50|$|The {{simplest}} way of converting existing projectors {{is to add}} a so-called penthouse digital <b>soundhead</b> above the projector head. However, for new projectors {{it made sense to}} use dual analogue/digital soundheads in the normal optical <b>soundhead</b> position under the projector head. To allow for the dual-soundhead arrangement the data is recorded 26 frames ahead of the picture. If a penthouse <b>soundhead</b> is used, the data must be delayed in the processor for the required amount of time, around 2 seconds. This delay can be adjusted in steps of the time between perforations, (approximately 10.4 ms).|$|E

50|$|This was the {{temperature}} machine. It {{consisted of a}} long rotating drum (perhaps 18 inches long). Recorded on the drum were a series of temperatures (minus 40 °F to 120 °F, or &minus;40 °C to 50 °C). A single <b>soundhead</b> was attached to a lead screw. A thermometer was placed {{on top of the}} telephone company central office and connected to the Audichron temperature machine. This would cause the leadscrew to rotate and position the <b>soundhead</b> on top of the correct temperature recording.|$|E
50|$|The Syntok {{equipment}} {{had proved}} to be unsatisfactory, it was both unreliable and had poor sound quality. Consequently, it {{was replaced by a}} new Western Electric sound-on-film sound system. This consisted of standard Western Electric <b>soundheads</b> together with the Western Electric 4A amplifier system. The 4A was the smallest of the Western Electric cinema amplifier systems available at the time and was intended for small cinemas. Two Western Electric 12A full-range horn loudspeakers were employed, hung from a substantial wooden structure behind the screen. The high efficiency of these speakers made the most of the limited output power (about 5 watts) of the 4A amplifier system. At the same time the two Gaumont projectors were replaced by new Kalee model 7 machines.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{magnetic}} audio was {{of excellent}} quality {{it also had}} significant disadvantages. Magnetic sound prints were expensive, 35mm magnetic prints cost roughly {{twice as much as}} optical sound prints, whilst 70mm prints could cost up to 15 times as much. Furthermore, they wore out faster and were also prone to damage and erasure over time. Because of the high cost of installing magnetic sound reproduction equipment only a minority of movie theaters ever installed it and the magnetic <b>soundheads</b> needed considerable maintenance to keep their performance up to standard. As a consequence the use of the Cinemascope 35mm four-track magnetic sound format decreased significantly {{during the course of the}} 1960s and effectively ended with the success of the Dolby Stereo optical stereo format in the late 1970s. However 70mm film continued to be used for prestigious [...] "roadshow" [...] screenings until the introduction of digital sound on 35mm film in the early 1990s removed one of the major justifications for using this expensive format.|$|R
5000|$|Konvas (Конвас) is {{the general}} name of {{portable}} 35mm motion-picture cameras that was manufactured in the USSR by KMZ (KRASNOGORSKIY MEKHANICHESKIY ZAVOD - Krasnogorsk Mechanical Works), known as ZENIT camera makers, and later on, MOSKINAP (MOSKOVSKIY ZAVOD KINOAPPARATURIY - Moscow Works of Cinema Equipment (The holder of the Order of the Badge of Honour - Орден «Знак Почета»), at one time in the late 80's had over 2,000 employees; now OAO [...] "MOSKINAP", and {{for a short period}} at the same factory {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union. The factory was manufacturing Laser <b>soundheads,</b> and 35mm sound projectors originally were made by Odessa PO KINAP some time ago. The camera line is no longer made, although many working models are still circulating at reasonable prices worldwide. The name [...] "Konvas" [...] is a portmanteau that comes from the first three letters of the first and last name of the camera's designer, KONSTANTIN VASILIYEV.|$|R
50|$|The next convoy, UGS 54 to Plymouth, England, in September, was uneventful until Underhill left Plymouth in October. Upon {{leaving the}} harbor, a {{submarine}} sonar contact {{was made in}} the English Channel. Several hours of depth charging accomplished nothing, but while running the patterns, the ship struck an underwater object (possibly a U-boat) destroying the ship's sonar <b>soundhead.</b> Underhill drydocked at Plymouth, but the British were unable to make needed repairs, so Underhill returned to Boston with a group of tank landing ships (LSTs) for a new sound head.|$|E
50|$|After {{the split}} with de Forest, Case adopted a revised {{position}} for the projector <b>soundhead,</b> which was now placed below the picture head, with a sound-picture offset of 14 ½ inches (368 mm) (which {{is close to the}} present day standard), rather than being placed above the picture head as had been the phonofilm practice. Case also adopted the 24 frames/sec speed for Movietone, bringing it in line with the speed already chosen for the Western Electric Vitaphone sound-on-disc system, and thus establishing 24 frames/sec as the standard speed for all sound films, whether sound-on-disc or sound-on-film. With a few exceptions, this has remained the standard speed for professional sound films ever since.|$|E
50|$|While Hoxie's work {{found its}} way into {{national}} theaters through RCA, Theodore Case and Earl Sponable found a home with the Fox Film Corporation after leaving de Forest and Phonofilm. Case and Sponible's Movietone sound system made several modifications to the earlier Phonofilm system that they had helped to create. One was moving the position of the projector's <b>soundhead</b> from above the picture head (as it had been in Phonofilm), to 14½ inches (368 mm) below the picture head, close to the present day standard. Case also adopted the 24 frames per second speed for Movietone, bringing it in line with the speed already chosen for Warner Brothers' Vitaphone sound-on-disc system, and thus establishing 24 frames per second as the standard speed for all sound films, whether sound-on-disc or sound-on-film.|$|E
50|$|Batman Returns was {{the first}} film to use Dolby Digital {{technology}} when it premiered in theaters {{in the summer of}} 1992. Dolby Digital cinema soundtracks are optically recorded on a 35 mm release print using sequential data blocks placed between every perforation hole on the sound track side of the film. A constant bit rate of 320 kbit/s is used. A charge-coupled device (CCD) scanner in the image projector picks up a scanned video image of this area, and a processor correlates the image area and extracts the digital data as an AC-3 bitstream. The data is then decoded into a 5.1 channel audio source. All film prints with Dolby Digital data also have Dolby Stereo analogue soundtracks using Dolby SR noise reduction and such prints are known as Dolby SR-D prints. The analogue soundtrack provides a fall-back option in case of damage to the data area or failure of the digital decoding; it also provides compatibility with projectors not equipped with digital <b>soundheads.</b> Almost all current release cinema prints are of this type and may also include SDDS data and a timecode track to synchronize CD-ROMs carrying DTS soundtracks.|$|R
50|$|The image above, at right, {{clearly shows}} the bottom structure—plants, sediments and hard bottom are {{discernible}} on sonar plots of sufficiently high power and appropriate frequency. Slightly {{more than halfway}} {{up from the bottom}} {{to the left of the}} screen centre and about a third away from the left side, this image is also displaying a fish - a light spot just to the right of a 'glare' splash from the camera's flashbulb. The X-axis of the image represents time, oldest (and behind the <b>soundhead)</b> to the left, most recent bottom (and current location) on the right; thus the fish is now well behind the transducer, and the vessel is now passing over a dip in the ocean floor or has just left it behind. The resulting distortion depends on both the speed of the vessel and how often the image is updated by the echo sounder.|$|E
50|$|The Case Research Lab {{then set}} about to perfect {{the system of}} sound film they had {{provided}} DeForest, now that DeForest was {{no longer able to}} inhibit their development of this new technology. One of the first things Case did was to change the location of the sound head on a sound-film projector from being above the picture head (as had been the Phonofilm standard) to below the picture head. According to Sponable, there were three reasons for this change: to accommodate a large flywheel in the <b>soundhead,</b> to simplify the design of the printer (which printed the picture and soundtrack in two separate passes) and to prevent films made to the Phonofilm standard being played on Case equipment. Case chose a separation of 20 frames between the sound and the picture frame to which it relates, this standard was adopted by all subsequent sound-on-film systems and still applies to this day.|$|E
40|$|Reports of metered {{inaccuracy}} in ‘therapeutic’ {{ultrasound unit}} output {{have been made}} since 1962, but have tacitly been accepted, perhaps due to the universal lack of appropriate testing facilities. Factors of treatment selection subject to instrumental error include duration of application, operating frequency, intensity, pulsed output. Metered errors in space-averaged intensity are common and are {{the most difficult to}} detect without specialised equipment which is rarely available. Couplants, essential for ultrasound transmission, can be a source of acoustic power loss if incorrectly used. Beam profiles demonstrate the rapid spatial variations in the near (Fresnel) zone, necessitating <b>soundhead</b> movement during treatment. Ultrasound physics must be understood, but professional integrity should demand better output testing facilities and equipment for clinical treatment...|$|E
40|$|This {{purpose of}} this study was twofold: to {{determine}} whether ultrasound transducer velocity affected tissue temperature increase, and whether heating was uniform across the treatment site. Thermocouples were inserted 2. 5 cm below the skin surface at the center, edge of the ERA, and the edge of the treatment site that was the size of two times the <b>soundhead.</b> Each subject received three 10 -minute treatments at each speed, letting tissue temperature return to baseline between treatments. Repeated measures factorial ANOVA revealed no significant differences in the speed of application and no interaction between speed and location. However, the location of the thermocouples proved to be a factor, with pairwise comparisons showing a significant difference among the 3 locations. In conclusion, the speed at which ultrasound is applied has no effect on temperature rise; however, the size of the treatment area needs to be taken into account as uniform heating does not occur...|$|E
40|$|One {{benefit of}} {{ultrasound}} over infrared modalities {{is its ability}} to penetrate subcutaneous fat. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare tissue temperature rise during ultrasound treatments in humans with various thicknesses of subcutaneous fat in the medial gastrocnemius. Twenty males served as subjects. A 23 -gauge hypodermic needle microprobe was inserted 3 -cm deep into the medial portion of the anesthetized gastrocnemius, and connected to a thermocouple temperature gauge. We applied 15 ml of ultrasound gel, preheated to body temperature (37 °C), to a 10 -cm-diameter target area. Continuous ultrasound was delivered topically at 1. 5 W/cm 2 for 10 minutes. During this time, the <b>soundhead</b> was moved at a speed of 4 cm per second, and the temperature was recorded every 30 seconds. The mean baseline temperature for all subjects was 35. 4 °C. The mean temperature increase was 4. 9 °C. We performed a regression analysis to test for correlation between fat thickness and tissue temperature rise of subjects. There was a small positive but insignificant correlation (r=. 128). This supports the claim of Grotthus and Draper. Since subcutaneous fat does not serve as a barrier to therapeutic ultrasound, athletic trainers and physical therapists can expect comparable increases in muscle temperature when using this modality on people with varying thicknesses of adipose tissue...|$|E
