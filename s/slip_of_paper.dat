5|$|White owned {{a number}} of {{antiques}} and pieces of furniture of historical interest. Among these were items once possessed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron including a pair of andirons with heavy brass heads and a fender, possibly used at Lord Fairfax's Greenway Court estate. White also had a richly inlaid table made of several types of wood, which once belonged to his grandfather, Virginia judge Robert White. Beneath the table's framework was pasted a small <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> on which Robert White signed his name and the date, 1789. Historian Hu Maxwell noted the similarity between the handwriting of White, his father John Baker White, and his grandfather Robert White. White also owned a sugar bowl from Switzerland that had originated in China and {{had been in the}} possession of the Streit and White families for over two centuries.|$|E

50|$|Typically {{one will}} see in an {{advertisement}} of an estate sale, 'street numbers honored' or 'street numbers not honored.' Street numbers are <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> that are generated by customers, usually dealers. These 'street' numbers are then exchanged for the real, official numbered <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> handed out by the estate sale company.|$|R
50|$|Matthias was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} first priests via a sortition (lot) process. After choosing nine members of the Unity that the synod attendees felt had gifts suitable for ministry, they took twelve <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> and wrote the words “it is he” on three <b>of</b> them. The <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> with those words would be called the positive lot because the members that drew those <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> would be selected as priests. It was also possible that none of the positives would be drawn, which would be seen as a sign from God that no priests should be selected.|$|R

25|$|In 1886–87 {{when the}} Royal E. House Telegraph was {{produced}} with the printing telegraph, the Morse Telegraph tried to enjoin them from infringing the Morse patents. Morse claimed the sole right of transmitting intelligence by electricity (which utilized the Morse code). The courts decided the House Company did not infringe the Morse patent {{in the slightest}} degree, as the messages using the House system were all printed on a <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> while the Morse signals were embosed and in code (dots and dashes) which afterwards were translated into words.|$|E
25|$|According to {{his nephew}} {{who was an}} eyewitness, Javed Naseer Rind was {{abducted}} by gunpoint and forcibly disappeared along with Rind's relative Abdul Samad Baloch {{near his home in}} Hub City, Lasbela District, Balochistan, Pakistan on 10 September 2011. After his disappearance, Balochistan Union of Journalists requested government intervention. His corpse was found 5 November 2011 near Ghazgi Chowk, Khuzdar, and his corpse had multiple bullet wounds, showed evidence of torture, and was found with a <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> identifying him as the journalist who had been previously kidnapped. His corpse was then transported to the civil hospital in Khuzdar for an autopsy.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto the lid of the box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E
60|$|Pinney's {{letter was}} a long one, written in pencil on one side <b>of</b> long <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> like printer's copy; the slips were each {{carefully}} folioed in the upper right hand corner; but the language was the language of Pinney's life, and not the decorative diction which he usually addressed to the public on such <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|R

Modern fortune cookies are a variant on these forms of divination.|$|R

The set featured a plastic [...] "clam-shell" [...] Homer-head design and received many complaints. In the United States, the set contained a <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> informing purchasers how to request alternate packaging — which consisted of a case-sleeve in a similar style to the standard box design — for only a shipping and handling fee.|$|E
500|$|In May 2014, {{the inaugural}} Milutin Bojić Prize {{was awarded to}} a student from Čačak by the Milutin Bojić Library, a Belgrade-based {{learning}} institution dedicated exclusively to studies on Bojić's life and work. The Library is funded by the Serbian Ministry of Culture, and operates an extensive online database known as the Milutin Bojić Virtual Library. In August 2014, researchers discovered the original manuscript of [...] "Ode to a Blue Sea Tomb" [...] in the Library's archives. The yellowed <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> was immediately given to experts at the National Library of Serbia, who went about restoring it so as to prevent further decay.|$|E

The players write down their greatest fear on a <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> which {{is placed in the}} [...] "well of fears" [...] by the Chosen One. The Gatekeeper then starts the game, and the players, using their Numb Skulls, race to become a Harbinger by landing on the Harbinger's headstone located in each province. If a player fails to make it to a headstone within ten minutes, they become Soul Rangers {{for the rest of the}} game. They must remain in the sewers until either they are released by the Gatekeeper, or collect the Keystone which allows them to release themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the use of}} paper, the Chinese used coins {{that were}} circular, with a {{rectangular}} hole in the middle. Several coins could be strung together on a rope. Merchants in China, if they became rich enough, found that their strings of coins were too heavy to carry around easily. To solve this problem, coins were often left with a trustworthy person, and the merchant was given a <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> recording {{how much money he}} had with that person. If he showed the paper to that person he could regain his money. Eventually, the Song Dynasty paper money called [...] "jiaozi" [...] originated from these promissory notes.|$|E
2500|$|The navvies {{working on}} the Liverpool and Manchester Railway were paid daily and their pay reputedly went on ale, leaving little for food. When the workers were unfit to work, monies were {{subtracted}} from their wages and meal tokens were issued. These tokens could be handed in at meal caravans for a bowl of soup and a portion of bread. At first the token was a <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> called a [...] "flimsy" [...] because of its thickness. In today's terms it {{would be similar to}} a grade called [...] "bank paper". As these tokens could be copied by the forgers, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway supplied its contractors with six-sided food tokens that were surrendered for meals. These were cut from brass and had the initials LMR stamped upon them. This reduced the problems of drunken navvies and eliminated the local farm labourers freeloading from the food caravans. Tokens and a description of their use {{can be found in the}} Museum of Science & Industry in Manchester.|$|E
