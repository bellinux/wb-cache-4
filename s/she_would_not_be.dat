5|$|Senator Mary White had {{announced}} her intention {{to stand for}} the Fianna Fáil nomination in 2008, but in May 2011 said that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> seeking the nomination.|$|E
5|$|After being {{sworn in}} as premier, Dunderdale {{announced}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> seeking {{the leadership of the}} Progressive Conservative Party and therefore would only serve in the role of premier until a leadership election was held in the spring of 2011. However, on December 17, 2010, Dunderdale announced that she was reconsidering running for the leadership of the party and that she would make a final decision after Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Closing in Melbourne August 9, 2009, {{the show}} {{transferred}} to Sydney's Capitol Theatre. Previews began on September 5, 2009, {{with the official}} opening on September 12. Shortly into the run, Harrison {{was forced to leave}} the role of Elphaba, so current standby Jemma Rix and Australian theatre veteran Pippa Grandison began to share the role, each appearing in four shows per week. Eventually, it was confirmed that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> returning to the cast.|$|E
60|$|Polly soon lured her out again, by {{assurances that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> <b>be</b> utterly despoiled, and {{promises}} to try and soften the hard hearts of her father's creditors, if the ear-rings and the smelling-bottle were attached.|$|R
50|$|On 24 May 2015, Anderson {{announced}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> renewing her {{contract for}} Emmerdale and {{would leave the}} show having portrayed Alicia Gallagher for five years.|$|R
40|$|Sharing in the Apostolate" Some {{weeks ago}} I was visiting {{with the mother}} of a priest, and in course of her remarks she made the rather curious {{observation}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not,</b> <b>were</b> the chance given to her again, make a strenuous effort to direct a young man into the seminary to study for the priesthood [...] ...|$|R
5|$|The {{contracts}} of Edelstein, Epps, and Leonard expired {{at the end}} {{of season}} seven. As a cost-cutting measure, the three actors were asked to accept reduced salaries. Epps and Leonard came to terms with the producers, but Edelstein did not, and in May 2011 it was announced that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> returning for the show's eighth season.|$|E
5|$|The next court {{session was}} on July 1. At this session, Satoshi Kawamitsu, an {{attorney}} for the employment agency that V. N. worked for, testified that he had tried to arrange a jidan settlement between Brown and V. N. in December 2002, but V. N. had insisted on pressing charges. He stated that he informed her that once the charges were filed, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to withdraw them until the trial began.|$|E
5|$|David {{made several}} visits to California, which she much enjoyed, but her health began to fail. Because her legs had been {{troublesome}} for some time, she suffered {{a succession of}} falls which resulted in several spells in hospital. She became increasingly reclusive but, despite spending periods in bed at home, she continued to work on Ice and Ices. She realised that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to finish the work, and asked Norman to complete it for her. It was published in 1994, under the title Harvest of the Cold Months.|$|E
60|$|NOBODY {{could say}} any great harm of Florence Cray, or <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> bound to Miss Lee.|$|R
60|$|Although a gem, Elsie was {{exceedingly}} imperfect. Had she <b>been</b> {{the reverse}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> worth writing about.|$|R
50|$|The {{dry heat}} of the Punjab had a bad effect on Alice's health. Two years after she arrived {{it was clear that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to {{maintain}} a good quality of life in India, and so Wellesley resigned from the American Mission and together they returned to Ireland.|$|R
5|$|In April 2016, Bravo {{announced}} that the series is renewed for a ninth season. Fields confirmed in March 2016 that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> returning to the series. Despite previously confirming her return, Leakes confirmed in September 2016 {{that she was not}} asked back for the series' ninth season. The ninth season premiered on November 6, 2016, with Whitfield returning in a full-time capacity {{for the first time since}} the fourth season. Hampton and Morton made multiple guest appearances during the season, with former housewife Zolciak-Biermann making an appearance at the season's finale.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, it was {{confirmed}} that Byung-hun Lee would reprise {{his role as}} Storm Shadow in the sequel. Channing Tatum and Ray Park also returned, as Duke and Snake Eyes, respectively. Rachel Nichols, the actress who played Scarlett in the first film, stated that most cast members would not be returning, except for the three aforementioned actors. In March 2011, Sienna Miller stated that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> returning for a sequel. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also confirmed {{that he would not be}} returning as Cobra Commander in the sequel.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the actors}} {{cast in the}} four leading roles, only Gina McKee {{was a native of}} North East England, and she was from Sunderland rather than from Newcastle. McKee related {{strongly}} to many of the characters and story elements in the scripts and was very keen to play Mary, but the production team was initially uncertain whether {{it would be possible to}} age her up convincingly enough to portray the character in her 50s. McKee was concerned that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> given the part after an unsuccessful makeup test where efforts to make her appear to be in her 50s resulted in her resembling a drag queen.|$|E
50|$|On September 4, 2012, Toscano parted {{ways with}} Interscope Records and 19 Management and her debut album that <b>she</b> {{recorded}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> released.|$|R
60|$|I {{felt she}} was right. If she had been capable of giving it up, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> Hilda. There was but one other way left.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should hope not!" [...] said Mrs. Mulbridge. [...] "I guess <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> have <b>been</b> {{alive to}} tell the tale, if it had <b>n't</b> <b>been</b> for you." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{birth of}} her {{daughter}} in September 1857, however, began to reduce the level of her activism. Stone had made preliminary arrangements for the 1857 national convention {{to be held in}} Providence, but because <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to attend it, she handed responsibility to Susan B. Anthony and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. When the Panic of 1857 disrupted Anthony’s plan to move the convention to Chicago, Stone made the announcement that the next National Woman’s Rights Convention would be in May 1858. Anthony helped Stone arrange the 1858 convention and then took sole responsibility for the 1859 meeting. Elizabeth Cady Stanton took charge of the 1860 convention.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins and {{his mother}} were very close, and her 1983 Alzheimer's disease {{diagnosis}} {{may have contributed to}} his drug problems. He was devastated that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to enjoy his success in the major leagues. In the last few years of Wiggins' life, he enjoyed a closer relationship with his father, Albert, and he often took his children on visits to see their grandfather. Wiggins had a very difficult time with his father's death in May 1990.|$|E
5|$|As the day {{of their}} May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston with {{uncertainty}} and were determined to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man {{with whom she had}} fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for the hustle and bustle and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Atli, looking sharply on him, [...] "were {{the maid}} sprung from me, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> long <b>be</b> called the 'Fatherless,' for few {{have such a}} daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} {{supposed}} that," [...] answered the lady; [...] "for if Miss Asher <b>would</b> <b>not</b> take you <b>she</b> certainly <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> content {{with either of}} them." ...|$|R
60|$|Alison, though <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> confess it, <b>was</b> {{sensible}} of {{a similar}} curiosity.|$|R
5|$|Consisting of six chapters, Madonnaland finds Simone visiting Madonna's birthplace, Bay City, Michigan, {{where she}} spoke with the local people about the singer. The book also {{analyses}} Madonna's career and fame, with the author delving into her own music career and obscure Bay City bands. Simone had been initially commissioned to write a new biography about the singer. However, due to already available excess content on her, the author felt <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to find anything new. Instead, she ended up writing Madonnaland about her own failure to create a Madonna biography, why Bay City {{did not have any}} commemoration for the singer, as well as unknown music bands, pop culture and celebrity life.|$|E
5|$|Deal was {{satisfied}} with the material recorded up to this point, but realized <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to tour without a band. She returned to New York {{to look for a}} backing group in March 2000. After a chance meeting with members of Fear, she invited drummer Andrew Jaimez, bassist Mando Lopez, and guitarist Richard Presley to jam with her at the studio she was renting. Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, Lopez, and Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon after. About a month after Kim Deal's arrival, Jose Medeles replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not have enough time for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical projects. The new line-up {{spent the rest of the}} year writing and rehearsing.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcement}} by Richmond Centre MLA Olga Ilich that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> seeking re-election, Howard announced, in January 2008, {{that he would}} seek to replace Ilich as the BC Liberal Party candidate in the next election. As no one else came forward to challenge Howard, he was acclaimed, in November 2008, to be the BC Liberal candidate. In the general election, held in May 2009, he was challenged by a New Democratic Party candidate, notary public Kam Brar, and a Green Party candidate, teacher Michael Wolfe, and Nation Alliance Party candidate, accountant Kang Chen. The riding {{was considered to be}} a safe seat for the BC Liberals to win, which the 54-year-old Howard did win with over 60% of the vote, with his BC Liberal Party winning a majority government.|$|E
60|$|Rilla {{gathered}} herself together. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> lisp--she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{calm and}} composed.|$|R
50|$|In 1840 she, {{her sister}} Matilda {{and her father}} {{attended}} the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London although <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> permitted to speak as the women <b>were</b> <b>not</b> regarded as full delegates.|$|R
60|$|Christine did {{not know}} how about that; perhaps <b>she</b> <b>would</b> and perhaps <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not.</b> It <b>was</b> a nice, pretty little cap; what would the little {{underground}} man give her for it? that was the question.|$|R
5|$|HMS Renown was {{the lead}} ship of her class of battlecruisers of the Royal Navy built during the First World War. She was {{originally}} laid down as an improved version of the s. Her construction was suspended on the outbreak of war on the grounds <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> ready in a timely manner. Admiral Lord Fisher, upon becoming First Sea Lord, gained approval to restart her construction as a battlecruiser that could be built and enter service quickly. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Eustace Tennyson-D'Eyncourt, quickly produced an entirely new design to meet Admiral Lord Fisher's requirements and the builders agreed to deliver the ships in 15 months. They did not quite meet that ambitious goal, but the ship was delivered {{a few months after}} the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Renown, and her sister , were the world's fastest capital ships upon completion.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E
5|$|Janeway {{begins to}} share Seven's suspicions and warns {{the crew to}} stay alert, but remains optimistic. The new engine system is {{compatible}} with Voyager, but the ship wouldn't {{be able to stand}} the stresses of the slipstream for long. The crew would have to abandon the ship to use the Dauntless to travel home. Seven states to Janeway that she would opt to stay behind, feeling that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to integrate back on Earth. Janeway reviews the message decoded by Arturis, and discovers the message to be fake. She transports to the Dauntless to confront Arturis. He tries to pin the blame on Seven, but Janeway rejects his claims. Arturis activates a panel on the ship, igniting the engines. All but Janeway and Seven are able to be transported out before the ship enters the slipstream.|$|E

60|$|The first {{bustle of}} {{installation}} over, time hung heavy on his hands. July loomed distant, as in some future century; Antonia's eyes beckoned him faintly, hopelessly. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> even <b>be</b> {{coming back to}} England for another month.|$|R
60|$|In {{that last}} resolve I {{think we may}} {{say that he was}} right. If Lily would ever listen to him again at all, <b>she</b> {{certainly}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> deterred from marrying him by his own story of his debts.|$|R
