40|$|Precision {{agriculture}} and Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) cover {{a number of}} activities that relate to food <b>safety,</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>use</b> of chemicals <b>and</b> reduction of the residue level on food crops, minimal negative impacts of agricultural production on the environment, and occupational safety and welfare. In a review current and future potential environmental and food safety contributions are discussed. Quantitative information on environmental benefits from precision agriculture technology is discussed nitrogen application, weed control and pest and disease control. Potential environmental benefits from implementation of other precision technology in combination with changing agricultural practices are listed. In conclusion, technology development and precision agriculture will have benefits for consumers {{in terms of a}} more efficient healthy production with lower chemical inputs and reduced environmental risks...|$|R
40|$|This book {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} holistic design and development of cyber physical systems to achieve their safe and secure operation. It shows that by following the standards for embedded system’s <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>using</b> <b>appropriate</b> hardware <b>and</b> software components inherently safe system’s architectures can be devised and certified. While the standards already enable testing and certification of inherently safe and sound hardware, this is still {{not the case with}} software. The book demonstrates that Specification PEARL(SPEARL) addresses this issue and proposes appropriate solutions from the viewpoints of software engineering as well as concrete program components. By doing so it reduces the complexity of cyber physical systems design in an innovative way. Three ultimate goals are being followed in the course of defining this new PEARL standard, namely: 1. simplicity over complexity, 2. inherent real-time ability, and 3. conformity to safety integrity and security capability levels...|$|R

40|$|Background: Depending on the {{therapeutic}} target, transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) {{are designed to}} provide a continuous supply of drug through the skin to allow for local or systemic drug effects. The purpose of this descriptive review is to introduce practical theories behind TDDS for nurses. Additionally, the authors will compare and contrast different transdermal patch delivery systems and offer recommendations for <b>appropriate</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> administration of prescription products with an emphasis on nursing care. Findings: A total of 18 individual or fixed combination active ingriedient prescription transdermal formulations are available for use in the United States. <b>Appropriate</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> disposal of TDDS are dictated by the active ingredient, patch type and several patient-specific characteristics such as age, gender, skin integrity and organ function. Conclusions: Transdermal systems are convenient and therapeutically beneficial for select patient types. Appropriate application, disposal and monitoring techniques can optimize care for patients, caregivers and the general public.

40|$|Since {{economic}} liberalization {{in the late}} 1970 s, China's health care providers have grown heavily reliant on revenue from drugs, which they both prescribe and sell. To curb abuse and to promote the availability, <b>safety,</b> <b>and</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>use</b> of essential drugs, China introduced its national essential drug list in 2009 and implemented a zero markup policy designed to decouple provider compensation from drug prescription and sales. We collected and analyzed representative data from China's township health centers and their catchment-area populations {{both before and after}} the reform. We found large reductions in drug revenue, as intended by policy makers. However, we also found a doubling of inpatient care that appeared to be driven by supply, instead of demand. Thus, the reform had an important unintended consequence: China's health care providers have sought new, potentially inappropriate, forms of revenue...|$|R
