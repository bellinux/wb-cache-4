5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a <b>single</b> <b>reduction</b> gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E

25|$|The enzyme {{ribonucleotide}} reductase (RNR) catalyzes the de novo {{synthesis of}} dNDPs. Catalysis of ribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (NDPs) involves a reduction at the 2’-carbon of ribose 5-phosphate to form the 2’-deoxy derivative-reduced 2’-deoxyribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (dNDPs). This reduction is initiated with the generation of a free radical. Following a <b>single</b> <b>reduction,</b> RNR requires electrons donated from the dithiol groups of the protein thioredoxin. Regeneration of thioredoxin occurs when {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) provides two hydrogen atoms that are used to reduce the disulfide groups of thioredoxin.|$|E
25|$|In 1895, the C itself built {{locomotive}} No. 17 at Stockwell depot, {{and carried}} {{out a series of}} tests on locomotives 12, 15 and 17, as more locomotives would soon be needed for the extensions being made. They ordered three more locomotives from different manufacturers in 1898, which were equipped with four-pole motors, a more efficient control system using series-parallel switching of the motors, and on-board compressors. The motors were still mounted on the axles. Another two locomotives (Nos. 21 and 22), which were built at Stockwell Depot, included further refinements and were the prototypes for the final batches of locomotives. Nos. 23 to 52 were built by Crompton to an improved design, including nose-suspended motors connected to the axles by a <b>single</b> <b>reduction</b> gear, but still bore a strong external resemblance to the original locomotives.

Unlike the first five Leanders, which had their machinery arranged on the [...] "in-line" [...] principle (consisting of six boilers in three compartments forward, and four turbines in two further compartments aft), Sydney was designed with two redundant machinery groups, a design practice adopted from the United States Navy. The cruiser had two boilers and the turbines for the outer shafts forward, and two boilers and the turbines for the inner shafts aft; as steam from any boiler could be routed to any turbine, the ship could continue operating if one space was damaged. Each space had its own uptake, giving the modified ships a different profile to the single-funnelled early Leanders; an arrangement which contributed to naval historian Henry Lenton's description of the Modified Leanders as [...] "the most handsome cruisers ever built by the Royal Navy, with a symmetry that was as attractive as it was functional." ...|$|E

They used a new high-pressure Indret boiler rated at [...] While this gave more power for its weight and size, {{it proved to}} be fragile and difficult to maintain. Each set of Rateau-Bretagne geared turbines was rated at [...] and consisted of four main turbines, a high-pressure, a medium-pressure and two low-pressure with a reversing turbine in each of the main low-pressure turbine cases. There were also two small cruise turbines operating in parallel in each engine room. At low speeds, steam was directed to the cruise turbines, but at higher speeds it was diverted to the high-pressure turbine. At [...] the cruise turbines were decoupled entirely using a Vulcan clutch. This didn't work properly and several ship's captains recommended that the cruise turbines be deleted from future classes entirely. Each of the two shafts was driven by <b>single</b> <b>reduction</b> gearing. The port shaft was driven by the rear engine room and was significantly shorter than the starboard shaft which was driven by the forward engine room. This caused a significant disparity between the turning circle, depending on which direction the ship was turning.|$|E

500|$|The Mahans' {{propulsion}} plant was considerably improved over {{that of the}} Farraguts. Steam pressure was raised from [...] to [...] in some ships, and superheated steam temperature was raised from [...] to [...] in all ships. Double reduction gearing replaced <b>single</b> <b>reduction</b> gearing, allowing smaller, faster-turning turbines to be used; this saved enough space and weight to allow cruising turbines to be fitted, which greatly improved fuel economy at moderate speeds. Boiler economizers, as in previous ships, further improved fuel economy. The ships' range was extended to [...] at , [...] farther than the Farraguts. Design shaft horsepower was increased from [...] to [...] in the same space and weight as in the Farraguts. The relatively compact power plant contributed to the Mahans' ability to carry 12 torpedo tubes instead of eight with only 150 tons extra displacement. The main turbines were manufactured by General Electric and were impulse-type, also called Curtis turbines. Each main turbine was divided into a high-pressure (HP) and a low-pressure (LP) turbine feeding into a common reduction gear to drive a shaft, {{in a similar manner}} to the machinery illustrated at the following reference. Steam from the boilers was supplied to the HP turbine, which exhausted to the LP turbine, which exhausted to a condenser. The cruising turbines were geared to the HP turbines and could be engaged or disengaged as needed; at low speeds they were operated in series with the HP turbines to improve the efficiency of the overall turbine arrangement, thus improving fuel economy. This general arrangement with double reduction gearing became standard for most subsequent steam-powered surface ships of the US Navy, although not all of these had cruising turbines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{previous}} studies, performance {{improvement of}} nearest neighbor classification of high dimensional data, such as microarrays, {{has been investigated}} using dimensionality reduction. It has been demonstrated that the fusion of di-mensionality reduction methods, either by fusing classifiers obtained from each set of reduced features, or by fusing all reduced features are better than than using any <b>single</b> dimensionality <b>reduction</b> method. However, none of the fusion methods consistently outperform {{the use of a}} <b>single</b> dimen-sionality <b>reduction</b> method. Therefore, a new way of fusing features and classifiers is proposed, which is based on searching for the optimal number of dimensions for each considered dimensionality reduction method. An empirical evaluation on microarray classification is presented, comparing classifier and feature fusion with and without the proposed method, in conjunction with three dimensionality reduction methods; Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Information Gain (IG). The new classifier fusion method outperforms the previous in 4 out of 8 cases, and is on par with the best <b>single</b> dimensionality <b>reduction</b> method. The novel feature fusion method is however outperformed by the previous method, which selects the same number of features from each dimensionality reduction method. Hence, it is concluded that the idea of optimizing the number of features separately for each dimensionality reduction method can only be recommended for classifier fusion.
