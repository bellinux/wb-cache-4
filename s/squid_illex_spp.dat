Zoological Studies 46 (1) : xxx-xxx. The spatial {{and temporal}} distribution patterns of Argentine the short-finned <b>squid,</b> <b>Illex</b> argentinus, abundances and relationships between the squid abundance and environmental variables in the Southwest Atlantic were analyzed using a geographical information system and statistical methods. The abundances of squid were estimated by standardizing commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE) data from the Taiwanese squid fishery during 1986 - 2003. Illex argentinus has a clear general annual migration pattern, which consistently occurred in different years. The monthly distribution patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) corresponded to the current systems in the Southwest Atlantic. Local squid abundances showed a negative correlation with SSTs during Mar. -Aug., although it was difficult to determine if this reflected any causal link.

40|$|Abstract: Argentine shortfin <b>squid</b> (<b>Illex</b> argentinus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} commercial fish in the world. Pepsin-solubilized collagen (PSC) was isolated from squid skin and biochemical properties of PSC were studied. The yields of skin PSC was about 18. 5 % (on the dry weight basis). SDS-PAGE patterns showed that the collagen consisted of at least two different polypeptides (α 1 and α 2 chains). The peptide maps of PSC digested by pepsin were distinct from those of carp skin collagen. Denaturation temperatures, measured by melting point using circular dichroism, was 26. 5 ˚C. The results suggest that squid skin collagen has potential as a possible underutilized resource used in various fields...|$|R

40|$|The {{scientific}} basis {{for managing the}} short fin <b>squid,</b> <b>Illex</b> argentinus, Stock around the Falkland Islands is presented. A target proportional escapement policy is used which permits a level of fishing effort compatible with conservation targets to be set each year. This policy is intimately related to the method of assessing stock size {{and the rate of}} fishing mortality presented in a related paper. The results of applying this management procedure for the 1987 and 1988 fishing seasons, the first 2 years of regulated fishing in Falkland Islands waters, are described.

40|$|The {{market value}} of Atlantic-short-finned <b>squid,</b> <b>Illex</b> illecebrosus for certain {{importing}} countries is adversely affected by its greater propensity to undergo browning reaction than other available genera and species of squid.

Radial muscles probably contribute additional energy via elastic storage in circular collagen fibers.
