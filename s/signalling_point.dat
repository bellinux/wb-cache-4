40|$|We {{obtain a}} shaping gain with a {{non-uniform}} probability {{distribution of the}} <b>signal</b> <b>points</b> in a high order signal constellation. To obtain non-equiprobable <b>signal</b> <b>points,</b> we assign a non-uniform amount of distinct bit labels to the <b>signal</b> <b>points.</b> The proposed method is integrated in a bit interleaved coded modulation scheme with iterative demapping and decoding (so called BICM-ID scheme). This iterative process resolves the ambiguities that arise when several bit labels are assigned to one <b>signal</b> <b>point.</b> We derive a greedy algorithm to get a close to optimum probability distribution of the <b>signal</b> <b>points</b> and we use a binary switching algorithm to optimize the bit-mapping. At a rate of 3 bits per channel use, we obtain shaping gains over 1 dB for a 16 ASK signal constellation. In combination with irregular convolutional codes, we achieve an iterative decoding threshold at 0. 7 dB below {{the capacity of the}} uniform distribution. ...|$|R
50|$|In fact, {{the church}} was used {{as part of the}} defences of the Hospitaller Knights of St. John the Baptist against the Ottoman Turks. The new transepts, nearly a third higher than the nave, {{provided}} commanding views of the nearby bays. High within the walls of the transept, a corridor was inserted with windows lined up on the sites of two new low lying forts, which were to be built at St. Thomas, Marsascala, and St. Lucian in Marsaxlokk. Hence, St. Catherine's old church became an intermediate military <b>signalling</b> <b>point,</b> forewarning Mdina, Cottonera and Valletta about any attack by Ottoman navy ships entering these nearby ports.|$|E

However, with growing railway expansion in the Victorian era and the connecting Downpatrick, Dundrum and Newcastle Railway being subsequently built with a junction north of Downpatrick for through trains between Queens Quay, Belfast and Newcastle railway station (County Down). The awkward permanent way with Downpatrick railway station being on a branch necessitated the construction of the triangle and Loop platform. Therefore, trains could call at Downpatrick or use the avoiding line with connections for passengers and goods at the Loop Platform, thereby making the railway operationally from a <b>signalling</b> <b>point</b> of view, more efficient using a railway triangle.|$|E

50|$|From {{a railway}} <b>signalling</b> <b>point</b> of view, the 925 m-long Schwarzkopftunnel lies within Heigenbrücken railway station. This {{peculiarity}} {{stems from a}} pushing operation, still undertaken today, between Laufach and Heigenbrücken. Heavy goods trains {{come to a stop}} at Laufach station, where a helper locomotive joins the train’s tail end to help the train’s main locomotive get the train up the Spessart Ramp, which reaches a steepness of 1:47 (some 21‰). The tunnel itself is built with no gradients to speak of. Just before the tunnel portal, the helper locomotive leaves the goods train, which has now covered the steepest gradient and continues on its way southeastwards. So that the helper locomotive does not need to go through the tunnel and into the passenger transport complex (which would lead to disruption of normal operations), the tracks at the Aschaffenburg (that is to say, far) end of the tunnel are so arranged as to allow it to cross over to the other track and travel back to Laufach. The points needed for this also belong to the Heigenbrücken signal box, meaning that Heigenbrücken station stretches right through the tunnel.|$|E
40|$|Introduction This Recommendation {{describes}} aspects {{which are}} pertinent to {{and should be}} considered in the design of international signalling networks. Some or all of these aspects may also be relevant to the design of national networks. Some aspects are dealt with for both international and national networks (e. g. availability), others are discussed {{in the context of the}} international network only (e. g. number of signalling transfer points in a signalling relation). A number of aspects require further study for national networks. This Recommendation also gives in Annex A examples of how the signalling network procedures may be applied to the mesh network representation. The national and international networks are considered to be structurally independent and, although a particular <b>signalling</b> <b>point</b> may belong to both networks, signalling points are allocated <b>signalling</b> <b>point</b> codes according to the rules of each network.

30|$|The past {{median filter}} {{operates}} on the pixel {{points of the}} image by the same operation method, which causes {{the value of the}} real <b>signal</b> <b>point</b> to change, and the image has a fuzzy problem, so it is not suitable for the system application of this paper. If the true pixel <b>signal</b> <b>point</b> and the <b>signal</b> <b>point</b> contaminated by noise are accurately distinguished, the misoperation of the true pixel <b>signal</b> <b>point</b> can be avoided, and the clarity of the courseware image can be improved. Using the improved switch median filtering method, the pixel of the courseware image can be accurately judged to avoid misoperation of the true pixel <b>signal</b> <b>point.</b> For a pixel of a suspected color image, there is a strong correlation between adjacent points, and the brightness value of a point in the image is close to the brightness value of the adjacent point. The pixel points of the isolated point of the pixel and the image portion of the edge portion are generally considered to be noise points. Therefore, in a courseware image, if there is a large difference between the value of a certain pixel point and its neighborhood value, the correlation between the pixel point and the neighborhood is low, and the point {{is considered to be a}} noise point, which needs to be performed filter processing. If the point value is close to the neighbor value, it is the true <b>signal</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

In this way, the ordinary constellation is rearranged to the expanded constellation, which contains all possible combinations of different components of <b>signal</b> <b>points</b> in the ordinary constellation.

40|$|Abstract — Discrete input {{distributions}} are capacity-achieving for {{a variety}} of noise distributions whenever the input is subject to peak power or other bounding constraints. In this paper, we consider additive noise with arbitrary absolutely-continuous distribution and ask the question what the optimal input distribution over a set of fixed <b>signaling</b> <b>points</b> would be. The capacity-achieving distribution is characterized by constant Kullback Leibler distance between the shifted noise distribution and a certain mixture hereof. As an application, the optimal input distribution for binary symmetric signaling over exponential noise channels is determined. It further follows that in certain symmetric cases the uniform distribution over all <b>signaling</b> <b>points</b> is capacity-achieving. I...|$|R
