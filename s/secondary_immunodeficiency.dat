25|$|Immunopathology is {{a branch}} of {{clinical}} pathology that deals with an organism’s immune response to a certain disease. When a foreign antigen enters the body, there is either an antigen specific or nonspecific response to it. These responses are the immune system fighting off the foreign antigens, whether they are deadly or not. Immunopathology could refer to how the foreign antigens cause the immune system to have a response or problems that can arise from an organism’s own immune response on itself. There are certain problems or faults in the immune system {{that can lead to}} more serious illness or disease. These diseases can come from one of the following problems. The first would be Hypersensitivity reactions, where there would be a stronger immune response than normal. There are four different types (type one, two, three and four), all with varying types and degrees of an immune response. The problems that arise from each type vary from small allergic reactions to more serious illnesses such as tuberculosis or arthritis. The second kind of complication in the immune system is Autoimmunity, where the immune system would attack itself rather than the antigen. Inflammation {{is a prime example of}} autoimmunity, as the immune cells used are self-reactive. A few examples of autoimmune diseases are Type 1 diabetes, Addison’s disease and Celiac disease. The third and final type of complication with the immune system is Immunodeficiency, where the immune system lacks the ability to fight off a certain disease. The immune system’s ability to combat it is either hindered or completely absent. The two types are Primary Immunodeficiency, where the immune system is either missing a key component or does not function properly, and <b>Secondary</b> <b>Immunodeficiency,</b> where disease is obtained from an outside source, like radiation or heat, and therefore cannot function properly. Diseases that can cause immunodeficiency include HIV, AIDS and leukemia. In all vertebrates, there are two different kinds of immune responses: Innate and Adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is used to fight off non-changing antigens and is therefore considered nonspecific. It is usually a more immediate response than the adaptive immune system, usually responding within minutes to hours. It is composed of physical blockades such as the skin, but also contains nonspecific immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, T Cells, and basophils. The second for of immunity is Adaptive immunity. This form of immunity requires recognition of the foreign antigen before a response is produced. Once the antigen is recognized, a specific response is produced in order to destroy the specific antigen. Because of this idea, adaptive immunity is considered to be specific immunity. A key part of adaptive immunity that separates it from innate is the use of memory to combat the antigen in the future. When the antigen is originally introduced, the organism does not have any receptors for the antigen so it must generate them from the first time the antigen is present. The immune system then builds a memory of that antigen, which enables it to recognize the antigen quicker in the future and be able to combat it quicker and more efficiently. The more the system is exposed to the antigen, the quicker it will build up its responsiveness.|$|E

40|$|Immune {{status of}} healthy people, {{patients}} with <b>secondary</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> and allergic diseases is assessed. To {{reduce the number}} of characteristics of immunity (23 indicators) to a number of the generalizing factors the multivariate analysis is used (principal component method). This method consistently reveals the principal components – independent functional complexes of interacting factors, with the characteristic of force of their interrelation. The principal components reflect communications between separate indicators and are located in size of their contribution to the total amount of information. The method is applied to structuring immunological indicators and a possibility of detection of features (distinctions) of the immune status of patients with <b>secondary</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> and allergic diseases. The method of principal components when it is applied to the assessment of immune status creates welldefined pattern of a functional condition of the immune system, accentuating main types of the reacting immunocompetent cells, their combinations and interaction. In the general immune status of healthy people (blood donors) the T cell compartment (the first and second the principal components) plays the major role. The second in importance components reflect the humoral immunity status. The indicators describing the response of the innate immunity (natural killer cells, the system phagocytic cells), follow them. Mathematical modeling reveals hierarchy of responses of innate and adaptive immunity, which is in agreement with established mechanisms of immune response. Differences of individual indicators of principal components of donors blood (norm), the patients with <b>secondary</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> and allergic diseases built in the first, second and fourth to the principal components are detected. They group and display the status of 40 % of the total amount (dispersion) of immunological information taken in the analysis accentuating quantity and a functionality of T cells subpopulations {{and to a lesser extent}} – the level of B cells. In case of <b>secondary</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> the major part of distribution of values principal individual components is in a zone of negative values, and in case of allergic diseases – in a zone of positive values, indicators of the norm are in the intermediate position.

40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} common causes of hospital-acquired {{secondary}} infections in hospitalized patients is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the expression of IMP and VIM in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (carbapenem resistant and producer MBL enzyme) in patients with <b>secondary</b> <b>immunodeficiency.</b> Materials and Methods: In a cross sectional study, 96 patients with <b>secondary</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> hospitalized in the Al-Zahra hospital were selected. Carbapenem resistant strains isolated and modified Hodge test was performed in order to confirm the presence of the metallo carbapenemase enzyme. Under the standard conditions they were sent to the central laboratory for investigating nosocomial infection Multiplex PCR. Results: Of 96 samples 28. 1 % were IMP positive, 5. 2 % VIM positive and 3. 1 % both VIM and IMP positive. The prevalence of multidrug resistance in the IMP and/or VIM negative samples was 29 %, while all 5 VIM positive samples have had multidrug resistance. Also the prevalence of multi-drug resistance in IMP positive samples were 96. 3 % and in IMP and VIM positive samples were 100 %. According to Fisher's test, the prevalence of multi-drug resistance based on gene expression has significant difference (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Based on the results of this study it can be concluded that, a significant percentage of patients with <b>secondary</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> that suffer nosocomial infections with multidrug resistance, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are probably MBL-producing gene positive.

40|$|The {{consumption}} of immunoglobulins (Ig) is increasing due to better recognition of antibody deficiencies, {{an aging population}} and new indications. This review aims to examine the various dosing regimens and research developments in the established and {{in some of the}} relevant off-label indications in Europe. The background to the current regulatory settings in Europe is provided as a backdrop for the latest developments in primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> and in immunomodulatory indications. In these heterogeneous areas, clinical trials encompassing different routes of administration, varying intervals and infusion rates are paving the way towards more individualized therapy regimens. In primary antibody deficiencies adjustments in dosing and intervals will depend on the clinical presentation, effective IgG trough levels and IgG metabolism. Ideally, individual pharmacokinetic profiles in conjunction with the clinical phenotype could lead to highly tailored treatment. In practice, incremental dosage increases are necessary to titrate the optimal dose for more severely ill patients. Higher intravenous doses in these patients also have beneficial immunomodulatory effects beyond mere IgG replacement. Better understanding of the pharmacokinetics of Ig therapy is leading to a move away from simplistic ‘per kg’ dosing. Defective antibody production is common in many <b>secondary</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> irrespective of whether the causative factor was lymphoid malignancies (established indications), certain autoimmune disorders, immunosuppressive agents or biologics. This antibody failure, as shown by test immunisation, may be amenable to treatment with replacement Ig therapy. In certain immunomodulatory settings (e. g.
