The gum exported came from the band of acacia trees that once covered much of the Sahel region: the southern littoral of the Sahara Desert that runs from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. Today, the main populations of gum-producing Acacia species are harvested in Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. Acacia senegal is tapped for gum by cutting holes in the bark, from which a product called kordofan or <b>Senegal</b> <b>gum</b> is exuded. Seyal gum, from Acacia seyal, the species more prevalent in East Africa, is collected from naturally occurring exudations on the bark. Traditionally harvested by seminomadic desert pastoralists {{in the course of their}} transhumance cycle, acacia gum remains a main export of several African nations, including Mauritania, Niger, Chad, and Sudan. The hardened exudations are collected in the middle of the rainy season (harvesting usually begins in July), and exported at the start of the dry season (November). Total world gum arabic exports are today (2008) estimated at 60,000 tonnes, having recovered from 1987-1989 and 2003-2005 crises caused by the destruction of trees by the desert locust. Sudan, Chad, and Nigeria, which in 2007 together produced 95% of world exports, have been in discussions to create a producers' cartel.|$|E

These most likely represent the arabinogalactan (AG), arabinogalactan-protein (AGP) and glycoprotein (GP) molecules present in Acacia gum exudates. Micrographs obtained for gum solutions that had been left to stand for up to 5 days indicated that molecular aggregation had occurred, this was particularly evident for the Acacia senegal sample. This aggregation process was attributed to intermolecular electrostatic interactions. The adsorbed layer thickness of the gums adsorbed onto polystyrene latex particles was determined using dynamic light scattering.

Gum arabic is widely used as a food additive, including in soft drinks, among others, and as an emulsifier and coating agent in industries. World demand is high, but smaller producer countries including Senegal struggle to organize a stable export flow. The producer incentives to collect gum from the forests seem to be problematic. In this paper we analyse whether interlocked contracts could contribute to a conducive market environment that stimulates producers to collect and market gum. We collected data of 422 gum producers in Senegal. Results suggest positive effects of interlocking relationships as producers with interlocked contracts are found to collect larger quantities of gum and obtain larger economic returns...|$|E

Acacia senegal, Acacia seyal (AcSey), sugar beet pectin (SBP) in conventional and matured states and two conventional samples of gum Ghatti (GG) were studied in aqueous solutions at pH 4. 5 and 3. 1. Samples were analysed by their Langmuir compression isotherms. At pH 4. 5, the conventional A. senegal (GAc) and A. seyal (AcSeyc) samples exhibited low {{spreading capacity}} {{compared with the}} other hydrocolloids. The capacity to spread on the surface was improved by the maturation process applied to A. senegal gums and to SBP, but {{had little effect on}} the A. seyal samples. The elasticity at zero deformation rate was homogenous for the hydrocolloids. Only A. seyal samples showed high resistance to layer compression, probably due to their low specific volume because of their more compact structure. The matured A. <b>senegal</b> <b>gum</b> was hydrophobically fractionated to separate the main components which were studied individually. The arabinogalactan protein (AGP) component dominates the surface behaviour of this hydrocolloid, and it was confirmed that the arabinogalactan (AG) component did not exhibit surface activity. Acidification of the sub-phase to pH 3. 1 improved the spreading and mechanical properties of the layers for all conventional and matured samples, which is in agreement with previous results at n-hexadecane-water interface. However, the GG samples were not affected by pH changes and exhibited similar Langmuir isotherms at both pH values. A. senegal gums were further studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry. In aqueous solutions circular particles of about 11 nm in diameter were detected at pH 4. 5 for GAc, whereas matured A. <b>senegal</b> <b>gum</b> (designated as EM 2) showed circular objects of about 25 nm diameter.

40|$|Acacia <b>senegal,</b> which {{produces}} <b>gum</b> arabic, has suffered greatly {{from the effects}} of the drought. This tree with the golden sap (gum arabic) does not thrive in plantations, so the only viable method of restoring it to previous numbers is to protect its natural environment. Trees in the Sahel have a variety of ways of resisting the vagaries of the climate. Acacia tortilis delays blooming until the last rains because the onset of the cool season fluctuates so much. The baobab keeps its reserves of water inside its trunk. Most species have developed huge root systems which can seek water as far away as possible. But the Acacia senegal, has perhaps the most interesting drought defence system of all: to avoid dehydration when the wind, animals or insects damage its trunk, it secretes a viscous liquid known as gum arable. Gum arabic- a rare and precious commodity Man has long harvested gum arabic as something rare and precious. In ancient fumes it had considerable commercial value and this has not diminished. Its rarity {{comes from the fact that}} only the gum tree produces it, and a satisfactory substitute has never been found. It is used for glue, sweets, pills and lozenges; it stabilizes wine and fizzy drinks; it is a fixative for paintings and ceramics; and local people use it for starching their traditional costumes, for cooking, and for medicine. Over the years, the tapping of the trees for gum has developed into a skilled operational In Mauritania, northern Senegal, Niger and Mali all the stockmen, from the Moors to the Peulhs, shepherds and nomads, collect the gum when they go in search of new pastures for their flocks and herds. Some even take their cattle to those areas where there are gum trees to tap because they know they can sell what they get as additional income. A small tree well adapted During the drought years of the Seventies, the Sahelian landscape lost many gum trees, despite the fact that this five-six metre tree with its low thorny bushy branches is well suited to the Sahelian climatic conditions. It needs only about 250 - 270 mm rainfall, and can withstand nine to eleven months of drought and temperatures of 45 C. Its rough thick bark protects it from this heat. Its main roots can descend one metre, and its secondaries are long and supple and can spread out through the sand so the strong Harmattan winds cannot uproot the tree. However, the disappearance of the gum tree is more the result of disarry in herd movements than of the drought. Herdsmen lead their stock into the least arid areas, but that is precisely where the gum tree is most likely to flourish again and young shoots get eaten and the trees destroyed. Nomads have not yet gone back to their old routes and they need to graze their herds and flocks where they are at present but the gum tree is specially enjoyed by goats, cattle, and - above all - camels. As a result the production of gum declined sharply, from 60, 000 tonnes in 1970 to 20, 000 tonnes in 1980, and has now stabilized around 45, 000 tonnes Large-scale plantations There have been various attempts to domesticate this tree, but large plantations have not been successful Acacia senegal plantation, principally in Mali have had variable results: some trees produce gum well (between five and ten kilo per annum) but others produce only one kilo. Scientists have not yet managed to isolate, and then reproduce, the most productive strains. Research programmes are in train but no results will be published for some years.

And by combining tree and crop species, and using existing water harvesting methods, they appear to have developed a sustainable system that can restore productivity to these abandoned fields.

But Oscar began by explaining that their initial efforts had not been successful. IN:		?The first step was that scientists tried to use very heavy machinery. ? OUT:		?. Are needed? Yes. ? DUR?N		 6 ? 57 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Oscar Eyog Matig on a research project that has been helping farmers to restore degraded farmland in north Cameroon. Transcript Matig		The first step was that scientists tried to use very heavy machines to plough the land, to allow the land to increase its water holding capacity. And after two years we discovered that the soil will come back at the initial level of degradation. Fatunde	So two years of wasted effort? Matig	Because you have a very good yield of cotton or rice the first year but later on, two or three years after the yield becomes as it was at the beginning. Fatunde	Then what was the next solution to that? Matig	The next solution was how to sustain this. To sustain it we need to continue to harvest water and secondly to provide people and the land with crops which will continue to provide products to the farmers. Fatunde	Yes and what are these? Matig	And the practice that we used was farmer practice. The way they are harvesting water in that type of land and they are digging small dams, with all of those practices which can harvest the maximum of the rainfall. The species that we planted was tree species that have available water all the time and {{because of a lack of}} amount of water we decided also to make inter-cropping. Fatunde	Inter-cropping between what kind of trees and what kind of crops? Matig		As the water was in a very huge quantity we decided to use rice. Fatunde	Rice. Matig	And for the trees, we used two types of trees. The first one is what we call Acacia senegal, which is producing Gum Arabic. Fatunde	So Acacia <b>senegal</b> means <b>Gum</b> Arabic trees? Matig	Yes and the second was a fruit tree, local fruit trees which is called a marula but the scientific name is Sclerocarya birrea Fatunde	Two trees? Matig		Two trees. Fatunde	Now how did you marriage, through inter-cropping, these two trees and rice? Matig	You have the rice in the middle because the trees are planted 4 metres by 4 metres and in between you have the rice. Fatunde	What purpose do the trees serve? Matig	With this system we have three advantages. The first is that we have almost lost 20 % of the farmland in the region which we have now recovered. The second benefit is that we have planted a crop. Even if you are planting it only the two first years they can use it as additional, add value. Now for the third benefit, is the trees. You have Gum Arabic which is well known in the world, used to produce this chewing gum, used to produce coca cola. And you have also Sclerocarya birrea which is a fruit, a local fruit tree. Those ones will continue providing a product for the farmers. Fatunde	While at the same time rice production is going on seasonally? Matig		Yes. Fatunde	After two years or three years of this experimentation what was the reaction of the farmers who were working on a pilot project? Matig	The farmers were very surprised because for them this land was lost completely and they have noticed that we have regenerated the land. So for them it?s a very? even if it was the only success of the project it was enough. Fatunde	But that was not the only success of the project? Matig	But it was not the only success, they were producing crop as inter-cropping and it was another success for them because they were involved, it was they who were planting those crops and harvesting it. Fatunde	Did they also go ahead to multiply, reproduce this experiment on their own farms? Matig	Yes. Let me tell you one thing which is a major concern for the farmer to implement the same system by his own. There is a problem of land tenure. Whenever you have to plant a tree you should be the owner of the land. It is only those who are owners and mainly the chief who are able to implement the same system. Fatunde	Were they also able to have enough money to also build wells and so on? Matig	Yes because as I told you the system we use was learned from the farmers. Even the well or the small dams they are doing it themselves for other purpose. They are doing it for what we call a very specific variety of sorghum, we call muskwari. We are doing it already. Fatunde	Oh, they were doing it. What you people did was to do inter-cropping now? Matig	Now it?s only awareness, to tell them that what you are doing with the sorghum you can sustain it by putting very very important species and permanent species which can provide them incomes. When an Acacia senegal is well managed you have the Gum Arabic forever. Fatunde	I see. Now going back to the farmers, since you?ve visited some of them, how did you evaluate the progress you saw from what they learnt from your pilot project? Matig	The progress in the farmer when you have a new technology is very slow because the farmer was very happy to implement it as soon as possible. As I have told you they have the land constraints but this can be solved because it?s a problem of meeting local authorities and also it?s at policy level. So this can be solved. Technically what we found was that few farmers have started planting their own trees within the farmland. So when they started planting trees within the sorghum land it was an improvement. What we noticed was a very big demand of tree seedlings by farmers. Fatunde	So how do you see the future of this inter-cropping system you have introduced among the farmers in northern Cameroon? What is your own evaluation based on what you saw in the ground? Matig	What I saw on the ground is that this technology can quickly take off but they need some assistance, a policy support by the government and technical support by the scientists in the region. Fatunde	Are needed? Matig	Yes. End of track. Researcher Oscar Eyog Matig explains how intercropping of trees and cereal crops, combined with water harvesting, has restored degraded land in north Cameroon...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{glycoprotein}} (GP) molecular fraction {{structure of}} the gum exudate of Acacia <b>senegal</b> (<b>gum</b> Arabic) isolated from hydrophobic interaction chromatography was investigated using high-performance size exclusion chromatography-multi angle laser light scattering (HPSEC-MALLS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations. In solution, GP would be a mixture of spheroidal monomers and more anisotropic oligomers {{as suggested by the}} two exponent values found in the R-g vs. M-w relationship and TEM observations. The GP conformation probed by SAXS was ascribed to a thin object with a triaxial ellipsoid morphology, certainly attributed to GP oligomers. A 9 nm diameter particle was also identified by SAXS in agreement with the dimensions identified by TEM on single isolated ring-like structures. The GP oligomerization process, as probed by TEM, would be the result of ring-like subunits self-association. This self-association would lead to more linear or, sometimes, cyclised assembly. At the molecular level, GP fraction was found to have secondary structures mainly made of beta-sheets and turns (64 %) but also, to a lesser extent, made of polyproline II (PPII) and alpha-helices (19 %). These features were characteristic of hydroxyprolin-rich glycoproteins with arabinosylated and arabinogalactan polysaccharide side chains grafted to the polypeptide backbone. The GP molecular fraction structure from Acacia gum would be an assembly of ring-like glycoproteins modules. These ring-like structures were certainly due to hydroxyproline (Hyp) -arabinogalactan (AG) subunits. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The aims were to tree/crop relations within the gum cultivation cycle on sandy soils, the effect of Acacia senegal plantations on "Gardod" soil and to compare the effect of intercropping of groundnut, sesame and sorghum within the A. <b>senegal</b> <b>gum</b> gardens with sole cropping of the same crops on yield, respectively. In the first study, {{the results showed that}} all treatments gave land equivalent ratio (LER) of more than one indicating the superiority of growing field crops in intercropping with Acacia senegal over sole cropping system. The economic analysis revealed that all treatments were economically attractive since they gave positive net revenue. The second study revealed that soil moisture was higher under trees than in the open. Yield of gum Arabic was higher in the 4 × 8 meter spacing than in the 4 × 4 m and 8 × 8 m spacing and the control. In the last study, the results indicated increased crop yields under intercropping – probably due to increased fertility and shelter under A. senegal trees. Although gum Arabic decreased in intercropped plots, yet the land equivalent ratio was positive due to the high crop yields relative to sole cropping. Furthermore, crop yields were much higher than the yields in traditional field...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} and physicochemical characteristics of gum exudate samples harvested from mature trees of Acacia senegal at two new specific ecolocations in Nigeria, {{have been investigated}} together with gum samples harvested from A. senegal and A. seyal originating from Sudan. The monosaccharide sugar compositions for the A. <b>senegal</b> <b>gum</b> samples {{were found to be}} similar, but the protein contents for the Nigerian samples were significantly higher than recorded for the Sudanese sample. Gel Permeation Chromatography coupled to light scattering, refractive index and U. V. detectors, has shown the presence of arabinogalactan, arabinogalactaneprotein and glycoprotein fractions within the A. senegal gums and has also shown the presence of an additional small proportion of very low molar mass proteinaceous material all the samples which has previously been ignored. The plot of radius of gyration, Rg, as a function of elution volume showed a discontinuity for one of the Nigerian samples and for the A. seyal gum sample at elution volumes corresponding to the AGP component suggesting a different molecular structure. Plots of MweveRg confirmed that the molecules had a compact structure. The hydrodynamic size of the molecules was followed using dynamic light scattering as a function of time and it was found that molecular association occurred in solution. The extent of association increased as the protein content in the sample increased and was inhibited in the presence of electrolyte, it was concluded that association was due to electrostatic interaction between the protein moieties and glucuronic acid groups on individual macromolecules...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{focus of}} the study was to {{determine}} the symbiotic and growth response of three Senegalia Senegal (Syn. Acacia <b>Senegal,</b> <b>gum</b> arabic tree) provenances, namely Dahra (Senegal), Tera (Niger) and Makueni (Kenya) to inoculation with selected S. Senegal-nodulating rhizobia in soils from Dahra and Goudiry regions of Senegal, representing typical soil and enviromental conditions for establishing gum arabic production plantations. Methods: A greenhouse experiment was performed to evaluate the effect of 11 rhizobial strains on nodulation and growth of three S. Senegal provenances in two field soils, differing in nutrient status and indigenous rhizobia. After 4 months, plants were harvested for determination of nodulation, shoot and root dryweight. Results: Nodulation and growth of S. Senegal varied in relation to rhizobial strain, provenance, soil type, and their interactions. Generally, nodulation was higher in Dahra than Goudiry soils, while Makueni provenance was the most compatible host. Inoculation had a significant effect on all parameters measured in Dahra field soil. By contrast, inoculation had a significant effect on height (shoot length), and shoot, root and total dry matter but not on nodulation. In the two field soils, seed provenance effect was significant for all parameters measured. The interaction between inoculation and provenance showed a significant effect on all parameters measured except nodule number in Dahra field soil while in Goudiry, the interaction had a significant effect on seedling height and shoot, root, and total dry matter but this effect was not significant with nodulation parameters. Conclusions: S. Senegal is variable in its response to inoculation, it is therefore advantageous to select and match effective rhizobia-provenance symbionts for each site. ...|$|E
40|$|The Acacia gum (Acacia senegal var. senegal), {{which is}} a food {{additive}} approved by Codex Alimentarius, is defined within the Acacia subgenus (family Leguminosae). The structural characteristics associated with a “poor” and “good” emulsifying A. senegal var. senegal exudate gum are identified and it is shown {{that it is possible}} to maturate the “poor” emulsifier in a process comparable to that which occurs to the exudate gum as the age of the tree increases from 1 to 15 years and when the gum is stored naturally after collection. Thus, the molecular parameters of the “good” gum can be matched, and the emulsification effectiveness can attain the level of the “good” emulsifier. The process can be further continued to produce a series of gums of precisely structured molecular dimensions with improved properties and if the maturation is continued can yield a hydrogel form of Acacia. The new forms of A. senegal which are described here, and which have not previously been available are designated Acacia (sen) SUPER GUM™ which are constant in properties and with precisely structured molecular dimensions, unlike the naturally occurring gum. The viscosity can be increased up to 20 times compared to the starting material. The controlling factor is the agglomeration of the proteinaceous components within the molecularly disperse system that is A. <b>senegal</b> <b>gum</b> to increase the amount of arabinogalactan protein (AGP) emulsifying component up to more than double the amount present originally. This results in a dramatic increase in the interfacial surface properties and coverage of the oil droplet in oil in water emulsion. No other chemical change is initiated by the maturation process...|$|E
40|$|On {{behalf of}} the 90 th {{birthday}} of Professor Glyn O. Phillips, {{it is a great}} honor for authors of this publication to make a review on Acacia gum, one of the favorite polysaccharides extensively studied by Glyn and his collaborators all around the world during these last five decades. After remembering a synthetic historical perspective, the present critical review summarizes the main updated data of this complex polysaccharide from the chemical composition to the functional properties with a particular attention toward structure and bulk and interfacial properties. Biological properties of Acacia gums were not considered. Some of the main challenges in a near future for {{a better understanding of the}} functional properties of this polysaccharide concerns the detailed study of the gum maturation mechanism upon exudation, the structure and conformation of different molecular fractions, the role of minor components (minerals, polyphenols, lipids) on the structure and functionality of gums, the physicochemical properties of purified molecular fractions and the ways to modified them upon enzymatic modifications. In our opinion, the main challenges for a better understanding of the interfacial function of this polysaccharide (adhesion and stabilization at liquid and solid interfaces) will be to probe the interfacial induced conformational changes. This area of research seems to have been quite neglected during these last past years and fundamental questions arising from the adhesive and stabilizing properties of Acacia gum are still without answer today. In addition, the amino-acid sequence contained in this complex polysaccharide are totally unknown today and future developments based on enzyme/chemical modifications and liquid chromatography coupled to on line mass spectrometry could unravel the sequence and decipher between the existence of one or more amino-acid sequences in Acacia <b>senegal</b> <b>gum.</b> We sincerely hope Glyn, one of the “father of Arabic gum”, will find some positive echo in this review...|$|E
40|$|Acacia gum is {{a natural}} arabinogalactan-protein type {{polysaccharide}} widely used in industrial applications. The two varieties of Acacia gum, A. senegal and A. seyal, are hyperbranched polysaccharides rich in arabinose and galactose (PRAG) mainly formed by chains of 3, 6 -linked beta-D-Galp substituted in position 6 by side chains of 3 -linked alpha-L-Araf. Beyond this common structure, A. senegal presented the highest degree of branching (78. 2 % vs. 59. 2 %) with more branched galactopyranoses, shorter arabinosyl side branches, and more rhamnopyranoses in terminal position. Circular dichroism experiments evidenced that both Acacia gums were partially structured into polyproline type II helices but in a lesser extent for A. <b>senegal</b> <b>gum,</b> suggesting its less structured organisation. The fingerprint of both Acacia gums and their spectral differences determined by FTIR spectroscopy were described. Analysis of HPSEC-MALLS data suggested that macromolecules of both Acacia gums adopted an ellipsoid-like conformation in solution. The average molecular weight of A. seyal macromolecules was larger than that of A. senegal ones (8. 2 x 10 (5) g mol(- 1) vs. 6. 8 x 10 (5) g mol(- 1)). Nevertheless, A. seyal macromolecules appeared more compact and less viscous (R-g: 17. 1 nm; [eta]: 16. 5 mL g(- 1)) than A. senegal ones (R-g: 30. 8 nm; [eta]: 22. 8 mL g(- 1)). The most compact structure of A. seyal gum can be partly explained by the lowest concentration of charged sugars that induces less electrostatic repulsion, and the highest content of long arabinose side chains that may self-organize and interact between them (e. g. hydrogen bonding, steric effect, etc.). For both Acacia gums, the anisotropy of macromolecules increased with the molecular weight, however, A. senegal macromolecules were the most anisotropic one...|$|E
40|$|Cylophosphamide (CYCL) is {{a strong}} anticancer and {{immunosuppressive}} agent but its urotoxicity presents {{one of the major}} toxic effects that limit its wide usage particularly in high dose regimens. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate Acacia <b>Senegal</b> <b>gum</b> exudate, Gum Arabic (GA), for its possible role as a natural, nontoxic agent against CYCL-induced urotoxicity. Male Swiss albino rats were exposed to CYCL (150 mg/kg BW, once i. p) with or without GA oral supplementation (7. 5 g/kg/day for 6 days) through drinking water. Glutathione (GSH), Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Nitric oxide (NO) bladder contents were assessed. Responsiveness of the bladder rings to acetylcholine (ACh) in vitro, microscopic and macroscopic features are also investigated. CYCL produced pronounced harmful effects on bladder urothelial lining with significant increases in (MDA) and NO levels in the tissue homogenates. Bladder-GSH content is dropped by over 60 % following CYCL injection. Bladder contractility, as measured by its responsiveness to ACh, recorded a marked reduction. The isolated bladders exhibited such macroscopic changes as severe edema, inflammation and extravasation. The bladder weight increased as well. Histological changes were evident in the form of severe congestion, petechial hemorrhage and chronic inflammatory reaction in the lamina propria accompanied with desquamated epithelia. GA, a potential protective agent, produced an almost complete reversal of NO induction, lipid peroxidation or cellular GSH bladder contents in the GA + CYCL-treated group. Likewise, bladder inflammation and edema were reduced. Bladder rings showed a remarkable recovery in their responsiveness to ACh. Bladder histological examination showed a near normal configuration and structural integrity, with a significant reduction in inflammation and disappearance of focal erosions. These remarkable effects of GA may be attributed to its abdity to neutralize acrolein, the reactive metabolite of CYCL and/or the resultant reactive oxygen metabolites, through a scavenging action. CA may limit the cascading events of CYCL-induced damage, initiating a cytoprotective effect leading to structural and functional recovery of the bladder tissue...|$|E
