40|$|Kinetic {{friction}} during {{dry sliding}} along atomistic-scale Al(001) /Al(001) and alpha-Al 2 O 3 (0001) /alpha-Al 2 O 3 (0001) interfaces {{has been investigated}} using molecular dynamics (MD) with recently developed Reactive Force Fields (ReaxFF). It is of interest to determine if kinetic friction variations predicted with MD follow the macroscopic-scale friction laws known as Coulomb's law (for dry sliding) and Stokes' friction law (for lubricated sliding) {{over a wide range}} of sliding velocities. The effects of interfacial commensuration and roughness on kinetic friction have been studied. It is found that kinetic friction during sliding at commensurate alpha-Al 2 O 3 (0001) /alpha-Al 2 O 3 (0001) interfaces exceeds that due to sliding at an incommensurate alpha-Al 2 O 3 (0001) /alpha-Al 2 O 3 (0001) interface. For both interfaces, kinetic friction at lower sliding velocities deviates minimally from Coulombic friction, whereas at higher sliding velocities, kinetic friction follows a viscous behavior with <b>sliding</b> <b>damped</b> by thermal phonons. For atomically smooth Al(001) /Al(001), only viscous friction is observed. Surface roughness tends to increase kinetic friction, and adhesive transfer causes kinetic friction to increase more rapidly at higher sliding velocities...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferating cell}} nuclear Ag (PCNA) is a DNA {{replication}} factor postulated {{to function as}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>damp</b> around DNA. PCNA is also a target for autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus. The autoantigenicity of PCNA is highly conformation-dependent, and reaction with most anti-PCNA sera requires a nearly full-length PCNA molecule. Here we describe the use of gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation to analyze the native structure and size of PCNA. PCNA from three sources was studied (PCNA from HeLa cells, PCNA purified after its overexpression in bacteria, and PCNA produced in the wheat germ cell-free translation system) as well as mutant forms of PCNA translated in vitro. In each case, full-length PCNA behaved as a trimer. Analysis of mutant proteins revealed a correlation between the trimeric form and binding to the common type of human anti-PCNA autoantibody, suggesting that the Abs are specific for the active form of the protein. These findings are consistent with the idea that autoantibodies are generated as a response to native Ag and provide experimental support for the hypothesis that PCNA serves its processive function in DNA replication as a trimeric ring structure...|$|R

This oscillator is a strongly simplified model for a damping principle applied to turbine blades to suppress oscillations induced by inhomogeneous flow fields. It exhibits periodic, quasi-periodic, as well as chaotic dynamics occuring suddenly due to adding sliding bifurcations. Mathematically, the oscillator is given as a piecewise smooth (Filippov) system with a switching manifold corresponding to the sticking phase of the damper mass. The rich dynamics of this system is analyzed and illustrated by means of resonance curves, Lyapunov diagrams, Poincaré sections and reductions to iterated one-dimensional maps...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{designing}} a single-structure triaxes MEMS capacitive gyroscope which {{is capable of}} measuring the three angular velocities on a single drive. A Z-shaped beam {{for the support of}} folded coupling spring has been applied to suppress the unwanted mode and decrease the stress effect at the spring ends. The unique coupling spring has changed the driving motion, due to which <b>slide</b> film <b>damping</b> in the driving mode has been reduced. This reduction can lead to higher performance of the sensor with less requirements on vacuum level which decreases the cost of fabrication. Simulation analysis has been performed in COMSOL Multiphysics and Matlab Simulink to finalize the design for fabrication. After finite element analysis, the driving, x-sensing, z-sensing, and y-sensing are, respectively, found to be 13. 30 [*]KHz, 13. 40 [*]KHz, 13. 47 [*]KHz, and 13. 51 [*]KHz...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{characterization}} of a vibratory yaw rate MEMS sensor that uses in-plane motion for both actuation and sensing. The design criterion for the rate sensor {{is based on a}} high sensitivity and low bandwidth. The required sensitivity of the yaw rate sensor is attained by using the in-plane motion in which the dominant damping mechanism is the fluid loss due to <b>slide</b> film <b>damping</b> i. e. two–three orders of magnitude less than the squeeze-film damping in other rate sensors with out-of-plane motion. The low bandwidth is achieved by matching the drive and the sense mode frequencies. Based on these factors, the yaw rate sensor is designed and finally realized using surface micromachining. The in-plane motion of the sensor is experimentally characterized to determine the sense and the drive mode frequencies, and corresponding damping ratios. It is found that the experimental results match well with the numerical and the analytical models with less than 5 % error in frequencies measurements. The measured quality factor of the sensor is approximately 467, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that for a similar rate sensor with out-of-plane sense direction...|$|R
40|$|Scene {{inhomogeneity}} in SAR images {{has been}} traditionally {{measured by the}} coefficient of variation (# #), defined as the ratio of local standard deviation to local mean. Such an inhomogeneity feature, however, relies on statistics calculated locally and thus is not capable to describe an image property related to the global image context. Secondly, the # # is very sensitive to speckle noise, unless statistics are calculated on a large <b>sliding</b> window, which <b>damps</b> its capability to resolve fine spatial details. In this work, an alternative feature, calculable from SAR images on a per-pixel basis, but relying on global image statistics, is described and discussed.

40|$|Key words: {{ultrasonic}} linear motor; precision positioning; mechanical drift. Abstract: During {{the experiment}} of cell poking, it is {{required that the}} point of a probe is aimed at the cell {{with the help of a}} precision motion platform, and then, controlled by this motion platform, the tip of the probe pokes into the cell. When these operations are done, the driving force of this platform will be removed. But within a certain period (for example, an hour), the platform doesn’t stop moving. This kind of movement, which should be only several microns, is termed in this paper as the mechanical drift of ultrasonic linear motors. Experiments show that the forms used for clamping the stator is one of the factors that affect the mechanical drift. It is studied through experiments the impacts of several clamping forms on mechanical drift, the drift value’s relationship with the <b>slide</b> rail’s <b>damping</b> and the motor’s step size, and how the drift direction is related to the motion direction. The mechanism of mechanical drift of ultrasonic linear motors has also been explored preliminarily. This kind of research will facilitate refinements of the design and control methods for ultrasonic linear motor as well as motion platforms...|$|R

The testing results verified its stiffness and damping controllable capability. Then a quarter-car model with the advanced damper was built to evaluate the performance of the <b>damper.</b> <b>Sliding</b> mode control was used to control the damper and the simulation results verified the variable stiffness and damping damper performs the best on vibration control compared with other dampers...|$|R

These vibration problems {{can be used as}} a toy model for rain-wind induced oscillations of cables. In order to suppress undesired vibrations in the string (or beam), dampers are used at the boundary. The main aim of this paper is to show how solutions for these string and beam problems on a semi-infinite domain can be computed. We derive explicit solutions for a linear string problem which is attached to a mass-spring-dashpot system at x = 0 by using the D’Alembert method, and for a transversally vibrating beam problem which has a pinned, <b>sliding,</b> clamped or <b>damping</b> boundary, respectively, at x = 0 by using the method of Laplace transforms.

40|$|We {{determine}} the linear viscoelastic response of jammed packings of athermal repulsive viscous spheres, {{a model for}} emulsions, wet foams, and soft colloidal suspensions. We numerically measure the complex shear modulus, a fundamental characterization of the response, and demonstrate that low frequency response displays dynamic critical scaling near unjamming. Viscoelastic shear response is governed by the relaxational eigenmodes of a packing. We use scaling arguments to explain the distribution of eigenrates, which develops a divergence at unjamming. We then derive the critical exponents characterizing response, including a vanishing shear modulus, diverging viscosity, and critical shear thinning regime. Finally, we demonstrate that macroscopic rheology is sensitive to details of the local viscous force law. By varying the ratio of normal and tangential damping coefficients, we identify and explain a qualitative difference between systems with strong and weak <b>damping</b> of <b>sliding</b> motion. When <b>sliding</b> is weakly <b>damped</b> there is no diverging time scale, no diverging viscosity, and no critical shear thinning regime. Comment: 12 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{sliding friction}} of a dimer over a substrate is studied within a one-dimensional model, {{consisting of a}} vibrating dimer (two masses connected by a spring), internally <b>damped,</b> <b>sliding</b> over a sinusoidal potential. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the friction force has an approximate v− 3 dependence if the velocity is sufficiently large, {{and that there is}} a striking periodic variation of the proportionality coefficient with the ratio of the length of the dimer to the substrate wavelength. The nonlinear velocity dependence was predicted earlier for a Langevin model of an adsorbed layer in the presence of strong external force. We study it here in detail in the transient regime and without external force. We obtain the dependence on key parameters (internal dissipation, dimer mass, substrate corrugation, and length ratio), and examine the validity of the friction law. A semianalytical expression is suggested which confirms the numerical observations in the high-velocity regime...|$|R
40|$|Gyroscope is an {{angular rate}} {{measurement}} sensor having broad application {{in the field}} of automotive, military services, aerospace and consumer electronics industries. Silicon micro machined MEMS vibratory gyroscopes have better advantages compared to conventional gyroscope. Nano beam vibratory gyroscope is one of the simple gyroscope. It has relatively small size, light weight, low power consumption, low cost and simple structure. When a gyroscope is made to rotate at its base along with some excitation in one of the bending direction, due to Coriolis effect, there will be significant displacement in other bending direction. Dynamic modeling of beam gyroscope is very interesting area. In the micro/nano level actuation and sensing are with electrostatics principles. This report presents the modeling and analytical simulation task of a nano cantilever beam gyroscope. Static and dynamic analysis of a nano/micro cantilever gyroscope with a tip mass is studied. Pull-in instability corresponding voltage is estimated from static and frequency response. Pull-in stability regions are identified as a function of beam length, tip mass value, elastic modulus of the beam. Nonlinearities due to geometry and the external forces including electrostatic and van der Waals forces are considered during modelling.

40|$|Radar layer {{geometry}} in divide {{areas is}} {{strongly influenced by}} {{the operation of the}} Raymond effect, which causes upwarping of the layers {{as a consequence of the}} nonlinear rheology of ice. The detailed geometry of these layers is known to store a record of change in the cryosphere, of local thinning, and of the age of formation of the divide and has been surmised to provide information about lateral motion of divides. Such lateral motion can be caused by changes in flanking ice streams, and the divide area thereby contains a record of ice stream dynamics. It has also been suggested that a large perturbation of divide position will obliterate the cumulative effects of the operation of the Raymond mechanism, leading to the disappearance of Raymond bumps. Since the Raymond effect has a strong influence on the age-depth relation in ice cores, knowledge of whether its operation is localized (leading to strong bump formation) or distributed is crucial in the interpretation of ice cores. The detailed evolution of ice divide radar layer geometry remains poorly understood. Employing a full thermomechanically coupled transient model, we qualitatively explore the effect of divide migration on radar layer geometry. Certain qualitative features emerge which can be used to infer history of cryosphere change, in particular, in areas distant from the usual sites of geological dating. There remains uncertainty about the influence of sliding on the operation of the Raymond effect. Under certain conditions, the existence of <b>sliding</b> can <b>damp</b> or eliminate the operation of the Raymond effect. If this is generally true, then dating of ice divides may simply be a date for the freezing of the divide bottom. We show that sliding does not necessarily eliminate the formation of bumps. Dates of divide formation are likely to be dates for the location of the ridge at a particular spot. Raymond bump evolution is weakened by flow along the ridge. We explore quantitatively the strength of this effect, using a scaling analysis to show that the weakening can efficiently be described by one parameter, the ratio of along-ridge slope to a measure of the across-divide curvature...|$|R

40|$|Power system {{generators}} are interconnected in a {{distributed network}} to allow sharing of power. If {{one of the}} generators cannot meet the power demand, spare power is diverted from neighbouring generators. However, this approach also allows for propagation of electric disturbances. An oscillation arising from a disturbance at a given generator site will affect the normal operation of neighbouring generators and might cause them to fail. Hours of production time will {{be lost in the}} time it takes to restart the power plant. If the disturbance is detected early, appropriate control measures can be applied to ensure system stability. The aim of this study is to improve existing algorithms that estimate the oscillation parameters from acquired generator data to detect potentially dangerous power system disturbances. When disturbances occur in power systems (due to load changes or faults), damped oscillations (or "modes") are created. Modes which are heavily damped die out quickly and pose no threat to system stability. Lightly damped modes, by contrast, die out slowly and are more problematic. Of more concern still are "negatively damped" modes which grow exponentially with time and can ultimately cause the power system to fail. Widespread blackouts are then possible. To avert power system failures it is necessary to monitor the damping of the oscillating modes. This thesis proposes a number of damping estimation algorithms for this task. If the damping is found to be very small or even negative, then additional damping needs to be introduced via appropriate control strategies. This thesis presents a number of new algorithms for estimating the damping of modal oscillations in power systems. The first of these algorithms uses multiple orthogonal sliding windows along with least-squares techniques to estimate the modal damping. This algorithm produces results which are superior to those of earlier sliding window algorithms (that use only one pair of sliding windows to estimate the damping). The second algorithm uses a different modification of the standard <b>sliding</b> window <b>damping</b> estimation algorithm - the algorithm exploits the fact that the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) within the Fourier transform of practical power system signals is typically constant across a wide frequency range. Accordingly, damping estimates are obtained at a range of frequencies and then averaged. The third algorithm applied to power system analysis is based on optimal estimation theory. It is computationally efficient and gives optimal accuracy, at least for modes which are well separated in frequency...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} damping {{potential}} of carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced polymer matrix composites through integrated experiments and continuum modeling techniques. Both ?passive" and ?active? damping are studied. The passive damping here {{refers to the}} inherent capability of a composite to damp vibrations {{in the absence of}} external stimuli, such as electrical signals, by exploiting different damping mechanisms introduced by the presence of the nanoscale reinforcements. Among the targeted passive damping mechanisms in nanocomposites is a ?slip-stick? mechanism in which the interactions between the filler and polymer results in energy dissipation in a frictional mode along the interface. Microstructural design of nanocomposites, such as the development of CNT alignment, was pursued here to enhance the contribution of interfacial <b>sliding</b> to <b>damping,</b> relative to other mechanisms such as stress concentrations within the matrix and matrix plasticity. A micromechanics model was used to provide additional insight into the experimental observations by showing that the nonlinear variation of damping with dynamic strain can be attributed to slip-stick behavior. The dependence of the interfacial load-transfer reversibility on the dynamic strain history and characteristic time scale was experimentally investigated to demonstrate the relative significance of van der Waals (vdW) interactions, mechanical interlocking, and covalent bonding on shear interactions. In this effort, we also studied the controllability of energy dissipation capability in nanocomposites via electrical signals, referred to as active damping. This mechanism benefits from the electrically conductive network of CNTs, as well as their high surface to volume ratio, to thermally enhance viscous phenomena, such as chain relaxation in polymers. For active damping, the thermomechanical response of the polymer is targeted and studied as a potential damping source within the nanocomposite. By taking advantage of the polymer relaxation resulting from an increase in temperature, the composite shows the potential for damping enhancement. However, the non-uniform temperature distribution in the composite sample has a large effect on the overall damping enhancement. The non-uniformity of the temperature distribution, both locally and globally, was studied via experiments and multi-resolution models to further shed light on this phenomenon. This effort clearly points to the significance of interface phenomena, both friction between filler and matrix and energy transfer from the fillers to the matrix, in controlling the damping mechanisms in nanocomposites and presents insights, both qualitative and quantitative, into the origins of these effects...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that, in seismic zone, the {{adoption}} of the classical design philosophy for MR-frames provides to concentrate the energy dissipation at beam ends requiring, due to random variability and strain-hardening of the materials, the employment of heavy structural details for joints and a significant oversizing of columns due to the application of members’ hierarchy criterion. In order to overcome such limitations, in last decades mainly due to economy issues, partial strength connections have been proposed as an effective alternative to full-strength connections. In fact, with this approach the action transferred to the column is limited to the joint resistance and a more cost/effective design can be reached especially in case of frames of medium rise with long spans. Within this framework, in this paper, an intermediate approach between the classical and innovative one is presented through the application of friction dampers to steel joints. In particular, it is proposed to connect the beam to the column with a classical fixed T-stub fastening the upper flange and a friction damper located at the beam lower flange. The friction damper, composed by a stack of steel plates with one of the inner plates thermally sprayed with aluminium dust, is designed in order to slide in correspondence of a force equal to the nominal resistance of the connected beam divided by the lever arm (which is equal to the distance between the T-stub and the friction damper). In this way, provided that all the joint components are designed to be over-strength with respect to the actions corresponding to the friction <b>damper</b> <b>sliding</b> force, it is possible to obtain practically full-strength connections without providing any damage to the steel elements. In the paper, the approach is validated reporting the results of an experimental campaign developed at the Laboratory of Materials and Structures of the University of Salerno...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} analysis {{described in}} this paper has been performed within {{the activities of the}} FREEDAM project (FREE from DAMage steel connections), which is an RFCS project (Research Fund for Coal and Steel), granted by the European Community, devoted {{to the development of a}} new design strategy based on the employment of friction dampers in beam-to-column joints. In past, the application of dampers has been widely investigated within the development of supplemental energy dissipation strategies, with the aim to improve the energy dissipation capacity of the primary structure and to reduce the structural damage by concentrating the energy dissipation supply in fuses located in zones of the structure where high relative displacements are expected. Conversely, the strategy studied in the FREEDAM project is based on the application of damping devices, specifically friction dampers, under a new perspective. In fact, they are conceived as elements included in connections with the aim to completely substitute the traditional dissipative zones of MRFs, i. e. the beam ends. To this scope, beam-to-column joints are equipped with friction dampers constituted by steel plates and friction pads pre-loaded with high-strength bolts, that can be located either at the level of both flanges, or at the bottom flange level only, or on additional haunches which can be used to increase the lever arm of the damper. In particular, the connection studied in the FREEDAM project is realized as a modification of the classical detail of a Double Split Tee Joint (DST) where, in substitution of the bottom Tee element, a symmetrical friction damper is introduced which is realized pre-loading friction pads located between the webs of a couple of angles used to fasten the beam to the column and the beam flange or the lowev plate of an eventual beam hunch, which is slotted in order to allow the <b>sliding</b> of the <b>damper.</b> With this connecting system, under bending actions, the joint is forced to rotate around a rotation center located at the base of the upper T-stub web and the energy dissipation supply is provided by the alternate slippage of the lower beam flange on friction pads. In this way, provided that the steel components of the connection are properly over-strengthened, the joint resistance and the rotation capacity can be easily governed by calibrating the preload applied to the frictional interfaces and realizing slotted holes whose length provides an adequate stroke for the dissipative device. The main feature of this connection is that, even under the occurrence of destructive seismic events, the only damage is due to the consumption of the friction pads, while all the steel elements are completely preserved obtaining, in this way, a connection able to withstand destructive seismic events without any damage to the steel parts, namely a FREE from DAMage connection. Clearly, in order to accurately control the design of such a connection typology, the knowledge of the value of the friction coefficient of the material employed to realize the friction pads is of paramount importance. Therefore, among all the possible materials, it is necessary to select those able to develop high values of the friction coefficient and a stable behavior under cyclic loading conditions. In this paper, the main results of preliminary analyses devoted to select the best materials to be employed as friction pads in the FREEDAM connections are presented. To date, twelve tests on eight different materials combined with stainless steel plates have been realized. The tests performed, mainly devoted to evaluate the behavior of the friction interfaces in terms of static and kinetic friction coefficient and in terms of degradation, are inspired to the sliding test proposed by EN 1090 - 2 adopting the loading protocol suggested by the EN 12159 for the qualification of seismic devices. The initial value of the friction coefficient and its evolution during the tests, have been determined for the different materials by monitoring the values of the forces of the bolts used to apply the pre-load to the friction interface and the value of the sliding force. The obtained results are presented both in terms of force-displacement curves and in terms of friction coefficient, providing a comparison between the performances of the analyzed interfaces in terms of energy dissipation supply...|$|R
