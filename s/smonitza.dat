40|$|In {{the present}} paper an {{estimation}} was given of total specific area (S) of very clayey soils of <b>smonitza</b> type in Central Serbia {{on the basis of}} the data on their textural composition and maximal hygroscopic moisture. Total specific area (m 2 g- 1) of the analysed very clayey smonitzas is, on average equal to the product of maximal hygroscopic moisture (MH), expressed in percent ratio of the mass, and the coefficient 11. 50, i. e. S = 11. 50 *MH (m 2 g- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Long-standing {{utilization}} of agricultural machines in agricultural production {{leads to a}} significant increase of compaction in noncarbonate, slightly <b>smonitza</b> - like meadow black soils, in the Kolubara river valley. A substantial increase of compaction in the investigated soils was found in arable and subarable horizons down to the depth of 30 cm. The compaction increase induced negative changes in other most important physical properties of soil, like the increase of bulk density and packing density of soil particles, and the decrease of total porosity, content of pores > 30 mm and void ratio...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{synthesis}} of long-term investigations based {{on the effect of}} different (mineral and organic fertilisers, heavy metals, contaminated irrigation water, nitrification inhibitor and detergents) on the dynamics of soil fungi number. The investigations were performed at the Microbiology Department and trial fields of the Faculty of Agronomy in Cacak on <b>smonitza</b> and alluvium soils in field and greenhouse conditions. Maize, wheat, barley and red clover were used as test plants in these studies. The quantitative composition of the fungi in the soils investigated was determined by the Czapek selective agar dilution method. The study results show that the number of soil fungi was dependent on the type and rate of agrochemicals used, on the growing season and the soil zone the samples were taken from for the analysis. Lower nitrogen fertiliser rates (80 and 120 kg?ha- 1) and organic fertilisers stimulated the development of soil fungi, unlike the rate of 150 kg?ha- 1. Heavy metals, mercury and cadmium in particular, as well as high rates of the N-serve nitrification inhibitor inhibited the development of this group of soil microorganisms. Generally, the adverse effect of contaminated irrigation water on the soil fungi was recorded in both soil types, and particularly in the <b>smonitza</b> under red clover. Low detergent (Meril) concentrations did not have any significant effect on this group of microorganisms. In this respect, it can be concluded that the soil fungi number dynamics can be used in monitoring soils polluted by different toxinogenic substances...|$|E
40|$|The {{methods for}} {{estimating}} Fe, Mn and Zn solubility in <b>smonitzas</b> over Serbia (ten localities) used as fields and meadows, were studied in this paper. The total contents {{of these elements}} {{were found to be}} nearly equal to their mean values in the world soils. Regarding their availability, investigated <b>smonitzas</b> were found to be well supplied with manganese and, for the majority of samples, with iron. But, deficiency of iron in the soil were found in 25 % and zinc in 65 % of analyzed samples, after a more sensitive DTPA method had been used. A certain number of positive or negative correlations between the total and the available contents of the elements studied and some basic properties of the <b>smonitzas</b> were obtained, which is in agreement with the behavior of these elements in the soil...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{sampling}} {{was carried}} out in the Velika Morava river valley, covering the area from Velika Plana to the mouth of Morava to the Danube. The composite soil samples, representing alluvial soils (22 samples), cambisols (14) and <b>smonitzas</b> (4), were taken from plough layers, based on a regular square grid with intervals set at 5 x 5 km, covering total area of 100, 000 ha. The total and available fluorine contents were determined in the soils samples. The highest average amount of total fluorine was found for alluvial soils (391 mg kg- 1), then for <b>smonitzas</b> (348 mg kg- 1) and the lowest one for cambisols (285 mg kg- 1). These amounts are within normal fluorine content for soils (150 - 400 mg kg- 1), although the maximum found levels were even about 500 mg kg- 1. The available fluorine content was very low (< 1 mg kg- 1), being mostly less than 0. 2 % from its total amount, so it could be concluded that there was no danger from fluorine accumulation in the plants. Statistically significant correlation coefficient between total and available fluorine contents was not obtained. The total and available fluorine contents have mostly been in the correlation (with positive sign) with soil pH and the content of mechanical fraction silt+clay. Significant correlation coefficients between total fluorine content and the content of some heavy metals (Cr, Ni, Co, Cu, As) were also found, which indicated their mutual geochemical origin...|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} {{the results of}} macro field trial with some ZP and NS corn hybrids have been shown. The field trial was {{accomplished}} in 2001 and 2002 year {{in the area of}} Toplica. The soil on which the field trial was accomplished was <b>smonitza.</b> The antecedent culture was the winter barley. The insemination was performed at the beginning of May. In the macro field trial 19 ZP and NS corn hybrids of different length of vegetation were included. The results showed that the harvest lacked from 15 - 26 % of plants in relation to the number of showed ones. The content of the damp in the harvest went from 20, 7 to 28, 8 %. The average crop was from 4, 73 (NS dunav) to 6, 47 t/ha (NS zenit). ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Wind is an {{important}} erosional process {{in the areas of}} steppe-savanna climate in Europe as typified by the Vojvodina plain in Yugoslavia. Cultivated and forested plots on the Subotica-Horgos Sands were used to study aeolian erosion processes. Wind erosion on the cultivated plot was 3 - 29 times greater than that occurring on a plot planted to forest trees. That erosion results in important losses of humus and nutrients. A practical equation estimating wind erosion from wind- 3 Deflation processes in the zone of steppe-savanna climate in Europe are represented in the large plain of Vojvodina, which is a cornfield and a region of particular importance to Yugoslavia. The use of contemporary agricultural engineering, the inappropriate organization of the territory, destruction of protective green cover, and other unfavorable effects lead to the initiation and development of deflation processes of different intensities. This aspect of soil destruction affects, first of all, agriculture, water resources management, traffic, infrastructure, environment, etc. The region of Vojvodina is characterized by heterogeneous soil types, ranging from sands, black soil, chernozem, and <b>smonitza</b> to gleyed soil which, in given climate conditions, are differently threatened by the process of wind erosion. In this paper we shall point out the research on wind erosion (started in 1980) on the soils of light mechanical composition (potentially the most threatened soils), on th...|$|E
