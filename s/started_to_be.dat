This {{population}} was East-Semitic speaking one, and used a dialect much similar {{to the language of}} Ebla (the Eblaite language), while the Shakkanakku period had an East-Semitic Akkadian speaking population. West Semitic names <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attested in Mari since the second kingdom era, and by the middle Bronze-Age, the west Semitic Amorite tribes became the majority of the pastoral groups in the middle Euphrates and Khabur valleys. Amorite names <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> observed in the city {{toward the end of the}} Shakkanakku period, even among the ruling dynasty members.|$|E

5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a diverse}} and growing {{cultural}} scene, with cultural life exhibited {{in a number}} of fields, including the visual arts, performing arts and nightlife. The city's cultural scene spans its history, dating back to Roman times: the city <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built in that period, which has left its mark on the urban layout (centered on today's Piața Muzeului) as well as surviving ruins. However, the medieval town saw a shift in its centre towards new civil and religious structures, notably St. Michael's Church.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the state}} of anarchy being {{experienced}} by the city, Belgrano's death was largely unnoticed. The only newspaper of the time to note his death was El Despertador Teofilantrópico, written by Francisco de Paula Castañeda, and there was no government representation at his funeral. Former students of his educative institutions would arrive in the following days with obsequies, when the news <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known. The following year the political context was less chaotic and Bernardino Rivadavia, who was minister by then, organised a massive state funeral.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{topography}} {{of the area}} in the vicinity of Scotch Run, the area near the stream was not settled until some time after the first settlement in the surrounding areas. Alexander McCauley settled on the stream in Beaver Township 1774. Some time before 1820, a carding mill was built by George Fleming on the stream southeast of Mainville.

5|$|During the Middle Ages {{sheep farming}} for the wool trade came to {{dominate}} the economy of Exmoor. The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, fulled, dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During this period a Royal Forest and hunting ground was established, administered by the Warden. The Royal Forest was sold off in 1818.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have {{developed}} a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an antecedent period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in southwest Asia, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Current models indicate that wild stands that had been harvested previously <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> planted, but were not immediately domesticated.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the first}} century AD, the Coptic {{alphabet}} <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet {{with the addition of}} some Demotic signs. Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine and Islamic periods in Egypt, but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Jean-François Champollion, were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.|$|E

In 1994, following the election of Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress, the National Colours Board {{was set up to}} control the distribution of Springbok colours. Despite this, the majority of South Africa's sporting organisations stopped awarding Springbok colours following the replacement of the Springbok by the Protea following a government demand. The only sporting body in South Africa that was allowed to retain Springbok colours was the South African Rugby Union as an act of conciliation towards the white minority who made up the majority of the national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Ulysses S. Grant, {{the former}} President of the United States, visited Japan. While in Tokyo, he {{attended}} a jujutsu presentation at Shibusawa Eiichi's home in Asukayama. Kano Jigoro {{was one of the}} jujutsuka present. At that time, jujutsu was just starting to become known in Europe and the Americas. Excepting literal circus acts, few non-Japanese had much chance of seeing or learning about the art. Even in Japan, judo and jujutsu were not considered separate disciplines at that time. Indeed, it was not until 1925 that there <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> clear differentiation of the names in Japan, and outside Japan, judo and jujutsu were not completely separated until the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 1973-1982 {{restoration}} of the Refectory Church of St. John the Theologian (the only building that survived the demolition of the 1930s) was held. Authors of the project - architect V. Shevchenko and architect I. Karakis (interiors and furniture). After Ukraine regained independence in 1991, the demolition of the monastery was deemed a crime and voices <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard calling for the monastery's full-scale reconstruction as {{an important part of}} the cultural heritage of the Ukrainian people. These plans were approved and carried out in 1997–1998, whereupon the cathedral and belltower were transferred to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate. Yuriy Ivakin, the chief archaeologist for the site, said that more than 260 valuable ancient artifacts were recovered during excavations of the site before reconstruction. In addition, a portion of the ancient cathedral, still intact, was uncovered; this today makes up a part of the current cathedral's crypt.|$|E
