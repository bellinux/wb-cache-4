5|$|Even liberal {{senators}} were agitated by {{the proposed}} changes, fearing their own lands would be confiscated. Senators arranged for other tribunes {{to oppose the}} reforms. Tiberius then appealed to the people, and argued that a tribune who opposes {{the will of the}} people in favour of the rich is not a true tribune. The senators were left with only one constitutional response – to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This necessitated Tiberius to <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second term.|$|E
5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{lieutenant}} governor does not preside over the state Senate, {{as is the case}} in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and was a member of the governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee. As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917. When McCall decided that he would not <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.|$|E

5|$|At , Hughes faced future UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, winning via {{unanimous}} decision. Hughes {{started the}} action by taking Sherk down immediately, passing to half guard. Sherk {{was able to}} <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few seconds before Hughes took him down again. In round two, they started to trade punches, but eventually Hughes took Sherk down. Like the first round, they stood up for a moment. At {{the beginning of the}} third round, Sherk took Hughes down, while Hughes attempted a kimura from the bottom. A late stand up led to a second takedown by Sherk. Round 4 saw Hughes using his strength to control the challenger on the ground. Sherk took Hughes down again in the fifth round, but the champion controlled {{the rest of the time}} sprawl-and-brawling as he finished on top. With the victory, he became the first man to ever defeat Sherk.|$|E
5|$|Maclean (1972) further {{suggests}} that the Dutch simply made a cartographical error, and confused Hirta with Skildar, the old name for Haskeir island much nearer the main Outer Hebrides archipelago. Quine (2000) hypothesises that the name is derived {{from a series of}} cartographical errors, starting {{with the use of the}} Old Icelandic Skildir ("shields") and appearing as Skildar on a map by Nicholas de Nicolay (1583). This, so the hypothesis goes, was transcribed in error by Lucas J. Waghenaer in his 1592 charts without the trailing r and with a full stop after the S, creating S.Kilda. This was in turn assumed to <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> saint by others, creating the form that has been used for several centuries, St Kilda.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{took the}} party into the 2015 United Kingdom general election, which saw a {{majority}} {{win for the}} Conservatives, and Labour's worst-ever election result in Scotland. There was a landslide shift towards the SNP, which took 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster, while Labour lost 40 of the 41 Westminster seats it was defending. Notable losses included Murphy's constituency of East Renfrewshire and Brown's former constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, previously Labour's safest seat in Scotland. Other high-profile figures such as Sarwar, Clark, Curran, Ian Davidson, and Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander also lost their seats. Following his defeat, Murphy spoke of his intention to <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Holyrood seat in 2016. However, the result prompted Labour figures {{and those in the}} trade union movement to question the future of his leadership. Ian Davidson suggested that {{it would be difficult for}} Murphy to remain as Scottish Labour leader without a parliamentary seat and in the wake of such a heavy defeat. Rafferty, and Kevin Lindsay of ASLEF, called for his resignation, while Findlay, and Labour's local government spokesman Alex Rowley, expressed their concerns about the party's future under Murphy's leadership and resigned from his shadow cabinet.|$|E

25|$|A syllable-final pharyngealization of the {{consonant}} is transcribed in Cyrillic with Cʼ (where C <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> consonant) {{and with}} VCˤ in the Latin transcription (the V <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vowel).

60|$|When {{we examine}} common words, we find that, broadly speaking, proper names <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> particulars, while other substantives, adjectives, prepositions, and verbs <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> universals. Pronouns <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> particulars, but are ambiguous: {{it is only}} by the context or the {{circumstances}} that we know what particulars they <b>stand</b> <b>for.</b> The word 'now' <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> particular, namely the present moment; but like pronouns, it <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ambiguous particular, because the present is always changing.|$|R

25|$|Although a {{large number}} of symbols are known, most {{artifacts}} contain so few symbols that they are very unlikely to represent a complete text.

Although PS stands for the single word postscript (or the Latin postscriptum), it is often spelled with periods (P.S.).|$|E

25|$|Khodorkovsky also {{planned to}} {{participate}} in the Duma byelections for the same seat as Kvachkov. His plan was based on the legal loophole: a convicted felon cannot vote or <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> parliament, but if his case is lodged with the Court of Appeal he still has all the electoral rights. Unexpectedly it took only a couple of weeks to process Khodorkovsky's appeal, invalidating any of his electoral plans until the end of his sentence.|$|E
