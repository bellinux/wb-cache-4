It enables more informed and relatively low cost investigation of significant risk factors, mitigation strategy effectiveness, and sensitivity to initial conditions, material, or soil properties. In this paper, a granular avalanche experiment from the literature is reanalyzed and used as a basis to assess the accuracy of discrete element method (DEM) predictions of avalanche flow. Discrete granular approaches such as DEM simulate the motion and collisions of individual particles and are useful for identifying and investigating the controlling processes within an avalanche. Using a superquadric shape representation, DEM simulations were found to accurately reproduce transient and static features of the avalanche. The effect of material properties on the shape of the avalanche deposit was investigated.

A good comparison with the observations is obtained for the phase of the oscillation across the array. The predicted magnitude is somewhat smaller than in the observations.

40|$|Since 1962 {{storage cell}} codes have been {{developed}} to simulate flow on fluvial and coastal floodplains. These models treat the floodplain as a series of discrete storage cells, with the flow between cells calculated explicitly using some analytical flow formulae such as the Manning equation. Recently these codes have been reconfigured to use regular Cartesian grids to make full use of widely available high resolution data captured from remote sensing platforms and stored in a raster GIS format. Such raster-based storage cell codes have many of the advantages over full two-dimensional depth averaged schemes but without the computational cost, however their typical implementation results in a number of fundamental limitations. These include an inability to develop solutions that are independent of time step or grid size, and an unrealistic lack of <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> floodplain <b>friction.</b> In this thesis, a new solution to these problems is proposed based on an optimal adaptive time step determined using a Courant-type condition for model stability. Comparison of this new adaptive time step scheme to analytical solutions of wave propagation/recession on flat and sloping planar surfaces and against field measurements acquired for four real flood scenarios demonstrates considerable improvement over a standard raster storage cell model. Moreover, the new scheme is shown to yield results that are independent of grid size or choice of initial time step and which show an intuitively correct <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> floodplain <b>friction</b> over spatially-complex topography. It does, however, incur a prohibitive computation cost at model grid resolutions less than 50 m. This primary research is supplemented by an examination of the data and methods used to apply, and in particular calibrate, distributed flood inundation models in practice. Firstly, different objective functions for evaluating the overall similarity between binary predictions of flood extent and remotely sensed images of inundation patterns are examined. On the basis of the results presented, recommendations are provided regarding the use of various measures for hydrological problems. Secondly, the value of different observational data types typically available for calibrating/constraining model predictions is explored within an extended Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) framework.

40|$|Friction is an {{important}} parameter in atmospheric modeling that may affect internal variability {{in a number of}} ways. It directly damps the annular-mode variability, but it also helps to maintain it through baroclinic feedbacks. Also, by determining the mean strength and position of the midlatitude jet, friction affects the internal dynamics that drive this variability. This work investigates the relevance of all of these factors for the sensitivity of the persistence of annular variability to changes in the zonal-mean friction using an idealized quasigeostrophic two-layer model. This model produces realistic variability, yet it is so simple that one can cleanly separate the different effects. It is found that the sensitivity of persistence to friction is dominated by the direct damping effect, while changes in the eddy momentum forcing and in the mean jet are not as important. As in more complex models, the persistence of the jet anomalies in this model decreases at all lags with increasing friction, but the long-time decorrelation decay rate of these anomalies is remarkably insensitive to friction. Although this implies that the eddy feedback must increase with friction to maintain the anomalies against the enhanced damping, it is shown that this is not due to baroclinic effects. A model that assumes that the eddy forcing does not change with friction can reproduce reasonably well the numerical results. The crucial factor that determines the model’s <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>friction</b> is the spectral structure of the eddy momentum forcing. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> surface <b>friction</b> of the {{latitude}} {{of the surface}} westerlies and the associated eddy-driven mid-latitude jet is studied in an idealized dry GCM. The westerlies move polewards as the friction is reduced in strength. An increase in the eastward phase speed of midlatitude eddies is implicated as playing {{a central role in}} this shift. This shift in latitude is mainly determined by changes in the friction on the zonal mean flow rather than the friction on the eddies. If the friction on the zonal mean is reduced instantaneously, the response reveals two distinctive adjustment time scales. In the fast adjustment over the first 10 - 20 days, there is an increase in the barotropic component of zonal winds and a substantial decrease in the eddy kinetic energy; the shift in the surface westerlies and jet latitude occurs in a slower adjustment. The space-time eddy momentum flux spectra suggest that the key to the shift is a poleward movement in the subtropical critical latitude associated the faster eastward phase speeds in the dominant midlatitude eddies. The view is supported by simulating the upper tropospheric dynamics in a stochastically stirred nonlinear shallow water mode...|$|R

40|$|Dynamics {{analyses}} are presented {{for the west}} Florida continental shelf response to upwelling favorable, alongshore or offshore winds using a three-dimensional, time-dependent, primitive equation model. These analyses complement the kinematics analyses of Li and Weisberg [1999]. Results are provided on four topics: (1) the response evolutions to quasi steady states, (2) the across-shelf distributions of the vertically integrated alongshore and across-shelf momentum balances, (3) the three-dimensional structures of the terms composing the momentum balance closures, and (4) the model <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> vertical <b>friction</b> parameterization. The response evolution starts with a local wind-driven acceleration, and it transitions over the inner shelf into a primary balance between the pressure gradient, Coriolis, and vertical friction terms. Thus the inner shelf spin-up takes a classical Ekman-geostrophic route. The middle shelf takes longer because it also depends on coastal boundary effects, notably the partial closure of the domain in the south by the Florida Keys. The outer shelf never achieves a steady state because of topographic wave effects. Coastline and isobath geometries result in fully three-dimensional flow fields. Thus a two-dimensional model that ignores alongshore variations cannot account for the results obtained. The inner shelf is the transition region between Ekman and Ekman-geostrophic balances where the surface slope results from mass adjustments through overlapping surface and bottom Ekman layers. Across the inner shelf the vertically integrated momentum balance shows a gradual trade-off between the Coriolis, pressure gradient, and bottom friction terms, and with the inner shelf frictionally determined its scale is sensitive <b>to</b> vertical <b>friction</b> parameterization...|$|R
40|$|This is the pre-peer {{reviewed}} {{version of}} the article which has been published in final form at: [URL] modelling of flood inundation over large and complex floodplains often requires mesh resolutions coarser than the structural features (e. g. buildings) that are known to influence the inundation process. Recent {{research has shown that}} this mismatch is not well represented by conventional roughness treatments but that finer scale features can be represented through porositybased sub grid scale treatments. This paper develops this work by testing the interactions between feature representation, sub grid scale resolution and mesh resolution. It uses as the basis for this testing a 2 D diffusion-based flood inundation model which is applied to a 2004 flood event in a topologically-complex upland floodplain in northern England. Results showed serious degradation of model predictions without explicit representation of features like walls. Inclusion of such features through raising mesh cell elevations where intersected by a feature resulted in a major improvement in model predictions in terms of reduced inundation extent. To make such treatments physically realistic, and notably so that the full potential for floodplain storage is included, it was shown that a sub grid scale treatment also needed to be included.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the plausibility of mesoscale eddy generation through local baroclinic instability of weak midocean gyre flows. The main tool is a statistically steady, two-layer quasigeostrophic turbulence model {{driven by an}} imposed, horizontally homogeneous, vertically sheared mean flow and dissipated by bottom Ekman friction. A wide range of friction strengths is investigated. In the weakly damped limit, flow is nearly barotropic, and the horizontal length scale of barotropic energy increases with decreasing friction, consistent with previous studies. The strongly damped limit, explored {{here for the first}} time, is equivalent barotropic (lower-layer velocities are nearly zero) and features an increase in the horizontal scale of potential energy with increasing friction. Current-meter data suggest that midocean eddies lie between the barotropic and equivalent barotropic limits. In accord with this suggestion, the moderately damped regime of the model compares well to observations of eddy amplitude, vertical structure, and horizontal scale, especially when stratification is surface intensified. A review of pertinent observations suggests that mesoscale eddies may indeed lie in the moderately damped limit. These arguments are first developed in f -plane simulations. Previous studies of beta-plane turbulence have had eastward mean flows, and in this case eddy energy has little <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>friction.</b> However, midocean gyre flows are generally nonzonal, and this nonzonality appears to be a significant factor in the production of energetic eddies. Beta-plane turbulence driven by nonzonal mean flows is sensitive to bottom friction, such that moderate damping is required for model eddies to compare well to observations, as on the f plane. A heuristic argument is presented in support of this similarity...|$|E
40|$|In turbomachinery, direct {{contacts}} between bladed disks and surrounding casings occur {{through a variety}} of mechanisms that may lead to severe damages. These mechanisms still remain unclear and understanding their origins is a new challenge. On that subject, the present work deals with a new full 3 D strategy in order to provide meaningful insights to designers. It involves reduced computational costs and a robust contact methodology able to account for high relative displacements at the contact interface. The first aspect of the problem is addressed through the reduction of the structures using the Craig-Bampton approach. The second one is treated with the use of spline concepts in order to smooth the contact surface and thus, avoid numerical issues. Accordingly, one set of interface nodes belonging to the area where contact is anticipated is defined for each structure. The contact constraints are enforced through a surface spline attached to the interface nodes of the casing. The respective contact forces are calculated using the Lagrange multiplier framework within an explicit time-marching procedure.

40|$|Many {{investigators}} have idealized the oceanic mesoscale eddy field with numerical simulations of geostrophic turbulence forced by a horizontally homogeneous, baroclinically unstable mean flow. To date such studies have employed linear bottom Ekman friction (hereinafter, linear drag). This paper presents simulations of two-layer baroclinically unstable geostrophic turbulence damped by quadratic bottom drag, {{which is generally}} thought to be more realistic. The goals of the paper are 1) to describe the behavior of quadratically damped turbulence as drag strength changes, using previously reported behaviors of linearly damped turbulence {{as a point of}} comparison, and 2) to compare the eddy energies, baroclinicities, and horizontal scales in both quadratic and linear drag simulations with observations and to discuss the constraints these comparisons place on the form and strength of bottom drag in the ocean. In both quadratic and linear drag simulations, large barotropic eddies develop with weak damping, large equivalent barotropic eddies develop with strong damping, and the comparison in goal 2 above is closest when the nondimensional friction strength parameter is of order 1. Typical values of the quadratic drag coefficient (cd 0. 0025) and of boundary layer depths (Hb 50 m) imply that the quadratic friction strength parameter cdLd/Hb, where Ld is the deformation radius, may indeed be of order 1 in the ocean. Model eddies are realistic over a wider range of friction strengths when drag is quadratic, because of a reduced <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>friction</b> strength in that case. The quadratic parameter is independent of the mean shear, in contrast to the linear parameter. Plots of eddy length scales, computed from satellite altimeter data, versus mean shear and versus rough estimates of the friction strength parameters suggest that both linear and quadratic bottom drag may be active in the ocean. Topographic wave drag contains terms that are linear in the bottom flow, thus providing some justification for the use of linear bottom drag in models. <br/...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSea-surface {{temperature}} {{images of}} the coastal upwelling regions off Northwest Africa show that the core of upwelling is sometimes located far from the coast. This has been documented in three regions that share a common feature, namely a wide and shallow continental shelf. This upwelling feature {{plays a key role}} in the ecology of the Canary Current System. It creates an innerfront which provides retention for biological material, e. g. fish eggs and larvae, in the highly productive nearshore environment. An analytical model has been developed based on a two dimensional extension of Ekman's solution. The linear and steady response of a homogeneous ocean forced by an upwelling-favorable wind provides a mechanism for the upwelling separation from the coast. The merging of the surface and bottom Ekman layers induces a very weak cross-shore circulation and a “kinematic barrier” for the Ekman transport divergence. In the case of an alongshore wind, the barrier is located near the isobath h ≈ 0. 4 D, where D is the thickness of Ekman layers. This yields an upwelling cell which is essentially concentrated in the region 0. 5 D < h < 1. 25 D, with upwelling occurring preferentially near the isobath h ≈ 0. 6 D. It turns out that the cross-shore width of upwelling scales with D/S, the ratio of Ekman depth to bottom topographic slope. The application of this solution to real bathymetric profiles rationalizes, not only the offshore upwelling observations in Northwest Africa, but also the influence of topography on the cross-shelf structure of a wind-driven coastal upwelling. The model also quantifies the effect of the cross-shore wind component showing how it drives the nearshore pressure gradient adjustment and how it affects the upwelling. A linear numerical experiment reproduces the theoretical steady solution, thereby allowing investigation of the transient regime. Relaxation of the hypothesis in the numerical model validates the linear assumption of the theory and then allows investigation of the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>friction</b> parameterizations and the influence of stratification. The latter leads to an “oscillation” of the upwelling cell with seaward migration driven by outcropping and homogeneization of the water column, and, coastal incursion driven by a “boundary layers splitting” process caused by shoreward advection of the isopycnal dome and stratification of the inner shelf...|$|E
40|$|This {{body of work}} {{consists}} of two manuscripts related to modeling ocean waves and erosion associated with the 100 -year storm in southern Rhode Island. ^ Predicting the 100 -year storm inundation along the Narragansett Bay shoreline The {{lack of confidence in}} FEMA maps after Hurricane Sandy (2012) led to question the accuracy of the methodology used in FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM). The present analysis presents a case study, re-computing the 100 -year inundation maps in Washington County, RI, using a chain of two-dimensional models. Presented results focus on the West Passage of the Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA, an area characterized by a complex shoreline. The selection of the initial and boundary conditions for ocean wave simulations are based on results of fully coupled 2 -D surge and wave models, the ADvanced CIRCulation model (ADCIRC) and the phase-averaged STeady state spectral WAVE model (STWAVE), respectively, from the North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS) performed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. Waves are simulated using STWAVE over a series of high-resolution grids in near-shore and overland areas. The method {{is referred to as the}} NAST method. Results are mapped and compared with FEMA 2 ̆ 7 s results along transects. Cross-sections across the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) at the site of the FEMA 1 -D transects are in relatively good agreement using both methodologies, with larger discrepancies shown in the northern section of the bay. Discrepancies are primarily due to a difference in the 100 -year wind assumption and secondarily to the 100 -year storm surge assumption, which, besides defining the depth and extension of the inundation, controls the wave impact over land. Mapping the results reinforces the importance of adopting a 2 -D approach to fully represent the inundation, showing that the selected transects often miss the sites of the most extreme wave incursion and most destructive impacts. The analysis highlights the differences in methods and results but also suggests adopting, besides a 2 -D approach, a scenario-based approach to the 100 -year storm rather than a deterministic single map to assess the uncertainty associated with this event. ^ Modeling the erosion associated with the 100 -year storm on the southern Rhode Island coast The erosion due to a synthetic 100 -year storm is modeled on the southern shore of Rhode Island using the process-based morphodynamic model XBeach (Roelvink et al., 2009). The study area includes barrier beaches, coastal ponds, and residential areas. The model is forced using a synthetic storm time series extracted from the North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS; Cialone et al., 2015, Nadal-Caraballo et al., 2015) database, selected as a proxy 100 -year storm. ^ An empirical method (Stockdon et al., 2006; Stockdon et al., 2012) is used to parameterize wave setup, swash, and runup to estimate the erosion impact regime (Sallenger, 2000), using NACCS water levels and offshore wave heights as inputs at seven cross-shore transects within the study area. As the storm is expected to evolve from the collision regime to the overwash and inundation regimes over time, the two-step XBeach model calibration process suggested by Nederhoff (2014) is followed. The first step {{consists of}} adjusting the facua wave skewness/asymmetry parameter to calibrate the collision regime. The second step involves testing the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>friction</b> across the dune to calibrate the overwash regime. The sensitivity of the model to the facua parameter is tested by modeling a historical storm that stayed within the collision regime. Hurricane Irene (August, 2011) is selected and simulated erosion is compared to measured erosion at five cross-shore profiles monitored by the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO). GSO performed measurements and data collection before and after Irene 2 ̆ 7 s impact at the site. For the 100 -year storm, results of four simulation scenarios are presented: the facua parameter is tested for the default and maximum suggested values of 0. 1 and 0. 3, respectively, and the bottom friction is either set to a constant Manning 2 ̆ 7 s n of 0. 02 or a variable Manning 2 ̆ 7 s n bed friction coefficient based on land cover. ^ The resulting eroded dunes for the four simulations are presented in 2 -D maps as well as 1 -D cross-sections at the seven cross-shore locations. Two additional transects to the GSO transects are included, located at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) coastal transect sites that were used to create the 100 -year Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the region. Results are compared at these two sites with FEMAs dune erosion protocol. Additionally, the simulated dune is compared to the generalized barrier profile for a 100 -year storm developed for the region by Oakley (2015). ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the analytical {{properties of the}} solutions of the sensitivity equations for steady-state, two-dimensional shallow water flow. These analytical properties are used to provide guidelines for model calibration and validation. The sensitivity of the water depth/level {{and that of the}} longitudinal unit discharge are shown to contain redundant information. Under subcritical conditions, the sensitivities of the flow variables are shown to obey an anisotropic elliptic equation. The main directions of the contour lines for water depth and the longitudinal unit discharge sensitivity are parallel and perpendicular to the flow, while they are diagonal to the flow for the transverse unit discharge sensitivity. Moreover, the sensitivity for all three variables extends farther in the transverse direction than in the longitudinal direction, the anisotropy ratio being a function of the sole Froude number. For supercritical flow, the sensitivity obeys an anisotropic hyperbolic equation. These findings are confirmed by application examples on idealized and real-world simulations. The <b>sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> the geometry, <b>friction</b> coefficient or model boundary conditions are shown to behave in different ways, thus providing different types of information for model calibration and validation...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{graphene}} oxide (GO) {{on the safety}} characteristics of 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazinane (RDX) was studied in this work. Graphene oxide was prepared and was investigated to form a composite based on GO-RDX by solvent-antisolvent slurry technique. For comparison, different polymer bonded explosives (PBXs) based on RDX bonded by viton A, fluorel or polymethyl-methacrylate binders were studied and designed as RDX-Viton, RDX-Fluorel and RDX-PMMA respectively. <b>Sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> impact and <b>friction</b> of the presented samples {{as well as the}} pure RDX was measured. The ignition temperatures were determined and the activation energies were calculated by using the ignition delay method. Results of x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope proved that RDX crystals were coated by a thin layer of GO. The impact sensitivity of GO-RDX composite is lower than that of the other studied samples while the friction sensitivity is slightly higher. The ignition temperature of GO-RDX was lower than the other studied samples which indicates that the GO caused accumulation of the decomposition gaseous products and accelerated the decomposition process of RDX. GO is an interesting candidate material to be used for coating the explosive crystals instead of the polymeric matrices...|$|R
