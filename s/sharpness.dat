5|$|At its widest aperture, the <b>sharpness</b> {{does not}} meet the 1800 {{threshold}} at either 8mm (1572, f/4.5) or 12mm (1356, f/5), but at 16mm (f/5.6) it achieves over 2000 lines per picture height. However, stopping down improves the <b>sharpness</b> at all focal lengths, according to PC Magazine. At 8mm, 1800 is reached at f/8, while at 12mm it is still only at 1509 by f/8. The image quality is asymmetric with better performance on the right side. At 8mm and f/4.5, it has 1 blur unit in the center and 1.5 in the corners. Although the images are slightly sharper at f/5.6, SLR Gear claims <b>sharpness</b> declines significantly at f/11 to almost 2 blur units with further stopping down increasing blur to 3.5 at f/22. At the longer focal lengths for this lens, stopping down to f/29 yields a 5 blur unit result.|$|E
5|$|The canal had {{links to}} both the Thames and Severn Canal (at Wallbridge) and the Gloucester and <b>Sharpness</b> Canal (at Saul).|$|E
5|$|The River Severn is {{considered}} a navigable river and Gloucester {{used to be an}} important port, with shipping having to deal with the bore. Vessels can ride the tide up from <b>Sharpness</b> to Gloucester. The tide will outstrip the vessel but by timing the journey correctly, a barge can reach Gloucester at high water. Descending is more difficult, and barges often needed to start their descent with one tide, lay up before crossing Longney Sands, and finish the descent at the next tide. These inconveniences in accessing Gloucester were overcome when the Gloucester and <b>Sharpness</b> Canal was opened in 1827, bypassing the need for shipping to use the river to reach Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contractor}} was Hamilston's Windsor Ironworks Company Limited of Garston, Liverpool. They were tasked with the founding and erection {{of the pier}} cylinders on the riverbed, and the erection and riveting of the twenty-one bowstring spans and the swing bridge over the Gloucester and <b>Sharpness</b> Canal. They were also responsible for another swing bridge on the North Docks Branch of the line close to the New Docks at <b>Sharpness.</b> The company manufactured the castings and the wrought iron structures for the bridge. Project manager George Earle was later given a watch praising his ability and enthusiasm for carrying out the project. The engineers for the project were George Wells Owen and George William Keeling.|$|E
5|$|The {{stretch of}} canal from <b>Sharpness</b> to Purton runs {{very close to}} the river. At a high spring tide they were {{separated}} by little more than the width of the towpath. The canal also has no locks, and owing to its width, not even any stop locks. Any damage to the canal bank could thus render the entire canal unnavigable.|$|E
5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The {{eyes are}} {{located at the}} sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflecting}} membrane, {{at the back of the}} retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in <b>sharpness</b> from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).|$|E
5|$|On 25 October 1960, {{in thick}} fog {{and a strong}} tide, two barges (named the Arkendale H and Wastdale H) which had {{overshot}} <b>Sharpness</b> Dock, collided {{with one of the}} columns of the bridge after being carried upstream. Two bridge spans collapsed into the river. As they fell, parts of the structure hit the barges causing the fuel oil and petroleum they were carrying to catch fire. Five people died in the incident.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The <b>sharpness</b> of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{absorption}} {{in carbon}} nanotubes differs from absorption in conventional 3D materials by presence of sharp peaks (1D nanotubes) {{instead of an}} absorption threshold followed by an absorption increase (most 3D solids). Absorption in nanotubes originates from electronic transitions from the v2 to c2 (energy E22) or v1 to c1 (E11) levels, etc. The transitions are relatively sharp {{and can be used}} to identify nanotube types. Note that the <b>sharpness</b> deteriorates with increasing energy, and that many nanotubes have very similar E22 or E11 energies, and thus significant overlap occurs in absorption spectra. This overlap is avoided in photoluminescence mapping measurements (see below), which instead of a combination of overlapped transitions identifies individual (E22,E11) pairs.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Railway Bridge (historically {{called the}} Severn Bridge) was a bridge {{carrying}} the railway across the River Severn between <b>Sharpness</b> and Lydney, Gloucestershire. It {{was built in}} the 1870s by the Severn Bridge Railway Company, primarily to carry coal from the Forest of Dean to the docks at Sharpness; at that time it was the furthest downstream bridge over the Severn. The company was taken over in 1893 by the Great Western Railway and the Midland Railway Companies when it got into financial difficulties. The bridge continued to be used for freight and passenger services until 1960, and saw temporary extra traffic on the occasions that the Severn Tunnel was closed for engineering work.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{viewpoints}} from which the bore can be seen; viewers do not have to restrict themselves to these because most of the river banks and floodbanks are public footpaths. Crowds often assemble at popular viewing points and car parking may prove difficult. Related to the time of the high tide at <b>Sharpness,</b> the bore passes Newnham on Severn one hour before this, Framilode and Arlingham, twenty-five minutes before, Epney twenty minutes before, Minsterworth at the high tide, Stonebench, on the east bank, fifteen minutes after the high tide and Over Bridge thirty-five minutes afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Through their {{acquisition}} of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment's pre-1996 film library catalogue, MGM released {{a special edition}} of the film on October 2, 2001, which included documentaries, the script, and advertisements for the film. On January 23, 2001, a Hong Kong VCD edition was released online. On June 20, 2006, the film was released on Blu-ray through Sony in the United States. In late 2012, the film was re-released on Blu-ray, this time with a transfer by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, which features improved <b>sharpness</b> compared to Sony's 2006 Blu-ray, and revised color grading, as well as expanded extra material, such as deleted scenes and a making-of feature.|$|E
5|$|A second bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the {{connection}} from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and <b>Sharpness</b> Canal at Saul was rejected in 2007. This section presents some engineering challenges, {{as it was}} severed by {{the construction of the}} M5 motorway and the A38 road. The roundabout where the A38 joins the A419 road was built over Bristol Road Lock, and part of the route was destroyed by flood relief work for the River Frome. At Stonehouse, the bridge carrying the Bristol and Gloucester Railway {{has been replaced by a}} culvert, but a bid has been made to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board for its reinstatement, and to create a long-distance footpath along the route. Outside of the main restoration, the Cotswold Canals Trust are gradually restoring many of the other structures, with the ultimate goal of re-opening a link between the River Thames and the River Severn.|$|E
5|$|Bores {{are present}} on about 130 {{days in the}} year, {{concentrated}} on the days immediately following the new and full moon. The size and precise timing of the bore depend on {{such things as the}} time of high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, the amount of water coming down the river and how well scoured the main drainage channels are. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen, or viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, the bore has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by the construction of an alternative route, the Gloucester and <b>Sharpness</b> Canal, which opened in 1827. Nowadays the bore is of more interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.|$|E
5|$|In 1794, a basin {{was built}} above Framilode lock, so that vessels could wait {{there until the}} tide in the Severn was at a {{suitable}} level. This had been requested by the Thames and Severn Canal company, but requests for a horse towing path in 1799 and 1812 were dismissed as too expensive. They eventually provided one after the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal had been built, and the canal was {{the only part of}} the waterway from Shrewsbury on the Severn to Teddington on the Thames that did not have one. It was completed in August 1827. The opening of the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal in 1825 required a slight diversion where they crossed at Saul, and the levels were adjusted by building a new lock on the Stroudwater below the junction, to ensure neither company lost water to the other. The new company paid for its construction.> After the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal opened to <b>Sharpness</b> in 1827, the link between Saul and the Severn at Framilode was used much less, although coal from the Forest of Dean still used that route.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 2009, the new South Ferry station opened, {{replacing}} the original loop station. The loop station could only accommodate {{the first five}} cars of a train and required the use of gap fillers because of the <b>sharpness</b> of the loop curve. The new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station. The newer station {{does not have a}} connection to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and is underneath the loop station. The MTA claimed that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's trip time and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour, as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour with the loop station. This was the first new station to open since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{miniature}} towers bear finer {{and more}} elegant details, indicating that architectural ideas traveled fast {{from the north}} to the south. Decoration and ornamentation had evolved from a moulded form to a chiseled form, the <b>sharpness</b> sometimes giving it a three-dimensional effect. The foliage decorations changed from bulky to thin, and {{a change in the}} miniature towers on dual pilasters is seen. The 11th century miniatures consisted of a cornice (kapota), a floor (vyalamala), a balustrade (vedika) and a roof (kuta) with a voluptuous moulding, while in the 12th century, detailed dravida miniature towers with many tiny tiers (tala) came into vogue. Some 12th-century temples such as the Kallesvara Temple at Hirehadagalli have miniature towers that do not stand on pilasters but instead are supported by balconies, which have niches underneath that normally contain an image of a deity.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} idea was based around {{the premise of}} creating a town like those found in a role-playing game. The team chose the design elements of a fractured, floating world due to their wish to portray a sky in the game, which is usually not possible with an isometric camera, as it always points down. They also wanted to forgo a map system, and felt that having the ground {{come up to the}} Kid allowed the player to easily see without a map where they had already been in a level. The story of the Calamity was created as a way to explain this game mechanic. Jen Zee developed the art style of the game to express beauty in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The hand-painted style was intended to soften the <b>sharpness</b> she saw as typical in isometric games and the colorless, harsh depictions of most devastated landscapes. Zee was inspired by the pixel art landscapes of earlier Japanese isometric games.|$|E
5|$|In the lower, broader {{part of the}} estuary near Avonmouth, {{the tidal}} surge {{advances}} as a slight roll in the deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past <b>Sharpness,</b> the bore begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to {{the eastern side of}} the river. Above Langney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to a hundred yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of a foot or so.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The <b>sharpness</b> of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} of the {{restoration}} project will be the section from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and <b>Sharpness</b> Canal at Saul, which has been blocked by both the M5 motorway and the A38 road. A bid was submitted to the Living Landmarks Fund in August 2006. This is part of the Big Lottery Fund, and £16 million was requested. An interim award of £250,000 was made, to allow the bid to be developed, but the application was rejected in November 2007. Despite this setback, money for purchasing the land around the M5 and the A38 was part of the phase 1 grant by the HLF. Current proposals for the A38 involve tunnelling under the Whitminster roundabout. The original Bristol Road Lock was buried by the construction of the roundabout, and will be reconstructed to the east of it. There are two proposals for passing under the M5 motorway. One is for a new channel alongside the River Frome through an existing culvert, and the other is for a new wider culvert, nearer to the original line of the canal. Below this, the canal used to cross the River Frome at Lockham Aqueduct, but this was demolished in the 1970s, when the canal and river channel were combined as part of a flood defence scheme.|$|E
25|$|The Gloucester and <b>Sharpness</b> Canal {{connects the}} Severn at Gloucester to the Severn at <b>Sharpness,</b> {{avoiding}} {{a stretch of}} the tidal river which is dangerous to navigate. The Stroudwater Navigation used to join the tidal Severn at Framilode, but since the 1920s has connected to the Severn only via the Gloucester and <b>Sharpness</b> Canal.|$|E
25|$|Post-capture {{manipulation}} of the image is ignored. Sharpening via techniques such as deconvolution or unsharp mask can increase the apparent <b>sharpness</b> in the final image; conversely, image noise reduction can reduce <b>sharpness.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{a matter}} of performance, lenses often do not perform optimally when fully opened, and thus {{generally}} have better <b>sharpness</b> when stopped down some– note that this is <b>sharpness</b> in the plane of critical focus, setting aside issues of depth of field. Beyond a certain point, there is no further <b>sharpness</b> benefit to stopping down, and the diffraction begins to become significant. There is accordingly a sweet spot, generally in the 4– 8 range, depending on lens, where <b>sharpness</b> is optimal, though some lenses are designed to perform optimally when wide open. How significant this varies between lenses, and opinions differ on how much practical impact this has.|$|E
25|$|If {{the camera}} {{position}} and image framing (i.e., angle of view) have been chosen, {{the only means}} of controlling DOF is the lens aperture. Most DOF formulas imply that any arbitrary DOF can be achieved by using a sufficiently large f-number. Because of diffraction, however, this isn't really true. Once a lens is stopped down to where most aberrations are well corrected, stopping down further will decrease <b>sharpness</b> in the plane of focus. At the DOF limits, however, further stopping down decreases the size of the defocus blur spot, and the overall <b>sharpness</b> may still increase. Eventually, the defocus blur spot becomes negligibly small, and further stopping down serves only to decrease <b>sharpness</b> even at DOF limits (Gibson 1975, 64). There is thus a tradeoff between <b>sharpness</b> in the POF and <b>sharpness</b> at the DOF limits. But the <b>sharpness</b> in the POF is always greater than that at the DOF limits; if the blur at the DOF limits is imperceptible, the blur in the POF is imperceptible as well.|$|E
25|$|From 1879 {{until its}} {{collapse}} in 1960 the Severn Railway Bridge also carried trains across the Severn from <b>Sharpness</b> to Lydney.|$|E
25|$|For general photography, {{diffraction}} at DOF limits typically becomes significant only at {{fairly large}} f-numbers; because large f-numbers typically require long exposure times, motion blur may cause greater loss of <b>sharpness</b> than the loss from diffraction. The {{size of the}} diffraction blur spot depends on the effective f-number , however, so diffraction is a greater issue in close-up photography, and the tradeoff between DOF and overall <b>sharpness</b> can become quite noticeable (Gibson 1975, 53; Lefkowitz 1979, 84).|$|E
25|$|A curious {{phenomenon}} {{associated with}} the lower reaches of the Severn is the tidal bore, which forms somewhat upstream of the port of <b>Sharpness.</b>|$|E
25|$|For digital capture {{with color}} filter array sensors, demosaicing is ignored. Demosaicing alone would {{normally}} decrease <b>sharpness,</b> but the demosaicing algorithm used might also include sharpening.|$|E
25|$|As the pinhole is made smaller, {{the image}} gets sharper, but the {{projected}} image becomes dimmer. With too small a pinhole, however, the <b>sharpness</b> worsens, due to diffraction.|$|E
25|$|For , the far {{limit of}} DOF is at {{infinity}} and the DOF is infinite; of course, only objects at or beyond the near limit of DOF will be recorded with acceptable <b>sharpness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In winemaking, a {{bacterial}} process, natural or controlled, {{is often used}} to convert the naturally present malic acid to lactic acid, to reduce the <b>sharpness</b> and for other flavor-related reasons. This malolactic fermentation is undertaken by the family of lactic acid bacteria.|$|E
25|$|When four-valved models {{without any}} kind of {{compensation}} play in the corresponding register, the <b>sharpness</b> becomes so severe that players must finger the note a half-step below the one {{they are trying to}} play. This eliminates the note a half-step above their open fundamental.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{rotating}} the POF {{can better}} fit the DOF to the scene, and achieve the required <b>sharpness</b> at a smaller f-number. Alternatively, rotating the POF, {{in combination with}} a small f-number, can minimize the part of an image that is within the DOF.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}}s of the imaging medium and the display medium are ignored. If {{the resolution of}} either medium is of the same order of magnitude as the optical resolution, the <b>sharpness</b> of the final image is reduced, and optical blurring is harder to detect.|$|E
25|$|If {{the final}} image is viewed under normal {{conditions}} (e.g., an 8″×10″ image viewed at 10″), it may suffice {{to determine the}} f-number using criteria for minimum required <b>sharpness,</b> {{and there may be}} no practical benefit from further reducing the size of the blur spot. But this may not be true if the final image is viewed under more demanding conditions, e.g., a very large final image viewed at normal distance, or a portion of an image enlarged to normal size (Hansma 1996). Hansma also suggests that the final-image size may not be known when a photograph is taken, and obtaining the maximum practicable <b>sharpness</b> allows the decision to make a large final image to be made at a later time.|$|E
