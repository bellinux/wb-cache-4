60|$|The {{recollection}} of Bill's performance stimulated Miss Leonard into a temporary wakefulness, and <b>she</b> <b>giggled.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>giggled</b> as she {{scraped the}} loaf. Even Miriam laughed {{in spite of}} herself. Paul mended the fire ruefully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{whatever}} I am, {{remember you}} are my wife; we were married an hour since, {{in the presence of}} all these witnesses." [...] <b>She</b> <b>giggled,</b> and her colour rose.|$|E
5000|$|At the feast, Domenica Baccalieri cries, {{anxious to}} go on the tea cup ride again. As an exasperated Janice looks on, Tony placates Nica, picking her up into his arms, {{swinging}} her around as <b>she</b> <b>giggles</b> and laughs.|$|R
50|$|Back in the garden, {{the devil}} and Jerry realize Tom's going to serenade his new girlfriend. The devil asks Jerry if he can take that again after what {{happened}} in 1946's Solid Serenade, when Tom kept disturbing Jerry by serenading another girl. The devil sends Jerry {{on his way to}} stir up trouble armed with a hatpin, a mini TNT and some matches. Jerry marches towards Tom and the beautiful female cat. While he is marching, he suddenly spots a pretty female mouse and immediately becomes smitten with love for her, imitating a dog expressing fondness after <b>she</b> <b>giggles.</b> The devil, frustrated, laments that whenever a pretty lady comes into his life, it means trouble for him. Just then, he suddenly spots a beautiful female devil, quickly changes his mind and soon falls in love with her, imitating a dog expressing fondness as <b>she</b> <b>giggles</b> as the cartoon faded out.|$|R
5000|$|Pam - A girl at Janet's school. Her {{best friend}} is Barbara and <b>she</b> <b>giggles</b> a lot. <b>She</b> is also good friends with Janet. Her full first name is Pamela. She {{sometimes}} proves herself a worthy member of the Secret Seven by getting brainwaves, but is sometimes careless, such as yelling out the password and squealing when Peter was nearly pushed out of their [...] "secret" [...] treehouse.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she began}} to repent very much indeed, because she knew the value of money. Still, it was {{probable}} that the blind man was overestimating {{the value of his}} work. Gentlemen, she knew, were absurdly particular about their things. <b>She</b> <b>giggled</b> as a nervous housemaid giggles when she tries to explain the breakage of a pipe.|$|E
60|$|She was a {{nice little}} thing, very shy and timid, {{but by no means}} unpresentable, and an evident lady. <b>She</b> <b>giggled</b> {{at the end of every}} sentence; and she was endowed with a slight squint, which somehow seemed to point all her feeble sallies. She knew little outside South Africa; but of that she talked prettily; and she won all our hearts, in spite of the cast in her eye, by her {{unaffected}} simplicity.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{had reached}} the {{interesting}} age of sixteen. She was plain, decidedly, but sweet-tempered in the extreme. Her mouth was good, {{and her eyes were}} good, and her colour was good, but her nose was a snub,-- an undeniable and incurable snub. Her mother had tried to amend it from the earliest hours of Lucy's existence by pulling the point gently downwards and pinching up the bridge,--or, rather, the hollow where the bridge ought to have been,--but all in vain; the infant turned up its eyes when the operation was going on, and still turned up its nose when it was over. Yes, although there were many of the elements of beauty about Lucy, she was plain--but sweet; always bear that in mind. She was funny too. Not that she made fun of her own free will; but she appreciated fun in others so intensely that she looked funny herself; and <b>she</b> <b>giggled.</b> This was her only fault, <b>she</b> <b>giggled.</b> When the spirit of fun was roused, nothing could stop her. But don't suppose that she was always giggling; by no means. She was always good and amiable, often grave, and sometimes deeply serious.|$|E
5000|$|Mr Slocum (slow come) squeezes Maddy {{into his}} car: [...] "I’m coming, Mrs Rooney, I’m coming, give me time, I’m as stiff as yourself." [...] She makes sexual innuendos {{that she is}} in a compromising position. <b>She</b> <b>giggles</b> and shouts in delight when she finally gets in the car and Slocum is left panting in exhaustion. The sexual {{connotation}} is continued when her dress is ripped in the door. As if actually guilty of adultery, Maddy wonders what her husband will say when he discovers the tear in her dress.|$|R
5000|$|After {{television}} work stopped trickling in, Kelsey {{returned to}} her native Twin Cities area, where she has continued her career in regional theater productions, memorably {{in the title role}} of Mary Stuart at the Park Square Theater, a performance for which Talkin' Broadway described her as [...] "beautiful, feminine, determined and regal throughout, even when <b>she's</b> <b>giggling</b> with her lady-in-waiting. She affects every man who comes to see her." [...] In 2009, she revisited her television past, playing Sue Ann Nivens for a week in a Minneapolis theatre company's restaging of The Mary Tyler Moore Show scripts, including the episode in which she originally appeared.|$|R
50|$|Soon after, <b>she</b> began <b>giggling</b> during Mass and, by April, {{her mental}} state {{deteriorated}} {{and the doctors}} at the local psychiatric hospital diagnosed her disease as schizophrenia and, after a two-week treatment, they released her into {{the care of the}} monastery.|$|R
60|$|Myrtle Cass appeared, with Cy Bogart. <b>She</b> <b>giggled</b> {{and bounced}} when Cy tickled her ear in village love. They strolled with the half-dancing gait of lovers, kicking their feet out {{sideways}} or shuffling a dragging jig, and the concrete walk sounded to the broken two-four rhythm. Their voices had a dusky turbulence. Suddenly, {{to the woman}} rocking {{on the porch of}} the doctor's house, the night came alive, and she felt that everywhere in the darkness panted an ardent quest which she was missing as she sank back to wait for----There must be something.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fifteen years," [...] she answered. [...] "I was a {{bit older}} than 'im. But I've never looked my age, they tell me. Lord, what a boy 'e was! Swept you off your feet, like. 'E wasn't the only one. I'd got a way with me, I suppose. Anyhow, the men seemed to think so. There was always a few 'anging about. Like flies round a 'oney-pot, Mother used to say." [...] <b>She</b> <b>giggled.</b> [...] "But 'e wouldn't take No for an answer. And I didn't {{want to give it}} 'im, neither. I was gone on 'im, right enough. No use saying I wasn't." ...|$|E
60|$|Vera, finding {{herself for}} the first time in {{distinguished}} company, which desired to set her at ease, began to be at ease, and to desire to shine, so <b>she</b> <b>giggled</b> whenever she perceived the slightest excuse, even when Lord Ivinghoe handed her the eggs, and, hoped she had not too British an appetite for French eggs; and Lady Ivinghoe asked if she had seen the fowls, and whether their feathers were ruffled up like a hen's that had been given to Aunt Cherry. Her little sister Joan, she added, had asked whether eating the eggs would make her hair curl.|$|E
50|$|Babee: Buzzbee and Rubee's baby sister. <b>She</b> {{loves to}} <b>giggle</b> {{and play with}} her sister and brother.|$|R
5000|$|Gin follows Hache to a {{gas station}} and when {{he goes into the}} store, she accidentally hits his bike. He picks it up and asks her what has he done to her. While <b>giggling</b> <b>she</b> {{explains}} to him that the motorcycle was in front and accidentally fell. She begs him to give her the keys back and threatens to call the police, he turns around and tells her to call the police to see if her situation will get better. He walks to her car and locks all the doors so she can't get in. On their way she asks him his name and he tells her [...] "Hache" [...] which is the letter [...] "H" [...] in Spanish. <b>She</b> <b>giggles</b> and questions him what real name is behind the letter, by mentioning a few. He answers with Hugo to which she thinks is an appealing name. On the other hand, when she is asked about hers she says that is Gin derived from Ginebra, to which he laughs and mocks her once more.|$|R
60|$|Honora, {{in spite}} of her discomfort, had an insane desire to <b>giggle.</b> <b>She</b> did not dare to raise her eyes.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a little}} too obvious. Nora's cousin from the country, a very nice and estimable person in her way, was not equal to the occasion. She wore her ill-fitting clothes without grace or confidence. <b>She</b> <b>giggled</b> repeatedly, and her eyes seldom left Jacob's, as though all the time she were bidding for his approval. She was just well enough looking and no more, the sort of woman who would have looked almost pretty on her wedding day, a little dowdy most of the time during the next five years, and either a drudge or a {{nuisance}} afterwards, according to her circumstances. Jacob was very polite and very glad when the evening was over. His host wrung his hand as they parted.|$|E
60|$|Tom paused as Polly spoke, evidently {{ashamed of}} himself; but his temper was up, {{and he would}} n't give in. If Polly had cried a little just here, he would have yielded; {{unfortunately}} <b>she</b> <b>giggled,</b> for Tom's fierce attitude was such a funny contrast to his dress that she could n't help it. That settled the matter. No girl that ever lived should giggle at him, much less lock him up like a small child. Without a word, he made a grab at Polly's arm, for the hand holding the key was still in her, pocket. With her other hand she clutched her frock, and for a minute held on stoutly. But Tom's strong fingers were irresistible; rip went the pocket, out came the hand, and with a cry of pain from Polly, the key fell on the floor.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{three days}} in Bombay were uneventful; we merely waited {{to get rid of}} the roll of the ship, which {{continued}} to haunt us for hours after we landed--the floor of our bedrooms having acquired an ugly trick of rising in long undulations, as if Bombay were suffering from chronic earthquake. We made the acquaintance of His Honour the Acting Governor, and His Honour's consort. We were also introduced to Mrs. Balmossie, the lady who was to chaperon us to Moozuffernuggar. Her husband was a soldierly Scotchman from Forfarshire, but she herself was English--a flighty little body with a perpetual giggle. <b>She</b> <b>giggled</b> so much over the idea of the Maharajah's inviting us to his palace that I wondered why on earth she accepted his invitation. At this she seemed surprised. 'Why, it's one of the jolliest places in Rajputana,' she answered, with a bland Simla smile; 'so picturesque--he, he, he--and so delightful. Simpkin flows like water-- Simpkin's baboo English for champagne, you know--he, he, he; and though of course the Maharajah's only a native like the rest of them--he, he, he--still, he's been educated at Oxford, and has mixed with Europeans, and he knows how to make one--he, he, he--well, thoroughly comfortable.' ...|$|E
60|$|Julia <b>giggled.</b> <b>She</b> did {{not know}} where the cab was going, and she {{certainly}} did not care. She was thoroughly enjoying herself.|$|R
6000|$|And yet she {{retained}} her dignity. She did {{not grow}} silly nor hysterical as a lesser woman might have done. She was tremulous with happiness and wonder, but she sat before him mistress {{of her hands}} and voice. Her very laughter pleased him; if she had giggled--heavens, if <b>she</b> had <b>giggled!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|With {{pity for}} his bewilderment, {{and a certain}} desire to <b>giggle,</b> <b>she</b> consoled him, [...] "Then let's try some Tennyson. You've read him?" ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile her manners changed. She became absent-minded, {{and seemed}} sullen and haughty to her companions at times. <b>She</b> never <b>giggled</b> {{like the rest}} of the girls. She had fine teeth, and yet her smile was infrequent. She laughed when {{occasion}} demanded, and laughed heartily, but she was not easily stirred to laughter.|$|R
50|$|Sulley {{has brought}} Boo back to Monstropolis {{in hopes that}} she will join in the {{flashlight}} festivities. Although {{it seems as if}} Boo is interested, <b>she</b> <b>giggles</b> naughtily, intending to go exploring rather than playing. Sulley warns her not to go off too far, but Boo simply responds by giggling. Turning a corner, guests find that Randall has returned from the human world, determined to capture Boo to extract her scream, via the usage of a butterfly net. Randall's evil laugh still echoes through the factory, the vehicles turn and face a window overlooking all of Monstropolis at nightfall. Mike stands nearby at the switch of a power generator, that supposedly gives power to all of Monstropolis. Mike kicks a flashlight tag off by turning off the generator, causing the entire factory and the city to go dark.|$|R
50|$|Several {{twists and}} turns follow, but finally the murders are solved just after the show ends. In the last scene, Nancy (Wing), a squeaky pretty blonde showgirl, finally gets to tell Ellery and Murdock what she has {{attempted}} to tell Ellery several times throughout the show. However, he kept putting her off, she {{was just trying to}} gain his attention, and he was too busy staging the show. She actually had a vital piece of information that would have solved the first murder much sooner, and might have prevented the second murder. Now that the show is over and a success, Ellery's attention is finally on her, and they go out for the night to celebrate. <b>She</b> <b>giggles</b> once again and moves off stage left in front of him, and then Oakie breaks the fourth wall just momentarily, looking into the camera with a devilish grin, before he follows her.|$|R
50|$|We {{then see}} Nicole {{in her black}} and peach bikini lying down on the sand. Her lover is filming her from above. Nicole then is seen semi nude, with her hands {{covering}} her breasts. Then she is seen playing around with her lover in the sea. They splash around and Nicole then is seen {{on the edge of}} the boat, in a blue dress. More semi nude appearances follow. But then we return to the bed, which was seen at the start. Nicole is now kneeling on top of her boyfriend, in her white bra and panties. She sings to him whilst he strokes her hips and touches the sides of her panties. She then leans down to kiss his cheek softly. He kisses her arm. The video ends with Scherzinger making one final semi nude appearance, covering her breasts with her hands. <b>She</b> <b>giggles</b> and the scene fades.|$|R
60|$|In his horror he {{attempted}} to laugh, but the laugh ended in a weakly <b>giggle.</b> <b>She</b> was more woman than girl by this time, and realized his feeling.|$|R
50|$|Joan awakens {{in a hotel}} room. She takes {{a shower}} and a bullet scar {{can be seen on}} her shoulder. In a flashback, a police officer shoots a rifle. Bill knocks and tells Joan the reason he picked her up is because she reminds him of someone. He invites her to have dinner with him at the {{restaurant}} next door, where he shows Joan a picture of Rose, who is revealed to be his daughter. Joan excuses herself and goes to the bathroom where <b>she</b> <b>giggles</b> and has a memory of killing a woman and stealing her identification card. Joan sees Bill talking to a cop and steals a knife from a bus tray. Bill tells her they have to hit the road to beat an impending storm and Joan goes to the car where Linda is waiting. Linda tells Joan that Bill sees Rose in every young girl but that she doesn't see Rose in Joan at all.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he heard}} the man {{speaking}} in the twilight, and, doglike, understood that his trouble stood off from him--"Allah is good, Binkie. Not quite so gentle as we could wish, but we'll discuss that later. I think I see my way to it now. All those studies of Bessie's head were nonsense, and they nearly brought your master into a scrape. I hold the notion now as clear as crystal, 'the Melancolia that transcends all wit.' There shall be Maisie in that head, because I shall never get Maisie; and Bess, of course, because she knows all about Melancolia, though she doesn't know she knows; and there shall be some drawing in it, and it shall all {{end up with a}} laugh. That's for myself. Shall <b>she</b> <b>giggle</b> or grin? No, she shall laugh right out of the canvas, and every man and woman that ever had a sorrow of their own shall--what is it the poem says?- - ...|$|R
5000|$|Mariola Rebeka Kiepska (Barbara Mularczyk): Walduś’ 17-year-old sister. Like Bud Bundy she is {{the most}} well {{adjusted}} of her family. She is a typical teenager and likes to spend time outside the house - this usually involves going somewhere with her boyfriend Łysy ('bald'). She is typically perverted- usually when a guest comes over, she will turn the topic toward sex, and after the topic change <b>she</b> will typically <b>giggle.</b> (<b>She</b> is usually ignored though. She was debuted in the first episode first - Umarł odbiornik, niech żyje odbiornik! (TV is dead, long live the TV!) ...|$|R
60|$|When the {{collection}} arrived {{with the last}} hymn, her cousin was again singing resoundingly. And still it amused her. In spite of the shameful exhibition she had made of herself, it amused her still. She listened to it in a spell of amusement. And the bag was thrust in front of her, and her sixpence was mingled {{in the folds of}} her glove. In her haste to get it out, it flipped away and went twinkling in the next pew. <b>She</b> stood and <b>giggled.</b> <b>She</b> could not help it: she laughed outright, a figure of shame.|$|R
60|$|That was all, and {{he wished}} <b>she</b> had not <b>giggled</b> {{most of the}} time. She was sniggering, as if she thought him a very funny boy, even when he rang the bell and bolted.|$|R
50|$|Tuffy {{tries to}} call for the cat but to no avail. He tries to persuade Jerry that Tom was here, but Jerry brings {{him back to his}} mousehole and punishes Tuffy by getting him to write 'Un mouseketeer est brave' {{approximately}} 100 times on a blackboard. Then Tuffy goes to the door and holds his hat out. It gets chopped into pieces by Tom. Tuffy then nervously peeks out, but Jerry, annoyed by Tuffy having not delivered his letter to Lilli yet because of his cowardice, pokes him on the back with his sword, sending Tuffy rocketing past Tom to Lilli's house. He knocks on the windowsill. Lilli comes to the window and sees the love letter. <b>She</b> <b>giggles</b> while reading it, then disappears and returns with another letter with perfume on it. Tuffy then goes to deliver it to Jerry. But to see if Tom is around, he puts his hat on his sword and waves it. Tom waves his hat and then appears and fights Tuffy again.|$|R
5000|$|Alice {{received}} severe backlash {{from news}} outlets and online commenters, with several observing {{that she had}} disrespected and [...] "butchered" [...] the anthem, dubbing the rendition an [...] "absolute disaster" [...] and [...] "one of the worst attempts in recent memory" [...] and criticizing her singing in general. Alice later tweeted that the reason <b>she</b> had <b>giggled</b> was because <b>she</b> had seen some fellow Canadians {{on the big screen}} and was [...] "overcome with excitement." ...|$|R
