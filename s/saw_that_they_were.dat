5|$|At {{the age of}} 75, Isaac {{moved to}} Beer-lahai-roi after his father died. When the land {{experienced}} famine, he removed to the Philistine land of Gerar where his father once lived. This land was still {{under the control of}} King Abimelech {{as it was in the}} days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back to all of the wells that his father dug and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to Beersheba, where he made a pact with Abimelech, just like in the day of his father.|$|E

When daylight came Schmitt and his group <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> surrounded by North Koreans. One force occupied the higher knob half a mile above them, formerly held by B Company. Below them, North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units, some of them already several miles eastward. The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force Manchu group. They first attacked it at 14:00 that afternoon, and were repulsed. That night an estimated company attacked three times, pressing the fight to close quarters, but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter. Daylight of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter.|$|E

25|$|After about a month, Yang Zhao {{failed to}} {{overcome}} Lu Kang and {{had run out}} of ideas so he withdrew his army on one night. Lu Kang wanted to pursue the enemy but he was worried that Bu Chan (who was still inside Xiling) might use the opportunity to attack him from behind, and he did not have enough troops with him. He then ordered his men to beat the drums and pretend to prepare to attack Yang Zhao's retreating forces. When Yang Zhao's men <b>saw</b> <b>that,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> so terrified that they abandoned their armour and equipment and fled. Lu Kang sent a small group of lightly-armed soldiers to pursue Yang Zhao and they inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy. Yang Hu and the other Jin generals withdrew their armies after receiving news of Yang Zhao's defeat. Lu Kang then attacked and conquered Xiling. Bu Chan, along with his family and high-ranking officers, were executed for treason, while the others, numbering over 10,000, were pardoned after Lu Kang made a request to the Wu court. Lu Kang then had Xiling's fortifications repaired before returning east to Yue District (樂鄉). He remained humble after his victory in Xiling and still behaved {{in the same manner as}} he did before. His humility earned him the respect and favour of his men.|$|E

When God asked the woman what she had done, she replied that the serpent duped her, and she ate.

2500|$|During Guo Yuan's {{tenure in}} Wei Commandery, {{there was an}} {{incident}} where an anonymous person wrote libelous pamphlets and circulated them. Cao Cao, who hated defamatory behaviour, ordered Guo Yuan to investigate and find out who the culprit was. Guo Yuan kept the pamphlets and ordered his subordinates to keep it secret. After examining the pamphlets, he realised that they contained lines from the two [...] "Metropolis Rhapsodies". He instructed one of his subordinates: [...] "Wei Commandery is a big commandery. Even {{though it is a}} capital city, there are few scholars living here. These pamphlets can serve as something for the young to study. I want you to find three persons to study under the scholars." [...] After his subordinate found him three young men, Guo Yuan told them, [...] "You still have much to learn. The two [...] "Metropolis Rhapsodies" [...] are important works of literature, yet they are often neglected and very few scholars understand them. You should find a scholar who understands the two [...] "Metropolis Rhapsodies" [...] and ask him to teach you." [...] He then secretly gave them other instructions. The three men found a scholar who was well-versed in the two [...] "Metropolis Rhapsodies", got him to write an article, and passed it to Guo Yuan. Guo Yuan compared the scholar's handwriting with the handwriting in the pamphlets and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> similar.

2500|$|During the 15th century {{opinion was}} more evenly split {{as to the}} nature of the Pyramids. [...] An {{anonymous}} traveler in 1420 speaks of going [...] "to see the most marvelous fourteen granaries of Pharaoh, five or six miles distant from Cairo." [...] He continues, [...] "you must cross the river Nile that flows from the Earthly Paradise ... and from the top [...] there is a good view of the very large city of Cairo. [...] But there, around these granaries, there is such a great colony of rats that it sometimes seems as if they cover the entire ground." [...] In 1436 the Spaniard Pero Tafur visited and left a rather fanciful account: [...] "We went to see the Granaries of Joseph, which are three leagues from the mouth of the river, in the desert. Although they say that there are many more further inland, there are only three here, two great ones, and one lesser one. They are diamond shaped, with the apex raised, and they must be much higher than the Great Tower at Seville. As one enters through the door there is a wall joined to another, making a circular stairway which reaches to the top, with many windows. And the beasts, when they are laden, climb up and are unloaded through those windows, and so they fill the granaries to the top. [...] Certainly I never thought that there was such a great building in the world to-day, nor have I seen the like before or since." [...] Another curious interpretation was offered by Georges Lengherand, Mayor of Mons, who visited in 1486: [...] "These granaries are very marvelous buildings and there used to be fourteen and now there are only six or seven. [...] It is impossible to enter, and they are all of dressed stone ... and are in the manner of a hill ... And while we were there, we found four wolves asleep on the stones ... And around these granaries are small little chambers, several cut into the rock; I do not know what could be their use, unless at the time theses granaries were in existence there were guards in these little chambers." [...] The German traveler Arnold von Harff paid a visit in 1497 and left a fairly objective report: [...] "We went across the Nile to these three Kassa Pharaonis. [...] As we approached near these three towers we <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> very strange buildings ... We climbed up outside for three full hours to the top, which is about two roods square. [...] From there we saw far out over the whole of the land of Egypt, and over the country to Alexandria and the western sea ... They say that King Pharaoh caused the towers to be built during the lean years, and kept them full of corn. [...] That is why they are called the Kassa Pharaonis. [...] But I could find no entrance. [...] Some say that they are the tombs of the old kings of Egypt." ...|$|E
