D.), Department of Plant Pathology, Washington State UniversityThe {{maritime}} Pacific Northwest is {{the only}} region of the USA suitable for production of <b>spinach</b> <b>seed,</b> a cool-season, daylength-sensitive crop. However, the acidic soils of this region are highly conducive to spinach Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae. Rotations of 10 to 15 years between <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> crops are necessary {{to reduce the risk}} of losses to this disease. Raising soil pH with limestone partially suppresses spinach Fusarium wilt, but the suppressive effect is transitory, and the disease still limits seed crop acreage in the region. Experiments were conducted to: 1) assess the potential for annual applications of limestone for three years prior to a <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> crop to improve Fusarium wilt suppression compared to the level of suppression from a single limestone amendment, 2) develop a soil-based greenhouse bioassay to characterize the spinach Fusarium wilt risk of soil samples submitted from stakeholders' fields, and 3) explore the mechanism(s) of limestone-mediated Fusarium wilt suppression. Annual applications of limestone for each of three years prior to a <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> crop were superior to a single limestone application for suppressing Fusarium wilt and increasing seed yield. A soil bioassay to assess Fusarium wilt risk was developed in which three spinach lines representing a range in Fusarium wilt susceptibility were used to test soil samples from growers' fields under consideration for <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> crops. In the four years that the soil bioassay has been offered as a risk assessment service, soil samples from 147 fields were submitted by stakeholders for evaluation. Follow-up visits to <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> crops planted in fields assessed with the soil bioassay validated the results. In vitro experiments demonstrated that deficiencies of iron, manganese, and zinc can reduce growth and sporulation of F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae. Furthermore, greenhouse experiments in naturally-infested field soil indicated that reduction in availability of these micronutrients in limestone-amended soils reduced Fusarium wilt inoculum potential. Together, these findings reveal relationships among soil properties and spinach Fusarium wilt development, increase the capacity for and profitability of USA <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> production, and will guide future research on soil-based management of this disease.  Department of Plant Pathology, Washington State Universit...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGermination {{is a short}} {{developmental}} process {{during which}} many new proteins are synthesised. We have chosen the previously characterised RPL 21 gene encoding plastid-localised ribosomal proteins RPL 21, to analyse activation of gene expression during germination. Transcription activation occurs at the P 1 promoter during the first hours following imbibition and coincides {{with the appearance of}} a trans-acting factor that we named AUBE 1. AUBE 1 binds specifically to a short DNA fragment that encompasses the P 1 promoter of the RPL 21 gene. The protein has a size of 28 – 30 kDa and is transiently expressed during the early phase of germination. Using the properties of primed seeds we show that AUBE 1 is maintained after desiccation of primed seeds. We conclude that AUBE 1 {{can be used as a}} marker in <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> priming...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{pathogens}} {{migrate to}} new regions through human {{activities such as}} trade, where they may establish themselves and cause disease on agriculturally important crops. Verticillium wilt of lettuce, caused by Verticillium dahliae, is a soilborne fungus that was introduced to coastal California via infested <b>spinach</b> <b>seeds.</b> It has caused significant losses for lettuce growers. Once introduced, Verticillium wilt could be managed by fumigating with methyl bromide and chloropicrin, but this option is no longer available. Growers can also manage the disease by planting broccoli or not planting spinach. These control options require long-term investments for future gain. Verticillium wilt can also be prevented or controlled by testing and providing <b>spinach</b> <b>seeds</b> {{with little or no}} V. dahliae infestation. However, seed companies have been reluctant to test or clean <b>spinach</b> <b>seeds,</b> as <b>spinach</b> crops are not affected by Verticillium wilt. Thus, available control options are affected by externalities. Renters and other producers with short time horizons will not undertake long-term investments and seed companies do {{not take into account the}} effect of their decision not to test on lettuce producers. We review the literature on the economics of managing crop disease; discuss the economics of managing Verticillium wilt; and review the recent research on the externalities that arise with short-term growers, and between seed companies and growers due to Verticillium wilt. An externality arises whenever the actions of one individual or firm affects the payoffs to another individual or firm not involved in a specific transaction. These externalities have important implications for the management of Verticillium wilt and, more broadly, for the management of migratory pathogens and the diseases they cause in agriculture in general.

40|$|Verticillium dahliae is a soilborne fungus that is {{introduced}} to the soil via infested spinach seeds and that causes lettuce to be afflicted with Verticillium wilt. This disease has spread rapidly through the Salinas Valley, the prime lettuce production region of California. Verticillium wilt can be prevented or controlled by the grower by fumigating, planting broccoli, or not planting spinach. Because these control options require long-term investment for future gain, renters might not take the steps needed to control Verticillium wilt. Verticillium wilt can also be prevented or controlled by a <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> company through testing and cleaning the spinach seeds. However, seed companies are unwilling to test or clean spinach seeds, as they are not affected by this disease. We discuss our research on the externalities that arise with renters, and between seed companies and growers, due to Verticillium wilt.

40|$|Rice bran compost (RC) was {{evaluated}} under greenhouse and field conditions for eco-friendly weed control of vegetable crops in organic farming systems. RC was applied 7 days before <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> sowing, {{at the rate}} of 0 % (control), 10 %, 20 % and 30 % of soil (v/v) in the greenhouse and 2 kg m - 2 under field conditions. RC significantly controlled the number and dry weight of weeds, and the weed control potentiality was increased by the increased application of RC in both years. The efficacy of RC in reducing weed emergence and dry weight of broadleaf species was higher than grass weeds. Among the broad leaf weeds, Lamium amplexicaule L was the most sensitive to RC and was drastically reduced by the increased application of RC. Under field conditions, the total number of weeds and the dry weight of weeds were also significantly reduced with the application of RC, compared with the untreated control. The growth inhibition potentiality of water soluble fractions of RC was also tested with seed germination and radicle elongation of test species (barley, oat, tomato and lettuce). The concentration response curves for the test species were drawn by plotting the percentage of germination against the logarithm of the concentration. Considering the I 25 value (defined as 25 % inhibition of control) both for seed germination and radicle elongation, it was indicated that water soluble fractions of RC was more effective in the suppression of dicotyledonous species (tomato and lettuce) than monocotyledonous species (barley and oat). The results of the preliminary experiment with fresh rice bran under greenhouse conditions showed that fresh bran suppressed <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> germination when applied as 10 % rice bran in soil but RC did not show a significantly negative effect up to 20 % RC application, compared with the control. Moreover, RC enhanced spinach growth. Considering both the weed control potentiality and spinach growth enhancing ability of RC, the effective appplication rate of RC is between 10 - 20 % of soil (v/v) for weed control as well as the successful growth of spinach. This research indicates that RC has the potential of being used as a natural herbicides...|$|E
40|$|Acyl {{carrier protein}} (ACP) {{contains}} an essential sulfhydryl group in its phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. We {{have investigated the}} state of this sulfhydryl in developing and mature <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> (Spinacia oleracea). Seed extracts were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate or native polyacrylamide gels, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies raised against spinach ACP-I. In extracts of mature seeds prepared with reducing agents, ACP-II migrated as a single major band, whereas extracts prepared without reducing agents gave two major bands. The additional band {{was identified as a}} conjugate of ACP-II to glutathione (ACP-S-S-G) {{on the basis of its}} sensitivity to reducing agents and its comigration with standards in both native and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. In developing spinach seeds ACP-II exists primarily in its free sulfhydryl form or as acyl derivatives, with essentially no ACP-S-S-G present. During later stages of seed development, as seed water content declines, ACP-S-S-G accumulates to approximately 50 % of the total ACP. Seed imbibition results in a rapid decline in ACP-S-S-G levels. The ACP-S-S-G:ACP-SH ratio of seeds during storage was found to be a function of seed water content and this could be manipulated by controlling the relative humidity under which the seeds were stored. We speculate that conjugation of ACP to glutathione protects the ACP from sulfhydryl oxidative damage in dry seeds...|$|E

Lifelite filtered out all light wavelengths between 500 and 580 manometers, lowered the transmission level to 26 percent in the 380 to 500 nanometer range and transmitted up to 62 percent of the wavelengths in the 580 to 700 nanometer range. Lifelite enhanced the germination of <b>spinach</b> <b>seeds,</b> inhibited the germination of lettuce and tomato seeds and had no effect on the germination of cabbage or onion seeds. The only positive morphological change elicited by Lifelite was a considerable increase in stem elongation because of an enlargement of cells.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of vigor tests {{in assessing the}} physiological potential of seeds depends on their standardization for different species. In this context, the research aimed to study specific methodologies to evaluate the vigor of spinach seeds (Tetragonia tetragonoides). For this purpose, five lots of <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> cv. New Zealand were submitted to germination, first count of germination, seedling emergence in the field, accelerated aging (with and without use of saturated solution of NaCl at 41 and 45 ºC for 24, 48 and 72 hours), controlled deterioration (18, 21 and 24 % seed water content adjustments for 24 hours at 45 ºC) and electrical conductivity tests with variations inwater volume (25, 50 and 75 mL), seed quantity (25 and 50) and soaking period (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours) at 25 ºC. The first count test allowed obtaining preliminary information about seed vigor, and other tests in general showed similarity with seedling emergence in the field. Thus, {{it was concluded that}} traditional accelerated aging test 24 h / 41 ºC and accelerated aging test with saturated salt solution for 24 h at 41 ºC and 45 ºC, and controlled deterioration test with 21 % seed water content / 24 h / 45 ºC were all efficient for evaluating the physiological potential of spinach seeds...|$|E

The research was conducted on June-September 2016 in Microbiology Laboratory, Agroindustry Laboratory and Agriculture Land, University of Mercu Buana Yogyakarta. The study used a single factor experiment with 16 treatments and 3 blocks which arranged using completely randomized design (CRD). The treatment was desinged by soaking the water <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> on the various PGPR consorcium. All treatments were control (seed soaking on the water or without PGPR), the seed soaking on the various PGPR consorsium including K 2, K 9, K 15, C 7, K 2 K 9, K 2 K 15, K 2 C 7, K 9 K 15, K 9 C 7, K 15 C 7, K 2 K 9 K 15, K 2 K 9 C 7, K 9 K 15 C 7, K 2 K 15 C 7, and K 2 K 9 K 15 C 7.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on <b>spinach</b> <b>seed</b> germination was evaluated using {{a total of}} nine spinach genotypes and seven temperatures: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 32, and 35 oC in growth chambers. Genetic variation was observed. ‘Donkey’, ‘Marabu’, and ‘Raccoon’ showed higher seed germination percentage with over 70 % at 30 and 32 oC, indicating the three spinach genotypes had heat-tolerance for germination. However, all spinach genotypes except ‘Ozarka II’ had lower germination percentages of less than 30 % while ‘Ozarka II’ had 63 % at 35 oC, indicating ‘Ozarka II’ may {{be a source of}} heat-tolerance for seed germination. Seed germination may be useful as an early screening method for heat-tolerant spinach genotypes. The whole-plant experiment was conducted using two temperatures, 20 and 32 oC, in growth chambers. Variation was observed among spinach cultivars for leaf area and shoot dry weight at 32 oC. ‘Samish’ was the only cultivar to have no significant difference between 20 and 32 oC for leaf area, while the leaf area for ‘Ozarka II’, ‘Donkey’, and ‘Marabu’ decreased from 20 to 32 oC. This may indicate that ‘Samish’ is heat-tolerant. However, significant differences were not observed among cultivars for shoot dry weight. The results from whole-plant growth at high temperature did not parallel those of the seed germination study, and the evidence does not indicate that seed germination {{can be used as a}} screening tool for heat tolerant cultivars. Bolting, tallness, and erectness are important morphological traits in spinach breeding. A total of 288 USDA spinach accessions were used as the association panel in this research. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered through genotyping by sequencing (GBS) were used for genotyping. Three SNP markers, AYZV 01001038 _ 398, AYZV 01031624 _ 1060, and AYZV 01088923 _ 95 were found to be associated with bolting.

40|$|<b>Spinach</b> <b>seeds</b> (Spinacia oleracea L.) given massive {{doses of}} γ-irradiation (500 krad) {{germinate}} {{and form a}} seedling with two green cotyledons and a radicle, but develop no further. Irradiated cotyledons show no increase in cell number or total DNA over a 7 -day period in the light, while in control cotyledons {{there is a small}} increase in cell number and large increases in total DNA and chloroplast number. The chloroplasts of irradiated cotyledons are delayed in their division, become greatly enlarged and contain large amounts of starch. The whole population of chloroplasts subsequently undergoes a wave of division. The daughter chloroplasts show normal thylakoid development, but have some abnormal structural features caused by the radiation stress. Information on the effect of X-irradiation, ultraviolet irradiation, and 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine on chloroplast replication and on chloroplast and nuclear DNA synthesis was obtained from cultured spinach leaf discs. It appears that chloroplast replication is more resistant to ionizing radiation than cell division and can proceed in the absence of nuclear DNA synthesis and greatly reduced chloroplast DNA synthesis...|$|R

The Km for soluble starch was about 10 times lower than that for maltose, and they had higher activity not only towards malto-oligosaccharides but also towards α-glucans. The optimum pH was 4. 5 - 5. 5 and about 50 % of the activity remained after incubation at 71 ℃ for 20 min. On the other hand, α-glucosidases Ⅲ and Ⅳ showed similar enzymatic propreties. The Km for maltose was 3 - 4 times lower than for solble starch, and they had high activity toward malto-oligosaccharides but faint activity towards α-glucnas. The optimum pH was 4. 5 - 5. 0 and no activity was found after incubation at 70 ℃ for 20 min.

40|$|The {{development}} of new nitrogen fertilizers is necessary to optimize crop production whilst improving the environmental aspects arising {{from the use of}} nitrogenous fertilization as a cultural practice. The use of urease inhibitors aims to improve the efficiency of urea as a nitrogen fertilizer by preventing its loss from the soil as ammonia. However, although the action of urease inhibitors is aimed at the urease activity in soil, their availability for the plant may affect its urease activity. The aim of this work was therefore to evaluate the effect of two urease inhibitors, namely acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) and N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), on the germination of pea and <b>spinach</b> <b>seeds.</b> The results obtained show that urease inhibitors do not affect the germination process to any significant degree, with the only process affected being imbibition in spinach, thus also suggesting different urease activities for both plants. Our findings therefore suggest an activity other than the previously reported urolytic activity for urease in spinach. Furthermore, of the two inhibitors tested, NBPT was found to be the most effective at inhibiting urease activity, especially in pea seedlings. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

For this purpose, a randomized block experimental design whit five treatments including 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 mg Cd/ kg soil and three replications was established in the greenhouse. After contamination the soils with different levels of cadmium, <b>spinach</b> <b>seeds</b> were planted. When plants were fully developed, plants were harvested and their cadmium contents in shoot and roots as well as the soil-cadmium were measured. The results indicated that by increasing Cd concentration in soil, the major Cd accumulation was occurred in the roots rather than shoots. Maximum cadmium concentration within the shoots and roots was 73. 7 and 75. 86 mg/kg soil, respectively. According to Spinach ability to absorb high concentration of cadmium in the root zone and its high biomass and capability of Cadmium accumulation in shoots, Spinach can be used as hyperaccumulator plant to remediate cadmium from Cd-contaminated soils. But, according to minimum remediation time and maximum dry matter for the 30 mg Cd/ kg soil, maximum Cd extracted by shoots in hectare/year was in 30 mg Cd/ kg soil.

The solid extracted MSW portion was mixed with the sandy soil at 1, 2, or 3 %, then five weeks after rocket and spinach emergence, a foliar spray technique was used to spray the water extract. The third experiment was fertilized using the conventional rate of NPK fertilization (0. 597, 0. 224 and 0. 426 g pot - 1 of super phosphate, potassium sulfate and urea, respectively). The plants were harvested three times. Growth parameters such as shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight and the water content percentages were determined. The moisture content of rocket plants was approximately 0. 8 g g - 1 of plant and was not affected by the rate of MSW (complete or extracted). However, the MSW rates gave slightly higher moisture content than the NPK treatment. Similar results were obtained for spinach. The 1 % of MSW (extracted) gave the greatest shoot fresh and dry weights among all treatments for rocket plants. The NPK and 3 % of complete MSW gave higher shoot fresh and dry weights than other MSW rates for spinach plants. The NPK treatments gave the greatest spinach shoot fresh and dry weights among all extracted MSW treatments. The results obtained with spinach encourage using the complete MSW as a source for plant nutrients.

50|$|The {{farmers in}} the rural areas of Ethiopia had not been taught many of the newer farming {{techniques}} or how to replenish their land. Project Mercy started large demonstration gardens in order to teach the school students as well as local farmers some of the methods {{that can be used to}} enhance their crops. Gardens were started using a variety of nutritious vegetables - many of which were new to the people of Yetebon. Once the vegetables matured, many from the community had their first introduction to broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, kale, <b>spinach,</b> etc. The <b>seeds</b> of some of the new vegetables were also dried for the next planting and shared with those in the community who were interested. The Project Mercy gardens are also used to provide a large portion of the food for the School Meal Program.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of plant-uncoupling mitochondrial protein (PUMP), previously described by Vercesi et al. (1995), was screened in mitochondria of various organs or tissues of several plant species. This was done functionally, by monitoring purine nucleotide-sensitive linoleic acid-induced uncoupling, or by Western blots. The following findings were established: (1) PUMP {{was found in}} most of the higher plants tested; (2) since ATP inhibition of linoleic acid-induced membrane potential decrease varied, PUMP content might differ in different plant tissues, as observed with mitochondria from maize roots, maize <b>seeds,</b> <b>spinach</b> leaves, wheat shoots, carrot roots, cauliflower, broccoli, maize shoots, turnip root, and potato calli. Western blots also indicated PUMP presence in oat shoots, carnation petals, onion bulbs, red beet root, green cabbage, and Sedum leaves. (3) PUMP was not detected in mushrooms. We conclude that PUMP is likely present in the mitochondria of organs and tissues of all higher plants. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we present the synthesis, {{structural}} and spectroscopic characterization of Co 2 + coordination compounds with ethyl 4 -methyl- 5 -imidazolecarboxylate (emizco). The effects of emizco, the metal salts CoCl 2. 6 H 2 O, CoBr 2, Co(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O and their metal coordination compounds [Co(emizco) 2 Cl 2], [Co(emizco) 2 Br 2]. H 2 O, [Co(emizco) 2 (H 2 O) 2 (NO 2) 2. 2 H 2 O were evaluated on photosynthesis in <b>spinach</b> chloroplasts. <b>Seed</b> germination and seedling {{growth of the}} monocotyledonous species Lolium multiflorum and Triticum aestivum and the dicotyledonous species Trifolium alexandrinum and Physalis ixocarpa were also assayed under {{the effect of the}} compounds and salts. The results showed that cobalt(II) salts and their emizco coordination compounds inhibit photosynthetic electron flow and ATP-synthesis, behaving as Hill reaction inhibitors. Coordination compounds are more potent inhibitors than the salts. It was found that the salts target is at the b 6 f level while the complexes targets are at QB(D 1) -protein and b 6 f level. The QB inhibition site was confirmed by variable chlorophyll a fluorescence yield. On the other hand, emizco inhibits seed germination, root and shoot development, in both weed and crop species. Cobalt(II) coordination compounds are the most effective photosynthesis inhibitors, but they are less potent than emizco in germination and seedling growth, while the metal salts are the least active of all...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} was studied of split dressings of N on susceptibility to lodging, on yields of grain and straw and on seed {{quality of a}} number of seed crops: poppy (Papaver somniferum), spinach (Spinacia oleracea), radish (Raphanus sativus), caraway (Carum carvi), winter swede-like oilrape (Brassica napus var. biennis) and canary grass (Phalaris canariensis). The data on yield, lodging and quality were from field trials under normal management. The second application of N was just before flowering. Of the 6 seed crops, at least 3 (poppy, spinach, radish and sometimes caraway) increased in seed production. The other crops reacted either indifferently (caraway, winter swede-like oilrape) or always negatively (canary grass). Split dressings improved seed quality of poppy and radish. The commercial value of other crops was not affected. The effect on straw stiffness (lodging) of the crops concerned was not marked; only for poppy {{and to a lesser extent}} spinach and radish did split application provide some advantage. For poppy, <b>spinach</b> and radish <b>seed</b> N dressing could be delayed until plants were in full bloom...|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves and}} starchy, {{tuberous}} roots of some species {{are used as}} foodstuffs (e.g. sweet potato and water <b>spinach),</b> and the <b>seeds</b> are exploited for their medicinal value as purgatives. Some species contain ergoline alkaloids that are likely responsible {{for the use of}} these species as ingredients in psychedelic drugs (e.g. ololiuhqui). The presence of ergolines in some species of this family is due to infection by fungi related to the ergot fungi of the genus Claviceps. A recent study of Convolvulaceae species, Ipomoea asarifolia, and its associated fungi showed the presence of a fungus, identified by DNA sequencing of 18s and ITS ribosomal DNA and phylogenetic analysis to be closely related to fungi in the family Clavicipitaceae, was always associated with the presence of ergoline alkaloids in the plant. The identified fungus appears to be a seed-transmitted, obligate biotroph growing epiphytically on its host. This finding strongly suggests the unique presence of ergoline alkaloids in some species of the family Convolvulaceae is due to symbiosis with clavicipitaceous fungi. Moreover, another group of compounds, loline alkaloids, commonly produced by some members of the clavicipitaceous fungi (genus Neotyphodium), has been identified in a convolvulaceous species, but the origin of the loline alkaloids in this species is unknown.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory and {{greenhouse}} {{experiments were}} conducted to evaluate the allelopathic effects of the extracts and residue Arctotis arctotoides (L. f.) O. Hoffm on selected vegetable crops. The study aimed to address the following specific objectives to (i) examine the ultra structures of the leaf of A. arctotoides using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), (ii) carry out comprehensive qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analysis of the root and shoot materials of the plant, (iii) investigate the allelopathic activities of the root and shoot aqueous extracts of A. arctotoides at concentrations of 10, 8, 6, 4 and 2 mg/ml on germination, radicle and plumule growth of cabbage, carrot, tomato and spinach, (iv) evaluate the inhibitory effects of the dried shoot residue of the plant at 10, 20 and 40 g kg- 3 of soil (treatments B, C and D) and the control (treatment A) on the morphology, growth and chlorophyll pigment content of tomato and cabbage transplants at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after transplanting and (v) assess {{the effects of the}} dried shoot residue of A. arctotoides on the yield, nutrient uptake by the leaves of tomato and cabbage at 4 and 12 weeks after transplanting. Finally, to analyze the residual mineral content of the soils with tomato and cabbage transplants at 12 weeks after transplanting. The the SEM revealed that anisocytic stomata and glandular trichomes (GTs) were numerous on the abaxial than the adaxial surfaces of A. arctotoides. The non glandular trichomes (NGTs) were also present on both surfaces but lesser on the abaxial. Morphologically, the GTs were peltate, uniseriate and globular head while the NGTs were cylindrical and filamentous with variable number of cells at the basal portion. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of some crystals showed that Na+ Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + were the major constituents of the crystal deposit found around the GTs and stomata. The results of the phytochemical composition of the root and shoot extracts of A. arctotoides confirmed the occurrence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, saponnins, tannins and triterpenes as the common constituents. In addition, cardiac glycosides and steroids were also detected in the shoot of the A. arctotoides. Quantitative estimation of the chemical constituents of the crude extracts further revealed that the alkaloid content in the root higher (0. 97 percent) than the shoot (0. 64 percent). The quantity of flavonoids detected in the shoot (1. 02 percent) was more than that observed in the root (0. 35 percent). Others (phenolics and tannins) were marginal in the two plant parts. The results of the inhibitory effects of the root and shoot aqueous extract at the varying concentrations showed that root extract at 10 mg/ml considerably reduced the germination of cabbage, carrot, tomato and <b>spinach</b> <b>seeds</b> by 84. 0, 83. 2, 72. 8 and 37. 4 percent respectively. Incubation of the shoot extract at the same concentration resulted in 100 percent inhibition of cabbage and carrot seed germination whereas those of tomato and spinach were suppressed by 91. 5 and 61. 2 percent respectively. The two extracts at the varying concentrations also had a significant reduction on the radicle and plumule growth of the four vegetables. Addition of the shoot residue to the soil showed massive chlorosis, necrotic lesions and wilting of tomato and cabbage leaves under treatments C and D at 2 weeks after transplanting. The number of leaves, leaf area, dry shoot and root weight of the two vegetables grown in the amended soils were also drastically reduced. The inhibition percentages due to the addition of the three concentrations of A. arctotoides dried shoot residue on the dry shoot weight at 4 weeks after transplanting were 38. 6, 45. 5 and 70. 3. for tomato and 57. 5, 73. 3 and 87. 5 percent for cabbage. Similarly, the declines in the dry root weight of 61. 3, 82. 9. 4 and 83. 4 percent for tomato as well as 53. 1, 54. 7 and 67. 2 percent for cabbages were recorded for the two vegetables under treatment B, C and D during the period. The results further showed that the dry fruit yield and shoot weight of tomato under the treatments B, C and D decreased with increase in shoot residue concentrations of A. arctotoides. Relative to treatment A, no significant differences were recorded in the dry head weight of cabbage under the residue treated groups. The reductions in the fruit yield and fresh head weight caused by treatments C and D were 37. 2 and 84. 8 percent for tomato and 30. 9 and 72. 4 percent for cabbage. The findings on the mineral contents in the leaves of the two vegetables revealed significant differences in the uptake of N, Mg, Na, Cu and Fe by tomato leaves. The concentrations of N, K, Na and Zn in cabbage leaves also differed. However, the P content was relatively constant in the leaves of the two vegetables at 4 and 12 weeks after transplanting. At 12 weeks after transplanting, the Fe content in soils with tomato and cabbage treatments C and D was greatly enhanced in comparison with the other nutrients. The residual N, P and Zn detected in soils planted to cabbage were similarly equal among all the groups including the control. Thus, under the greenhouse experiment, Arctotis arctotoides (L. f) O. Hoffm has been shown to contain some phytotoxic chemical compounds in its root and shoot materials. The compounds either singly or collectively have demonstrated some inhibitory potentials on the germination, growth and yields of cabbage, carrot, tomato and spinach evaluated in this study...|$|R
5000|$|The Obamas {{planted a}} {{vegetable}} garden on the South Lawn of the White House on March 20, 2009. This L-shaped 1100 sq ft garden is located by the mansion’s tennis courts {{and can be}} seen from E street. [...] The plot provides more than 55 varieties of vegetables along with fruits that are incorporated into meals made for the Obama family as well as invited guests. Another portion of the yields are donated to the local soup kitchen and the Food Bank Organization. There are 55 varieties of vegetables grown, including: arugula (rocket), cilantro (coriander), tomatillo, hot peppers, spinach, chard, collards, black kale, berries and lettuce. In addition to the seeds selected to be planted are twenty five heirloom seeds and ten different herbs such as anise hyssop and Thai basil. Former presidents' favorite produce will also be sown such as President Thomas Jefferson’s preferred vegetables “Brown Dutch and Tennis Ball lettuce, Prickly <b>Seed</b> <b>spinach</b> and Savoy cabbage” but beets will not be grown as President Obama does not like them. Along with the vegetable garden a beehive was added near the chef’s kitchen that is overseen by Charlie Brandts, a beekeeper and White House carpenter. Honey collected from the beehives has been used to brew White House Honey Ale. The contributing gardeners responsible for {{the early stages of the}} garden include the First Lady herself, White House Horticulturist Dale Haney, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, a team of chefs, and fifth graders from Bancroft Elementary School in Washington. These twenty-three fifth grader advocates, who have grown a garden at their school, helped with digging up the soil, planting, harvesting, and cooking the crops produced. Project facilitator Michelle Obama has made the vegetable garden a priority by requiring hands on assistance from all the family members. In May 2012, the First Lady published American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America, a book detailing her experiences with the Kitchen Garden and promoting healthy eating.|$|R
30|$|Corn (Zea mays L.) is an important, {{strategic}} cereal crop {{that has}} a relatively short growing period and produces a high yield. Corn ranks third in {{world in terms of}} production after wheat and rice (Raji 2003). Nanoparticles, which are 1 – 100  nm in diameter (Ruffini Castiglione and Cremonini 2009) have a large specific surface area that can provides for a good level of reactivity and this character facilitates effective absorption of fertilizers and pesticides at nanoscale (Sheykhbaglou et al., 2010). Thus nano particles can be used to increase the supply of elements to plant shoots and foliage. Nano particles appropriate for such application are those of are nano Tio 2, nano zinc, nano iron, nano aluminum and nano silver (Reynolds 2002). Application of nanoparticles can also increase seed germination and seedling growth. Furthermore nanoparticles can facilitate enhanced ability of water and fertilizer absorption by roots, and increase antioxidant enzyme activity such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. Thus, nanoparticles can increase plant resistance against different stresses (Harrison 1996). Many studies have reported that nano particles have favorable effects on plant growth and development. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are used in agriculture to increase growth and can improve yield by approximately 30 %; improve the rate of photosynthesis and reduce disease (Chao and Choi 2005). Titanium dioxide is used commercially as the most appropriate catalyst for photo catalytic reactions; upon exposure to ultraviolet light it mineralizes the organic chemicals in rivers to water and carbon dioxide with the potential to destroy microorganisms (Owolade et al., 2008). Lei et al., (2007) found that, nano Tio 2 increases photosynthesis and plant growth of spinach and enhances absorption and transmission of the sun’s energy to electron energy and activates chemical energy. Other research has reported that nano Tio 2, could greatly improve whole chain electron transport, photo reduction activity of photosystem II, O 2 -evolving and photophosphorylation activity of spinach Chl, not only under visible light, but also energy-enriched electron from nanoanatase Tio 2, which entered the Chl under ultraviolet light and was transferred in a photosynthetic electron transport chain and reduced NADP + be into NADPH, and coupled to photophosphorylation and stimulated the transformation of electron energy to ATP. In another experiment, Zheng et al. (2005), considered, germination rate and vigor index of <b>spinach</b> old <b>seeds</b> that treated with the nano Tio 2 (concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4, 6 and 8 percent) and Tio 2 (concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4, 6 and 8 percent) and observed that evaluations for these traits increased in seeds treated with concentrations of 0.25 to 4 percent of nano Tio 2 in comparison with Tio 2. Evaluations for chlorophyll levels, ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase activity, dry weight and fresh weight in seedlings that had been treated with 2.5 percent were higher than evaluations for treatments at other concentrations of nano Tio 2 and Tio 2 (bulk). Lu et al., (2002) reported that evaluations for nitrate reductase, super oxide dismutase and catalase increased in germinated soybean seeds that had been treated with nano Tio 2, and that levels of water water and fertilizer use efficiency increased. The research results of Moaveni et al., (2011) on effects of different nano titanium dioxide concentrations (0.01, 0.02, 0.03 percent) and titanium dioxide (bulk) spray treatment on barley plants showed that traits of grain yield, number of ears and harvest index in all treatments of nano titanium dioxide application were more effective than the control treatment. It was demonstrated that barley plants sprayed with nano titanium dioxide at concentrations of 0.03 % was 21.32 % produced higher evaluations for grain yield compared to the control. Also, Owolade et al., (2008) concluded that effects of nano Tio 2 spray on evaluations for traits of seed number per pod, 1000 seed weight, grain yield, leaf area, pod number per plant and pod length of Vina unguiculata, were significant and evaluations of these traits significantly increased compared to the control. So, this study was done to examine changes of photosynthetic pigments in maize (Zea mays L.) sprayed with nano Tio 2 at various stages of growth and development.|$|R
