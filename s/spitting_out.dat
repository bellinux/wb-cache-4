The goal followed from a long-range shot by Michael Essien, which deflected first off Nemanja Vidić and then Ferdinand. The ball's change in direction caused Van der Sar to lose his footing, leaving Lampard, who had made a run from deep, with a simple finish. In celebration, Lampard looked up and pointed to the sky with both hands in memory of his mother, Pat, who had died a month earlier.

500|$|In the song, Jackson {{tells the}} media to stop {{pressuring}} him and to stop misrepresenting the truth. Jon Pareles of The New York Times observed, [...] "fear has turned to aggression. The music has polarized; it's either clipped, choppy and electronic or glossy and sumptuous, only occasionally trying to combine the two. Most of the time, Jackson sounds as if he's singing through clenched teeth, <b>spitting</b> <b>out</b> words in defiance of any and all persecutors". He believed that [...] "Scream" [...] had a similar sound {{to the music of}} Janet's acclaimed Rhythm Nation. It was Michael Jackson's first song that contained the word [...] "fucking" [...] in the lyrics [...] "Stop pressuring me/Stop pressuring me/Stop fucking with me"—which was thought of as an unusual choice for Jackson, considering his appeal with the younger audience. Other songs on HIStory contained words such as kike, shit, and from The Notorious B.I.G., the word [...] "nigga". [...] "Scream" [...] incorporates elements of pop, R, hip-hop, funk and rock.|$|E
500|$|The Never Ending Tour {{commenced}} on June 7, 1988, and Dylan {{has played}} roughly 100 dates {{a year for}} the entirety of the 1990s and 2000s—a heavier schedule than most performers who started out in the 1960s. By May 2013, Dylan and his band had played more than 2,500 shows, anchored by long-time bassist Tony Garnier, drummer George Recile, multi-instrumentalist Donnie Herron, and guitarist Charlie Sexton. To the dismay of some of his audience, Dylan's performances remain unpredictable as he alters his arrangements and changes his vocal approach night after night. Critical opinion about Dylan's shows remains divided. Critics such as Richard Williams and Andy Gill have argued that Dylan has found a successful way to present his rich legacy of material. Others have criticized his live performances for mangling and <b>spitting</b> <b>out</b> [...] "the greatest lyrics ever written so that they are effectively unrecognisable", and giving so little to the audience that [...] "it is difficult to understand what he is doing on stage at all." ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{performance}} of [...] "Candy Shop" [...] {{was on the}} Hard Candy Promo Tour of 2008; Madonna, wearing a skintight black suit and a lace top, appeared on the stage while sitting on a throne [...] with a golden walking stick, as {{the music of the}} song started. Images of confectionery flashed on the television screens flanking the back of the stage as Madonna and [...] her six dancers gyrated in choreographed dance moves. That same year, the song was performed as the opening number of the Sticky & Sweet Tour. Similar to the promo tour, Madonna appeared on a M-shaped throne dressed in a Givenchy-designed dress, sitting with her legs spread apart and holding a staff in her hands and was accompanied by dancers in bondage themed costumes, while the backdrop screens depicted images of gumdrops and candies. For the 2009 extension of the tour, the backdrop video for [...] "Candy Shop" [...] was replaced by a new one by artist Marilyn Minter, featuring imagery of a giant tongue licking and <b>spitting</b> <b>out</b> neon-colored icing.

500|$|Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe listed [...] "The Only Exception" [...] as the {{highlight}} of Brand New Eyes, crediting the song as being an [...] "essential". Hirsh said that [...] "The Only Exception" [...] is [...] "probably {{the best place to}} start" [...] with the album, describing Williams' vocals as [...] "forging a connection" [...] rather than [...] "simply <b>spitting</b> <b>out</b> her feelings"; he also praised the other band members for locking in at a [...] "sympathetic simmer". Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic felt that [...] "The Only Exception" [...] had similarities to [...] "The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot" [...] by Brand New. Freeman stated that on Paramore's All We Know Is Falling, [...] "My Heart" [...] was a [...] "blunt and obvious song" [...] that focused on a [...] "climax to be emotional", but with [...] "The Only Exception", Paramore have [...] "figured out that it doesn't have to finish loud to incite a reaction in the listener". He also noted that the song shows that Williams' lyrics have [...] "definitely improved". Jesse Catalodo of Slant felt that the lyrics to [...] "The Only Exception" [...] may be [...] "irredeemably over-the-top" [...] but its [...] "vocal melodies are the stuff of perfect pop".|$|E

500|$|After the 2009 {{extension}} of the tour was announced, some changes {{were made to the}} setlist. [...] "Candy Shop" [...] had a new video backdrop by artist Marilyn Minter, featuring imagery of a giant tongue licking and <b>spitting</b> <b>out</b> neon-colored icing. Madonna also wore new opening outfit designed by Riccardo Tisci. [...] "Heartbeat" [...] was replaced by [...] "Holiday" [...] and incorporated elements of her then latest single [...] "Celebration", and her first single [...] "Everybody". After Michael Jackson's death, it was modified to include a medley of three Michael Jackson songs, as an homage to the recently deceased singer. The performance featured Madonna's dancer Kento, who danced in similar clothing and dancing style as Jackson. Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Dress You Up" [...] replaced the rock version of [...] "Borderline". It featured elements of rock songs like [...] "My Sharona" [...] by The Knack and [...] "God Save The Queen" [...] by Sex Pistols. [...] "Hung Up" [...] was removed and replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen" [...] with interpolations from [...] "Open Your Heart", which was set between [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". The video backdrop for [...] "Frozen" [...] used video outtakes from the song's music video, directed by Chris Cunningham. [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was also slightly edited for selected performances with the lyrics from Michael Jackson's song [...] "Man in the Mirror, [...] "If you wanna {{make the world a better}} place...

2500|$|In 1976, {{the first}} women-only Passover seder {{was held in}} Esther M. Broner's New York City {{apartment}} and led by her, with 13 women attending, including Gloria Steinem, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, and Phyllis Chesler. Esther Broner and Naomi Nimrod created a women's haggadah for use at this seder. In the spring of 1976 Esther Broner published this [...] "Women's Haggadah" [...] in Ms. magazine, later publishing it as a book in 1994; this haggadah is meant to include women where only men had been mentioned in traditional haggadahs, and it features the Wise Women, the Four Daughters, the Women's Questions, the Women's Plagues, and a women-centric [...] "Dayenu". The original Women's Seder has been held with the Women's Haggadah every year since 1976, and women-only seders are now held by some congregations as well. Some seders (including the original Women's Seder, {{but not limited to}} women-only seders) now set out a cup for the prophet Miriam as well as the traditional cup for the prophet Elijah, sometimes accompanied by a ritual to honor Miriam. Miriam's cup originated in the 1980s in a Boston Rosh Chodesh group; it was invented by Stephanie Loo, who filled it with mayim hayim (living waters) and used it in a feminist ceremony of guided meditation. Miriam's cup is linked to the midrash of Miriam's well, which [...] "is a rabbinic legend that tells of a miraculous well that accompanied the Israelites during their 40 years in the desert at the Exodus from Egypt". Furthermore, some Jews include an orange on the seder plate. The orange represents the fruitfulness for all Jews when all marginalized peoples are included, particularly women and gay people. An incorrect but common rumor says that this tradition began when a man told Susannah Heschel that a woman belongs on the bimah as an orange on the seder plate; however, it actually began when in the early 1980s, while when speaking at Oberlin College Hillel, Susannah Heschel was introduced to an early feminist Haggadah that suggested adding a crust of bread on the seder plate, as a sign of solidarity with Jewish lesbians (as some would say there's as much room for a lesbian in Judaism as there is for a crust of bread on the seder plate). Heschel felt that to put bread on the seder plate would be to accept that Jewish lesbians and gay men violate Judaism like chametz violates Passover. So, at her next seder, she chose an orange as a symbol of inclusion of gays and lesbians and others who are marginalized within the Jewish community. In addition, each orange segment had a few seeds that had to be spit out – a gesture of <b>spitting</b> <b>out</b> and repudiating the homophobia of traditional Judaism.|$|E
