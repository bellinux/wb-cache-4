25|$|As {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} one, the {{delivery}} phase is in between the release phase and the deployment phase. A <b>software</b> <b>vendor</b> develops and releases a software product and afterwards it has to be transported to the customer. This phase is the delivery process. This process is highly complex because the vendor often has to deal with a product which has multiple versions, variable features, dependency on external products, and different kinds of distribution options. The CCU method helps the <b>software</b> <b>vendor</b> in structuring this process.|$|E
40|$|MBA 2014 ABSTRACT The {{software}} {{market is}} changing, <b>software</b> <b>vendors</b> are moving towards offering ERP as a Software-As-A-Service (SAAS) product. South African <b>software</b> <b>vendors</b> {{need to be}} cognizant of the full implications of offering ERP SAAS and identify how it will impact their business. A smooth transition is essential for South African <b>software</b> <b>vendors</b> to be better positioned {{to capitalize on the}} growing demand for ERP SAAS. The purpose of this research was to determine how South African <b>software</b> <b>vendors</b> have changed their business model to offer ERP SAAS. The aim was to identify the major changes that <b>software</b> <b>vendors</b> experienced when transitioning from offering ERP as an on-premise system to a Software-As-A-Service model. Data was collected through conducting interviews with management, senior sales and information technology personnel who are involved in developing business models within the information technology companies offering ERP SAAS. The results of the study show that <b>software</b> <b>vendors</b> experienced changes in all the elements of their business model. <b>Software</b> <b>vendors</b> had to change their offering such that it offers a low total cost of ownership, shorter implementation time and is flexible to customer changes. They had to utilize more direct channels to deliver, market and support the ERP SAAS offering. The revenue stream from the ERP SAAS offering changed to monthly subscription fees. Key resources required include hardware and software infrastructure, as well as human resources to manage the new resources. <b>Software</b> <b>vendors</b> had to focus on simplifying the ERP SAAS offering and ensuring that it is operational 24 hours a day. The cost-structuring had to include infrastructure and labour costs. The transition from offering ERP as an on-premise system to a SAAS product has implications throughout the organization with regards to the business processes and personnel. <b>Software</b> <b>vendors</b> need to conduct thorough business planning and have large financial resources before embarking on offering ERP SAAS...|$|R

25|$|Unlike Windows XP, in {{the beta}} {{versions}} of Windows Vista, WSC {{could not be}} disabled or overridden. Security software maker Symantec spoke out against this, noting that it would cause {{a great deal of}} consumer confusion because any security problems would be reported by both WSC and Symantec's tools at the same time. McAfee, another large security <b>software</b> <b>vendor,</b> lodged similar complaints. In the end, Microsoft allowed WSC to be disabled.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} deliver the {{developed}} product to the customer, the vendor needs to package the different components of its product into a package. By doing this, the customer will receive all the information and software components at once fulfilling all its needs. After combining all elements into one package the <b>software</b> <b>vendor</b> will carefully have to check if the package is complete. The package will have to provide the customer with all the tools and information to use the product. When {{this is not the}} case the <b>software</b> <b>vendor</b> will get a lot of questions from its customers which will consume a lot of time. It is therefore very important that the package is checked carefully before it is shipped. The package can be a physical combination of different elements packed into for example a box, but it can also be a digital combination of files which contain all the elements. Within the CCU process it is stated that a package will consist of five elements, being: software package, system description, manual, and license and management information. In the following paragraphs is explained how these elements fit into the CCU delivery phase.|$|E

License managers protect <b>software</b> <b>vendors</b> from losses due to software piracy and enable end-user organizations to comply with {{software license}} agreements. License managers enable <b>software</b> <b>vendors</b> to offer {{a wide range of}} usage-centric software licensing models, such as product activation, trial licenses, subscription licenses, feature-based licenses, and floating licensing from the same software package they provide to all users.|$|R
40|$|The computer-services and {{software}} industry {{used to be}} conveniently divided into three main sectors: mass-market <b>software</b> <b>vendors,</b> enterprise <b>software</b> <b>vendors,</b> and computer services. The three sectors were distinct, because personal computers, corporate mainframes, and online computer networks operated in relative isolation. The arrival of the Internet effectively connected everything, facilitating the entry of mass-market <b>vendors</b> into enterprise <b>software</b> and of both mass-market and enterprise <b>software</b> <b>vendors</b> into computer services.

25|$|Adobe {{acquired}} Aldus Corp. in 1994, a <b>software</b> <b>vendor</b> {{that sold}} FreeHand, a competing product. Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor. The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar {{program for the}} next 10 years (1994-2004). Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11. When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete. With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{license is}} {{in this case a}} Software license {{agreement}} in which is stated how the customer is permitted to use the product. For example it can state how many users are permitted to use the software product. In this situation the license agreement is a contract or a certificate which is the customers prove of its using permits. The <b>software</b> <b>vendor</b> has its own part of the agreement which in most cases is stored in a system. An elaboration of this part {{can be found at the}} receive feedback section of this article. The license agreement shipped to the customer can be a digital document as well as a physical document.|$|E
25|$|The {{software}} distribution {{of a product}} can be done offline as well as online. In an offline situation the package is a physical package which contains all the elements. The software is stored on a data carrier such as a CD or a DVD, and the documents might also be stored in a digital form on this data carrier, or they might be in physical form such as a booklet. The package {{as a whole is}} a physical product. In an online situation the entire package needs to be in a digital form. The consequences on the distribution process are described in the following paragraphs. CCU is designed to fit both situations but as bandwidth is growing it is making more sense to distribute especially updates and new versions to existing customers online. In this article both ways are discussed. In the process-data model it is assumed that the <b>software</b> <b>vendor</b> conducts both distribution channels. As a practical example: HISComp, a provider of medical information systems distributes its software straightforward via CDs. However they use their website to distribute patches for the software products.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, a lot {{is asked}} from {{software}} vendors: their organizations have to be dynamic and agile, highly responsive to changes, while developing software at high speed, low cost and according to high quality standards. Two trends can be observed. First, a shift from object-oriented devel-opment to service-oriented development can be perceived. Secondly, while <b>software</b> <b>vendors</b> may have implemented a particular form of software usage data gathering mechanism, few <b>software</b> <b>vendors</b> actually use the data that is collected. <b>Software</b> <b>vendors</b> are unaware of how their soft-ware performs {{in the field and}} do not know what parts of their software are used and appreciated most and have little knowledge about the behavior of the software and its environment. In this thesis, a concept called Service Knowledge Utilization (SKU) is introduced as an approach to increase a <b>software</b> <b>vendor’s</b> flexibility, and responsiveness to changes in the performance and usage of its service-based online software, at specific customers and concerning its software in general. Furthermore, the SKU reporting toolset is presented.
