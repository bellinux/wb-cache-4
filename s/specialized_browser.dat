30|$|Collaboratory for Multi-scale Chemical Science (CMCS) [92] is {{a system}} for {{collaboration}} and data management used in chemistry. In this system provenance is stored in Scientific Annotation Middleware (SAM) {{to keep track of}} which scientific data was generated by which process. Unfortunately, CMCS does not support automated extraction of provenance. Thus, an application of a workflow itself should capture the provenance information, or a user needs to input the provenance manually via a web portal when the workflow is executed. A user can query the stored provenance and view the provenance {{in the form of a}} graph in a <b>specialized</b> <b>browser.</b> It is not known regarding simulation result reuse. Also, it is not certain whether the system could support reproduce the result. Applying data mining to the provenance data is not considered.|$|E

The simulators cover combinational and sequential logic networks, finite state-machine design, and microcomputer interfacing and programming. They are integrated together, and therefore allow {{the design and}} test of embedded digital systems. The environment guides students' activities by delivering learning materials through <b>specialized</b> <b>browsers.</b> An extensive collection of learning materials is available. This paper includes an example of activity on a problem assignment...|$|R

50|$|The giant sable {{antelope}} {{lives in}} forests near water, where leaves and tree sprouts are always juicy and abundant. It is an endangered species; it is protected in natural parks, and hunting it is forbidden. Typically, sable antelopes are <b>specialized</b> <b>browsers</b> feeding on foliage and herbs, especially those growing on termite mounds. One {{of the reasons for}} the decline in antelope numbers could be the animals' very specific feeding patterns. Typically, they will feed on tree leaves, which make up to 90% of their diets, at heights of 40 - 140 mm from the ground, taking only the leaf.|$|R
5000|$|Members of the Palaeopropithecidae family {{appear to}} have eaten a mix of fruit, nuts, and foliage. [...] The sloth lemurs were mixed-feeders rather than <b>specialized</b> <b>browsers</b> who ate a mixed diet based on seasonality. However, {{on the basis of}} high robusticity of the mandibular corpus, Palaeopropithecus and Archaeoindris can be {{considered}} highly folivorous. The Palaeopropithecidae family exhibited molar megadonty, small deciduous teeth with low occlusal length ratios, and a decoupling of the speed of dental and body growth with acceleration of dental development relative to body growth. These attributes were observed in conjunction with the finding that Palaeopropithecidae experienced prolonged periods of gestation.|$|R

Currently, raw data and <b>specialized</b> data <b>browsers</b> from {{the first and second}} phases are on www.ImmGen.org.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{activities}} are essential components of electronic engineering pedagogy. The introduction of complex solid state components {{and the development}} of software simulation and design techniques has deeply affected the organisation and use of educational laboratories. In particular, for digital design, traditional hardware laboratories are replaced by “virtual” environments, where simulated components are used instead of real ones. The diffusion of the Internet has further modified the education environment, with the introduction of remotely-controlled laboratories. The chapter explores the issues relevant for the pedagogical use of virtual and remote labs in the field of electronic engineering, using as examples two projects developed in our institution and used in our courses. Deeds is a learning environment for digital electronics based on a set of simulators and web resources. It enables integrated simulation of combinational and sequential logic networks, finite state machine and microcomputer boards. The Deeds has capabilities of guiding student’s activities by delivering learning materials through <b>specialized</b> <b>browsers</b> and it has been specifically designed to support distance education. ISILab is an environment currently used to deliver remote access to experiments of electronics. Students can practice with electronic instruments and measurement methods to execute real experiments on analogue and digital circuits. The experiments deal with basic electronic measurements, such as the delays in digital circuits or the gain and the distortion of amplifiers, and let to use devices such as waveform generators and oscilloscopes...|$|R
40|$|A VRML parser in Java language, {{as a part}} of a <b>specialized</b> VRML <b>browser</b> {{for blind}} people, is {{presented}} in this paper. The parser reads an input URL with a VRML 2. 0 scene description and creates an inner representation of the scene tree structure and the list of event routes, used by the other modules of the browser. A part of the input file analysing block contains also the management of the event route list and the event queue. Therefore, this work includes not only the parser, but represents a complete base-layer, called VRML API. It consists of classes representing the entities of VRML, especially of the class Browser, whose methods serve other modules for obtaining the inner structures and some basic properties of the system. There will be shown, how the inner scene structure is built from instances of class Node, how the route list and event queue are managed, how these and other VRML objects are specified, how the input file analyser works etc. KEYWORDS: VRML, virtual reality, J [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Respondus LockDown <b>Browser</b> is the <b>specialized</b> web <b>browser</b> {{which many}} {{students}} are forced to use. It is intended to provide a secure testing environment and discourage cheating. It is also trivially easy to manipulate into loading an attack page which could steal a student’s CWU login credentials. The information collected by such an attack would give the attacker access to the student’s Novell, Safari and GroupWise accounts. This would allow them to: view the student’s name, address, telephone number, and any other contact information which they had on file in Safari. The attacker could alter a compromised student’s course registrations; financial aid acceptance; send email messages {{as though they were}} the student; or use the school network for nefarious purposes which would then {{be traced back to the}} compromised student’s account. Further, since an attacker would have access to the student’s GroupWise email account, they would be able to compromise any accounts on services for which the student had used their cwu. edu email address as a password reset contact. This could include, bank, credit card, online bill payment, social networking, job search sites, or even additional email accounts from other providers. During this presentation we will demonstrate how difficult Respondus LockDown Browser makes it for a user to determine if a site is legitimate before entering their credentials. We will also provide guidance on how students can spot and avoid such an attack...|$|R
