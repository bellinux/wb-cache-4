Nakon utvrđivanja tipologije i vrednovanja svakog pojedinog reljefa, autor pripisuje 10 kvaiitetnijih reljefa Nikoli Firentincu (br 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 18), postavljajući hipotezu da su dva tipski različita (br 22 i 21) možda Đuknovićeva. Alešiju atribuira 9 reljefa (br 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11, 16, 19) The author {{concludes that}} {{the fate of the}} largest Early Renaissance {{architectural}} and sculptural monument in Croatia - The Chapel of St. John in Trogir, which was added to the Trogir cathedral 1468 - 1482 - has been that throughout this century scholars have almost exclusively carried out research on the 15 sculptures in niches and almost entirely forgotten the 143 reliefs showing children 2 ̆ 7 s figures and heads. This extraordinary disproportion between a lively interest in sculpture and the neglect of reliefs, has had a harmful effect on the interpretation and evaluation of the chapee, because the Trogir reliefs are not only the largest gallery of children 2 ̆ 7 s figures in the quattrocento, but they are an integral art of a building, which is itself unique in the Earkly Renaissance art of Europe. The author has undertaken the publication of an analytical and critical catalogue of these reliefs. In a number of studies he has established the iconographic stratigraphy of this chapel-mausoleum (an unusual feature of which is that besides Earth and Heaven, the Underworld is also shown), and has published studies of the 17 cornices of leaves and fruit around the oculi (which are in fact realistic "still lifes"), 96 reliefs of children 2 ̆ 7 s heads - seraphs on the coffered vault, 16 putti - telamoni on pillars and 9 angels in the relief Coronation of the Virgin in the lunette above the altar. In this essay he treats the last group of children 2 ̆ 7 s figures, genii torchbearers peeping out of the slightly opened doors of the Underworld, serving as the back of the stone pew that goes around the inside of the chapel and {{at the foot of the}} pilasters at the entrance. In the contract of 4 January 1468, they are refered to as the spiritelli, and the author define the as small spirits of the Underworld, Classical genii emerging with torches thorugh the door that separates the world of the living from the Kingdom of Shadows. In this contract Nikola Firentinac (Niccolo di Giovanni Fiorentino) and Andrija Aleši promised to make reliefs: et tra vne e I 2 ̆ 7 altro di dicti pilastrelli die esser a similitudine d 2 ̆ 7 vna portella, de la qual jusir de vn spiritello de longeza de pie 3 tenedo in mano vna fiasella per vno, che sarano per numero XVII. The author records that the Chapel was not entirely carried out according to the contract, and that every change required a larger number of human figures, decorative motifs were changed into figural ones, easier tasks into more difficult ones. Such treatment is typical of great creative artists such as Firentinac, who was the author of the project. Instead of 17 genii, 21 were made. According to the contract there were supposed to be three garlands at the foot of the pilasters, but instead there are four more figures genii with torches in relief o the back and front, and on the side towards the passage there is a bouquet of acanthus. The genii with torches in relief are placed in the following way: 4 at the foot of the pilasters, 6 on each of the side walls and 5 behind the altar. The author numbers them starting from the south-west pilaster as it is marked in ground-plan. After a thorough analysis and interpretation of every single relief, the author separates in typology or quality Nikola 2 ̆ 7 s reliefs which are better from Andrija 2 ̆ 7 s. But he considers that the dilemma of some researhcers, about a third artist being involved, should not be relinquished. He does, however, (following C. Fisković) reject the assumption that Duknović made two or three angels with thick hair decorated with ribbons and roses as I. Delalle wrote, and also the idea that the best reliefs might be the work of Laurana 2 ̆ 7 s followers, as Venturi suggested. He does agree however, that the reliefs of the genii on the back and front of the pilasters of the triumphal arch iconographically, typologically and in quality can be distinguished from the others. In the two outside ones the doors are differently treated, and the two inner ones do not have doors at all. The genii are specific and typologically different in treatment: more graceful and more delicate. Author states that their prettyness helps us to notice the essential realistic vitality and authenticity of work that is definitely Nikola 2 ̆ 7 s. However, every individual work has its own range in quality, scale and variants of typology, so it is not always easy, to decide whether it is the highest reach of the same author or another author. Although he agrees with C. Fisković that, in quality, these reliefs are not better than others by Firentinac, another leaves open the possibility of a third author being involved because of their different character. For now it is most logical to presume that they are the work of Duknović. This assumption is supported by the fact that the four reliefs at the foot of the pilasters were not in the contract. They may have been added so as to offer the possibility, as hommage, to a great sculptor who happened to find himself in Trogir at the time, to leave his mark on the most important project and Renaissance monument in the town. This has already been proved in the case of two sculptures by Duknović in the same chapel, St. John Evangelist and St. Thomas. The genii of the east pilaster, (numbers 20 and 21) might be attributed to Duknović also beccause of the way the hair is treated in voluminous locks, and the round face (like the genius shieldbearer and torchbearer from the small Ćipiko Palace). The genius at the front has a high forehead, thicker hair, the flame of the torch has been treated in an original way and at the bottom of the torch there is a band, similar to those on the reliefs attributed to Duknović. If these assumptions are right, we may see the two front reliefs at the foot of the trimphal arch, as representation and competition between the two greates sculptors of 15 t h century Dalmatia: Firentinac (left) and Duknović (right). Treating the typology, an aspect in common to all the reliefs on the three walls of the chapel (numbers 3 to 19), is that the genii are emerging from double, cassetted doors, one wing parallel to the wall, and the other half opened towards the inside. The doors on the front of the bases of the pilasters are different, because one side has only three cassettes. The doors are opened from left or right, which accordingly means that the genii can be placed on the left or right side of the composition. The number of the left and right doors is the same, and they do not alternate in any special order. On some reliefs one side of the door is completely closed and on some it is slightly opened (this is mostly in Aleši 2 ̆ 7 s reliefs). Thre are also two types of torches: the first is a sheaf of thicker, straight sticks (usually three), it widens at the top and is connected spirally by a leather band. The second type consists of thinner sticks (usually five), tightened with transversal bands so they are slightly convex. In the first type the sticks are treated like cane (they have "joints"). The flame is treated in a realistic manner, so that a <b>separate</b> <b>tongue</b> of flame comes out of each stick. The variants and quality are mostly similar to that of the locks of hair. Although they are generally naked, some genii have some kind of clothing: one has a short dress (sleeveless tunic), two have shorts, two have leaves around their waist (vine leaves and ivy leaves), two have socks, and three of them have a piece of fluttering cloth around their sholuders, one has a rose wreath on his head and another has a flower. When it comes to quality Nikola 2 ̆ 7 s genii have harmonious proportions and the modelation is softer (Aleši 2 ̆ 7 s are often stocky and their heads are too big), the facial details are more delicate, the hair is treated in a livelier manner, often the classical hairstyle (while Aleši 2 ̆ 7 s sometimes have hair like a helmet, in block), their poses and gestures are more convincing and real (for example blowing into the torch, hiding their eyes), and especially the different position of their fingers (I have called one the Fagot Player because he is holding his torch like a musical instrument, 6), while Aleši 2 ̆ 7 s always hold their fingers pressed toghether and parallel. According to the interpretation of every single genius and to comparative analysis, the criteria being typology and quality, 12 reliefs can be attributed to Nikola Firentinac (numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20 ?, 21 ?). We can see from the numbering, that they were often put up in pairs. Aleši 2 ̆ 7 s are numbers 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 ?, 14, 15, 19 (four reliefs in a row: the very west one and three on the north wall are behind the altar). The difference in number of Nikola 2 ̆ 7 a and Aleši 2 ̆ 7 s reliefs may also support the thesis that at least two reliefs of high quality are the work of another author, probably Duknović, (numbers 20 and 21). All the author 2 ̆ 7 s studies to date, are collected and published in R. Ivančević, The Early Renaissance in Trogir, Split 1977. The book does not include two texts: R.

This represents a huge financial burden to healthcare officials and governments. To combat this approaching epidemic, this paper proposes a noninvasive method to detect DM and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), the initial stage of DR based on three groups of features extracted from tongue images. They include color, texture, and geometry. A noninvasive capture device with image correction first captures the tongue images. A tongue color gamut is established with 12 colors representing the tongue color features. The texture values of eight blocks strategically located on the tongue surface, with the additional mean of all eight blocks are used to characterize the nine tongue texture features. Finally, 13 features extracted from tongue images based on measurements, distances, areas, and their ratios represent the geometry features.

The resulting temperature field is measured simultaneously at eight points across {{the width of the}} layer using fast-response cold-wire thermometry. The results show the presence of large, hot structures <b>separated</b> by <b>tongues</b> of cool fluid that enter the layer from either side. The usual bell-shaped mean-temperature profiles therefore result from a duty cycle whereby a fixed probe sees alternating hot and cool fluid, which results in the local mean. The adiabatic flame temperature is not achieved in the mean, at any location across the layer. For fixed velocities, it is found that, in general, two different mean-temperature profiles result from a given pair of reactant compositions if the sides of the layer on which they are carried are exchanged (‘flipped’). This finding is a direct consequence of the asymmetric entrainment of fluid into the layer. Results are compared with the predictions of Konrad and discussed {{in the context of the}} Broadwell–Breidenthal model.

40|$|The {{importance}} of domesticating and integrating high value fruit trees in agricultural landscapes by farmers is increasingly being {{recognized in the}} humid tropics. However in an agroforestry context, the growth attributes of intercropped trees above and belowground determine whether the association will be complementary or competitive. The focus of the present research was on two African indigenous fruit tree species (Dacryodes edulis G. Don) H. J. Lam (Burseraceae) and Allanblackia floribunda Oliv. (Clusiaceae), which are currently under domestication, and have high food, income and environmental security values. On D. edulis, the thrust was to assess and compare the structural and fine rooting systems together with the aboveground growth attributes of fruiting trees propagated sexually and vegetatively, while on A. floribunda, {{the focus was on}} how to reduce the long juvenile phase of about 10 - 12 years before first fruiting to less than 5 years through grafting techniques. The results of the investigations on D. edulis indicate that trees of seed origin were characterized by a tap root, reaching depths of about 1. 20 m, whereas, trees of cutting origin showed three strong vertical roots (d > 5 mm) with the longest reaching depths of 1. 31 m. Similarly, trees of marcot origin were observed to have thick, relatively short prominent vertical roots, reaching depths of 1. 15 m. In addition, trees of seed origin had greater fine root density (RD) (P ≤ 0. 001) than trees of vegetative origin (cuttings and marcots) in the upper soil stratum (0 - 30 cm). Trees of seed origin were also shown to have an exponential distribution pattern for fine root density and root length within depth to 80 cm. In contrast, the distribution pattern of fine roots of trees of vegetative origin (cuttings and marcots) were quadratic for the same variables which increased in the 20 - 30 cm soil depth stratum before declining steadily to a depth of 80 cm. Furthermore, shoot density, defined as, number of shoots per tree, and height differed significantly (p= 0. 004 and p= 0. 005, respectively) amongst tree origins. Trees of seed and cutting origins had single-stem shoots whereas marcots had 6 shoots per tree on average. Trees of cutting origin grew tallest, with mean height of 8. 4 ± 2. 2 m compared to 6. 7 ± 0. 9 m and 7. 6 ± 1. 9 m for trees of marcot or seed origins respectively. Mean carbon (C) sequestration estimated using allometric models differed significantly (p= 0. 014) between trees of vegetative origin and those of seed origin, with 10 years old D. edulis trees of cutting and marcot origins sequestrating averagely 26. 8 ± 19. 1 Mg C ha- 1 and 21. 74 ± 12. 8 Mg C ha- 1 respectively over 10 years, compared to 13. 10 ± 9. 4 Mg C ha- 1 for trees of seed origin. In summary, the results from the studies on D. edulis suggest that vegetative propagation on the species, besides reducing the long juvenile phase to fruiting and maintaining trueness in the transfer of desirable traits over generations, also results in trees that are apparently less competitive for belowground resources. In addition, vegetative propagated trees of D. edulis were shown to have apparently stable root system and the trees bigger in stature and higher in carbon sinks than trees of seed origin. In parallel, A. floribunda scions were taken from female trees, and grafted onto rootstocks using side tongue, top cleft, side veneer, and whip-and-tongue methods under nursery conditions. In a <b>separate</b> experiment, side <b>tongue</b> and inverted ‘T’ budding methods were also tested in situ on young A. floribunda wildings growing under semi-deciduous and evergreen tree covers. In addition, the effects of protecting side tongue grafts with non-perforated, translucent plastic, perforated translucent plastic and aluminium foil were assessed. A. floribunda was shown to be amenable to grafting both under nursery and field (in situ) conditions. Under nursery conditions, side tongue grafts were significantly more successful (80. 0 ± 6. 3 %), than grafts of side veneer (52. 5 ± 7. 9 %), top cleft (55. 0 ± 7. 9 %) and whip–and-tongue (50. 0 ± 7. 9 %). The success of side tongue grafts was further increased (86. 7 ± 6. 2 %) under evergreen shade when grafts were protected by non-perforated translucent plastic. A grafted A. floribunda tree transplanted in the field in 2007 flowered and carried a single fruit to maturity after 4 years, thereby reducing the long juvenile period to first fruit production of about 10 - 12 years reported in literature to less than 5 years. In conclusion, the effect of propagation methods on the belowground and aboveground growth attributes and their C storage potential studied in the present research on D. edulis, have not yet been studied and published anywhere according to the authors knowledge. Similarly, the reduced long juvenile period to first fruit production to less than 5 years in A. floribunda grafts reported in this research is the first published prove of concept on this species according to the author’s knowledge. Therefore, the research results presented in this thesis should be considered as pilot case studies aimed at obtaining insights into the effect of vegetative propagation methods on the above and belowground growth and development of improved planting materials of these two African indigenous fruit trees (Dacryodes edulis and Allanblackia floribunda) under domestication...|$|R
