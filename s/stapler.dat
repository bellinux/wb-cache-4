25|$|John Ross was {{introduced}} to the <b>Stapler</b> family of Brandywine Springs, Delaware by Thomas McKenney in 1841. Ross had many common interests with John <b>Stapler,</b> a merchant and widower. His eldest daughter, Sarah, cared for her younger siblings and befriended Ross. However, her younger sister, Mary Brian <b>Stapler,</b> developed a real love for Ross and initiated a romantic attachment in May 1844. As the time came for Ross to return to the Indian Territory, their mutual love ripened. They married in Philadelphia on September 2, 1844.|$|E
25|$|Commander Allen G. Quynn, Ashevilles captain, sent Marines {{from the}} ship's {{detachment}} ashore {{to guard the}} American hospital; the Chinese nurses there particularly appreciated the Marines' presence, fearing a repetition of outrages by the Japanese that had occurred when they had taken Nanking in December 1937. Anchored within 300 yards of the Bund, Asheville kept a careful watch on {{the activities of the}} Japanese. One occasion the ship's medical people provided first aid to two badly wounded Chinese women-who had been shot by a Japanese sentry-taken on board from a sampan. Transferred to the American hospital as soon as possible, one of the unfortunate women died several days later. Soon thereafter, , with Captain John T. G. <b>Stapler,</b> Commander, South China Patrol, embarked, arrived at Amoy, releasing Asheville to proceed back to Swatow. A little over a year later, Asheville again proceeded to the port of Swatow, and witnessed its occupation by the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Most {{polystyrene}} {{products are}} currently not recycled {{due to the}} lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. Due to the low density of polystyrene foam, it is not economical to collect. However, if the waste material goes through an initial compaction process, the material changes density from typically 30kg/m3 to 330kg/m3 and becomes a recyclable commodity of high value for producers of recycled plastic pellets. Expanded polystyrene scrap can be easily added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications; many manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap because of collection issues. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into products such as clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, <b>stapler</b> bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS. Currently, around 100 tonnes of EPS are recycled every month in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>staplers</b> {{are used}} to join {{multiple}} sheets of paper. Paper <b>staplers</b> come in two distinct types: manual and electric. Manual <b>staplers</b> are normally hand-held, although models that are used while set on a desk or other surface are not uncommon. Electric <b>staplers</b> exist {{in a variety of}} different designs and models. Their primary operating function is to join large numbers of paper sheets together in rapid succession. Some electric <b>staplers</b> can join up to 20 sheets at a time. [...] Typical <b>staplers</b> are a third-class lever.|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>staplers</b> {{continue}} to evolve and adapt to the changing habits of users. Less-effort, or easy-squeeze / use <b>staplers,</b> for example, make use of different leverage efficiencies {{to reduce the amount}} of force the user need apply. As a result, these <b>staplers</b> tend to be used in work environments where repetitive, large stapling jobs are routine.|$|R

500|$|The episode debuted {{the series}} as a midseason {{replacement}} for the 2004–05 season. The pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the British version. Daniels had decided {{to go through this}} route because [...] "completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do" [...] due to the show being an adaptation. Although the episode was primarily adapted from the first episode of the British series, it was partially re-scripted in an attempt to [...] "Americanize" [...] it. [...] Jokes such as Dwight's <b>stapler</b> being put in Jell-O by Jim were transferred verbatim from the original series, while others were only slightly changed. [...] Although later reshot, a scene in which Jim tapes pencils to his desk was originally filmed as a parallel to a scene in the British version, in which Tim Canterbury stacks up cardboard boxes in front of Gareth Keenan to restrict Keenan's view of Canterbury. [...] "Pilot" [...] was filmed almost six months prior to beginning of filming on the second episode of the season, [...] "Diversity Day". The Office used no laugh tracks in the [...] "Pilot", wanting its [...] "deadpan" [...] and [...] "absurd" [...] humor to fully come across.|$|E

5000|$|Saddle stitch <b>staplers</b> {{or simply}} saddle <b>staplers</b> are {{bookbinding}} tools designed to insert staples into the spine (saddle) of folded printed matter such as booklets, catalogues, brochures, and manuals.

2500|$|Comedy Central premiered Office Space on August 5, 2001 and 1.4 {{million viewers}} tuned in. By 2003, the channel had {{broadcast}} the film another 35 times. These broadcasts {{helped develop the}} film's cult following and Ron Livingston remembers being approached by college students and office workers. He said, [...] "I {{get a lot of}} people who say, 'I quit my job because of you.' That's kind of a heavy load to carry." [...] People approached Stephen Root asking him to sign their staplers. The red Swingline <b>stapler</b> featured prominently in the film was not available until April 2002 when the company released it in response to repeated requests by fans of the film. Its appearance in the film was achieved by taking a standard Swingline <b>stapler</b> and spray-painting it red.|$|E

She finally says, [...] "I thought you said, 'School's out forever.'" [...] Alice is shown behind the cart, saying, [...] "The song goes 'School's out for summer'. Nice try, though." [...] The hit song then plays as supplies are shown. The tagline, [...] "That was easy", is heard playing over the company logo, formed to resemble a <b>stapler.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Dwight is {{frequently}} {{the victim of}} practical jokes by co-workers Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly, including putting his desk supplies in the snack machine, putting his <b>stapler</b> into jello, and moving his desk into the men's restroom, although it appears that he remains oblivious to Pam's involvement; these pranks tend to exploit his stubborn and gullible nature. Dwight's frustration with Jim's pranks reaches a crisis point in [...] "Conflict Resolution", when Dwight threatens to quit unless Jim is transferred. Dwight occasionally pulls successful pranks on Jim in turn, most prominently in [...] "Classy Christmas" [...] where he subjects Jim to a barrage of pranks revolving around snowballs. Professionally, Dwight wins the 2005 Salesman of the Year Award, although, this is likely due to, at least in part, his theft of Jim's largest client.|$|E

2500|$|This melakha {{refers to}} an act of {{completing}} an object and bringing it into its final useful form. For example, if {{the pages of a}} newspaper were poorly separated, slicing them open would constitute [...] "applying the finishing touch". Ribiat, infra. Using a <b>stapler</b> involves transgressing [...] "applying the finishing touch" [...] in regard to the staple, which is brought into its final useful form by the act. Ribiat, infra. Adding hot water to a pre-made 'noodle-soup-pot' type cup (a dehydrated mixture of freeze-dried seasoning and noodles) would be the final act of completion for such a food as the manufacturer desired to make the product incomplete awaiting the consumer to finish the cooking process at their convenience.

2500|$|The hat {{became so}} iconic that the filmmakers could only {{come up with}} very good reasons or jokes to remove it.

In jest, Ford put a <b>stapler</b> against his head to stop his hat from falling off when a {{documentary}} crew visited during shooting of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. This created the urban legend that Ford stapled the hat to his head. Anytime Indy's hat accidentally came off as part of the storyline (blown off by the wind, knocked off, etc.) and seemed almost irretrievable, filmmakers would make sure Indy and his hat were always reunited, regardless of the implausibility of its return. Although other hats were also used throughout the films, the general style and profile remained the same. Elements of the outfit include: ...|$|E

2500|$|Four RCMP officers, Constables Gerry Rundel, Bill Bentley, Kwesi Millington, and {{supervisor}} Corporal Benjamin Robinson, {{arrived and}} entered the Customs room where Dziekański was pacing about. They apparently directed him to stand near a counter, to which Dziekański complied but picked up a <b>stapler</b> sometime after being told to place his hands on a counter. Shortly thereafter, about 25 seconds after arriving at the scene, Corporal Robinson ordered the Taser to be used. Constable Millington tasered Dziekański. He began to convulse and was tasered several more times after falling to the ground, where the four officers pinned, handcuffed, and continued to taser him. One eyewitness, who recorded the incident on her cellphone, told CBC News that Dziekański had been tasered four times. [...] "The third and fourth ones were at the same time" [...] delivered by the officers at Dziekański's right and left, just before Dziekański fell. According to B.C. Crown counsel spokesman Stan Lowe, Dziekański was tasered {{a total of five}} times. Constable Millington testified that he deployed the Taser four times, but he believed that in some of those instances the probes may not have contacted Dziekański's body. Dziekański writhed and screamed before he stopped moving. Cpl. Benjamin Monty Robinson stated he then checked for a pulse, but his heart had stopped. [...] Testimony from the other RCMP officers state they never saw anyone including Robinson check for a pulse. Dziekański did not receive CPR until paramedics arrived on the scene approximately 15 minutes later. They were unable to revive him and pronounced him dead at the scene.|$|E
