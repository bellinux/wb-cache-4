40|$|A phase separator, which {{separates}} helium vapor from liquid superfluid helium (He II), is {{an indispensable}} device for <b>space</b> <b>cryogenics.</b> The most recent {{approach to the}} Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) uses a new design concept in which only the detector package is cold at launch, {{the remainder of the}} telescope being subsequently cooled to operating temperature on orbit. Therefore, a large dynamic operational range is required of the cryogen system. This is a report of initial laboratory test results with candidate porous plugs as phase separators. Mass flow rates and pressure and temperature differences across a porous plug were measured in this experiment. Relatively large mass flow rates were observed even at small pressure differences.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the factors}} {{influencing}} contact resistance is important for optimizing system design in cryogenic applications. In <b>space</b> <b>cryogenics,</b> indirect cooling of infrared components is the primary concern. The presence of bolted joints results in contact resistances which can dominate all other contributions to the overall heat transfer rate. Here, thermal and electrical contact resistances measured between 4 K and 290 K {{for a series of}} bolted OFHC Cu contacts are reported. Surface roughness is found to have little effect on the overall contact resistance within the experimental limits, while oxidation can increase the contact resistance by as much as a factor of 100. Thermal and electrical contact resistances measured on the same contact show that the contact resistance temperature dependence does not follow the bulk dependence. For example, the residual resistance ratio (RRR) of the OFHC Cu is 110, but for contacts made from this material, the RRR is about two...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{need for}} {{cryogenic}} cooling in space has become of increasing importance with time. In many space sciences projects cryogenic detectors {{are essential for}} the accomplishment of the scientific objectives. Several other components such as the optics can benefit from a cryogenic cooling which reduces the radiative loading on the detectors. The current trend in space cryogenic is to develop cryogen free satellite, i. e. suppress the liquid reservoir for mechanical coolers. Although liquid cryostat is a straightforward technique, it leads to heavy reservoirs and structures and by essence limits the mission duration. For low temperature, several systems must be chained together to cover the temperature range, which now extends to 50 mK for some future space missions. Obviously the overall performance of the cryogenic chain depends {{on the performance of}} each links, on their ability to operate together and finally on the compatibility with the detectors. The use of mechanical coolers can require dedicated devices to distribute the cooling effect far from the cooler cold head and/or to deal with the temperature stability and limited instant cooling power. For decades development programs have been carried out to produce space cryocoolers able to provide net heat lifts at various temperature. At the European level, the laboratories and industries involved in <b>space</b> <b>cryogenics</b> are now in a position to propose full cryogenic chains from ambient temperature down to 20 mK. In this paper we give an overview through selected examples, and a particular focus on European developments is made...|$|E
