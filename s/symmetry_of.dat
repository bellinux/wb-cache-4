In diamond, only defects of the following symmetries have been observed thus far: tetrahedral (Td), tetragonal (D2d), trigonal (D3d,C3v), rhombic (C2v), monoclinic (C2h, C1h, C2) and triclinic (C1 or CS).|$|E

5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling {{in which}} each tile is a regular polygon and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a <b>symmetry</b> <b>of</b> the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings {{additionally}} are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E

40|$|We propose an {{automatic}} method for finding <b>symmetries</b> <b>of</b> 3 D shapes, that is, isometric transforms which leave a shape globally unchanged.

5|$|In {{chemical}} fields, such as crystallography, space {{groups and}} point groups describe molecular symmetries and crystal symmetries. These symmetries underlie {{the chemical and}} physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of quantum mechanical analysis of these properties.

5|$|The {{electromagnetic}} field {{can be understood}} as a gauge field, i.e., as a field that results from requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently at every position in spacetime. For the {{electromagnetic field}}, this gauge symmetry is the Abelian U(1) <b>symmetry</b> <b>of</b> complex numbers of absolute value 1, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex field without affecting observables or real valued functions made from it, such as the energy or the Lagrangian.|$|E

5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high <b>symmetry</b> <b>of</b> crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E
5|$|For illustration, if a {{physical}} system behaves the same, {{regardless of how}} it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the <b>symmetry</b> <b>of</b> the physical laws governing the system {{is responsible for the}} conservation law. As another example, if {{a physical}} experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes {{an element of the}} group and an element of the set and returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of <b>symmetry</b> <b>of</b> space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E
