50|$|Flowers on C. lacustris occur along <b>spikes</b> or spikelets, an elongated, tightly-packed type of {{inflorescence}} (flower cluster) {{that contain}} many small florets. Plants typically have 4-8 green <b>spikes,</b> 2-4 upper <b>spikes</b> that are male (staminate <b>spikes),</b> and 2-4 lower <b>spikes</b> that are female (pistillate <b>spikes).</b> The male <b>spikes</b> are narrow, 3-4 mm wide, 1-8 cm long, and are short-lived. The female <b>spikes</b> are thick, 10-15 mm wide, and 2-10 cm long, either sessile (stalkless) or on short stalks, with 50-100 well-separated florets. <b>Spikes</b> are generally erect, with lower <b>spikes</b> sometimes nodding, {{and they are}} sometimes compound. The olive-green perigynium is 5.5-7.3 mm long, hairless, distinctly ribbed, and gradually tapers into a beak. Thin female scales are ovate (tapered at tip) and awned, translucent to purplish or brown in color, and half {{the length of the}} perigynia.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this case}} report was to study the {{relationship}} between high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), <b>spikes,</b> and seizures in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy. IntroductionDuring intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), HFOs {{are thought to be}} a marker for the seizure onset zone (SOZ). High-frequency oscillations are classified into ripples with frequencies of 70 – 200 Hz and fast ripples with frequencies of 200 – 500 Hz. Although HFOs are thought to be a marker for the SOZ, their relationship to <b>spikes</b> has not been studied in detail, especially within the SOZ. MethodsWe studied the time course of ripples and <b>spikes</b> in a patient undergoing intracranial EEG. Medications were discontinued on day one. She suffered three seizures on day three. Her SOZ was in the left hippocampus, which displayed abundant ripples and <b>spikes.</b> Ripples, <b>spikes</b> with simultaneous ripples, and <b>spikes</b> without ripples were counted for this study. ResultsWe found that ripples and <b>spikes</b> in the SOZ had a marked diurnal variation. Ripples, <b>spikes</b> with ripples, and <b>spikes</b> without ripples increased and decreased in concert until just before seizure onset, when ripples and <b>spikes</b> with ripples increased markedly. <b>Spikes</b> without ripples did not increase. ConclusionsThese results support ripples as a marker for SOZ and show that they co-occur with <b>spikes.</b> Seizure onset was heralded by an increase in ripples and <b>spikes</b> with ripples, without an increase in <b>spikes</b> without ripples. We hypothesize that <b>spikes</b> associated with ripples may have a somewhat different pathophysiological mechanism than <b>spikes</b> not associated with ripples, differences that may be relevant for the timing of seizure onset...|$|R

30|$|For {{discrete}} input simulations, the server's DPM {{performs the}} itemizing operation, {{instead of the}} binning operation, in both of the HWC and LWC modes, before pushing a chunk of <b>spikes</b> to the queue. The itemizing operation divides the chunk of <b>spikes</b> into groups, each with a fixed number of <b>spikes</b> (e.g., 20) for efficient queue management. For example, when the fixed number of <b>spikes</b> for a group is 20 and the DPM receives a chunk which has 30 <b>spikes,</b> the first 20 <b>spikes</b> in the chunk are pushed in the queue as a group. Then, another group composed of the remaining 10 <b>spikes</b> and another 10 <b>spikes</b> being assigned an arbitrary value (e.g., zero) is queued. A counter is used to track the number of real <b>spikes</b> so that the arbitrary valued <b>spikes</b> are never used.

5|$|After <b>Spike</b> recovers {{and has a}} final {{talk with}} Rashid, he and Elektra are {{captured}} by Cherious Medical, who want to suppress all knowledge of the nanomachines' existence. The two escape from Cherious Medical, grabbing the newly produced vaccine on the way. In turn, Faye escapes after Vincent goes to trigger {{an attack on the}} city that will eventually kill everyone on Mars. After the group reunites, it is determined that Vincent will spread the nanomachines by exploding the giant jack-o'-lantern balloons used in the Halloween parade: Jet has a troop of old aircraft spread the antibodies over the city while Faye heads for the weather control center and causes it to rain on the city, aiding the spread of the vaccine. <b>Spike</b> and Elektra separately head to confront Vincent. <b>Spike</b> arrives first and the two battle to a standstill, then the nanomachines are released and <b>Spike</b> is temporarily weakened by them. As Vincent prepares to kill him, Elektra arrives and shoots Vincent. Having wanted to die since Titan, Vincent does not defend himself and thanks Elektra for their time together before dying.|$|E

However, the chip does not affect him when he harms demons and he now often fights on Buffy's side, after at first fighting just {{for the pleasure of}} brawling. His motivations changed when, in the fifth season, <b>Spike</b> realized he {{had fallen in love with}} Buffy. She initially rejected him, but after and just before her death they had begun to form a friendship of sorts. She has been confiding in him; prior to this episode, he is the only one to whom Buffy has revealed that she was in heaven.|$|E
40|$|The {{computational}} {{repertoire of}} neurons {{is enhanced by}} regenerative electrical signals initiated in dendrites. These events, referred to as dendritic <b>spikes,</b> can act as cell-intrinsic amplifiers of synaptic input. Among these signals, dendritic NMDA <b>spikes</b> are of interest {{in light of their}} correlation with synaptic LTP induction. Because {{it is not possible to}} block NMDA <b>spikes</b> pharmacologically while maintaining NMDA receptors available to initiate synaptic plasticity, it remains unclear whether NMDA <b>spikes</b> alone can trigger LTP. Here we use dendritic recordings and calcium imaging to analyse the role of NMDA <b>spikes</b> in associative LTP in CA 3 pyramidal cells. We show that NMDA <b>spikes</b> produce regenerative branch-specific calcium transients. Decreasing the probability of NMDA <b>spikes</b> reduces LTP, whereas increasing their probability enhances LTP. NMDA <b>spikes</b> and LTP occur without back-propagating action potentials. However, action potentials can facilitate LTP induction by promoting NMDA <b>spikes.</b> Thus, NMDA <b>spikes</b> are necessary and sufficient to produce the critical postsynaptic depolarization required for associative LTP in CA 3 pyramidal cells...|$|R
40|$|Besides usual <b>spikes</b> {{employed}} in <b>spiking</b> neural P systems, we consider "anti-spikes", which participate in <b>spiking</b> and forgetting rules, but also annihilate <b>spikes</b> when {{meeting in the}} same neuron. This simple extension of <b>spiking</b> neural P systems is shown to considerably simplify the universality proofs in this area: all rules become of the form bc ! b 0 or bc ! ¸, where b; b 0 are <b>spikes</b> or anti-spikes. Therefore, the regular expressions which control the <b>spiking</b> are the simplest possible, identifying only a singleton. A possible variation is not to produce anti-spikes in neurons, but to consider some "inhibitory synapses", which transform the <b>spikes</b> which pass along them into anti- <b>spikes.</b> Also in this case, universality is rather easy to obtain, with rules of the above simple forms.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the influence of}} seizures and carbamazepine (CBZ) on <b>spiking</b> rates in kindled cats. In the first experiment, <b>spiking</b> rates were measured before and after seizures, with and without CBZ. CBZ was administered immediately after seizures {{in order not to}} affect them. <b>Spiking</b> rates were measured over 9 h during the different sleep stages. In a second experiment, CBZ was administered before and after seizures so as to affect seizure strength and thus measure its effect on <b>spiking.</b> Results confirmed earlier findings of a large increase in <b>spiking</b> following a stage 6 seizure in fully kindled animals. We also established that: (1) repeated daily seizures caused a further increase in <b>spiking</b> until a ceiling was reached; (2) increased <b>spiking</b> was not a direct effect of postictal alterations in sleep stages; (3) CBZ, despite its effectiveness as an anticonvulsant, did not reduce <b>spiking</b> but rather increased it; (4) postictal increases in <b>spiking</b> were related to seizure 'strength'. These findings support the hypothesis that <b>spiking</b> rates are primarily influenced by seizure occurrence, as was found in patients with temporal lobe seizures, and that anticonvulsants act differently on seizures and <b>spikes.</b> This emphasizes the possibility of distinct pathophysiological mechanisms for interictal <b>spikes</b> and seizures...|$|R

The Publisher's final version can be found by following the DOI link. <b>Spiking</b> Neural P Systems are Neural System models characterised {{by the fact that}} each neuron mimics a biological cell and the communication between neurons is based on <b>spikes.</b> In the <b>Spiking</b> Neural P systems investigated so far, the application of evolution rules depends on the contents of a neuron (checked by means of a regular expression). In these P systems, a speci ed number of <b>spikes</b> are consumed and a speci ed number of <b>spikes</b> are produced, and then sent to each of the neurons linked by a synapse to the evolving neuron. In the present work, a novel communication strategy among neurons of <b>Spiking</b> Neural P Systems is proposed. In the resulting models, called <b>Spiking</b> Neural P Systems with Communication on Request, the <b>spikes</b> are requested from neighbouring neurons, depending on the contents of the neuron (still checked by means of a regular expression). Unlike the traditional <b>Spiking</b> Neural P systems, no <b>spikes</b> are consumed or created: the <b>spikes</b> are only moved along synapses and replicated (when two or more neurons request the contents of the same neuron). The <b>Spiking</b> Neural P Systems with Communication on Request are proved to be computationally universal, that is, equivalent with Turing machines as long as two types of <b>spikes</b> are used. Following this work, further research questions are listed to be open problems...|$|R

5|$|Purkinje cells {{form the}} heart of the {{cerebellar}} circuit, and their large size and distinctive activity patterns have made it relatively easy to study their response patterns in behaving animals using extracellular recording techniques. Purkinje cells normally emit action potentials at a high rate {{even in the absence of}} the synaptic input. In awake, behaving animals, mean rates averaging around 40Hz are typical. The <b>spike</b> trains show a mixture of what are called simple and complex spikes. A simple <b>spike</b> is a single action potential followed by a refractory period of about 10ms; a complex <b>spike</b> is a stereotyped sequence of action potentials with very short inter-spike intervals and declining amplitudes. Physiological studies have shown that complex spikes (which occur at baseline rates around 1Hz and never at rates much higher than 10Hz) are reliably associated with climbing fiber activation, while simple spikes are produced by a combination of baseline activity and parallel fiber input. Complex spikes are often followed by a pause of several hundred milliseconds during which simple <b>spike</b> activity is suppressed.|$|E
