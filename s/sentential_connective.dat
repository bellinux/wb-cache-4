This study used a visual world {{paradigm}} experiment to explore how this merging process proceeds online. We first presented participants with a short animation, illustrating different simple propositions that are possible to be merged by the sentential connectives.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate how people reason with “only ” as a quantifier. An assertion such as “only artists are beekeepers ” has the same truth conditions as “ah beekeepers are artists, ” but we argue that it makes explicit both {{the relation between the}} two sets and the relation between their complements, i. e., an individual who is not an artist is not a beekeeper. Experiment 1 confiied our expectation that this additional complexity would lead subjects to draw fewer logically correct conclusions from pairs of premises containing “only ” than from equivalent pairs containing “all. ” We outline a putative representation of “only ” in terms of a theory of reasoning based on mental models. Experiment 2 confiied this theory’s predictions about the most frequent errors and the relative difEculty of different sorts of inferences from a premise containing “only ” and another premise in a mood based on “all, ” “some, ” “no, ” or “some-not. ” Experiment 3 corroborated the prediction that modus tollens would occur more often with an “only ” premise than with an “ah ” premise, because of the former’s explicit representation of the negative relation.

40|$|This {{document}} was {{originally intended to}} be a section of Schagrin, Morton L.; Rapaport, William J.; & Dipert, Randall R. (1985), Logic: A Computer Approach (New York: McGraw-Hill). This document discusses the ternary (i. e., 3 -place) if-then-else <b>sentential</b> <b>connective,</b> which is based on the if-then-else instruction of computer programming languages. Before we begin, however, we should look closely at an important difference between the use of if-then (and of if-then-else) in programming languages and its use in sentential (i. e., propositional) logic. In most logic texts (e. g., Shagrin et al. 1985) that are about the logic of declarative sentences—i. e., sentences, expressing propositions, that can be either true or false—the antecedent and consequent of a conditional sentence are themselves declarative sentences. But in an “imperative ” programming language such as Basic or Pascal, an if-then statement is really a conditional instruction or command whose antecedent is a delcarative sentence but whose consequent is an instruction or command, i. e., an imperative sentence. Thus, whereas in sentential logic we are interested in conditional sentences such as: If Ann goes to the party, then Bob will go to the party in many programming languages, we would be interested in conditional instructions such as...|$|E

Thus: 'all men are mortal'. The logical constants such as [...] "all", [...] "no" [...] and so on, plus <b>sentential</b> <b>connectives</b> such as [...] "and" [...] and [...] "or" [...] were called syncategorematic terms (from the Greek kategorei - to predicate, and syn - together with).

40|$|The {{mental model}} theory postulates that the {{meanings}} of assertions, and knowledge about their context can modulate the logical meaning of <b>sentential</b> <b>connectives,</b> such as ‘‘if’’ and ‘‘or’’. One known effect of modulation is to block the representation of possibilities to which a proposition refers. But, modulation should also add relational information, such as temporal order, to models of possibilities. Three experiments tested this prediction. Experiment 1 showed that individuals spontaneously matched the tense of their conclusions (in Portuguese) to embody implied, but unexpressed, temporal relations in conditional premises. Experiment 2 demonstrated the same phenomenon in inferences from disjunctions.

40|$|Obviously (1) and (3) {{need not}} have the same truth-value. This is because (2 c) and (4) may differ in their truth-value. This {{resistance}} to substitution shows that the subject noun phrase even Leo induces intensionality and the intensional position is the position taken by the verb phrase. Two points to conclude. First, notice that although the intensionality above is related to the intensionality of sentential operators in (2 c) or (4), where the verbs explicitly expressing surprise are present, we cannot say that this form of intensionality is thus reduced to sentential intensionality. This is because (1) is not equivalent to (2 c) and (3) is not equivalent to (4). Second, the intensionality just exhibited occurs in very simple sen-tences, that is sentences which do not contain modals or propositional attitude verbs, nor, by contrast with examples discussed in Saul 1997, do they contain <b>sentential</b> <b>connectives...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{theory of}} how {{individuals}} construct mental models to draw inferences from single premises was tested in three experiments. Experiment 1 confirmed a counterintuitive prediction {{that it is}} easier to generate inferences between conditionals and disjunctions than it is to evaluate them. Experiment 2 replicated this finding, but an advantage found in the first experiment for conditional-to-disjunction over disjunction-to-conditional inferences was removed with different sentence contents. Experiment 3 showed that disjunction-to-conditional inferences were facilitated when premises expressed familiar indicative relations, whereas conditional-to-disjunction inferences were facilitated when premises expressed causal relations. The results indicate that small changes in task format can have large effects on the strategies that people use to represent and reason about different <b>sentential</b> <b>connectives.</b> We discuss the potential for theories other than mental models to account for these results.

40|$|Collocational word {{similarity}} {{is considered}} a source of text cohesion {{that is hard to}} measure and quantify. The work presented here explores the use of information from a training corpus in measuring word similarity and evaluates the method in the text segmentation task. An implementation, the VetTile system, produces similarity curves over. texts using pre-compiled vector representations of the contextual behavior of words. The performance of this system is shown to improve over that of the purely string-based TextTiling algorithm (Hearst, 1997). I Background The notion of text cohesion rests on the intuition that a text is "held together" by a variety of internal forces. Much of the relevant linguistic literature is indebted to Halliday and Hasan (1976), where co- hesion is defined as a network of relationships be- tween locations in the text, arising from (i) grammatical factors (co-reference, use of pro-forms, ellipsis and <b>sentential</b> <b>connectives),</b> and (ii) lexical factors (reiteration and collocation). Subsequent work has further developed this taxonomy (Hoey, 1991) and explored its implications in such areas as paragraphing (Longacre, 1979; Bond and Hayes, 1984; Stark, 1988), relevance (Sperber and Wilson, 1995) and discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) ...|$|R
40|$|Do Russellian propositions {{have their}} {{constituents}} as parts? One reason for thinking not {{is that if}} they did, they would generate apparent counterexamples to plausible mereological principles. As Frege noted, {{they would be in}} tension with the transitivity of parthood. A certain small rock is a part of Etna but not of the proposition that Etna is higher than Vesuvius. So, if Etna were a part of the given proposition, parthood would fail to be transitive. As William Bynoe has noted (speaking of facts rather than propositions), they would seem to violate certain supplementation principles. Consider the singular proposition, concerning identity, that it is identical with itself. Given the relevant form of Russellianism, this proposition would have identity as a proper part, but it would not have any parts disjoint from identity, and indeed it would not have even a single pair of disjoint parts, in violation of various supplementation principles. This chapter offers a unified solution to the problems about transitivity and supplementation. One key ingredient in the solution is the view that parthood is a four-place relation expressed by ‘x at y is a part of z at w’. Another key ingredient is the view that the semantic contents of predicates and <b>sentential</b> <b>connectives</b> have ‘slots’ or ‘argument positions’ in them. (Both ingredients are independently motivated elsewhere.) Four-place analogues of the transitivity and supplementation principles are set out, and it is argued that these are not threatened by the examples from Frege and Bynoe...|$|R
