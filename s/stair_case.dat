The interior wall of the gallery was alternately ornamented with stags' heads or other trophies of the chase, and coats of arms blazoned in stucco. The Prince did the honours of the castle to Vivian with great courtesy. The armoury and the hall, the knights chamber, and even the donjon-keep, were all examined; and when Vivian had sufficiently admired the antiquity of the structure and the beauty of the situation, the Prince, having proceeded down a long corridor, opened the door into a small chamber, which he introduced to Vivian as his cabinet. The furniture of this room was rather quaint, and not unpleasing. The wainscot and ceiling were painted alike, of a light green colour, and were richly carved and gilt. The walls were hung with green velvet, of which material were also the chairs, and a sofa, which was placed under a large and curiously-cut looking glass. The lower panes of the windows of this room were of stained glass, of vivid tints; but the upper panes were untinged, in order that the light should not be disturbed which fell through them upon two magnificent pictures; one a hunting-piece, by Schneiders, and the other a portrait of an armed chieftain on horseback, by Lucas Cranach.|$|E

For sufficiently wide stairs, a rail is mounted to the treads of the stairs. A chair or lifting platform is attached to the rail.

This lift runs on electric power and consists of a motor, reduction gear box, rope drive, two rails a sliding chair. In this system we use DC motor for changing the polarity of the power supply which will make the motor run in reverse direction connected with the earlier, while the later will form the entire assembly run to in downward direction, with the help of Toggle switches and push buttons. Advantages over the conventional hydraulic lift are no civil structure and alteration is required, low cost, less bulkiness, less power, less maintenance requires. Easy design, easy installations. Can be of industrial use too. Moreover, considering some drawbacks due to weight carrying capacity completely depend upon the capacity of motor.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this world}} of {{constantly}} increasing population and depleting resources there is urge to adopt cost effective and ecofriendly structures. These papers discuss the potential of bamboo and project the possibilities of usage of bamboo in the construction field. Bamboo is an ancient solution for the present day problem. Bamboo is an appropriate substitute for the present convention building material such as steel and wood. The main characteristic of the bamboo {{which makes it a}} suitable building material is it’s high tensile strength which is equivalent to mild steel at the yield point and very good weight strength ratio making it high resilient against the forces created by the earth quakes and hurricanes. Bamboo can replace 70 % of steel and wood used in the construction and reduce the cost by 40 %. Bamboo can be used from scaffolding to every stage of construction like in footings, beams, columns, slabs, <b>stair</b> <b>cases,</b> doors, windows etc. Bamboo is the renewable resource with amazing growth rate, rejuvenates the soil and grows in varied climatic conditions. Bamboo absorbs carbon dioxide and releases 35 % more oxygen into the atmosphere than other hardwood trees. There are few building codes also available for the usage of bamboo in the construction such as ISO 22156 : 2004 Bamboo structural design, ISO 22157 : 2004 Bamboo physical and mechanical properties, IS 9096 : 1979 Code of practice for preservation of bamboo for structural purposes. Thus bamboo is environmental friendly, energy efficient and cost effective material...|$|R

40|$|Pressurized <b>stair</b> <b>cases</b> are an {{important}} part of the Fire Safety Strategy of high rise buildings. Long egress times are compensated by creating safe environments within egress staircases allowing considering the displacement time within those stairs as time where occupants can be considered safe. The main mechanisms by which stairs are “made safe ” are by guaranteeing structural protection of the enclosure and by elevating the pressure within the stair to ensure that smoke can not enter. Despite the critical importance of this element of the Fire Safety Strategy, the analysis and implementation of these systems remain simplified. Simple models have been developed using Bernoulli type formulations that account for static pressure and empirical constants to calculate flows through doors and other leakage areas. Implementation of these systems is even more simplified, consisting mainly of a direct feedback loop that controls a fan output on the basis of a pressure measurement inside the stair. The flow induced by the fan guarantees a minimum pressure. The pressure inside the stair needs to be limited to enable doors to be open, thus pressure dampers are introduced to release airflow in the event the pressure exceeds a specified maximum. Validation of these methodologies was done in the 70 ’s and 80 ’s with very limited field validation in real systems. This study presents an assessment of the performance of pressurized staircases in six high rise buildings. All systems have been designed using a similar methodology but implemented in different ways. In all cases the control mechanism for the fan is a direct feedback loop from a single pressure sensor. The results have been evaluated showing the limitations of the control system in the event of multiple doors being opened and the limitations of the pressure release dampers (as a response mechanism) if the pressure becomes unstable...|$|R
