40|$|Low Power Mechanisation and Small-scale Vegetable Production in the Tunisian Sahel Region. Part 1 : Inquiry. In this study, it was {{investigated}} {{to what extent}} low power mechanisation could be introduced in vegetable production in the Tunisian Sahel region {{by means of an}} inquiry held among local vegetable growers and at the mechanisation market. Data were collected as to acquire precise information on exploitation characteristics (number and area of the parcels, crops grown, adopted mechanisation, etc.) and on equipment available at the local market (type, power, etc.). The results demonstrated the predominance of small exploitations, which mainly consist of two separate parcels on which several crops are grown. Most exploitations were managed by young and well experienced farmers. Only soil preparation was found to be entirely mechanised. Mechanisation was mainly based on relatively large and high power tractors (typically more than 50 kW). The local machinery market of low power mechanisation was found to offer 5 to 7 kW motor hoes, 6 to 10. 5 kW walking (two <b>wheel)</b> <b>tractors</b> and two types of <b>small</b> (<b>four</b> <b>wheel)</b> <b>tractors</b> of 12 and 16 kW. It was observed that equipment was available for all cultivation operations that are nowadays mechanised, while other operations as scuffling, ridging up, and phytosanitary treatments could still be mechanised...|$|R

50|$|Ferrari is a {{manufacturer}} of two and <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>tractors</b> devoted to agriculture and lawn care. It was created in 1954, during the agricultural reconstruction period of the country. After an initial period dedicated {{to the production of}} wire-drawing machines for irrigation pipes, in 1957 Ferrari took part in the Verona exhibition with its first agricultural machine: the two-wheel tractor MC 57, which carries the date of its birth. In 1965 Ferrari launched the first articulated tractor MT65. The range of products was increased to motor mowers and tractors for diverse applications. At the end of the 1960s, the company looked to foreign markets; the subsidiary company Ferrari France was established in 1972. In 1988 Ferrari became part of the BCS Group. Today Ferrari has a wide range of machines between maintenance machines for recreational use and professional tractors for niche agriculture. Headquarters and factories are located at Abbiategrasso.|$|R

40|$|Low Power Mechanisation and Small-scale Vegetable Production in the Tunisian Sahel Region. Part 2 : On the Field Evaluation of Performances and of Soil Preparation Costs. In this study, it was {{investigated}} {{to what extent}} low power mechanisation could be introduced in vegetable production in the Tunisian Sahel region by evaluating its performance (labour input and field efficiency) by means of field experiments in which different traction equipment was used for carrying out several cultivation operations. Furthermore, costs per unit area for soil preparation in both sandy clay and clayish sand were calculated for four different power classes and for small fields. The results showed that two <b>wheel</b> <b>tractors</b> had a real labour input for scuffling between plant rows ranging from 11. 3 h/ha to 18. 7 h/ha. These inputs ranged from 5. 5 h/ha to 6. 7 h/ha for tied crops. For mowing, the two <b>wheel</b> <b>tractor</b> had labour inputs of 17. 3 and 14. 2 h/ha {{for the first and}} the second cut, respectively, while for potato digging, the first and the second passage of secondary tillage these values were 11. 5, 14. 3 and 10. 4 h/ha, respectively. Superficial soil preparation by means of a <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>tractor</b> gave rise to values between 2. 7 and 3. 5 h/ha. With respect to the cost estimation for soil preparation, the lowest costs were obtained by means of the low power mechanisation.

40|$|A {{method used}} to measure the radial {{suspension}} properties of agricultural tractor tyres is described. The stiffness and damping of a range of tyres have been measured. The effects on tyre stiffness and damping coefficient of rolling speed, inflation pressure, load, amplitude, frequency of vibration, driving torque, surface type, tyre size, ply rating, construction, wear and age are reported. A relationship is developed which enables the stiffness of a rolling tyre to be estimated from the tyre size, age and inflation pressure. It is shown that this is a more accurate estimate of rolling tyre stiffness than measurement of the stiffness of a stationary tyre. The measured tyre characteristics are used to predict the vibration of a single degree of freedom system and of a <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>tractor.</b> Significant improvements in accuracy are found when the results are compared with those obtained using stationary tyre characteristics. The frequencies of the natural pitch and vertical modes of vibration are usually predicted to within ± 10 %. Predictions of rms acceleration levels are less accurate. Further improvements in modelling accuracy should be achieved by more accurate measurement and modelling of the suspension characteristics of the drive wheels in the longitudinal direction...|$|R

Functional test was done by lifting up the tractor so that it was not move sideways while the tires were rotated. Performance test was done on the field to know the ability of the tractor to move forward and backward automatically and to know the turning radius when the left or right brake pedal was pushed down automatically. Experimental result showed that the time required to push the brake was about 0. 47 s for left brake and 0. 61 s for right brake.

Plain disk type gave broken stubble cut. Higher rotation (1000 rpm) resulted better cuts as compared to lower rotation (500 rpm) both either on plain disk and scalloped disk.
