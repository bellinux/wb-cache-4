5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its <b>surrounding</b> <b>shell.</b> This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E

2500|$|It {{might appear}} {{from the above}} that all nuclei of the same nuclide (and hence the same γ) would {{resonate}} at the same frequency. This is not the case.

50|$|For higher mass stars, carbon {{collects}} in the core, displacing the helium to a <b>surrounding</b> <b>shell</b> where helium burning occurs. In this helium shell, {{the pressures}} are lower {{and the mass}} is not supported by electron degeneracy. Thus, {{as opposed to the}} center of the star, the shell is able to expand in response to increased thermal pressure in the helium shell. Expansion cools this layer and slows the reaction, causing the star to contract again. This process continues cyclically, and stars undergoing this process will have periodically variable radius and power production. These stars will also lose material from their outer layers as they expand and contract.|$|E

50|$|Carboxysomes are {{bacterial}} organelles {{consisting of}} polyhedral protein shells {{filled with the}} enzyme Ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) -the predominant enzyme in carbon fixation and the rate limiting enzyme in the Calvin Cycle-and a carbonic anhydrase. Carboxysomes {{are thought to have}} evolved {{as a consequence of the}} increase in oxygen concentration in the ancient atmosphere; this is because oxygen is a competing substrate to carbon dioxide in the RuBisCO reaction. To overcome the inefficiency of RuBisCO, carboxysomes concentrate carbon dioxide inside the shell by means of co-localized carbonic anhydrase activity, which produces carbon dioxide from the bicarbonate that diffuses into the carboxysome. The resulting production of carbon dioxide near RuBisCO decreases the proportion of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate oxygenation and thereby avoids costly photorespiratory reactions. The <b>surrounding</b> <b>shell</b> provides a barrier to carbon dioxide loss, helping to increase its concentration around RuBisCO. The carboxysome is an essential part of the carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM).|$|E
