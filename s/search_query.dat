25|$|Google Flu Trends {{tries to}} avoid privacy {{violations}} by only aggregating millions of anonymous search queries, without identifying individuals that performed the search. Their search log contains the IP {{address of the}} user, {{which could be used}} to trace back to the region where the <b>search</b> <b>query</b> is originally submitted. Google runs programs on computers to access and calculate the data, so no human is involved in the process. Google also implemented the policy to anonymize IP address in their search logs after 9 months.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, Soghoian filed a {{complaint}} with the FTC, in which he claimed that Google was intentionally leaking search queries to the sites that users visited after they clicked on a link from the search results page. Two weeks later, a law firm filed a class action lawsuit against Google for this practice. The lawsuit extensively quoted from Soghoian's FTC complaint. In October 2011, Google stopped leaking search queries to the sites that users visited, and then in 2015, the company settled the <b>search</b> <b>query</b> leakage class action lawsuit for 8.5 million dollars.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} ability to save {{searches}} as a Search Folder where opening the folder will execute a specific search automatically and display the results as a normal folder. A search folder is just an XML file which stores the <b>search</b> <b>query,</b> including the search operators as well. When these files are accessed, the search is run with the saved query string and the results presented as a virtual folder. Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a saved search (called a scope) can be nested within the query string of another search.|$|E

Furthermore, Granger causality is bi-directional: high searches follow high volatility, and high volatility follows high searches. Using the latter feedback effect to predict volatility we find that <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> contain additional information about market volatility. They help to improve volatility forecasts in-sample and out-of-sample {{as well as for}} different forecasting horizons. <b>Search</b> <b>queries</b> are particularly useful to predict volatility in high-volatility phases.

40|$|Digital {{surveillance}} using internet <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> {{can improve}} both the sensitivity and timeliness of {{the detection of}} a health event, such as an influenza outbreak. While it has recently been estimated that the mobile search volume surpasses the desktop search volume and mobile search patterns differ from desktop search patterns, the previous digital surveillance systems did not distinguish mobile and desktop <b>search</b> <b>queries.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the performance of mobile and desktop <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> in terms of digital influenza surveillance. The study period was from September 6, 2010 through August 30, 2014, which consisted of four epidemiological years. Influenza-like illness (ILI) and virologic surveillance data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used. A total of 210 combined queries from our previous survey work were used for this study. Mobile and desktop weekly search data were extracted from Naver, which is the largest search engine in Korea. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to examine the correlation of the mobile and desktop data with ILI and virologic data in Korea. We also performed lag correlation analysis. We observed that the influenza surveillance performance of mobile <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> matched or exceeded that of desktop <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> over time. The mean correlation coefficients of mobile <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> and the number of queries with an r-value of ≥ 0. 7 equaled or became greater than those of desktop searches over the four epidemiological years. A lag correlation analysis of up to two weeks showed similar trends. Our study shows that mobile <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> for influenza surveillance have equaled or even become greater than desktop <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> over time. In the future development of influenza surveillance using <b>search</b> <b>queries,</b> the recognition of changing trend of mobile search data could be necessary...|$|R

To ascertain marketing requirements, the company relied on informal metrics, including monitoring the usage patterns of some 200 Chrome OS machines used by Google employees. Developers also noted their own usage patterns. Matthew Papakipos, former engineering director for the Chrome OS project, put three machines in his house and found himself logging in for brief sessions: to make a single <b>search</b> <b>query</b> or send a short email.|$|E
25|$|Because these {{traditional}} methods are slow, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, proxies of transmission have been sought. One proxy {{in the case}} of influenza is tracking of influenza-like illness at certain sentinel sites of health care practitioners within a state, for example. Tools have been developed to help track influenza epidemics by finding patterns in certain web <b>search</b> <b>query</b> activity. It was found that the frequency of influenza-related web searches as a whole rises as the number of people sick with influenza rises. Examining space-time relationships of web queries has been shown to approximate the spread of influenza and dengue.|$|E
25|$|The Windows Search API {{can also}} be used to convert a <b>search</b> <b>query</b> written using Advanced Query Syntax (or Natural Query Syntax, the natural {{language}} version of AQS) to SQL queries. It exposes a method GenerateSQLFromUserQuery method of the ISearchQueryHelper interface. Searches {{can also be}} performed using the search-ms: protocol, which is a pseudo protocol that lets searches be exposed as an URI. It contains all the operators and search terms specified in AQS. It can refer to saved search folders as well. When such a URI is activated, Windows Search, which is registered as a handler for the protocol, parses the URI to extract the parameters and perform the search.|$|E
40|$|Web <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} to exhibit properties of a rudimentary language system, distinct from the mother language from which words of the queries are drawn. It has been hy-pothesized that the language of <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> is fast growing in complexity, reflected in the steady increase of query lengths over the years. In this research, we make the first attempts to quantify change in the linguistic structure of <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> by examining large query logs spaced four years apart. We adopt a multi-pronged approach and analyze query structure from three different perspectives, namely, language models, complex networks and positional pref-erences of words. All experimental findings confirm that the linguistic structure of Web <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> is indeed evolving. 1...|$|R

25|$|The first {{business}} model that dissuades illegal file sharing {{is to make}} downloading digital media easy and cheap. The use of noncommercial sites makes downloading digital media complex. For example, misspelling an artist's name in a <b>search</b> <b>query</b> will often fail to return a result, and some sites limit internet traffic, which can make downloading media a long and frustrating process. Furthermore, some illegal file sharing websites are host to viruses and malware which attach themselves to the files (see torrent poisoning).If digital media (for example, songs) are all provided on accessible, legitimate sites, and are reasonably priced, consumers will purchase media legally to overcome these frustrations.|$|E
25|$|Windows Search {{queries are}} {{specified}} in Advanced Query Syntax (AQS) which supports not only simple text searches but provides advanced property-based query operations as well. AQS defines certain keywords {{which can be}} used to refine the <b>search</b> <b>query,</b> such as specifying boolean operations on searched terms (AND, OR, NOT) as well as to specify further filters based on file metadata or file type. It {{can also be used to}} limit results from specific information stores like regular files, offline files cache, or email stores. File type specific operators are available as well. WDS also supports wildcard prefix matching searches. It also includes several SQL-like operators like GROUP BY. AQS is locale dependent and uses different keywords in international versions of Windows 7.|$|E
25|$|New {{information}} obtained by dbSNP becomes {{available to the}} public periodically in a series of “builds” (i.e. revisions and releases of data). There is no schedule for releasing new builds; instead, builds are usually released when a new genome build becomes available, assuming that the genome has some cataloged variation associated with it. This occurs approximately every 1–2 months. Genome sequences often contain errors so reference SNPs (“refSNP”) from previous builds, as well as new submitted SNPs, are re-mapped to the newly available genome sequence through multiple cycles of BLAST and MegaBLAST. Multiple submitted SNPs, if mapping to the same location, are clustered into one refSNP cluster and are assigned a reference SNP ID number. However, if two refSNP cluster records are found to map to the same location (i.e. are identical), then dbSNP will also merge those records together. In this case, the smallest refSNP number ID (i.e. the earliest record) would now represent both records, and the larger refSNP number IDs would become obsolete. These obsolete refSNP number IDs and are not used again for new records. When a merger of two refSNP records occurs, the change is tracked, and the former refSNP number IDs can still be used as a <b>search</b> <b>query.</b> This process of merging identical records together reduces redundancy within dbSNP.|$|E
50|$|Negative {{keywords}} {{are often}} necessary for paid search campaigns that contain keywords on either broad match or phrase match. These match types will display your ad for additional <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> (i.e. <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> {{other than the}} actual keyword that {{was added to the}} account). Thus, removing irrelevant terms often becomes necessary.|$|R

2500|$|In Windows Search, {{which is}} part of Windows Vista, it is also {{possible}} to save a <b>search</b> <b>query</b> as a Virtual Folder, called a Saved Search or Search Folder which, when accessed, runs the search with the saved query and returns the results as a folder listing. Physically, a search folder is just an XML file (with a [...]search-ms extension) which stores the <b>search</b> <b>query</b> (in either AQS or NQS), including the search operators as well. Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a saved search (called a scope) can be nested within the query string of another search. Search Folders are also distributable via RSS. By default, Windows references the profile of the user who originally created a Search Folder as part of the query's scope. This design choice does not prevent saved searches from being shared with other users, but it prevents them from operating on different user profiles. While users can manually modify the contents of a saved search so that the scope references the %USERPROFILE% environment variable, which will enable it to operate on other machines or profiles regardless of the original author, Microsoft has released a SearchMelt Creator utility that automates this process for the user.|$|E

40|$|Document-oriented {{databases}} {{are popular}} databases, in which users can store their documents in a schema-less manner and perform <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> for them. They {{have been widely}} used for web applications that process a large collection of documents because of their high scalability and rich functions. One of major functions of document-oriented databases is a string search that requires a high computational cost for a large collection of documents, because its computational complexity increases as the documents increase. In document-oriented databases, a database index is typically used for improving text <b>search</b> <b>queries.</b> However, the index cannot always be used for text <b>search</b> <b>queries,</b> such as a regular expression match search. To accelerate such queries by using GPUs, in this paper, we propose a GPU-friendly cache structure, called DDB Cache (Document-oriented DataBase Cache), which is extracted from a document-oriented database. By using GPU and DDB Cache, we can improve a performance of text <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> without relying on the database indexes. We implemented DDB Cache for MongoDB. Experimental results using GeForce GTX 980 show that our approach improves the performance of regular expression <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> by up to 101 x compared to the original document-oriented database. 1...|$|R
