Aims: To investigate possible {{statistically significant differences}} in experiencing life satisfaction between the macrobiotic and comparative groups. Participants: A research sample included 120 participants. The macrobiotic group constituted of 60 students or graduates of arts, aged 23 – 35, eating according to the model of a macrobiotic diet. The comparative group was selected by a method of pairing and included 60 students or graduates, corresponding to the age, gender and education, eating conventionally. Methods: The testing battery consisted of the <b>Selective</b> <b>Questionnaire</b> on eating habits and the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire. Results: The macrobiotic group obtained significantly higher total score of life satisfaction in the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire. Significant differences appeared in areas of Health, Job and Profession, and Finances. Conclusions: Statistically {{significant differences were found}} in experiencing life satisfaction between the compared groups. The macrobiotic group showed higher rate of global life satisfaction...|$|E

Ramzaev {{developed}} a Program for the radiation risk communication management for the adequate perception {{risks associated with}} the use of various technologies in the nuclear industry by the public. Carrying out sociological research is one of the stages of this program. The aim of the analysis presented in the article is to study the population’s awareness of radiation safety issues and its attitude to further development of the nuclear industry. The data used in this analysis is a part of a large sociological survey conducted in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region The sociological research was conducted by the method of a <b>selective</b> <b>questionnaire</b> survey among the adult population permanently residing in the territory of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region. The volume of the sample studied was 2369 respondents: 1006 in St. Petersburg and 1363 in the Leningrad Region, including Sosnovy Bor – 401. The analysis showed that the population of all the studied territories estimates the environmental situation as being mainly favorable. The residents consider the main environmental problems in all areas studied to be a collection, removal, storage, disposal of garbage, as well as air and water pollution. The population of the region is relatively poorly informed about the current projects in the nuclear industry. One-third of the inhabitants of the region perceives the Leningrad nuclear power plant as a source of danger. Respondents see the main danger in the possibility of an accident on it. There is a sharply negative attitude of the population towards the construction of radioactive waste disposal sites anywhere in the region. According to the results of the study, it can be concluded that the population of the studied region is poorly informed about the existing radiation situation and the nuclear industry projects. It requires an optimization of the choice of methods for risk communication.   </p...|$|E
40|$|Modern Methods of Construction {{can assist}} the {{construction}} industry to achieve higher levels of production and a higher quality of product. They are being promoted by the UK government and are seen {{by some as a}} panacea to the ills of {{the construction industry}}. Prefabrication does however need to be integrated with more traditional methods of construction and this interface is often problematic. The aim of this work is to identify these interfaces and to facilitate an understanding of how problems arise. The research included interviews with team members from a key prefabrication provider and <b>selective</b> <b>questionnaires</b> from contractors managing (and not managing) projects using elements of prefabrication. A lack of understanding between prefabrication specialists and those providing more traditionally built infrastructure was found to create problematic working relationships and good communication was found to be a key factor in successful projects.

This data collection contains {{data from a}} large battery of mathematics and executive function tasks administered {{to a sample of}} 403 participants aged between 5 and 25 years of age. The data collection includes standardised assessments of mathematics, the Numerical Operations and Mathematical Reasoning subtests from the Weschler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT-II UK), in addition to age appropriate experimental mathematics tests of factual knowledge, procedural skill and conceptual understanding in the domain of arithmetic. Executive functions were assessed with experimental tasks measuring verbal and visuospatial short-term and working memory, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility and <b>selective</b> attention. <b>Questionnaire</b> measures of mathematics anxiety and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function were also administered. These data underpin the following papers: Gilmore, C., Keeble, S., Richardson, S., & Cragg, L. (2015). The role of cognitive inhibition in different components of arithmetic. ZDM, 1 – 12.

Project description: A high proportion of children and adults struggle with learning and doing maths. To help them {{we need to have a}} clear understanding of the processes involved in mathematics. There are lots of different skills involved in successful maths performance including maths specific knowledge such as knowledge of facts, procedures, and concepts as well as other more general skills. These include holding and manipulating information in mind (working memory), flexible thinking (shifting), and focusing on relevant information and ignoring distractions (inhibition). These skills are often termed 'executive function' skills and are thought to be particularly important for learning maths. To date, this basic understanding of the importance of executive function skills has not been exploited in the classroom because our understanding is not detailed enough. This project will explore the relationship between maths and executive function skills in greater depth using a variety of different research methods. This research will reveal the ways in which executive function skills are involved in learning and doing maths and help us to understand why some children find maths easy, and other children struggle. These findings will be used to raise teachers’ awareness of the importance of considering executive functions skills when teaching maths...|$|R
40|$|Background: Headache {{patients}} frequently {{complain about}} difficulties in attention and concentration, {{even when they}} are headache-free and psychometric studies concerning attentional deficits in headache patients between attacks are scarce. Objective: To evaluate selective attention of headache patients in a pain free period and compare them with healthy volunteers. Subjects and Methods: We performed, between February 2011 and July 2011, a case-control study, including 45 university students consulting for primary headaches, matched with 45 healthy students as controls. Headaches were classified according to the International Headache Society criteria (IHS, 2004). Subjects with a history of brain injury, epilepsy and visual disturbancies were excluded. Mood disorders were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety Depression (HAD) <b>questionnaire.</b> <b>Selective</b> attention was evaluated using the D-KEFS color-word interference test. Results: Mean age of patients was 23. 29 ± 2. 55 years, versus 22. 89 ± 2. 04 years for controls (p = 0. 2). Migraine and tension-type headaches were the only diagnosed headache types, respectively 55. 56 % and 44. 44 %. The selective attention score was - 4. 04 ± 7. 08 for patients, versus - 1. 31 ± 7. 73 for controls (p = 0. 02). The mean mental flexibility score was lower in headache sufferers compared to controls (36. 67 ± 6. 79 versus 41. 33 ± 6. 23, p = 0. 001). Gender, anxiety and depression scores, and temporal features of headache had no correlation with selective attention score. Conclusion: Selective attention and mental flexibility capacities seem to be reduced in primary headache sufferers in pain free period. These findings could contribute {{to our understanding of the}} pathophysiology of primary headaches. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a pilot study conducted with second and third year undergraduate students. The study was established to see if a learning styles assessment could be used to assist lecturing staff in engaging students in their own learning as well as a tool to enhance group work. Group work is widely used within engineering programmes to develop team building and leadership skills. Selection of groups is often by random or self-selection rather than by a specific beneficial method chosen to enhance the student’s development and learning experience. Student feedback suggests some students are concerned about the benefit and assessment of group work. An initial evaluation of the student learning style was carried out using a standard questionnaire. On the basis of the results the students were given an option of selecting their own working group or being {{selected on the basis of}} balancing and appreciating the individual learning style of their peers. Equal numbers chose to self-select as were willing to participate in the selection process and the whole pilot is analysed in terms of the performance of the students on the module. The similarity in learning style response from all the engineering students that participated in this pilot scheme led the authors to reflect over the dependence demonstrated by the undergraduate engineering students. Students choosing to participate in the allocated groups performed at a higher level that the students who self selected which is consistent with the findings of other researchers. The awareness of staff and student’s was raised by participating in this pilot study and the conclusion that a more <b>selective</b> learning style <b>questionnaire</b> was needed to develop a model for group selection is discussed...|$|R

Paper 1 – The {{development and}} {{psychometric properties of}} the Selective Mutism Questionnaire-Child (SMQ-C) [...] Chapter 3. Paper 2 – Social phobia symptomatology and behavioural inhibition in children with Selective Mutism: A comparison with children with Social Phobia and non-clinical controls [...] Chapter 4. Paper 3 – Social anxiety and parenting behaviour among parents of children with Selective Mutism, children with Social Phobia and non-clinical controls [...] Chapter 5. Summary and conclusions. Research demonstrates that children with selective mutism (SM) present with symptoms of social anxiety and there is a high comorbidity between SM and social phobia (SP). As a result some researchers have questioned whether SM is a variant of SP rather than a distinct anxiety disorder. This thesis sought to clarify the association between SM and SP. Participants were 25 children with a primary diagnosis of SM, 17 children with a primary diagnosis of SP and 15 children identified as “easy-going” who did not meet criteria for a DSM-IV diagnosis. Children were aged between 4 to 8 years. Data included mother, father, teacher and child reports, a semi-structured clinical interview with the child’s mother, and an observational assessment with the child and their mother. The first paper in the thesis reports on the development and {{psychometric properties of the}} child self-report measure of mutism, <b>Selective</b> Mutism <b>Questionnaire</b> – Child (SMQ-C). The SMQ-C was adapted from a similar adult measure and was designed for children aged from 4 years. The SMQ-C showed good internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity. Even young children were able to provide a clear picture of how much they spoke in various contexts. The second paper systematically compared children with SM, SP and non-clinical controls on social anxiety symptomatology and behavioural inhibition. Observational measures showed that children in the SM group were more verbally and nonverbally inhibited than children in the SP group and nonclinical controls, and parent report revealed that they were more fearful of negative evaluation than children in theSP group who did not differ significantly from non-clinical controls. These findings indicate that children with a primary diagnosis of SM show similar or even greater social phobia symptomatology than children with a primary diagnosis of SP and both are more socially anxious than non-clinical controls. The third paper explored relationships between social anxiety, parents’ negative affectivity, and parenting practices among children with SM, SP and controls. No significant differences in the levels of negative emotion or social phobia symptomatology among mothers and fathers were found between the three groups, nor did the study find any significant differences in parent-child interaction with one exception. Mothers and fathers of children with a primary diagnosis of SM reported more thoughts of frustration with their child’s reticence in a novel social situation. Correlational analyses showed a significant association between maternal social phobia and child anxiety in the SM and non-clinical groups. Overall, the findings support the idea postulated in the literature that SM is a more severe form of SP observed in younger children. Speech is the primary form of communication in all social interactions, the high social anxiety together with the spoken and unspoken pressures to speak contribute to maintenance of the disorder.
