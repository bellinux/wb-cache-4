5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century, French {{builders}} developed the Gothic style, {{marked by the}} use of rib vaults, pointed arches, flying buttresses, and large <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> windows.

Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England. <b>Stained</b> <b>glass</b> became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost all lost.|$|E
