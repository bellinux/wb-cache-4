2500|$|He {{considered}} {{the second part}} of the operation to be relatively easy. The initial incision was extended along the raphe of the scrotum to the root of the penis. The surgical field was widened by retracting the <b>scrotal</b> <b>skin</b> on both sides and widely exposing the corpus spongiosum, both corpora cavernosa, and the two testes. Once the testes and their [...] had been dissected, the spermatic cord was cut and ligated. Then, both corpora cavernosa were ligated and cut at a level just distally to their attachment to the inferior ramus of the pubic bone. The level of transection of the spongious bulb and urethra had to correspond with the length of the future urethra. Subsequently, all erectile bodies were pushed out and dissected from the penile skin. When available, the foreskin was kept and the distal, coronal edge of the penile skin was closed; this yielded the skin tube that was inserted as neovaginal lining.|$|E

5000|$|The Johansen's {{procedure}} {{sometimes referred}} to as [...] "Johanson's urethroplasty" [...] is a two-stage procedure which was developed during the 1950s and 1960s by Swedish surgeon Dr. Bengt Johansen, and was originally designed as a surgical repair for hypospadias. Over the years, the surgery has evolved into a fairly complex operation whereby the damaged area of the urethra is opened ventrally and left open as a buried skin strip with a deep diversion created from <b>scrotal</b> or penile <b>skin</b> covering the area of the repair. An appropriately sized in-dwelling catheter is inserted, and the repaired area is temporarily closed (sutured in some locations, with packing and dressings in others) until the newly created diversion forms completely, usually within six months. Upon the confirmation of completed healing, the catheter is withdrawn and the surgical site closed permanently. There are numerous methods attributed to the name [...] "Johansen's". Most severe urethral trauma is reconstructed using the Johansen's urethroplastic procedure. It is also the procedure normally utilized in the repair of damage caused by balinitis lichen sclerosus, also referred to a BXO.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Concealed penis (CP) {{may vary}} in {{severity}} and includes megaprepuce (MP) as a variant. Many different surgical strategies {{have been described}} {{in order to maximize}} penile exposure and to deal with skin deficiency. We describe the strategies that we use to overcome technical problems in severe cases of CP. Materials and Methods: Six consecutive cases of severe CP (including 3 with MP) were treated in a 2 -year period between January 2011 and April 2013. These patients were treated using extensive degloving, removal of dysplastic dartos, Alexander's preputial flap, <b>scrotal</b> flaps and <b>skin</b> grafts. Three patients had been previously circumcised. Cases associated with hypospadias, obesity, disorders of sexual differentiation and micropenises were excluded. Results: All six patients attained good results, with good exposure of the penis, ability to void standing with a well-directed flow and reasonable esthetic results. A technical algorithm for the treatment of primary or recurring cases of CP is proposed. Conclusion: Alexander' s distally based ventral preputial flap is a useful technical resource to treat MP cases. Free skin grafts and/or laterally based scrotal flaps may be used to cover the penis after release in severe cases of CP...|$|R
40|$|Urethral {{stricture}} {{disease is}} as old as mankind. In the old times urethral strictures were mainly associated with longstanding infectious disease (gonococcal urethritis) or trauma (Beard and Goodyear, 1948). Current stricture aetiology in the developed world is mainly iatrogenic, such as strictures after (traumatic) urethral catheterization or transurethral resection, and idiopathic (Fenton et al., 2005, Lumen et al., 2009). Besides the aetiology of strictures, also the armamentarium to treat them has evolved. Repeated dilatation or, in complicated cases, external urethrotomy or cystotomy were the only treatment options for centuries instead of leaving the disease on its natural evolution. Today, optic urethrotomy, anastomotic urethroplasty and substitution urethroplasty offer better functional results, better cosmesis and in the majority of patients a permanent solution to the disease. Urethral strictures most frequently occur at the bulbar urethra (Lumen et al., 2009, Fenton et al., 2005, Meeks et al., 2009, Andrich and Mundy, 2008, Santucci et al., 2007). This is the part of the urethra that is surrounded by the corpus spongiosum and the bulbospongiosus muscle. When a bulbar stricture is encountered {{for the first time in}} a patient, a direct vision internal urethrotomy can be offered. This may be curative for short strictures in about half of the patients treated. Previous urethrotomy/dilatation or direct vision internal urethrotomy in longer strictures reduces success rates to almost zero (Pansadoro and Emiliozzi, 1996, Steenkamp et al., 1997). This does not mean that the patient cannot be managed this way, but the treatment is palliative in nature and repeat treatments or intermittent self catheterization will be mandatory to maintain patency. When these patients want to be cured from their stricture disease, an operative approach has to be offered. It is probably better to offer this approach sooner than later. From a surgical point of view, less spongiofibrosis will be found and from an economical point of view, early surgery is probably more cost effective (Rourke and Jordan, 2005, Greenwell et al., 2004, Andrich and Mundy, 2008, Wright et al., 2006). The operative approach can essentially be divided in anastomotic and substitution urethroplasties. In the first, a tension free, spatulated anastomosis is the key to success. This technique is generally advocated for shorter strictures that can be excised completely. It is assumed that results from end-to-end anastomotic urethroplasty are superior to substitution urethroplasty. This believe is partially based on intuition: excision of the diseased urethra and subsequent restoration of the continuity using healthy ends ‘has to be better’ then leaving the diseased urethra in place and augmenting it with another tissue. However, the evidence to support this believe is not solid (Meeks et al., 2009, Andrich et al., 2003). In a substitution urethroplasty, the urethral lumen calibre is restored using flaps (derived from <b>scrotal</b> or penile <b>skin,</b> tunica vaginalis,…) or grafts (skin, buccal mucosa, lingual mucosa, small intestinal submucosa,…) (Mangera et al.). This technique has become more widespread after the introduction of buccal mucosa as a free graft. Buccal mucosa offers a relatively resilient and easy to handle graft, rendering this surgery more accessible. In the following chapter we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of buccal mucosa free graft in the treatment of bulbar urethral stricture disease. We will not only focus on success as defined by absence of stricture recurrence but also on functional results and patient reported outcomes. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|The scrotum is an {{anatomical}} male reproductive {{structure that}} consists of a suspended dual-chambered sack of skin and smooth muscle that is present in most terrestrial male mammals and located under the penis.

The perineal raphe is a small, vertical, slightly raised ridge of <b>scrotal</b> <b>skin</b> under which is found the scrotal septum. It appears as a thin longitudinal line that runs front to back over the entire scrotum. The scrotum contains the external spermatic fascia, testes, epididymis and ductus deferens. It is a distention of the perineum and carries some abdominal tissues into its cavity including the testicular artery, testicular vein and pampiniform plexus.

50|$|Most hydroceles {{appearing}} {{in the first year}} of life seldom require treatment as they resolve without treatment. Hydroceles that persist after the first year or occur later in life require treatment through open operation for removing surgically, as these may have little tendency towards regression. Method of choice is open operation under general or spinal anesthesia, which is sufficient in adults. General anesthesia is the choice in children. Local infiltration anesthesia is not satisfactory because it cannot abolish abdominal pain due to traction on the spermatic cord. If a testicular tumor is suspected, a hydrocele must not be aspirated as malignant cells can be disseminated via the <b>scrotal</b> <b>skin</b> to its lymphatic field. This is excluded clinically by ultrasonography. If a tumor is not present, the hydrocele fluid can be aspirated with a needle and syringe. Clear straw-colored fluid contains mostly albumin and fibrinogen. If the fluid is allowed to drain in a collecting vessel, it does not clot but can be coagulated if small amounts of blood come in contact with the damaged tissue. In long standing cases, hydrocele fluid may be opalescent with cholesterol and may contain crystals of tyrosine and a palpable normal testis confirms the diagnosis; other wise surgical exploration of testis is needed.|$|E
50|$|No-scalpel vasectomy was {{developed}} in China by Dr. Li Shunqiang {{with the aim of}} reducing men’s fear related to the incision and increasing vasectomy use in China. Over time, the technique gained popularity and it is now a preferred method of male sterilization in many countries. The procedure is done under local anesthesia, usually in an outpatient clinic. Certain diseases of the male genital system, including infections, filariasis and large hydrocoele are contraindications for no-scalpel vasectomy. These diseases should be treated before no-scalpel vasectomy is performed. The vas is isolated by three-finger technique on both sides. The ideal entry point for the needle is midway between the top of the testes and the base of the penis. Usually, 100 mg lidocaine (without epinephrine) is injected to create a wheal. Afterwards, a ringed clamp is used to puncture the <b>scrotal</b> <b>skin</b> and elevate the vas deferens. A dissecting forceps is used to spread the tissue, pierce the wall of the vas and deliver it outside. It is then occluded and ligated. This procedure has less pain, bleeding and infection than conventional vasectomy.
