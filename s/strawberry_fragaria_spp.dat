40|$|Molecular {{mechanisms}} {{regulating the}} flowering process have been extensively studied in model annual plants; in perennials, however, {{understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms controlling flowering has just started to emerge. Here we review {{the current state of}} flowering research in perennial plants of the rose family (Rosaceae), {{which is one of the}} most economically important families of horticultural plants. <b>Strawberry</b> (<b>Fragaria</b> <b>spp.),</b> raspberry (Rubus spp.), rose (Rosa spp.), and apple (Malus spp.) are used to illustrate how photoperiod and temperature control seasonal flowering in rosaceous crops. We highlight recent molecular studies which have revealed homologues of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL 1) to be major regulators of both the juvenile to adult, and the vegetative to reproductive transitions in various rosaceous species. Additionally, recent advances in understanding of the regulation of TFL 1 are discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Strawberry</b> (<b>Fragaria</b> <b>spp)</b> is an {{emerging}} {{model for the}} development of basic genomics and recombinant DNA studies among rosaceous crops. Functional genomic and molecular studies involve relative quantification of gene expression under experimental conditions of interest. Accuracy and reliability are dependent upon the choice of an optimal reference control transcript. There is no information available on validated endogenous reference genes for use in studies testing strawberry-pathogen interactions. Thirteen potential pre-selected strawberry reference genes were tested against different tissues, strawberry cultivars, biotic stresses, ripening and senescent conditions, and SA/JA treatments. Evaluation of reference candidate’s suitability was analyzed by five different methodologies, and information was merged to identify best reference transcripts. A combination of all five methods was used for selective classification of reference genes. The resulting superior reference genes, FaRIB 413, FaACTIN, FaEF 1 a and FaGAPDH 2 are strongly recommended as control genes for relative quantification of gene expression in strawberry. This report constitutes the first systematic study to identify and validat...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} aphid-borne viruses infecting <b>Strawberry</b> (<b>Fragaria</b> <b>spp.)</b> Strawberry crinkle virus (SCV), Strawberry mild yellow edge virus (SMYEV), Strawberry mottle virus (SMoV) and Strawberry vein banding virus (SVBV) {{can cause}} serious crop losses. In this paper, a multiplex reverse transcriptase {{polymerase chain reaction}} (RT-PCR) method is described for the simultaneous detection of all four viruses in combination with a plant mRNA specific internal control {{which can be used}} as an indicator of the effectiveness of the extraction and RT-PCR. In total, 18 strawberry isolates infected naturally were analysed by this method. Every combination of RNA virus was able to be detected and a full complement of all four viruses were found together in three isolates, all taken from wild strawberry (Fragaria chiloensis (L.) Duch.) in Chile. The upper detection limit for the four viruses was at an extract dilution of 1 / 200. The broad applicability of the RNA specific internal control primers—which produced a PCR fragment of the expected size in 25 of 27 plant species tested—combined with improvements, made in extraction methods described provides potentially a standard method for comparable RT-PCR analyses {{in a wide variety of}} plant species...|$|E

40|$|Indigenous Peoples of North America have collectively used {{approximately}} 1800 different {{native species}} of plants, algae, lichens and fungi as food. When European explorers, traders and settlers {{arrived on the}} continent, these native foods, often identified and offered by Indigenous hosts, gave them sustenance {{and in some cases}} saved them from starvation. Over the years, some of these species – particularly various types of berries, such as blueberries and cranberries (Vaccinium spp.), wild raspberries and blackberries (Rubus <b>spp.),</b> and wild <b>strawberries</b> (<b>Fragaria</b> <b>spp.),</b> and various types of nuts (Corylus spp., Carya spp., Juglans spp., Pinus spp.), along with wild-rice (Zizania spp.) and maple syrup (from Acer saccharum) – became more widely adopted and remain in use to the present day. Some of these and some other species were used in plant breeding programs, as germplasm for hybridization programs, or to strengthen a crop's resistance to disease. At the same time, many nutritious Indigenous foods fell out of use among Indigenous Peoples themselves, and along with their lessened use came a loss of associated knowledge and cultural identity. Today, for a variety of reasons, from improving people's health and regaining their cultural heritage, to enhancing dietary diversity and enjoyment of diverse foods, some of the species that have dwindled in their use have been “rediscovered” by Indigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples, and indications are that their benefits to humanity will continue into the future...|$|R
40|$|The KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN (KNOX) genes play {{a central}} role in {{maintenance}} of the shoot apical meristem. They also contribute to the morphology of simple and compound leaves. In this report we characterize the FaKNOX 1 gene from <b>strawberry</b> (<b>Fragaria</b> <b>spp.)</b> and demonstrate its function in trasgenic plants. The FaKNOX 1 cDNA was isolated from a cultivated strawberry (F. ×ananassa) flower EST library. The sequence is most similar to Class I KNOX genes, and was mapped to linkage group VI of the diploid strawberry genome. Unlike most KNOX genes studied, steady-state transcript levels were highest in flowers and fruits. Transcripts were also detected in emerging leaf primordia and the apical dome. Transgenic strawberry plants suppressing or overexpressing FaKNOX 1 exhibited conspicuous changes in plant form. The FaKNOX 1 RNAi plants presented a dwarfed phenotype with deeply serrated leaflets and exaggerated petiolules. They also exhibited a high level of cellular disorganization of the shoot apical meristem and leaves. Overexpression of FaKNOX 1 caused dwarfed stature with wrinkled leaves. These gain- and loss-of-function assays in strawberry functionally demonstrate the contributions of a KNOX domain protein in a rosaceous species...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Strawberry</b> (<b>Fragaria</b> <b>spp.)</b> is the {{familiar}} {{name of a}} group of economically important crop plants and wild relatives that also represent an emerging system for the study of gene and genome evolution. Its small stature, rapid seed-to-seed cycle, transformability and miniscule basic genome make strawberry an attractive system to study processes related to plant physiology, development and crop production; yet it lacks substantial genomics-level resources. This report addresses this deficiency by characterizing 0. 71 Mbp of gene space from a diploid species (F. vesca). The twenty large genomic tracks (30 - 52 kb) captured as fosmid inserts comprise gene regions with roles in flowering, disease resistance, and metabolism. Results: A detailed description of the studied regions reveals 131 Blastx-supported gene sites and eight additional ESTsupported gene sites. Only 15 genes have complete EST coverage, enabling gene modelling, while 76 lack EST support. Instances of microcolinearity with Arabidopsis thaliana were identified in twelve inserts. A relatively high portion (25 %) of targeted genes were found in unanticipated tandem duplications. The effectiveness of six FGENESH training models was assessed via comparisons among ab initio predictions and homology-based gene and start/stop codon identifications. Fourteen transposable-element-related sequences and 158 simple sequence repeat loci were delineated...|$|E
40|$|The <b>strawberry</b> (<b>Fragaria</b> <b>spp)</b> is {{regarded}} as a false fruit because it originates from the receptacle, which is a non-ovarian tissue. For this reason, fruit-specific promoters isolated from plant species in which the fruit is derived from the ovary wall might not be suited to control gene expression in a fruit-specific way in strawberry. In order to achieve (false) fruit-specific expression in strawberry, we tested the petunia FBP 7 (floral binding protein 7) promoter, which proved to be active in the receptacles of petunia flowers, in transgenic strawberry fruits. In strawberry plants containing the FBP 7 promoter fused to the ß-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene (gus), GUS activity was found in floral and fruit tissues of all developmental stages tested but not in leaf, petiole and root tissue. Surprisingly, Northern blot analysis showed the presence of gus-derived mRNAs in root (strong) and petiole (weak) tissue of fbp 7 - gus plants in addition to the floral and fruit tissues. Therefore, it is concluded that the histological GUS phenotype does not necessarily correspond with expression at the mRNA level. mRNA quantification using the TaqMan polymerase chain reaction technology confirmed the Northern results and showed that in red strawberry tissue the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter is at least sixfold stronger than the FBP 7 promote...|$|E
5000|$|Snowshoe hares prefer branches, twigs, {{and small}} stems up to 0.25 inch (6.3 mm) diameter; larger stems are {{sometimes}} used in winter. In Yukon, they normally eat fast-growing birches and willows, and avoid spruce. At high densities, however, the apical shoots of small spruce are eaten. The snowshoe hare winter diet {{is dominated by}} bog birch (Betula glandulosa), which is preferred but not always available. Greyleaf willow (Salix glauca) is eaten most often when bog birch is not available. Buffaloberry (Shepherdia canadensis) is the fourth most common diet item. White spruce (Picea glauca) is eaten, but not preferred. In Alaska, spruce, willows, and alders comprise 75% of snowshoe hare diets; spruce needles make up nearly 40% of the diet. In northwestern Oregon, winter foods include needles and tender bark of Sitka spruce, Douglas-fir, and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla); leaves and green twigs of salal; buds, twigs, and bark of willows; and green herbs. In north-central Washington, willows and birches are not plentiful; snowshoe hares browse the tips of lodgepole pine seedlings. In Utah, winter foods include Douglas-fir, willows, snowberry (Symphoricarpos spp.), maples, and serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.). In Minnesota, aspens, willows, hazelnut (Corylus spp.), ferns (Pteridophyta spp.), birches, alders, sumacs (Rhus <b>spp.),</b> and <b>strawberries</b> (<b>Fragaria</b> <b>spp.)</b> are winter foods. Winter foods in New York include eastern white pine, red pine (Pinus resinosa), white spruce, paper birch, and aspens. In Ontario, sugar maple (Acer saccharum), striped maple (A. pensylvanicum), red maple, other deciduous species, northern white-cedar (T. occidentalis), balsam fir, beaked hazelnut (C. cornuta), and buffaloberry were heavily barked. In New Brunswick, snowshoe hares consumed northern white-cedar, spruces, American beech (Fagus grandifolia), balsam fir, mountain maple (A. spicatum), and many other species of browse. In Newfoundland, paper birch is preferred. Further details on regional food preferences are summarized in Snowshoe hare and allies: ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Strawberries</b> (Rosaceae <b>Fragaria</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{were grown}} on 57 farms on {{a total of}} 67 acres in 1997 (1). The average {{planting}} was less than 2. 5 acres. With a total of 110, 477 pounds produced annually in the state, crop value exceeds $ 145, 000, each year (1 and 2).

40|$|The genome {{sequence}} of the woodland <b>strawberry</b> (<b>Fragaria</b> vesca L.) is an important resource providing a reference for comparative genomics studies and future sequenced rosaceous species and has great utility {{as a model for}} the development of markers for mapping in the cultivated <b>strawberry</b> <b>Fragaria</b> ×ananassa Duchesne ex Rozier. A set of 152 microsatellite simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs was developed and mapped, along with 42 previously published but unmapped SSRs, permitting the precise assignment of 28. 2 Mbp of previously unanchored genome sequence scaffolds (13 % of the F. vesca genome sequence). The original ordering of F. vesca sequence scaffolds was performed without a physical map, using predominantly SSR markers to order scaffolds via anchoring to a comprehensive linkage map. This report complements and expands resolution of the <b>Fragaria</b> <b>spp.</b> reference map and refi nes the scaffold ordering of the F. vesca genome sequence using newly devised tools. The results of this study provide two signifi cant resources: (i) the concurrent validation of a substantial set of SSRs associated with these previously unmapped regions of the <b>Fragaria</b> <b>spp.</b> genome and (ii) the precise placement of previously orphaned genomic sequence.

40|$|The plant family Rosaceae {{consists}} of over 100 genera and 3, 000 species that include many important fruit, nut, ornamental, and wood crops. Members {{of this family}} provide high-value nutritional foods and contribute desirable aesthetic and industrial products. Most rosaceous crops have been enhanced by human intervention through sexual hybridization, asexual propagation, and genetic improvement since ancient times, 4, 000 to 5, 000 B. C.

40|$|The blends {{of flavor}} {{compounds}} produced by fruits serve as biological perfumes used to attract living creatures, including humans. They include hundreds of metabolites and {{vary in their}} characteristic fruit flavor composition. The molecular mechanisms by which fruit flavor and aroma compounds are gained and lost during evolution and domestication are largely unknown. Here, we report on processes {{that may have been}} responsible for the evolution of diversity in <b>strawberry</b> (<b>Fragaria</b> <b>spp)</b> fruit flavor components. Whereas the terpenoid profile of cultivated strawberry species is dominated by the monoterpene linalool and the sesquiterpene nerolidol, fruit of wild strawberry species emit mainly olefinic monoterpenes and myrtenyl acetate, which are not found in the cultivated species. We used cDNA microarray analysis to identify the F. ananassa Nerolidol Synthase 1 (FaNES 1) gene in cultivated strawberry and showed that the recombinant FaNES 1 enzyme produced in Escherichia coli cells is capable of generating both linalool and nerolidol when supplied with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) or farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), respectively. Characterization of additional genes that are very similar to FaNES 1 from both the wild and cultivated strawberry species (FaNES 2 and F. vesca NES 1) showed that only FaNES 1 is exclusively present and highly expressed in the fruit of cultivated (octaploid) varieties. It encodes a protein truncated at its N terminus. Green fluorescent protein localization experiments suggest that a change in subcellular localization led to the FaNES 1 enzyme encountering both GPP and FPP, allowing it to produce linalool and nerolidol. Conversely, an insertional mutation affected the expression o...|$|E

The data indicate that the strawberry genome is gene-dense, with an average of one protein-encoding gene or pseudogene per 5. 9 kb. Current overall EST coverage is sparse. The unexpected gene duplications and their differential patterns of EST support suggest possible subfunctionalization or pseudogenization of these sequences.
