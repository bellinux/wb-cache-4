500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> country, or <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E
500|$|Kenyon's {{appointment}} was initially greeted with caution by his fellow barristers, who worried that, {{as he had}} practised {{in a court of}} equity rather than a court of common law, he might be unfamiliar with the area covered by his new posting in the Court of King's Bench. Despite this, he was noted as an excellent judge, although one who suffered from an [...] "excess of zeal" [...] in moral issues. One of his flaws was his defective education; he was too proud to avoid exhibiting his ignorance. He was particularly noted for using Latin incorrectly, leading George III to say [...] "My Lord... it would be well if you would <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> good law and leave off your bad Latin". As a judge, Kenyon over-ruled the principles that a court of law could not consider trusts or a pecuniary legacy; it was said that he [...] "restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law". After nearly one and a half decades as a judge, Kenyon died on 4 April 1802 in Bath.|$|E

500|$|After {{spending}} {{several years}} operating at a loss, GoodHome.com reorganized {{under the name}} Scene7, which formally launched in January 2001, with $15 million raised from investors that included Hearst Interactive Media. The new company focused on helping companies prepare interactive advertisements for consumers. Mack, the Broderbund executive who had decided to spin off the company, reflected on the decision to reorganize and relaunch: [...] "We got a year into [...] and the whole B2C (business-to-consumer) market tanked, and we realized we could not build a successful business as a portal [...] But the whole time we kept having people approach us to license the technology , and finally a light bulb went off when we realized we were {{sitting on top of}} a great technology we could sell." [...] Scene7 raised a round of financing on July 12, 2001 that totaled $11.3million, which helped stabilize the company. The deal was led by venture capitalists from several firms, including Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management and Xcelera of the Cayman Islands, with cash investments from Cooley Godward and Perkins Coie. After the latest round of financing, Mack planned for Scene7 to have 15clients and a burn rate, or negative cash flow, of less than $700,000 a month, stating, [...] "What we learned was to <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> strategy, and don't get nervous when the competition is adopting a strategy to spend their way to victory." [...] At the time, the company's revenues were well below its peak of $1million a month, but Mack intended to increase revenues past that point in a few months.|$|E

She became a vegan in 1998 after attending an animal rights meeting, saying [...] "I realized that I was the problem … I was an animal lover who was eating animals."

2500|$|At around 10:00PM, General Kruel called João Goulart. In the call, Kruel {{asked the}} {{president}} to break with the left-wing by sacking his Minister of Justice and Chief of Staff and outlaw the [...] (Worker's General Command), a major workers' organization. Goulart replied that doing so would be a humiliating defeat for him, making him a [...] "decorative president". Goulart told Kruel: [...] "General, I don't abandon my friends. (...) I would rather stick with my grassroots. You should <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> convictions. Put your troops {{out on the street}} and betray me, publicly." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E
