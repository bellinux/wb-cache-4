When he learned of the {{underground}} societies that were planning a revolution and was asked to join, he <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> idea and turned down the offer.

Nevertheless, after the existence of the Katipunan was leaked in August 1896, the Luna brothers were arrested and jailed in Fort Santiago for [...] "participating" [...] in the revolution. His statement concerning the revolution was one of the many statements used to abet the laying down of death sentence for José Rizal.

500|$|Wills won {{the match}} for his {{side with a}} top score of 57 not out, and The Age said of his playing style and {{entertaining}} ability that [...] "there {{has not been a}} more amusing scene on this ground". In the January 1857 intercolonial against New South Wales, held on the Domain in Sydney, Wills was the leading wicket-taker with ten victims, but failed with the bat. Bowling fast round-arm, the Victorians <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> [...] "antiquated" [...] underhand action of their opponents. The latter style proved effective, however, giving New South Wales a 65-run win. Back in Victoria, Wills joined numerous clubs, including the provincial Corio Cricket Club, based in Geelong, and the elite Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC). Although he played his first club game with, and had a greater affinity for Corio, the MCC maintained that Wills belonged to them, and took offence at his lack of loyalty to any one club. In order to secure Wills in matches between the two teams, the MCC allowed Corio to field an extra five men to make up for his loss.|$|E

Previous titles had included If You See Kay (a pun on the spelling of [...] "fuck") and Genital Ben, {{accompanied by a}} bear {{on the cover of}} the album (a reference to Gentle Ben). Stressed at being at a loss for a name, DeLonge asked guitar tech Larry Palm for suggestions. The album's title was coined by Palm, who was snowboarding on a rainy day. Inside the lodge, Palm was congregating with friends when a young kid walked in completely drenched, to which his mother suggested he [...] "take off [...] pants and jacket." [...] Palm was told by DeLonge that if the band were to use the name, he would [...] "hook him up". Instead, Palm received a letter from manager Rick DeVoe for his contribution, which offered a $500 payout for the name. Palm <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> amount, and filed suit in 2003 with the intellectual property attorney Ralph Loeb, alleging breach of contract and fraud against the band. Palm demanded $20,000; the band eventually settled out of court for $10,000.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{establishment}} of the Tang dynasty, during the reign of Emperor Taizong (r.626649), the threat of Göktürk tribesmen from the north prompted some court officials to suggest drafting corvée labourers to repair the aging Great Wall. Taizong <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> suggestion, alluding to the Sui walls built in vain: [...] "The Emperor Yang of Sui made the people labor to construct the Great Wall in order to defend against the Turks, but in the end this was of no use." [...] Instead of building walls, Taizong claimed he [...] "need merely to establish Li Shiji in Jinyang for the dust on the border to settle." [...] Accordingly, Taizong sent talented generals like Li Shiji with mobile armies to the frontier, while fortifications were mostly limited to a series of walled garrisons, such as the euphemistically-named [...] "cities for accepting surrender" [...] (受降城, shòuxiáng chéng) that were actually bases from which to launch attacks.

500|$|Others saw no {{intentional}} snub of Colbert by the press. Responding to {{a question}} about why The Washington Posts article about the dinner did not go into any detail about Colbert's speech, Media Backtalk writer Howard Kurtz responded, [...] "The problem in part is one of deadline. The presses were already rolling by the time Colbert came on at 10:30, so the story had to be largely written by then." [...] Asked why television news favored Bush's performance over Colbert's, Elizabeth Fishman, an assistant dean at the Columbia School of Journalism and a former 60 Minutes producer, told MTV that the [...] "quick hit" [...] for television news shows would have been to use footage of Bush standing beside his impersonator. [...] "It's an easier set up for visual effect", she noted. Steve Scully, president of the White House Correspondents' Association (which hosted the dinner) and political editor of C-SPAN (which broadcast the dinner), <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> whole idea of the press intentionally ignoring Colbert: [...] "Bush hit such a home run with Steve Bridges that he got all of the coverage. I think that exceeded expectations. There was no right-wing conspiracy or left-wing conspiracy." [...] Time columnist Ana Marie Cox dismissed allegations of a deliberate media blackout, because Colbert's performance received coverage in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the major wire services. Fellow commentator Kurtz concurred, noting that the video was carried on C-SPAN and was freely available online; he also played two clips on his own show. [...] "Apparently I didn't get the memo," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky's music {{remained}} {{popular in}} Russia {{as well as}} abroad, and his scholarly prowess was admired by the Belyayev circle; however, these composers chose not to emulate his style. Composers who wished {{to be part of}} this group and desired Belyayev's patronage had to write in a musical style approved by Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. That approved style, Maes writes, included harmonies from the coronation scene in Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov, the colorful harmonization and octotonicism of Rimsky-Korsakov's operas Mlada and Sadko, and Balakirev's folk-song stylizations. These elements [...] "served as a store of recipes for writing Russian national music. In the portrayal of the national character... these techniques prevailed over the subjects portrayed." [...] Taruskin writes that echoing this style of writing became the prime order of business, with absolute music such as symphonies and chamber works preferred over the program music favored by The Five, and quasi-oriental themes such as those used in Balakirev's Islamey and Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade <b>scoffed</b> <b>at.</b> <b>The</b> trend toward writing in the preferred style would continue at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory after Rimsky-Korsakov's retirement in 1906, with his son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg in charge of composition classes at the Conservatory through the 1920s. Dmitri Shostakovich would complain about Steinberg's musical conservatism, typified by such phrases as [...] "the inviolable foundations of the kuchka", and the [...] "sacred traditions of Nikolai Andreyevich [...] ". (Kuchka, short for Moguchaya kuchka or [...] "Mighty Handful", was another name for The Five.) Eventually, the Belyayev aesthetic spread as more of its composers took up academic posts in music conservatories throughout Russia. Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov became director of the Moscow Conservatory, where Tchaikovsky had once exerted great influence, and Reinhold Glière likewise in Kiev, ensuring that these institutes [...] "retained a direct link with the Belyayev aesthetic".|$|E
