40|$|This paper {{develops}} a quantitative model of city structure to <b>separate</b> <b>agglomeration</b> forces, dispersion forces and fundamentals as determinants of location choices. The model remains tractable and amenable to empirical analysis because of stochastic shocks to worker productivity, which yield a gravity equation for commuting flows. To empirically disentangle alternative determinants of location choices, we use Berlin’s division and reunification {{as a source}} of exogenous variation in the surrounding concentration of economic activity. Using disaggregated data on land prices, workplace employment and residence employment for thousands of city blocks for 1936, 1986 and 2006, we find that the model can account both qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed changes in city structure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{three key}} issues encountered when estimating {{the relationship between}} agglomeration and multi factor productivity ('agglomeration elasticities') : the sorting of heterogeneous firms, the convexity of agglomeration effects, and the challenges of identifying the impact of persistent spatial differences in effective density. We use a firm-level panel containing production data together with detailed information on the geographic location of employment, covering {{a high proportion of}} the New Zealand economy. We are able to control for heterogeneity along firm, region, and industry dimensions, and to estimate <b>separate</b> <b>agglomeration</b> elasticities across industries and regions. Sorting leads to upward biased elasticity estimates but using firm fixed effects can lead to downward bias due to the highly persistent nature of agglomeration variables. Our preferred estimates control for sorting across regions and industries. Overall, we find a positive agglomeration elasticity of 0. 066. Within industries and, to a lesser extent within regions, there is pronounced variation in the strength of agglomeration effects, and evidence of decreasing returns to agglomeration. High density areas attract firms that benefit most from agglomeration...|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} {{and development of}} special economic and industrial zones in the current stage of development of each state is an important condition for economic development and strengthening of foreign economic relations of each country. They contribute to the integrated and balanced development of the territory using natural raw and material resources, creating a logistics and cluster centre, organising production, increasing the competitiveness of a <b>separate</b> <b>agglomeration</b> and the country’s territory.

50|$|Clonal {{reproduction}} {{takes place}} by longitudinal fission. Local populations consist {{of large numbers}} of cloned individuals with similar coloured oral discs and tentacles. Confirmation that they are clones can be gained by electrophoretic genotyping. It has been found that clones are found in <b>agglomerations,</b> sometimes narrowly <b>separated</b> from other <b>agglomerations</b> with the same genotype. There {{is no evidence that the}} clones are mobile through rafting.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} dynamics in biological systems is the emergence of clustering, in the sense that individuals self-organize into <b>separate</b> <b>agglomerations</b> in physical or behavioral space. Several theories have been developed to explain clustering in, for instance, multi-cellular organisms, ant colonies, bee hives, flocks of birds, schools of fish, and animal herds. A persistent puzzle, however, is the clustering of opinions in human populations, particularly when opinions vary continuously, such as the degree to which citizens are in favor of or against a vaccination program. Existing continuous opinion formation models predict "monoculture'' in the long run, unless subsets of the population are perfectly separated from each other. Yet, social diversity is a robust empirical phenomenon, although perfect separation is hardly possible in an increasingly connected world. Considering randomness has not overcome the theoretical shortcomings so far. Small perturbations of individual opinions trigger social influence cascades that inevitably lead to monoculture, while larger noise disrupts opinion clusters and results in rampant individualism without any social structure. Our solution to the puzzle builds on recent empirical research, combining the integrative tendencies of social influence with the disintegrative effects of individualization. A key element of the new computational model is an adaptive kind of noise. We conduct computer simulation experiments demonstrating that with this kind of noise a third phase besides individualism and monoculture becomes possible, characterized by the formation of metastable clusters with diversity between and consensus within clusters. When clusters are small, individualization tendencies are too weak to prohibit a fusion of clusters. When clusters grow too large, however, individualization increases in strength, which promotes their splitting. In summary, the new model can explain cultural clustering in human societies. Strikingly, model predictions are not only robust to "noise''-randomness is actually the central mechanism that sustains pluralism and clustering...|$|R

30|$|Two {{methods are}} {{generally}} used for nanofluid formulation, namely, the top-down method through size reduction (the two-step method), and the bottom-up approach through simultaneous production and dispersion of nanoparticles (the one-step method) [5, 6]. For the two-step method, nanoparticles are either synthesized or purchased {{first in the}} form of dry powders, and the nanofluid formulation process involves properly separating the aggregated dried particles into individual particles and keeping them from re-agglomeration under suitable ionic or surfactant conditions. How well the final dispersion is achieved depends on (i) the degree of agglomeration of the dried nanoparticles (which depends {{on the nature of the}} manufacturing, handling and storage process), (ii) the shear forces applied in <b>separating</b> <b>agglomerations</b> (weakly bonded agglomerates could be broken to their primary sizes by high shearing, but strongly bonded ones are difficult to be separated), and (iii) the liquid environment (pH or ionic conditions to keep separated particles from re-aggregation). As a result of these complicated factors and a lack of detailed characterization of the content and morphology of the liquid and solid phases, it is very difficult to compare the result from one study with another even using same nanoparticles. The formulation of nanofluids by the bottom-up approach through physical or chemical reactions has been gaining increasing interests [7]. Such a method has been practiced for a long time in the colloid industry, i.e., colloidal gold. A number of other nanofluids have also been formulated including copper and iron nanofluids through a modified physical vapor deposition method and a hydrothermal chemical reduction of salts [8, 9]. For nanofluids formulated through the one-step method, the stability of nanofluids can be improved through proper surface functionalization without involving mechanical facilities. This approach, however, suffers the problem of impurities, i.e., residual reactants are generally left in the nanofluids because of incomplete reaction or stabilization. It is difficult to elucidate the nanoparticle effect without eliminating this impurity effect.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the equilibrium of optimal production locations for two firms engaging in quantity competition under different degree of product differentiation and demand size. The main {{findings in this}} paper, which {{are different from the}} conventional findings in the literature that quantity completion always leads to central market agglomeration under the prerequisites of homogeneous product and full market coverage, are the followings. (1) Central market agglomeration is guaranteed under traditional "full market coverage" assumption, since the implicit demand size behind the assumption is so large that the demand effect, which attracts firms to agglomerate at the central market, would dominate the strategic effect, which tends to separate firms into different location. (2) Under the revised full-market-coverage, we prove that to reach the central agglomeration equilibrium requires only a smaller demand size than the conventional. In addition and importantly, when demand size shrinks to the level below the threshold, both separation and central-agglomeration are the equilibria, however, only the former equilibrium of separation is stable; and the smaller the demand size and/or the lower the degree of product differentiation between the two goods, the farther the two firms’ production locations will <b>separate.</b> Central <b>agglomeration,</b> Quantity competition, Full market coverage, Location choice...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{estimated}} the net agglomeration economies both in production side and in consumption side using Japanese city data around 1990, when interregional net migration nearly ceased. We showed that doubling city size increases that nominal wage about 10 % while it decreases the real wage about 4 %. A 10 % {{up of the}} nominal wage is attributed to the productivity increase in production activities while a 4 % down of the real wage is a compensation for the net agglomeration economies, which are the benefits from product variety minus the costs of congestion. That is, city bigness not only enhances productivity of firms, but also brings net agglomeration economies to households. In this way, we <b>separated</b> the net <b>agglomeration</b> economies in production side from those in consumption side. ...|$|R

We estimate that an area with 10 percent higher effective density has firms with productivity that is 0. 69 percent higher, once we control for the industry specific production functions and sorting of more productive firms across industries and locations.

40|$|Nanocrystalline CeO 2 samples {{have been}} {{manufactured}} using sol-gel techniques, containing either 15 % silica or 10 % alumina by weight to restrict {{growth of the}} ceria nanocrystals during annealing by Zener pinning. 29 Si and 27 Al MAS NMR {{have been used to}} investigate the structure of these pinning phases over a range of annealing temperatures up to 1000 °C, and their effect on the CeO 2 morphology has been studied using electron microscopy. The silica pinning phase resulted in CeO 2 nanocrystals of average diameter 19 nm after annealing at 1000 °C, whereas the alumina pinned nanocrystals grew to 88 nm at the same temperature. The silica pinning phase was found to contain a significant amount of inherent disorder indicated by the presence of lower n Qn species even after annealing at 1000 °C. The alumina phase was less successful at restricting the growth of the ceria nanocrystals, and tended to <b>separate</b> into larger <b>agglomerations</b> of amorphous alumina, which crystallised to a transition alumina phase at higher temperatures...|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} the {{feasibility}} of aerosol processing of nearly monodisperse silicon nanoparticles via pyrolysis of monosilane in a hot wall reactor is presented. For optimal conditions silicon nanoparticles with a geometric standard deviation of 1. 06 were synthesized at a production rate of 0. 7 g/h. The size of the particles could be precisely controlled {{in the range of}} 2040 nm, whilst maintaining a geometric standard deviation in the range of 1. 061. 08, by proper choice of the governing parameters temperature, residence time and precursor concentration. The results show that narrow particle size distributions can only be obtained in the temperature range between 900 and 1100 °C, as long as both the initial silane concentration (1 mbar silane partial pressure) and the reactor total pressure a re low (25 mbar). This regime for the production of narrow particle size distributions has not been identified in prior work on the thermal decomposition of silane.

40|$|Next to {{the coating}} formulation, process {{conditions}} play {{important roles in}} determining coating quality. This study aims to develop an operational window that <b>separates</b> layering from <b>agglomeration</b> regimes and, furthermore, the one {{that leads to the}} best coating quality in a fluidized bed coater. The bed relative humidity and the droplet size of the coating aerosol were predicted using a set of engineering models. The coating quality was characterized using a quantitative image analysis method, which measures the coating thickness distribution, the total porosity, and the pore size in the coating. The layering regime can be achieved by performing the coating process at a certain excess of the viscous Stokes number (ΔStv). This excess is dependent on the given bed relative humidity and droplet size. The higher the bed relative humidity, the higher is the ΔStv required to keep the process in the layering regime. Further, it is shown that using bed relative humidity and droplet size alone is not enough to obtain constant coating quality. The changes in bed relative humidity and droplet size have been identified to correlate to the fractional area of particles sprayed per unit of time. This parameter can effectively serve as an additional parameter to be considered for a better control on the coating quality. High coating quality is shown to be achieved by performing the process close to saturation and spraying droplets small enough to obtain high spraying rate, but not too small to cause incomplete coverage of the core particles...|$|R
