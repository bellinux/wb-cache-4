40|$|Cold-formed steel {{members can}} be {{assembled}} in various combinations to provide cost-efficient and safe light gauge floor systems for buildings. Such light gauge <b>steel</b> <b>framing</b> floor systems are widely accepted in industrial and commercial building construction. Light gauge <b>steel</b> <b>framing</b> floor systems must {{be designed to}} serve as fire compartment boundaries and provide adequate fire resistance. Floor assemblies with higher fire resistance rating are needed to develop resilient building systems for extreme fire events. Recently, a new composite panel system based on external insulation has been developed for light gauge <b>steel</b> <b>framing</b> floors to provide higher fire resistance rating under fire conditions. This article presents the details of an experimental investigation of light gauge <b>steel</b> <b>framing</b> floors made of both the conventional (with and without cavity insulation) and the new composite panel systems under standard fires. Analysis of the fire test {{results showed that the}} thermal and structural performance of externally insulated light gauge <b>steel</b> <b>framing</b> floor system was superior than conventional light gauge <b>steel</b> <b>framing</b> floors with or without cavity insulation. Details of the experimental results including the temperature and deflection profiles measured during the tests are presented along with the joist failure modes. Such fire performance data can be used in the numerical modelling of light gauge <b>steel</b> <b>framing</b> floor systems to further improve the understanding of their fire behaviour and to develop suitable fire design rules...|$|R
5|$|On the exterior, the two {{and three}} lower stories in the {{respective}} buildings were of red sandstone, while {{the balance of the}} work to the roof-line was red brick and red terracotta.

5|$|The van Berkel Pavilion was {{composed}} of two parallel rectangular planes joined by curving scoops, all built on a <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> covered with glossy white plywood. It was situated on a raised platform, which was sliced by a ramp entrance, making it ADA accessible. The Hadid Pavilion was a tensioned fabric shell fitted over a curving aluminum framework made of more than 7,000pieces. A centennial-themed video presentation was projected on its interior fabric walls after dark.|$|E

At the time of opening, four additional dining options were expected within three months. The area was carved out of a former second-floor banking hall.|$|E
40|$|Using fluid dampers {{to connect}} {{adjacent}} buildings for enhancing their seismic resistant performance has been recently investigated but limited to linear elastic adjacent buildings only. This paper presents {{a study of}} inelastic seismic response of adjacent buildings linked by fluid dampers. A nonlinear finite element planar model using plastic beam element is first constructed to simulate two <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> connected by fluid dampers. Computed linear elastic seismic responses of the two <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> with and without fluid dampers under moderate seismic events are then compared with the experimental results obtained from shaking table tests. Finally, elastic-plastic seismic responses of the two <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> with and without fluid dampers are extensively computed, and the fluid damper performance on controlling inelastic seismic response of the two <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> is assessed. The effects of the fundamental frequency ratio and structural damping ratio of the two <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> on the damper performance are also examined. The results show that not only in linear elastic stage but also in inelastic stage, the seismic resistant performance of the two <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> of different fundamental frequencies can be significantly enhanced if they are properly linked by fluid dampers of appropriate parameters.

5|$|Since {{the closure}} of the {{railways}} the railway land in the centre of the town stood empty for many years. Most prominent was a green space between the museum and brook which housed a dis-used pit wheel on a low <b>steel</b> <b>frame,</b> which many passers-by mistook for a spinning wheel. There had long been an aspiration to develop a memorial park or garden on the site to commemorate both the mining history of the town and to provide a new setting for the town's war memorial.|$|E
5|$|The Chrysler Building is {{considered}} a leading example of Art Deco architecture. The exterior of the building has about fifty total ornaments protruding from the building's corners at five different floors in a way similar to the gargoyles of Gothic cathedrals. The corners of the 61st floor are graced with eagles, (a nod to the bald eagle, the national bird of the United States), while the 31st-floor contains gargoyles and replicas of the 1929 Chrysler radiator caps at its corners. The building is constructed of masonry with a <b>steel</b> <b>frame,</b> as well as metal cladding, and currently contains a total of 3,862 windows on its facades.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> {{structural}} systems allowed completely vertical construction; {{but as with}} many skyscrapers of the era, the exterior was designed with multiple setbacks at increasing heights, which served to allow additional light into the ever-deepening concrete valleys in urban cores. At night, the setbacks are upwardly lit by floodlights, further emphasizing the structure's vertical elements. The night illumination design was a common contemporary Chicago architectural theme, seen also in the Wrigley Building, the Jewelers Building, the Palmolive Building, the LaSalle-Wacker Building, and the Tribune Tower.|$|E

5|$|The {{approach}} quickly {{caught on}} in Chicago. In 1889 the Tacoma Building replaced the bolted metal design with a stronger riveted approach, and Chicago's Chamber of Commerce Building introduced interior light courts to the structural design of skyscrapers. The 1890 Rand McNally Building became {{in the first}} entirely self-supporting, steel-framed skyscraper. Some buildings, such as The Rookery and the Monadnock Building, combined elements of both the newer and older styles, but generally Chicago rapidly adopted steel structures as a flexible and effective way to produce a range of tall buildings. Structural engineers specializing in the <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> design began to establish practices in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is neoclassical in the Louis XVI manner, built during the Belle Époque {{to resemble a}} stylish Parisian block of flats, over arcades that consciously evoked the Rue de Rivoli. Its architects were Charles Mewès, who had previously designed Ritz's Hôtel Ritz Paris, and Arthur Davis, with engineering collaboration by the Swedish engineer Sven Bylander. It {{was one of the}} earliest substantial <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> structures in London, the Savoy Hotel extension of 1903-04 being the first in the capital. Many of the materials used {{in the construction of the}} hotel were US-made. The initial fees for suites ranged from 1 1/2 guineas to 3 1/2 guineas.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{structural}} <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> {{was also}} a first for the city. It was covered in grey limestone from Saint-Marc-des-Carrières and Queenston. Due to the rapid construction, Saint-Marc-des-Carrières was unable to supply enough stone {{to keep up with}} demand on the building site, resulting in the use of Queenston as an additional source. Saint-Marc-des-Carrières limestone is a pearly grey, and becomes a pale beige with age, while Queenston limestone has pink calcite streaks from crinoid fossils and takes a chamois tint as it ages.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} benchmark solutions {{of space}} <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> using second-order distributed plasticity analysis. The majority of available benchmark solutions of <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> {{in the past}} were only of two-dimensional frames. Therefore, three-dimensional benchmark solutions are needed to extend the knowledge of this field. Details of the modeling including element type, mesh discretization, material model, residual stresses, initial geometric imperfections, boundary conditions, and load applications are presented. Case studies of Vogel’s portal <b>frame</b> and space <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> are performed. The ultimate loads obtained from the proposed analysis and Vogel agree well within 1 % error. The ultimate loads of the space <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> obtained from the proposed analysis and experiment compare well within 35 % error. The benchmark solutions of the space <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> are useful for the verification of various simplified second-order inelastic analyses. It is observed that the load carrying capacities calculated by the AISC-LRFD method are 2531 % conservative when {{compared with those of}} the proposed analysis. This difference is attributed {{to the fact that the}} AISC-LRFD approach does not consider the inelastic moment redistribution, but the analysis includes the inelastic redistributio...|$|R
5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design {{was different from the}} design of other power stations at the time because it enclosed the machinery in a <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> clad with glass. This was a departure from the usual power station designs, which normally enclosed the machinery in a concrete or brick wall. Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK and possibly even the world to be built in this way. The station was also the first in the world to use metal clad switchgear at a voltage as high as 66,000V.|$|E
5|$|The station {{consists}} of a parallel boiler house and turbine hall, which creates a large double-gabled building. It is of <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> construction with brick cladding. Other features include round-headed openings and ridge ventilators. This building originally housed the station's boilers and turbo generators. Constructed alongside the station was a brick built chimney, to remove gasses from the boilers. The station was first brick built power station in North East England, with corrugated iron being the usual material used prior to this.|$|E
5|$|The two-tier <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> {{and wooden}} floor Bullens Road Stand, {{designed}} by Archibald Leitch, {{was completed in}} 1926.

Few changes were made until 1963 when the rear of the Paddock was seated and an overhanging roof was added. The stand is known for Archibald Leitch's highly distinctive balcony trusses which also act as handrails for the front row of seats in the Upper Bullens stand. Goodison Park is the only stadium with two complete trusses designed by Leitch. Of the 17 created, only Goodison Park, Ibrox and Fratton Park retain these trusses.|$|E

40|$|In {{the seismic}} design of <b>steel</b> <b>frames,</b> beam-to-column joints can be {{designed}} either as full strength joints, forcing {{the location of the}} plastic hinges at the beam ends, or as partial strength joints which have to dissipate the seismic input energy. Seismic codes provide specific design criteria for full strength joints, but there are no detailed recommendations dealing with partial strength connections. Therefore, in this paper, by means of a simplified model, such as a SDOF system, the requirements which partial strength joints have to possess, for designing <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> characterised by seismic performances equivalent to those of <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> with rigid full strength joints, are pointed out. Successively, starting from the above requirements, a new method for designing seismic resistant <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> with extended end plate connections leading to the complete definition of the geometrical and mechanical parameters of the joints is proposed...|$|R

5|$|Construction of {{the first}} phase, the A Station, began in March 1929. The main {{building}} work {{was carried out by}} John Mowlem & Co, and the structural steelwork erection carried out by Sir William Arrol & Co. Other contractors were employed for specialist tasks. Most of the electrical equipment, including the steam turbine turbo generators, was produced by Metropolitan-Vickers in Trafford Park, Manchester. The building of the <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> began in October 1930. Once completed, the construction of the brick cladding began, in March 1931. Until the construction of the B Station, the eastern wall of the boiler house was clad in corrugated metal sheeting as a temporary enclosure. The A Station first generated electricity in 1933, but was not completed until 1935. The total cost of its construction was £2,141,550. Between construction beginning in 1929 and 1933, there were six fatal and 121 non-fatal accidents on the site.|$|E

5|$|Odin and Ägir {{used the}} same {{transverse}} and longitudinal <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> construction as the Siegfried-class ships. The ships had eight watertight compartments and a double bottom for about 60% {{of the length of}} the hull.

The ships were described as good sea boats; they had gentle motion and were very responsive to commands from the helm. The ships lost significant speed in heavy seas, however. The ships had a crew of 20officers and 256 enlisted men, with an additional 6officers and 22men when serving as a flagship. The refit increased crew requirements, to an additional 31sailors normally, and the extra flagship crew increased to 9officers and 34men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy.|$|E
