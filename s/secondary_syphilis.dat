500|$|Syphilis is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. The {{signs and symptoms of}} syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration) but there may be multiple sores. In <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> a diffuse rash occurs, which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina. In latent syphilis, which can last for years, there are few or no symptoms. In tertiary syphilis there are gummas (soft non-cancerous growths), neurological, or heart symptoms. Syphilis has been known as [...] "the great imitator" [...] as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases.|$|E

40|$|Primary Syphilis {{and is an}} <b>Secondary</b> {{acute and}} <b>Syphilis</b> chronic — sexually Continued {{transmitted}} disease (STD) caused by infection with Treponema pallidum. The disease is characterized by skin and mucous membrane lesions in the acute phase (primary and <b>secondary</b> [P&S] <b>syphilis)</b> and lesions of the bone, viscera, and cardiovascular and neurologic systems in the chronic phase. Because syphilis enhances transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), prevention of syphilis is important for controlling HIV (1). During 1986 – 1990, an epidemic of syphilis occurred throughout the United States (2). Syphilis rates began to decline in 1991 and have declined each year since that time. To determine whether this decline is reflected in changes in the epidemiology of syphilis, CDC analyzed notifiable disease surveillance data for 1997.

50|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> occurs {{approximately}} four to {{ten weeks}} after the primary infection. While secondary disease is known for the many different ways it can manifest, symptoms most commonly involve the skin, mucous membranes, and lymph nodes. There may be a symmetrical, reddish-pink, non-itchy rash on the trunk and extremities, including the palms and soles. The rash may become maculopapular or pustular. It may form flat, broad, whitish, wart-like lesions known as condyloma latum on mucous membranes. All of these lesions harbor bacteria and are infectious. Other symptoms may include fever, sore throat, malaise, weight loss, hair loss, and headache. Rare manifestations include liver inflammation, kidney disease, joint inflammation, periostitis, inflammation of the optic nerve, uveitis, and interstitial keratitis. The acute symptoms usually resolve after three to six weeks; about 25% of people may present with a recurrence of secondary symptoms.
