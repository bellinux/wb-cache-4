25|$|During the Santa Ana winds, large ocean waves can develop. These waves {{come from}} a northeasterly direction; toward the {{normally}} <b>sheltered</b> <b>side</b> of Catalina Island. Protected harbors such as Avalon and Two Harbors are normally sheltered and the waters within the harbors are very calm. In strong Santa Ana conditions, these harbors develop high surf and strong winds that can tear boats from their moorings and crash them onto the shore. During a Santa Ana, it is advised that boaters moor {{on the back side}} of the island to avoid the dangerous conditions of the front side.|$|E
500|$|The expedition's hut, a {{prefabricated}} structure measuring 33 x 19feet (10m x 5.8m), {{was ready}} for occupation {{by the end of}} February. It was divided into a series of mainly two-person cubicles, with a kitchen area, a darkroom, storage and laboratory space. The ponies were housed in stalls built on the most <b>sheltered</b> <b>side</b> of the hut, while the dog kennels were placed close to the porch. Shackleton's inclusive leadership style, in contrast to that of Scott, meant no demarcation between upper and lower decks—all lived, worked and ate together. Morale was high; as assistant geologist Philip Brocklehurst recorded, Shackleton [...] "had a faculty for treating each member of the expedition as though he were valuable to it".|$|E
500|$|Cambridge won the toss and {{selected}} the more <b>sheltered</b> <b>side</b> of the course. [...] The race started at 3:00p.m. on 24 March 2013. [...] Cambridge made the quicker start {{and led by}} a few feet after ten strokes. [...] They were half a length ahead after , out-rating Oxford by fours strokes per minute. [...] OUWBC's longer strokes enabled them {{to cope with the}} [...] "choppy" [...] conditions and at the [...] mark they began to catch the Cambridge boat, getting level by the [...] mark. [...] Pushing on, Oxford pulled away to win by one and three-quarter lengths in a time of 7 minutes 11 seconds, the slowest winning time since the 2001 race. [...] It was Oxford's first win since the 2011 race but their fifth win in the last six events. [...] The victory took the overall record in the event to 4127 in Cambridge's favour.|$|E

6000|$|... "Down!" [...] cried Amos Radbury, and the Texans had {{scarcely}} time to {{drop to the}} <b>sheltered</b> <b>sides</b> of the steeds, a favourite trick {{with old}} frontiersmen, when a volley sounded out, and the bullets whistled over their heads.

5000|$|Feldmark {{occurs in}} the least {{favourable}} situations for plant growth, including late-lying snowdrift areas on leeward slopes and cold, highly wind-exposed ridges. Because feldmark species are adapted to cold, bare ground, some are able to colonise areas of severe erosion where the topsoil has been removed, leaving only a surface of broken rock or stones. [...] In areas with strong prevailing winds, expansion through layering on the <b>sheltered</b> <b>sides</b> of plants means that they may grow preferentially on the protected sides and gradually move downwind across the landscape.|$|R
2500|$|Up to 90% of {{invertebrates}} in some lotic {{systems are}} insects. [...] These species exhibit tremendous diversity {{and can be}} found occupying almost every available habitat, including the surfaces of stones, deep below the substratum, adrift in the current, and in the surface film. Insects have developed several strategies for living in the diverse flows of lotic systems. [...] Some avoid high current areas, inhabiting the substratum or the <b>sheltered</b> <b>side</b> of rocks. Additional invertebrate taxa common to flowing waters include mollusks such as snails, limpets, clams, mussels, as well as crustaceans like crayfish and crabs. [...] Like most of the primary consumers, lotic invertebrates often rely heavily on the current to bring them food and oxygen (Brown 1987). [...] Invertebrates, especially insects, are important as both consumers and prey items in lotic systems.|$|E
60|$|The {{island was}} rocky, {{and it was}} covered with trees. On the <b>sheltered</b> <b>side</b> of it there was a beach, where the party landed. Although this beach was {{somewhat}} protected from the wind, still the waves which rolled in kept {{the water in a}} state of agitation. They, however, landed here, running the head of the boat upon the sand.|$|E
60|$|A door stood half-open {{upon the}} <b>sheltered</b> <b>side</b> of the building; and suddenly, as if blown thither like a storm-driven bird, a little figure came {{fluttering}} in, breathless, half-frozen, and quite bewildered {{by a long}} struggle with the pitiless gale. Feebly brushing away the snow that blinded her, the poor thing looked about her with frightened eyes; and, seeing no one but the cat, seemed to take courage and crept toward the fire, as if suffering for the moment conquered fear.|$|E

60|$|On his {{way back}} home from his darling orchard he found a rare fern {{in the woods and}} dug it up for Sara--she had loved ferns.

60|$|I {{put on an}} ulster, lit a cigar, {{and went}} up on deck.

But I had scarcely settled down before a little group of people came along the deck and halted close to me. A smooth-faced manservant, laden {{with a pile of}} magnificent rugs, struck a match and began to examine the labels on the chairs. Its flickering light was apparently sufficient for Adèle to recognize my features.|$|E
50|$|Mountain winds blow {{straight}} up {{the western side}} and straight down {{the eastern side of}} the mountains and become much warmer and drier due to the Föhn effect; this produces the most pleasant conditions when temperatures can occasionally rise over 20 C on summer days.

She made scarcely any attempt to listen to what Helen was saying, as Helen indulged in commonplaces to begin with. While Mrs. Ambrose arranged her embroidery, sucked her silk, and threaded her needle, she lay back gazing at the horizon.|$|E
60|$|Our {{favorite}} {{resort is}} by the old red smoke pipe of the steamer, which rises warm and luminous {{as a sort of}} tower of defence. The wind must blow an uncommon variety of ways at once when you cannot find a <b>sheltered</b> <b>side,</b> as well as a place to warm your feet. In fact, the old smoke pipe is the domestic hearth of the ship; there, with the double convenience of warmth and fresh air, you can sit by the railing, and, looking down, command the prospect of the cook's offices, the cow house, pantries, &c.|$|E

60|$|Chickadee's nest {{is always}} neat and {{comfortable}} and interesting, just like himself. It {{is a rare}} treat to find it. He selects an old knot-hole, generally on the <b>sheltered</b> <b>side</b> of a dry limb, and digs out the rotten wood, making a deep and sometimes winding tunnel downward. In the dry wood at the bottom he makes a little round pocket and lines it with the very softest material. When one finds such a nest, with five or six white eggs delicately touched with pink lying at the bottom, {{and a pair of}} chickadees gliding about, half fearful, half trustful, it is altogether such a beautiful little spot that I know hardly a boy who would be mean enough to disturb it.|$|E

6000|$|Several {{days had}} passed since her futile journey, and Tess was afield. The dry winter wind still blew, but a screen of {{thatched}} hurdles erected {{in the eye of}} the blast kept its force away from her. On the <b>sheltered</b> <b>side</b> was a turnip-slicing machine, whose bright blue hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene. Opposite its front was a long mound or [...] "grave", in which the roots had been preserved since early winter. Tess was standing at the uncovered end, chopping off with a bill-hook the fibres and earth from each root, and throwing it after the operation into the slicer. A man was turning the handle of the machine, and from its trough came the newly-cut swedes, the fresh smell of whose yellow chips was accompanied by the sounds of the snuffling wind, the smart swish of the slicing-blades, and the choppings of the hook in Tess's leather-gloved hand.|$|E

60|$|He {{went to one}} of {{the doors}} that was on the {{right-hand}} side of this room, and opened it a little way; but the wind and rain came in so violently that he thought he would go to the opposite side and try that door. This idea proved a very fortunate one, for, being now on the <b>sheltered</b> <b>side</b> of the ship, he could open the door and look out without exposing himself to the fury of the storm. He gazed for a time at the raging fury of the sea with a sentiment of profound admiration and awe. The surface of the ocean was covered with foam, and the waves were tossing themselves up in prodigious heaps; the crests, as fast as they were formed, being seized and hurled away by the wind in a mass of driving spray, which went scudding over the water like drifting snow in a wintry storm on land.|$|E
60|$|But on {{the fourth}} day out there came {{symptoms}} of a change. The chief had adopted the plan of travelling during every hour of the short day, or twilight, in order to make more sure of not missing the trail, and the stars with frequent aurora borealis had made each night so brilliant that he advanced almost as easily as during the day-time. The fourth day, however, on awaking, his ears were greeted with sounds that caused him to rise in haste and force out the door of his sleeping hut, when to his dismay he found that a furious gale was blowing, that the sky was black, and that he could hardly see the poor dogs, whom he found crouching as close as possible on the <b>sheltered</b> <b>side</b> of the hut. In these circumstances, to advance without losing his way was impossible, so that he was compelled {{to make the most of}} his time by sleeping as much as he could.|$|E
60|$|On {{the fifth}} morning Slingerland was persuaded to attempt {{the trip to}} aid Service. Larry wanted to {{accompany}} them, but Slingerland said he had better stay with Allie. So, muffled up, the two men set out on snow-shoes, dragging a sled. A crust had frozen on the snow, otherwise traveling would have been impossible. Once up on the slope the north wind hit them square in the face. Heavily clad as he was, Neale thought the very marrow in his bones would freeze. That wind blew straight through him. There were places where it took both men to hold the sled {{to keep it from}} getting away. They were blown back one step for every two steps they made. On the exposed heights they could not walk upright. At last, after hours of desperate effort, they got over the ridge to a <b>sheltered</b> <b>side</b> along which they labored up to Service's dugout.|$|E
