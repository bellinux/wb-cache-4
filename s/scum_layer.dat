50|$|A {{grease trap}} (also known as grease interceptor, grease {{recovery}} device and grease converter) is a plumbing device (a type of trap) designed to intercept most greases and solids before they enter a wastewater disposal system. Common wastewater contains {{small amounts of}} oils which enter into septic tanks and treatment facilities to form a floating <b>scum</b> <b>layer.</b> This <b>scum</b> <b>layer</b> is very slowly digested and broken down by microorganisms in the anaerobic digestion process. Large amounts of oil from food preparation in restaurants can overwhelm a septic tank or treatment facility, causing release of untreated sewage into the environment. High-viscosity fats and cooking grease such as lard solidify when cooled, and can combine with other disposed solids to block drain pipes.|$|E
50|$|Septic {{tank and}} drain field {{microorganisms}} have very limited capability for catabolizing petroleum products and chlorinated solvents, and cannot remove dissolved metals; although some may sorb onto {{septic tank sludge}} or drain field soils, and concentrations may be diluted by other groundwater {{in the vicinity of}} the drain field. Cleaning formulations may reduce drain field efficiency. Laundry bleach may slow or stop microbial activity in the drain field, and sanitizing or deodorizing chemicals may have similar effects. Detergents, solvents and drain cleaners may transport emulsified, saponified or dissolved fats into the drain field before they can be catabolized to short-chain organic acids in the septic tank <b>scum</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Alluvial soils {{may also}} be used to purify waste-water being {{returned}} to a river after use. Treated wastewater is typically discharged into a percolation pond on the alluvial flood plain rather than flowing directly into the river. [...] Chemical filtration will cease when all reactive sites within the flow pathway through aquifer soil have reacted. Physical filtration tends to become more effective as trapped particulates block interstitial passages between alluvial soil particles; but may ultimately limit flow rates through the soil. [...] Particulates on the river side of the soil interface may be periodically scoured away by turbulent flow. Wastewater percolation ponds may require maintenance to break up or remove a <b>scum</b> <b>layer</b> (Schmutzdecke) forming {{at the bottom of the}} pond. Biological filtration remains effective unless organic loading causes anaerobic conditions within the riverbed alluvium.|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{anaerobic}} digestion {{has been greatly}} developed during the last decades {{for the treatment of}} wastewater from food industries as for example, wastewaters from sugar and starch manufacturing and from breweries. However, for wastewaters which contain high amounts of fats and proteins, such as those from slaughterhouses and dairies, anaerobic digestion was found to be troublesome, due to the potential of sludge flotation, the formation of <b>scum</b> <b>layers</b> of lipids at the surface of the reactor, which are not digested and the toxicity of the intermediate compounds (long chain fatty acids) generated during the anaerobic digestion of the wastewater. The addition of hydrolytic enzymes, such as lipases prior to the anaerobic digestion can minimize these problems. In this work, this strategy is reviewed and the technical issues that must be considered in determining its feasibility are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{horizontal}} {{anaerobic digester}} {{was developed and}} tested in pilot scale for Korean food waste with high water contents (> 80 %). The hydrogen sulfide in the biogas was removed by a biological desulfurization equipment integrated in the horizontal digester. A mixer of the horizontal digester was designed to easily remove the sediment in the bottom and <b>scum</b> <b>layers</b> on surface in the digester. Experimental result for 120 days of operation of the pilot plant showed a high removal efficiency of 81. 2 % for organic substance and high stability during the whole operation period were acquired. Also food waste was treated at high organic loading rates over 4 kg•VS/m 3 ∙day and a methane gas production rate of 0. 62 m 3 /kg•VSremoved was accomplished. The biological desulfurization equipment inside the horizontal digester was proven to be an economic and effective method to reduce the biogas desulfurization cost by removing hydrogen sulfide more than 90 % without external desulfurization equipments.

40|$|Once a {{septic tank}} and {{absorption}} field are installed, {{you can do}} several things to prolong their life, thus protecting an investment which may cost 2500 or more. Here are several tips you can follow. Often overlooked or neglected {{is the fact that}} septic tanks should be inspected at least once annually. In every properly functioning septic tank, sludge accumulates in the bottom. This sludge is composed of solid materials and must be removed periodically. If the sludge is not removed, the accumulated solids will build up in the septic tank and will begin to wash out into the absorption field. Allowing solids from the septic tank to wash out into the absorption field will eventually clog it to the point where a new field will be needed. Most authorities agree that for a typical three-bedroom home, a 1, 000 -gallon (3, 800 I) septic tank will need to have the solids removed every three to five years. Smaller tanks must be pumped more often. Septic tank additives that 2 ̆ 2 clean 2 ̆ 2 the tank are available, but these are generally not recommended. Some additives may cause the solids to be flushed from the septic tank into the absorption field, causing clogging problems. Other compounds may produce a septic tank effluent which will destroy soil structure and cause premature failure of the soil absorption system. To determine if your septic tank needs pumping, the thickness of the sludge can be measured as illustrated in Figure 1. To measure the depth of the sludge, wrap a long stick with a piece of rough, white toweling and tie it securely. Lower the stick through the inlet tee (to avoid the scum) {{to the bottom of the}} tank. Wait about 30 seconds and remove the stick slowly and carefully. Black particles will cling to the towel indicating the depth of the sludge. The sludge should be removed if its depth is equal to one third or more of the liquid depth. Occasionally, a floating <b>scum</b> <b>layer</b> may develop in septic tanks. This <b>scum</b> <b>layer</b> can also cause clogging and should be checked annually. The <b>scum</b> <b>layer</b> thickness can be measured with a stick and hinged flap device (Figure 1). Push the stick through the scum until the hinged flap falls into the horizontal position. Raise the stick until you feel the bottom of the layer. Mark the stick to indicate the depth of the <b>scum</b> <b>layer.</b> Now use the same procedure to locate the lower end of the submerged inlet pipe. If the bottom side of the <b>scum</b> <b>layer</b> is within three inches (7. 6 em) of the lower end of the submerged inlet, the septic tank should be pumped. Most communities have contractors who pump septic tanks. It may cost 50 or more, but it is necessary for maintaining the life of the absorption field. The contractors pump the contents into a tank truck and dispose of it at an approved treatment site or by proper land application. Be sure the workman who cleans your tank mixes the liquid, sludge and scum before pumping so that all of the material can be removed, not just the liquid. It is not recommended to wash, scrub or disinfect the septic tank when pumping. Similarly, it is not necessary to leave solids in the septic to 2 ̆ 2 start 2 ̆ 2 it again. Normally, as the septic tank fills, the natural processes begin. Products to 2 ̆ 2 seed 2 ̆ 2 the system with desirable bacteria are available, but they are also not necessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify scum bacteria by FISH-technique and to correlate their numbers to the hydrophobicity and EPS compounds extracted from sludge and scum. Screening experiments from various wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) demonstrated that in most plants examined Microthrix parvicella was found in high numbers both in activated sludge and scum. Further nocardioform actinomycetes and type 1863 identified as Acinetobacter spp. could be characterized as important scum bacteria growing in low numbers in activated sludge and being enriched in scum layers. On the basis of these screening results, one nocardioform actinomycetes/Acinetobacter spp. -dominated WWTP 1 and one M. parvicella-dominated WWTP 2 were selected for detailed investigations. In actinomycetes/Acinetobacter-dominated WWTP 1 both lipophilic substances in the EPS and hydrophobic cell surfaces stabilized the <b>scum</b> <b>layer.</b> In M. parvicella- dominated WWTP 2 the hydrophobic cell surfaces of these organisms were responsible for the hydrophobic sludge properties and sludge floating. In both of the selected WWTPs the detected lipophilic substances in the EPS improved growth rate and development of hydrophobic cell surfaces and therefore promoted scum processes...|$|E
40|$|Sludge {{flotation}} {{was reported}} to cause several operational problems in anaerobic systems including UASB reactors treating both strong domestic sewage and some industrial wastewater. This research is to investigate the effect of anaerobic digestion on scum-forming potential (SFP) of sludge and other physical-chemical properties. A simple test was developed to measure and compare the tendency of different sludge to form a <b>scum</b> <b>layer.</b> Results showed that anaerobic digestion affects chemical composition of sludge flocs and consequently, SFP, which {{was found to be}} inversely proportional to the degree of digestion (both SRT and temperature). It was suggested that higher protein concentration at elevated SRT and 25 °C increased the negative surface charge of sludge flocs and,consequently, reduced the ability of sludge to attach to gas bubbles and float. Floc average size increased with increasing SRT and temperature, especially for sludge with 75 d SRT at 25 °C. On the other hand, settling properties of sludge were negatively affected by increasing SRT to 75 d at 25 °C. Filterability had a strong positive correlation with average floc size, but also polymeric constituents correlated positively with filterability at 25 °C...|$|E
40|$|A {{septic tank}} is a {{traditional}} wastewater treatment technology that uses an underground tank to hold and treat wastewater. As wastewater flows into the tank, heavier materials settle {{to the bottom and}} form a sludge layer, while lighter greases and fats float to the top, forming a <b>scum</b> <b>layer.</b> Clarified effluent is piped {{from the center of the}} tank and into a drainfield, where it percolates into the surrounding soil. An effluent screen (Figure 1) is a physical device that is placed on the outlet pipe of the septic tank to enhance solids removal from the septic tank effluent. In addition, by preventing excess solids from flowing out into the drainfields with the clarified effluent, these screens help to prevent blockages that can damage the drainfield. Finally, in some cases, a thin layer of organic growth called a “biomat ” may build up on the screen. This biomat is rich in anaerobic bacteria, which can help to remove viruses and pathogens from the effluent. APPLICABILITY The use of effluent screens in septic tanks is becoming more common in the U. S. Installation of effluent screens on septic tanks is mandatory in more than 50 counties nationwide, as well as in th...|$|E
40|$|Today most on-site systems fail {{due to lack}} of {{monitoring}} and maintenance. For instance, the septic tank, which is the most common on-site system, requires periodic checking of the bottom sludge layer and the top <b>scum</b> <b>layer,</b> so that the homeowner knows when it is time to pump it out. Otherwise, the scum and sludge layers may become too thick and eventually overflow into the leach field, which may clog both the leach lines and the soil. If the soil gets clogged, the bacteria contaminated water may surface and cause ponding. Clogging of the leach lines may cause the wastewater to back up into the house. One {{of the reasons for the}} lack {{of monitoring}} is that the layers have to be manually checked, which requires working with wastewater and risking bacteria and virus contamination. Some homeowners may not even know where the septic tank is buried. MicroSepTec has developed the first intelligent wastewater treatment system called the EnviroServer. The EnviroServer itself can be described as a hybrid fixed film-suspended growth extended aeration system with a two-stage biological process to optimize denitrification and on-site destruction of sludge. It produces tertiary quality water that is normally reused for subsurface irrigation. Typical test data for residential installations are below 10 mg/l of CBOD 5, below 10 mg/...|$|E
40|$|The {{oils and}} greases are organic {{substances}} of mineral, vegetal or animal origin, being the third constituent {{of the domestic}} sewer in quantitative terms. In digestors, if in great amount, they cause problems, therefore they form a dense <b>scum</b> <b>layer</b> in {{the surface of the}} same ones, harming the process of treatment of the sewer and when depositing itself in the interior of the tubings, it can provoke restrictions to the liquid flow, reduction of the speed of the draining, rise of the height of the liquid blade, solid deposition in transport for hidric saw and consequences cloggings. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the removal efficiency of mineral and vegetal/animal oils in a sanitary sewer treatment station. The data had been gotten in a sewer treatment station in the city of Cascavel-Paraná, enter the months of January and December of 2008, totalizing 12 samples. The collection points be situated {{at the beginning of the}} station, after Ralf 1 and 2 and in the end, before the launching of the effluent one to the receiving body. All the mineral oil samples and vegetal/animal oils meet below of the maximum limits established by Resolution CONAMA 357 / 2005.

40|$|In the {{quiescent}} state, cattle-manure slurry stratifies {{into three}} discernible layers, namely a floating <b>scum</b> <b>layer,</b> a bottom sludge layer and a watery middle layer. The proportions of top (scum), middle and bottom (sludge) layers were approximately 20, 60 and 20 % respectively {{of the volume}} of the whole slurry. Particulate matter from the different stratified layers was characterised for particle size distribution and cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin composition. Total solids concentrations of top, middle and bottom layers were 12. 7, 2. 8 and 7. 4 % respectively. Larger particles were found in the top layer compared with the bottom. The top layer contained the highest amounts of Neutral Detergent Fibre (NDF), Acid Detergent Fibre (ADF), cellulose and hemicellulose, but the lowest amount of Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN). The bottom layer contained the highest amounts of Acid Detergent Lignin (ADL) and TKN. With increase in particle size, there were increases in NDF, ADF, cellulose and hemicellulose, accompanied by decreases in ADL and TKN. Biochemical methane potential of the three layers was also measured. The top layer was found to produce the most methane with the middle layer producing the least. Biomethanation rate from the top layer was also the highest. Differences in biomethanation rates and biochemical methane potential were attributed to differences in chemical composition of the particulate matter. About 48 %, 23 % and 30 % of the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the top, middle and bottom layers respectively of the slurry was found to be degradable...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ammonia of {{low and high}} {{concentrations}} on milled wheat straw on biogas production was investigated. Aqueous ammonia was applied to milled wheat straw in a pretreatment process to assess improvement in biogas production through anaerobic digestion. Two different concentrations, 4 % (low) and 15 % (high), of ammonia were applied to mechanically pretreated wheat straw for 48 hours at 50 oC. Fermented sludge, obtained from Lemvig Biogasanlæg, was used as inoculum and 12 reactors were loaded {{with a mix of}} inoculum and pretreated wheat straw in a VS ratio of 4 : 1. Milled wheat straw pretreated with 15 % ammonia produced the highest average yield with 26. 5 ml per gVS- 1 and a cumulative output of 367 ml gVS- 1 compared with an average production of 19 ml per gVS- 1 and a cumulative output of 289 ml gVS- 1 of the 4 % ammonia pretreated milled wheat straw. Both produced more than the milling-only pretreatment which yielded 12. 8 ml per gVS- 1. with a cumulative 192 ml gVS- 1. The results indicate an increase in production of biogas per gVS- 1 for pretreatments using higher concentrations of ammonia. Based on the differences alone it seems that the ammonia pretreatment is effective at increasing biogas yield in a lab setting, however, no statistical significance was found for the data collected with regards to the effect of the ammonia pretreatment on biogas production (p= 0. 012). A second experiment was conducted examining the physical effects of the ammonia pretreatment which strong suggest that ammonia pretreatment has an effect on the sinkability of wheat straw, eliminating the <b>scum</b> <b>layer</b> formed under usual circumstances by wheat straw added to manure. A correlation between ammonia concentration applied to the wheat straw and sinkability was observed...|$|E
