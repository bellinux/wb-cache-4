40|$|The fully prone position, {{once used}} in surgery for chronic {{inflammatory}} lung diseases, has become obsolete. In the last 2 years, a modified <b>semiprone</b> <b>position</b> {{was used for}} video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in 358 patients undergoing lobectomy with mediastinal complete lymphadenectomy The ports were placed with the patient in the lateral decubitus position. The patient was rotated 45 â€“ 60 degrees towards the surgeon, giving enhanced exposure of the posterior mediastinum, esophagus, subcarinal and paratracheal spaces, due to displacement of the lung under gravity away from the operative field. This position is safe, well-tolerated, and allows more ergonomic and anatomical placement of the ports...|$|E
