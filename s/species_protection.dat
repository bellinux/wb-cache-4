There was an {{isolated}} population on Long Island, Tasmania in 1999, and an 1876 record allegedly from King Island, {{although there has been}} speculation that that specimen was actually collected in the Furneaux Group. The species no longer occurs at any of these Tasmania locations, and has been declared extinct in Tasmania under that state's Threatened <b>Species</b> <b>Protection</b> Act 1995.

According to the IUCN there are 21 threatened species in Puerto Rico: 2 mammals, 8 breeding birds, 8 reptiles, and 3 amphibians. The U.S. federal government lists 5 mammals, 2 amphibians, 8 birds, and 10 reptiles under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The Puerto Rican government, through the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), produces its own threatened species list which includes 18 critically endangered species (3 amphibians, 7 birds, 3 reptiles, 2 fish and 3 invertebrates), and 14 endangered species. The DNER follows the IUCN classification scheme for species' priority assignment.|$|E

5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered <b>species</b> <b>protection</b> is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E

25|$|The Peter Murrell Conservation Area {{is managed}} under the National Parks and Reserves Management Act and was {{reserved}} under the Nature Conservation Act. Additionally, {{management of the}} area must be {{in accordance with the}} Threatened <b>Species</b> <b>Protection</b> Act 1995. The Tasmanian Reserves Code of Practice 2003 is also important in providing guiding principles for management of the reserves. With Aboriginal heritage sites in the area, the Aboriginal Relics Act 1975 is also important legislation, protecting these sites and setting out statutory obligations for the TPWS to protect and preserve Aboriginal sites. The Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1994 is also relevant, as it contains provisions determining preparation of planning schemes. Also applicable is the national EPBC Act 1999, as a 'Key Threatening Process', Phytophthora cinnamomi, has been identified in the Peter Murrell Conservation Area. Additionally, with the Peter Murrell Conservation Area providing habitat for the eastern barred bandicoot, a species nationally listed as vulnerable, the EPBC Act 1999 is applicable to matters concerning this species.|$|E

For example, in Australia, they are considered a non-native invasive species, often viewed as pests, though are also considered to have some cultural and economic value. In the United States, feral horses and burros are generally considered an introduced species because they are descendants from domestic horses brought to the Americas from Europe.
