5|$|The tower has {{a three-story}} {{observation}} deck, located on floors 100â€“102, {{in addition to}} existing broadcast and antenna facilities. Similar to the Empire State Building, visitors are separated from the tenants, having their own separate entrance next to the museum, descending down to a below-ground security <b>screening</b> <b>area.</b> On the observation deck, the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor, {{but there is a}} food court on the 101st floor and a space for events for the 102nd floor. To show visitors the city, and give them information and stories about New York, an interactive tool called City Pulse is used by Tour Ambassadors. The admission fee is $32 per person, but admission discounts are available for children and seniors, and the deck is free for 9/11 responders and families of 9/11 victims. When it opens, the deck is expected to have about 3.5 million visitors per year. Tickets went on sale starting on April 8. However, the Manhattan District Attorney probed the Port Authority about the firm to which it awarded a contract to operate the deck. It officially opened on May 28, 2015, one day ahead of schedule.|$|E

25|$|In late 2007, work {{commenced}} on Skyhub (located {{between the}} Main Terminal and Terminal 2) which created a single, purpose-built security <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> {{in place of}} the previous individual facilities {{for each of the three}} piers, the other side effect being an enlarged duty-free shopping area created by taking most of the previous landside shopping and restaurant facilities airside. This new arrangement also frees up space in the departure lounges through the removal of the separate duty-free shops in the West and Central Piers. This however meant that the former public viewing areas of the apron are now airside, making the airport inaccessible to aviation enthusiasts and spectators.|$|E

50|$|Through {{the use of}} {{multiple}} projectors set up to project onto a <b>screen</b> <b>area,</b> over-projected images could be designed as animations. Typical multi-image animation effects included fading from one photograph or graphic to another, progressively building text to form a completed statement, inserting images or graphics into frames or windows on screen, step by step movement of images across the <b>screen</b> <b>area,</b> and superimposing text or images onto a background. The visual effects were synchronized to music or voice and based on the capabilities and limitations of the slide projectors and dissolve units.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, the {{domestic}} terminal undertook {{a series of}} upgrades costing a total of $30 million. Stage one ran from January 2013 to March 2013, and involved changes to the drop off points and roads outside the terminal. In {{the second half of}} 2013, the baggage claim belts were lengthened, parts of the apron was changed, and new corridors were connected to the jetbridges. The two different sides to the terminals now share a centralised security <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> following the upgrade and an extra storey was added to the western wing to provide an airside connection between the Air New Zealand side of the terminal and the Jetstar side of the terminal. The work took 12 months to complete.|$|E
25|$|On 11 June 1998, Hobart {{airport was}} privatised, with a 99-year lease {{purchased}} by Hobart International Airport Pty Ltd, a Tasmanian Government-owned company {{operated by the}} Hobart Ports Corporation. In 2004, the domestic terminal was redeveloped {{for the first time}} in its 30-year history. This development involved modernising the terminal, moving the retail shops to within the security <b>screening</b> <b>area,</b> realignment of the car park and moving the car rental facilities to a new building in the car park. In 2005, Hobart Airport experienced record annual passenger numbers and it was decided to bring forward plans to upgrade the seating capacity of the airport. This work expanded the domestic terminal building over the tarmac by three metres to provide more departure lounge space.|$|E
25|$|The International Terminal is {{composed}} of Boarding Areas A and G. The terminal was designed by Craig W. Hartman of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and opened in December 2000 to replace the International Departures section of Terminal 2. It is the largest international terminal in North America, and is the largest building in the world built on base isolators to protect against earthquakes. Food service focuses on quick service versions of leading San Francisco Bay Area restaurants, following other SFO terminals. Planners attempted to make the airport a destination in and of itself, not just for travelers who are passing through. The international terminal is a common-use facility, with all gates and all ticketing areas shared among international airlines and several domestic carriers. Common-use terminal equipment (CUTE) is used at check-in counters and gates. All international arrivals and departures are handled here (except flights from cities with customs preclearance). The International Terminal houses the airport's BART station, adjacent to the garage leading to Boarding Area G. The SFO Medical Clinic is located next to the security <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> of Boarding Area A. All the gates in this terminal {{have at least two}} jetway bridges except gates A2 and A10, which have one. Gates A1, A3, and A11 can accommodate two aircraft. Six of the gates are designed for the Airbus A380, making SFO one of the first airports in the world with such gates when it was built in 2000. Gates A9 (9A, 9B, 9C) and G101 (101A, 101B, 101C) have three jetways for boarding. Four other gates have two jetways fitted for A380 service.|$|E

50|$|The Game Gear's lower screen {{resolution}} {{results in}} the Game Gear version having a smaller visible <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> than the Master System edition, causing some fans to consider the Game Gear version the more challenging title. For example, when facing the boss of the Underground Zone, the reduced <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> either side of Sonic gives the player less time to react to hazards moving onto the screen. Other bosses were also affected: the Green Hills Zone battle {{takes place in a}} smaller, steeper arena; there is a 3rd chute which cannot be seen while fighting Robotnik in the final Crystal Egg stage.|$|R
2500|$|MWAA is also {{planning}} a new [...] "Secure National Hall" [...] project. Currently, National Hall is before security, {{with a separate}} security <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> {{for each of the}} three concourses. Since Terminal B and C were designed pre-9/11, the security screening areas are cramped and congested. Further, passengers cannot access the concessions and restaurants of National Hall after they go through security, and going from one concourse to another requires re-screening, or, in certain situations, taking a bus between concourses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{terminal}} building has a split-level design, with departures {{located in the}} upper floors and arrivals in the lower floors; an elevated roadway system provides vehicular access to both departures and arrivals levels. All check-in takes place within the Central Terminal Building, which contains 120 check-in desks and 20 self-service kiosks. Passengers then pass through a consolidated security <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> before dividing.Passengers flying internationally head to {{the northern part of}} the airport which is the international terminal, and passengers flying to other parts of South Africa head to the southern part of the airport to the domestic terminal ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{colliery}} was {{witness to}} several accidents, {{some of them}} fatal. In 1886, a collier {{by the name of}} Hardaker was injured in or around the coal <b>screening</b> <b>area.</b> The accident resulted in Hardaker taking Fletcher, the owner to court. Although some private papers about the subsequent court case, Hardakers v Fletcher, have survived, none of the paperwork is dated other than by the year. At 2:30pm on 25 June 1902, a collier by the name of W. Scott was killed. [...] Scott was pulling down the roof with his under-manager, a {{man by the name of}} Brown when a [...] layer fell, bringing down the next layer and crushing Scott. At the inquest in Bolton on 1 July, his death was recorded as accidental.|$|E

40|$|Background We {{assessed}} {{the relationship between}} screening uptake and socioeconomic deprivation for London women aged 50 â€“ 52 invited to their first routine screening appointment between 2006 and 2009. Methods We examined uptake for London overall and within six <b>screening</b> <b>areas,</b> using deprivation quintile, based on post code of residence. Results After adjustment for age, area and ethnicity, overall uptake decreased with increasing deprivation (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0. 95, P, 0. 001). However, in two <b>screening</b> <b>areas</b> with lower uptake, women living in deprived areas had higher uptake than women from affluent areas. Conclusions These potential inequalities in early diagnosis across London require further investigation...|$|R
50|$|Several {{expansion}} {{projects are}} planned or underway. The recently constructed 101-foot control tower {{was completed in}} September 2012. An expansion of the terminal building, with a new security <b>screening</b> <b>area,</b> was completed in 2007.|$|E
5000|$|These differing panel shapes {{are used}} {{in an attempt to}} reduce the {{quantity}} of panels on each frame but still provide maximum rigidity and support for the mesh attached to them. The purpose of reducing these panels is to maximize usable <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> as the walls of each panel {{get in the way of}} the mesh and prevent it from being used, this is known as [...] "blanking". The non-blanked <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> of a shaker screen is widely used as a selling feature, the more screen surface you have available to work the more efficient your shaker becomes and therefore can handle a higher quantity of fluid.|$|E
