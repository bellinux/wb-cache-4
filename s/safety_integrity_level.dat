40|$|International audiencePower {{substations}} are intensively renovated toward {{using information}} and communication technologies such as object oriented modeling and Ethernet networks. In the last two decades, Substation automation systems used capabilities of network communication services adopted from sophisticated international standardization such as IEC 61850. Distributed safety related functions take advantage of these technologies to protect the process-level equipment. Substation devices such as intelligent electronic devices, measurement units and circuit breaker controllers, with new capabilities, i. e. enabling IEC 61850, are integrated to build the protection and control functions that form the safety-related system.

50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>level</b> (SIL) {{is defined}} as a {{relative}} level of risk-reduction provided by a safety function, or to specify a target level of risk reduction. In simple terms, SIL is a measurement of performance required for a safety instrumented function (SIF).|$|E
5000|$|Assessment of the risk-reduction {{required}} by the safety function. This will involve a <b>safety</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>level</b> (SIL) or performance level or other quantification assessment. A SIL (or PL, AgPL, ASIL) applies to an end-to-end safety function of the safety-related system, not just to a component {{or part of the}} system.|$|E
30|$|As {{a result}} of this step, safety goals are defined as {{top-level}} safety requirements, which have to be incrementally refined during the safety assurance lifecycle. Usually, any safety requirement consists of a functional part and an associated <b>integrity</b> <b>level.</b> The functional part defines what the system must (not) do, whereas the <b>integrity</b> <b>level</b> defines the rigor demanded for the implementation and verification of this requirement. The <b>integrity</b> <b>level</b> depends on the risk associated with the hazardous event that is addressed by the safety goal. For example, ISO 26262 defines so-called automotive <b>safety</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>levels</b> (ASIL).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a quantitative approach to operational risk modeling and estimation of <b>safety</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>levels,</b> {{required for the}} deep water electric work class remotely operated vehicle with reference to ROSUB 6000 developed by the National Institute of Ocean Technology, India. ROSUB 6000 is used for carrying out bathymetric surveys, gas hydrate surveys, poly-metallic nodule exploration, salvage operations, and meeting emergency response situations. The system {{is expected to be}} in operation for a period of 300 h per year, and has to be extremely safe and reliable. Methods and models for the quantitative assessment of operational safety and estimation of <b>safety</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>levels</b> for ROV are seldom available in the deep water intervention industry. The safety instrumented functions implemented in the ROV should be able to meet the SIL requirements of specific mission. This study indicates that the required safety factors are implemented into the design of the state-of-the-art ROV ROSUB 6000, considering IEC 61508 / 61511 recommendations on Health, Safety and Environment and it is found that the system is able to meet the required SIL for seven identified functions. This paper gives the design and safety engineers in the ROV industry, an overview of the numerical operational risk assessment methods and safety-centered ROV engineering...|$|R
50|$|The {{functional}} requirements include details like frequency of operation, required response time, operating modes, duty cycles, operating environment, and fault reaction functions. The safety integrity requirements {{are expressed in}} levels called <b>safety</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>level</b> (SIL).

50|$|To {{reach the}} <b>safety</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>level</b> (SIL) {{required}} after a risk analysis, all system components have to comply to this level.Pre-certified software components within CODESYS {{make it much}} easier for device manufacturers to have their controllers SIL2 or SIL3 certified. Therefore, CODESYS Safety consists of components within the programming system and the runtime system, whereas the project planning is completely integrated in the IEC 61131-3 programming environment.|$|E
