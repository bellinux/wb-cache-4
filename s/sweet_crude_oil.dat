In view of the great need to improve the energy efficiency of the refining processes and to reduce maintenance cost, <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> fouling {{has been the subject of}} intense research in recent years. A combination of ASTM D 3279 and an in-house method using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was established for SARA quantification.

40|$|The Nigerian <b>crude</b> <b>Oil</b> Market {{has been}} facing {{difficulties}} in Marketing their light and <b>sweet</b> <b>crudes</b> {{on a global}} scale. These difficulties are the consequences of changes in trend in the Oil Market Industry, such as changes in the global oil refining landscape, highly increase competition from one of its key exporting partner and {{with the increase in}} demand shifting to the Middle East and Asia, with the assumption that the world is increasingly geared towards heavier and more sour crudes. The research paper will define and examine the different characteristics of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> grades, it will enable the reader to understand what is meant by “light and sweet “and “heavy and sour” crudes and where such crudes are situated. In addition, the research paper will examine the Nigerian Oil Industry and the World Oil Industry, in order to demonstrate the importance of such industry and the necessity of marketing one’s product. My objective was to demonstrate that the new trend “global structural transforming trend” in the oil refining market had no significant impact on the Marketing of Nigerian light and <b>sweet</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oils.</b> On the other hand, the real significant impact on the Marketing of Nigerian light and <b>sweet</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oils,</b> is the Management style of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the lack of information that is provided from the latter, the lack of infrastructure in Niger Delta area, the disruption in their <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> supply and the decrease in Nigeria’s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) have dramatically caused distress in the Nigerian Oil Market. Concerning external challenges, the American Shale Boom has impacted the crude exportation to the USA and this Revolution has caused not only distress in the Nigeria Market but globally, with fallen <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> prices and the conquer for market share among producers. In conclusion, reasonable evidence has proven that the market is not indeed at this instance geared towards “heavier and more sour crudes”. On the contrary, the findings had illustrated that the Oil Market Industry is quite oversupplied with “light and sweet crudes”, thus beneficial for refiners, but not for the Nigerian Oil Industry...|$|R

High-quality, low-sulfur crude oil is commonly used for processing into gasoline and is in high demand, particularly in the industrialized nations.

Nineteenth-century prospectors would taste and smell small quantities of oil to determine its quality.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{distinguishing}} features of most commodity prices against other asset prices {{is the presence of}} a mean-reverting behavior (see, e.g., Bessembinder et al.

Based on this, commodity modeling has been applying models with this property since long time ago [1]. In that sense, the most basic and simplified stochastic process that describes the characteristic of the process to drift toward a long-term value is known as the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process [8].

40|$|The {{upheaval}} in global <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> {{markets and the}} boom in shale oil production in North America brought scrutiny on the US export ban for <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> from 1975.

We consider detailed oil supply chain infrastructure with multiple <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> types, distinct oil products, as well as specific refinery configurations and modes of transport. Prices, quantities produced and consumed, as well as infrastructure and refining capacity investments are endogenous to the model. We compare two scenarios: an insulated US <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> market, and a counter-factual with lifted export restrictions. We find a significant expansion of US <b>sweet</b> <b>crude</b> exports with the lift of the export ban. In the US refinery sector, more (imported) heavy sour crude is transformed.
