25|$|The key to {{designing}} a passive <b>solar</b> <b>building</b> is to best {{take advantage of}} the local climate. Elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type, thermal insulation, thermal mass, and shading. Passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings, but existing buildings can be retrofitted.|$|E
25|$|In passive <b>solar</b> <b>building</b> design, windows, walls, {{and floors}} {{are made to}} collect, store, and {{distribute}} solar {{energy in the form}} of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer. This is called passive solar design or climatic design because, unlike active solar heating systems, it doesn't involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices.|$|E

40|$|The {{mission of}} the US Department of Energy's <b>Solar</b> <b>Buildings</b> Program is to advance the {{development}} and widespread deployment of competitive solar thermal technologies for use in buildings. The long-term goal of the Program is to combine solar energy technologies with energy-efficient construction techniques and create cost-effective buildings that have a zero net need for fossil fuel energy on an annual basis. The <b>Solar</b> <b>Buildings</b> Program conducts research and development on solar technologies that can deliver heat, light, and hot water to residential and commercial buildings. By working closely with manufacturers in both the <b>buildings</b> and <b>solar</b> energy industries and by supporting research at universities and national laboratories, the <b>Solar</b> <b>Buildings</b> Program brings together the diverse players developing reliable and affordable <b>solar</b> technologies for <b>building</b> applications. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, jointly participate in the <b>Solar</b> <b>Buildings</b> Program. These two national laboratories work closely with industry researching new concepts, developing technology improvements, reducing manufacturing costs, monitoring system performance, promoting quality assurance, and identifying potential new markets. In calendar year 1999, the <b>Solar</b> <b>Buildings</b> Program focused primarily on solar hot water system research and development (R and D), US industry manufacturing assistance, and US market assistance. The Program also completed {{a number of other}} projects that were begun in earlier years. This Contract Summary describes the Program's contracted activities that were active during 1999...|$|R

25|$|To reduce {{operating}} energy use, designers use {{details that}} reduce air leakage {{through the building}} envelope (the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space). They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. Another strategy, passive <b>solar</b> <b>building</b> design, is often implemented in low-energy homes. Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings, porches, and trees to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (daylighting) can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further reduces energy costs.|$|E

The solution requires both improved incentives for energy conservation, and new energy sources.|$|E

2500|$|The first [...] {{zero-energy}} design {{home was}} built in 1979 with support from President Carter's new United States Department of Energy. It relied heavily on passive <b>solar</b> <b>building</b> design for space heat, water heat and space cooling. It heated and cooled itself effectively in a climate where the summer peak temperature was 110 degrees Fahrenheit, and the winter low temperature was −10 F. It did not use active solar systems. It is a double envelope house that uses a gravity-fed natural convection air flow design to circulate passive solar heat from [...] of south-facing glass on its greenhouse through a thermal buffer zone in the winter. A swimming pool in the greenhouse provided thermal mass for winter heat storage.

2500|$|Since the 1980s, passive <b>solar</b> <b>building</b> {{design and}} passive house have {{demonstrated}} heating energy consumption reductions of 70% to 90% in many locations, without active energy harvesting. For new builds, and with expert design, {{this can be}} accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building. Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design. Such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building. A few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels (costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kWh production, U.S. dollar equivalent) may only reduce external energy requirements by 15% to 30%. A [...] high seasonal energy efficiency ratio 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7kW of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating, and that does not include enough for off-the-grid night-time operation. Passive cooling, and superior system engineering techniques, can reduce the air conditioning requirement by 70% to 90%. Photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the overall demand for electricity is lower.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} and select suitable phase change materials (PCMs) for northern heating-cooling supplied (heating in winter and cooling in summer) <b>solar</b> <b>buildings</b> in China. Fuzzy mathematic comprehensive analysis method was used in the process. And there are many impact factors involved in the process also. In the paper we only considered phase-transition temperature, phase-transition latent heat, coefficient of thermal conductivity, density, phase-transition temperature region, material price and safety. And some thermal performances of materials were attained by experimental measurement in the study. Finally we got the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation results of 7 selected low-temperature materials including dodecanol, heptadecane, octadecane, decanoic acid, dual composite PCM decanoic acid- palmitic acid (DA-PA), decanoic acid-lauric acid (DA-LA), and polyethylene glycol 600 (PEG 600). The conclusion is that the value of comprehensive performance index of dodecanol is the biggest, 0. 832, in seven PCMs. Therefore, the dodecanol is the most suitable PCM for northern heating-cooling supplied <b>solar</b> <b>buildings</b> in China...|$|R
40|$|Planning {{for future}} {{energy-efficient}} and energy-producing buildings requires specific knowledge during the design process. Many design decisions taken by urban planners –form, density, roof type and orientation – {{have a significant}} effect on the conditions of such buildings, although urban planners might not always be aware of the effect of their design. This study examines the effects of important design decisions on the solar energy potential of net zero energy <b>solar</b> <b>buildings.</b> Typical Swedish building blocks with varying form, density, roof type and orientation were used to simulate the annual solar irradiation and energy production, and to calculate the load match for heating and electricity under Swedish conditions. Results of this study show that the urban density is the most influential parameter on the <b>solar</b> potential of <b>building</b> blocks. Furthermore, flat roofs often returned the highest load match value, while the effect of orientation on the solar potential turned out not to be that straightforward. With the results of this study, urban planners can make better informed decisions, while it also provides a ground for the net zero energy <b>solar</b> <b>buildings</b> discussion by exposing the boundaries of such buildings in the urban environment...|$|R
