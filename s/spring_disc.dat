In this study, a load–displacement formula for the slotted <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> is newly developed in the form of energy method by considering both rigid and bending deflections of the two segments. This formula is developed with the aim to further improve the SAE formula which is limited to a straight slotted <b>disc</b> <b>spring.</b> The coned and the lever arm angles of the straight slotted <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> are the same. They are different for a bended slotted <b>disc</b> <b>spring.</b> Because of this limitation, it is geometrically impractical to employ the SAE formula for a bended slotted <b>disc</b> <b>spring.</b> To achieve the goal of this study, new calculations based on geometric and material properties inputs are developed for a bended slotted <b>disc</b> <b>spring.</b> A firm background study based on the theory of Almen is presented in developing new load–displacement calculations for a bended slotted <b>disc</b> <b>spring...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Minimally Invasive Manipulator (MIM) copies the {{movements}} of the hands of the surgeon to the tip of the instrument inside the operating area. The movement is mechanically copied using cables and pulleys. When the surgeon grasps and holds an object, the friction inside the MIM increases and distorts the force feedback in the remaining degrees of freedom. The increased friction {{is the result of the}} reaction forces on the cables and pulleys due to the required pinch force to hold the object. The goal of this report is to present two designs for a bi-stable compliant grasper. The grasper will have two stable positions: open and closed. In those positions there is no need for an actuation force from the surgeon. When the grasper is closed, it will produce enough pinch force to hold an object. The first design is a compliant grasper combined with bi-stable beam. Both the grasper and bi-stable element will be a planer design. A large scale prototype is presented and evaluated. The prototype showed bi-stable behavior over a range of 8 mm. Using finite element modeling, dimensions for a bi-stable beam suitable for the MIM are found. The second design uses a <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> as bi-stable element. This design is a 3 D design, and is on the scale of the MIM. An ANSYS model and a database were validated. Using the model and database <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> with suitable dimensions for the MIM scale was found. Two <b>disc</b> <b>springs</b> in parallel were needed to make a bi-stable compliant grasper. Both the bi-stable beam and the <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> can be used in the design for a bi-stable grasper. The bi-stable beam is more effectively creating negative stiffness inside a circular space. As a result, it should be able to produce more force and/or stroke in the same volume as a <b>disc</b> <b>spring.</b> This makes the bi-stable beam more suitable for use in a bi-stable grasper than a <b>disc</b> <b>spring.</b> BMDBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

The computation shows that the JET divertor unit can withstand up to five consecutive cycles, 10 s long, of an evenly distributed heat loading (averaged heat flux of similar to 6. 5 MW/m(2)) with half-an-hour intervals before the springs reach their uppermost temperature limit. However, if we take into account: (i) the real heat load distribution over the upper lamellae surface (shadowing effect), (ii) an initial temperature {{of the structure of}} 200 C, {{it may be that the}} temperature approaches 600 C after a single full-energy Pulse.

40|$|Pulley-based {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) with metal pushing V-belt (V-belt) offers tremendous potentials in the fuel economy of the car due to its wide and continuous ratio coverage. Nevertheless, the existing pulley-based CVTs in automotive markets use electro-hydro-mechanical (EHM) actuation system to vary its ratio and to provide sufficient clamping force on the V-belt. This, unfortunately, leads to a significant high power consumption from the engine of the car which eventually worsens the car’s fuel economy. To address this issue, researchers introduce electro-mechanical CVT (EM CVT) in which {{the application of the}} EHM actuation system is replaced by an electro-mechanical (EM) actuation system. This paper discusses the application of <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> in clamping force mechanism of EM CVT. The selected <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> is analyzed and evaluated to prove its workability for CVT’s application. The analysis results indicate that the application of <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> in clamping force mechanism of EM CVT is possible and it also offers some benefits particularly in term of its compact design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} an electro-mechanical dual acting pulley {{continuously variable}} transmission (EMDAP CVT) system and presents a method of measuring belt-pulley clamping force indirectly using a DC motor current sensor. The EMDAP CVT mainly consists of two movable primary (input) and secondary (output) pulley sheaves connected by metal pushing V-belt. Two DC motor’s actuation systems adjust the CVT ratio. Additionally, the secondary actuation system controls belt-pulley clamping force by adjusting the flatness of the <b>spring</b> <b>discs</b> placed {{at the back of}} each secondary pulley sheave to keep the belt tight and prevent belt slip. Ideally, a force sensor is used to measure the belt-pulley clamping force however the use of force sensor inside transmission gearbox is not feasible due to high temperature and oily environment. A viable solution for indirectly measuring the clamping force using current sensor for DC motor is proposed. Since the DC motor actuates the movable pulleys to clamp the belt, the relationship between the DC motor current and belt-pulley clamping force can then be investigated experimentally. The results will give positive impact on precisely controlling belt-pulley clamping force of EMDAP CVT using current sensor which is relatively simpler and less expensive than force sensor...|$|R
