60|$|Sally was silent. The {{significance}} {{of his words}} had not escaped her. She realized that his presence there was a challenge which she must answer. And yet it hardly stirred her. She had been fighting so long, and she felt utterly inert. She was like a swimmer who can battle no longer and prepares to yield to the numbness of exhaustion. The heat of the room pressed down on her like a <b>smothering</b> <b>blanket.</b> Her tired nerves cried out under the blare of music and the clatter of voices.|$|E
5000|$|Author Lisa Moore {{wrote of}} this work: [...] "Philippa Joness {{installation}} ... captures {{the isolation of}} living in a town on an island in the North Atlantic, especially under the <b>smothering,</b> claustrophobic <b>blanket</b> of winter, when air travel is often thwarted and even a trip to the bar becomes a mythic voyage".|$|R
60|$|I {{had great}} {{difficulty}} in keeping Mrs. Brown from <b>smothering</b> him in <b>blankets,</b> and ruining his digestion with the delicacies of her larder; but I at last got him completely {{rolled up in}} the corner of my room, and asleep. I lay awake some time later with plans for his future. I finally determined to take him to Oakland--where I had built a little cottage, and always spent my Sundays--the very next day. And {{in the midst of a}} rosy picture of domestic felicity, I fell asleep.|$|R
60|$|A settler, a {{fisherman}} named Matt Abrahamson, {{and his daughter}} Molly, found Tom. He was washed {{up on the beach}} among the wreckage, in a great wooden box which had been securely tied around with a rope and lashed between two spars--apparently for better protection in beating through the surf. Matt Abrahamson thought he had found something of more than usual value when he came upon this chest; but when he cut the cords and broke open the box with his broadax, he {{could not have been more}} astonished had he beheld a salamander instead of a baby of nine or ten months old lying half <b>smothered</b> in the <b>blankets</b> that covered the bottom of the chest.|$|R
40|$|Blanket bog – a term first coined in 1935 – {{refers to}} areas of regular {{precipitation}} and generally cool climates where blanket mire develops as a mantle of peat <b>smothering</b> entire landscapes, <b>blanket</b> bog referring specifically to {{those parts of}} this peat-draped landscape which are entirely rain-fed (ombrotrophic) bogs. The blanket bog components in such a landscape predominate but are linked by areas of minerotrophic fen or other types of wetland system. A number of differing approaches {{can be used to}} describe individual blanket bog units but perhaps the most universally applicable is their geographic position within the landscape. The global extent of blanket bog may be larger than originally thought because certain habitat formations normally thought of as other habitat types may be more appropriately classified as blanket bog...|$|R
60|$|Had I {{space and}} time to give a {{faithful}} account of this journey it would be chiefly a tribute to Xavier's skill, for they who have not put themselves {{at the mercy of}} the Mississippi in a small craft can have no idea of the dangers of such a voyage. Infinite experience, a keen eye, a steady hand, and a nerve of iron are required. Now, when the current swirled almost to a rapid, we grazed a rock by the width of a ripple; and again, despite the effort of Xavier and the crew, we would tear the limbs from a huge tree, which, had we hit it fair, would have ripped us from bow to stern. Once, indeed, we were fast on a sand-bar, whence (as Nick said) Xavier fairly cursed us off. We took care to moor at night, where we could be seen as little as possible from the river, and divided the watches lest we should be surprised by Indians. And, as we went southward, our hands and faces became blotched all over by the bites of mosquitoes and flies, and we <b>smothered</b> ourselves under <b>blankets</b> to get rid of them. At times we fished, and one evening, after we had passed the expanse of water at the mouth of the Ohio, Nick pulled a hideous thing from the inscrutable yellow depths,--a slimy, scaleless catfish. He came up like a log, and must have weighed seventy pounds. Xavier and his men and myself made two good meals of him, but Nick would not touch the meat.|$|R
