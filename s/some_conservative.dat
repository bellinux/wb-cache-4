5|$|Controversy {{erupted in}} June 1965 when Queen Elizabeth II {{appointed}} all four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) after Prime Minister Harold Wilson nominated {{them for the}} award. In protest – the honour {{was at that time}} primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders – <b>some</b> <b>conservative</b> MBE recipients returned their own insignia.|$|E
5|$|Yates did {{not rule}} the Smith Act unconstitutional or even {{overrule}} the Dennis decision, but Yates limited {{the application of the}} Act {{to such a degree that}} it became nearly unenforceable.Redish pp 103–105. The Yates decision outraged <b>some</b> <b>conservative</b> members of Congress, who introduced legislation to limit judicial review of certain sentences related to sedition and treason, which did not pass.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri opposed those {{elements}} of ACA over {{which they had}} discretion. For example, Missouri declined to expand Medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace engaging in active non-cooperation, enacting a statute forbidding any state or local official to render any aid not specifically required by federal law. Other Republican politicians discouraged efforts to advertise {{the benefits of the}} law. <b>Some</b> <b>conservative</b> political groups launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.|$|E

5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{retreated from}} Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, {{shocking}} <b>some</b> <b>conservative</b> readers {{who were not}} prepared to accept anything akin to deism. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author Mary Hays criticized the book's mawkishness. A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, The Wanderer in Norway (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature and emotion offered, however, Brown represented {{her work as a}} failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a cautionary tale, whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform. As Favret argues, almost all of the responses to Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark placed the narrator/Mary in the position of a sentimental heroine, while the text itself, with its fusion of sensibility and politics, actually does much to challenge that image.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{was elected}} bishop by the New Hampshire diocese on June 7, 2003, at St. Paul's Church in Concord. Thirty-nine clergy votes and 83 lay votes were the {{threshold}} necessary {{to elect a}} bishop in the Diocese of New Hampshire at that time. The clergy voted 58 votes for Robinson and the laity voted 96 for Robinson on the second ballot. The Episcopal Church requires in its Canon 16 that the election procedure and the candidate who is elected be subjected to review and must be consented to by the national church. No objections were raised to the procedure of the election. If diocesan election occurred within 120 days (3 months) of a General Convention, canon law requires consent by the House of Deputies and then the House of Bishops at the General Convention itself. Consent to the election of Robinson was given in August at the 2003 General Convention. The General Convention of 2003 became the center for debate over Robinson's election, as conservatives and liberals within the Church argued over whether Robinson {{should be allowed to}} become bishop. <b>Some</b> <b>conservative</b> factions threatened a schism within both the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion should Robinson be elected. Before the House of Deputies can vote on a resolution, a legislative committee must examine the piece of legislation first. The Committee on the Consecration of Bishops held a two-hour hearing on Robinson's election and supporters and opponents were allowed to speak. One of the speakers was Robinson's daughter, Ella, who read a letter from his ex-wife Boo in strong support of Robinson. The House of Deputies, which consists of laypersons and priests, voted in the affirmative: the laity voted 63 in favor, 32 opposed, and 13 divided; the clergy voted 65 in favor, 31 opposed, and 12 divided.|$|E

50|$|In most democracies, {{political}} conservatism {{seeks to}} uphold traditional family structures and social values. Religious conservatives typically oppose abortion, homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage.

2500|$|When the {{financial}} system verged on total collapse in 2008, Bush pushed through large scale rescue packages for banks and auto companies that even <b>some</b> <b>conservatives</b> in Congress did not support. <b>Some</b> noted <b>conservatives,</b> including Richard A.

25|$|Views on drug {{legality}} and policing {{vary greatly}} within the Conservative Party. <b>Some</b> <b>Conservative</b> politicians such as Alan Duncan take the libertarian approach that individual freedom and economic freedom {{of industry and}} trade should be respected. Other Conservative politicians, despite being economically liberal, are in favour of full prohibition of the ownership and trade of many drugs. Other Conservatives {{are in the middle}} ground, favouring stances such as looser regulation and decriminalisation of some drugs. Legalisation of cannabis for medical uses is favoured by <b>some</b> <b>Conservative</b> politicians, including Boris Johnson.|$|E

25|$|Head covering.
