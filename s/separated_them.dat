The people of Ocute explained that the great wilderness <b>separated</b> <b>them,</b> {{and that no one}} alive had ever crossed it due to the war, despite what De Soto's guide had claimed. Nevertheless, the army departed on April 13. A party from Ocute initially joined the Spanish to raid Cofitachequi, but De Soto sent them home upon realizing there was no easy way through the wilderness.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Congress {{appropriated}} $9.7 {{million for the}} property's further renovation and improvement. Federally appropriated funds were augmented with $5 million in private donations. The Jackson Place properties were internally combined into a single building and then merged with Blair–Lee House {{by way of a}} connecting structure occupying the alleyway that had <b>separated</b> <b>them.</b> The renovation and merger of the four properties resulted in their closure from 1982 through 1988.|$|E

Chase, controlling his columns by radio, suffered slight burns to his hands when a Japanese truck exploded. A squadron of the 8th Cavalry, guided by two Filipino guerrillas reached the sprawling campus of the University of Santo Tomas which {{had been turned into}} an internment camp, liberating some 3,700 internees.|$|E

5|$|In 1095, Byzantine emperor Alexius I {{appealed to}} Pope Urban II for help against renewed Muslim invasions in the Byzantine–Seljuk Wars, which caused Urban {{to launch the}} First Crusade aimed at aiding the Byzantine Empire and {{returning}} the Holy Land to Christian control. In the 11th century, strained relations between the primarily Greek church and the Latin Church <b>separated</b> <b>them</b> in the East–West Schism, partially due to conflicts over papal authority. The Fourth Crusade and the sacking of Constantinople by renegade crusaders proved the final breach. In this age great gothic cathedrals in France were an expression of popular pride in the Christian faith.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{continued}} {{to publish the}} poetic works of Aikin and Barbauld {{as well as those}} of George Dyer, Joseph Fawcett, James Hurdis, Joel Barlow, Ann Batten Cristall and Edward Williams. Most of the poets that Johnson promoted and published are not remembered today. However, in 1793, Johnson published William Wordsworth's An Evening Walk and Descriptive Sketches; he remained Wordsworth's publisher until a disagreement <b>separated</b> <b>them</b> in 1799. Johnson also put out Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Fears of Solitude (1798). They were apparently close enough friends for Coleridge to leave his books at Johnson's shop when he toured Europe.|$|E
5|$|Some mycologists {{classify}} C.violaceus as {{two distinct}} species—Cortinarius violaceus and Cortinarius hercynicus, with hercynicus {{relating to the}} Hercynian Forest region of southern Germany. These species are differentiated morphologically by the latter population's rounder spores. Persoon had described C.hercynicus as a separate species in 1794, though Fries regarded it as conspecific with C.violaceus. Moser <b>separated</b> <b>them</b> once again as species in 1967, and Norwegian biologist Tor Erik Brandrud classified C.hercynicus as a subspecies of C.violaceus in 1983. However, Harrower and colleagues, on limited molecular testing, found no genetic or ecological {{difference between the two}} taxa.|$|E

5|$|The CIA Damage Assessment Team (DAT) {{reviewed}} {{the credibility of}} all of the Agency's Soviet agents from the mid-1980s onward, then <b>separated</b> <b>them</b> into three groups: those who Ames admitted to betraying but continued providing intelligence; those whom Ames was suspected of betraying and those whom Ames' spying may have helped the Soviets identify; and the agents whom neither Ames nor Moscow uncovered. The DAT thus deemed intelligence supplied by the first group suspicious, although investigators acknowledged that it may have included genuine material as feed. The debate over the second group's bona fides proved especially contentious, while the information from the third group of agents was considered credible despite some concerns that even they may have been compromised.|$|E
5|$|The Four Quartets {{was first}} {{published}} as a series in New York in 1943 and London in 1944. The original title {{was supposed to be}} the Kensington Quartets after his time in Kensington. The poems were kept as a separate entity in the United States until they were collected in 1952 as Eliot's Complete Poems and Plays, and in the United Kingdom until 1963 as part of Eliot's Complete Poems 1909–62. The delay in collecting the Four Quartets with the rest of Eliot's poetry <b>separated</b> <b>them</b> from his other work, even though they were the result of a development from his earlier poems.|$|E
5|$|Gobioolithus {{eggs were}} {{probably}} laid in open nests {{on the banks}} of ephemeral rivers or lakes, which could frequently flood the nesting areas and bury the eggs. The distribution of the eggs suggests that they had a long-term colonial nesting site at the Khermeen Tsav locality in the Barun Goyot Formation. At the Bayn-Dzak locality, the eggs are typically arranged in clutches, whereas elsewhere they are scattered randomly, each oriented nearly vertically in the substrate. The solitary eggs may have been laid and buried individually, similar to the nesting habits of modern megapodes. It is also possible that they were originally laid in clutches, but flooding <b>separated</b> <b>them</b> and deposited them vertically as the water level dropped. Water damage would also explain why Gobioolithus shells are frequently heavily recrystallized.|$|E

5|$|Hunter's force {{advanced}} {{towards the}} town in a semi-circle formation, composed by the four battalions arranged {{from left to right}} in the following order: the 10th Sudanese, 9th Sudanese, the reduced 3rd Egyptian, and the 11th Sudanese. The artillery battery was with the 3rd Egyptian. The force reached the ridge of the plateau overlooking the town, about three hundred yards away, at a quarter past six. Major-General Hunter, finding the Mahdist garrison prepared for the assault and entrenched in their defenses, ordered the artillery to bombard their positions, which commenced at six-thirty. However, the artillery proved ineffective, as the guns were unable to strike within the narrow trenches or blast aside the cover behind which the Mahdist infantry waited. Hunter ceased the barrage, and ordered Lieutenant MacDonald to lead his brigade in a general advance. The command to fix bayonets was given, and the troops began an orderly advance across the three hundred yards that <b>separated</b> <b>them</b> from their objective. However, facing a line of Mahdist riflemen well-protected in their trenches, the soldiers of each advancing battalion were compelled to open fire without direct orders. The uncoordinated volleys of the advancing brigade were moderately effective against the Mahdist riflemen, who had not yet returned fire. When the battalions were about halfway across the three hundred yard stretch, their lines of fire began to converge due to their semi-circle formation, and the 10th Sudanese, on the left, was forced to halt to avoid coming under the fire of the rightmost 11th Sudanese.|$|E
5|$|Robson led Ipswich to {{two major}} trophies and several seasons in top flight European football. The {{successful}} period began in 1973 when the club won the Texaco Cup and finished {{fourth in the}} league, qualifying for the UEFA Cup for the first time. By the late 1970s, Robson had built a strong side with talent in every department, introducing the Dutch pair Arnold Mühren and Frans Thijssen to add flair to a team that featured British internationals including John Wark, Terry Butcher and Paul Mariner, although the Ipswich squad perhaps lacked the depth of established big clubs like Liverpool and Manchester United. Ipswich regularly featured {{in the top five}} of the league and in the UEFA Cup. At their peak in the 1979–80 season, they beat Manchester United 6–0 in a league game at Portman Road, a game where United goalkeeper Gary Bailey also saved three penalties. The defeat cost United two points – the margin which eventually <b>separated</b> <b>them</b> and champions Liverpool. Major success came in 1978 when Ipswich beat Arsenal at Wembley Stadium to win their only FA Cup trophy. The triumph was followed by a UEFA Cup victory in 1981. The club also finished as league runners-up in 1981 and 1982.|$|E

In most animals, embryos pass through a blastula stage, which is a characteristic exclusive to animals, and which allows for differentiation into specialized tissues and organs.|$|R
