40|$|This study {{proposes a}} quantum <b>secret</b> <b>authentication</b> <b>code</b> for {{protecting}} the integrity of secret quantum states. Since BB 84 [1] was first proposed, the eavesdropper detection strategy in almost all quantum cryptographic protocols {{is based on the}} random sample discussion, in which the probability of eavesdropper detection is depending on the number of check qubits eavesdropped by the eavesdropper. Hence, if the eavesdropper interferes only a few qubits of the transmitted quantum sequence, then the detection probability will be very low. This study attempts to propose a quantum <b>secret</b> <b>authentication</b> <b>code</b> to solve this problem. With the use of quantum <b>secret</b> <b>authentication</b> <b>code,</b> not only is the probability of eavesdropper detection guaranteed to be evenly distributed no matter how many qubits had been eavesdropped, but also can the quantum transmission efficiency be highly enhanced...|$|E

We develop a protocol for Secure Authentic Communication where we address authentication for the group communication scheme proposed by Blundo et al. which only provides confidentiality. Authentication scheme used is a multiparty authentication scheme which allows all the users in the system to send and receive messages simultaneously.

40|$|Linear codes {{with a few}} weights {{have been}} widely {{investigated}} in recent years. In this paper, we mainly use Gauss sums to represent the Hamming weights of a class of $q$-ary linear codes under some certain conditions, where $q$ is a power of a prime. The lower bound of its minimum Hamming distance is obtained. In some special cases, we evaluate the weight distributions of the linear codes by semi-primitive Gauss sums and obtain some one-weight, two-weight linear codes. It is quite interesting that we find new optimal codes achieving some bounds on linear codes. The linear codes in this paper {{can be used in}} <b>secret</b> sharing schemes, <b>authentication</b> <b>codes</b> and data storage systems...|$|R

In this paper, we construct several classes of binary linear codes from vectorial Boolean functions and determine their parameters, by further studying a generic construction developed by Ding et al. recently. First, by employing perfect nonlinear functions and almost bent functions, we obtain several classes of six-weight linear codes which contains the all-one codeword. Second, we investigate a subcode of any linear code mentioned above and consider its parameters. When the vectorial Boolean function {{is a perfect}} nonlinear function or a Gold function in odd dimension, we can completely determine the weight distribution of this subcode. Besides, our linear codes have larger dimensions than the ones by Ding et al. 's generic construction. Comment: 30 page...|$|R
40|$|Linear codes {{with few}} weights have many {{applications}} in <b>secret</b> sharing schemes, <b>authentication</b> <b>codes,</b> communication and strongly regular graphs. In this paper, we consider linear codes with three weights in arbitrary characteristic. To do this, we generalize the recent contribution of Mesnager given in [Cryptography and Communications 9 (1), 71 - 84, 2017]. We first present {{a new class}} of binary linear codes with three weights from plateaued Boolean functions and their weight distributions. We next introduce the notion of (weakly) regular plateaued functions in odd characteristic $p$ and give concrete examples of these functions. Moreover, we construct {{a new class of}} three-weight linear $p$-ary codes from weakly regular plateaued functions and determine their weight distributions. We finally analyse the constructed linear codes for secret sharing schemes.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of {{numerous}} multimedia applications and communications through Internet, secret image sharing has been becoming a key technology for digital images in secured storage and confidential transmission. However, the stego-images are obtained by directly replacing the least-significant-bit planes (LSB) of cover-images with <b>secret</b> data and <b>authentication</b> <b>code</b> in most schemes, which will result in the distortion of the stego-images. In this paper, we proposed a novel secret image sharing scheme by applying optimal pixel adjustment process to enhance the image quality under different payload capacity and various authentication bits conditions. The experimental results showed that the proposed scheme has improved the image quality of stego images by 4. 71 %, 9. 29 %, and 11. 10 %, as compared with the schemes recently proposed by Yang et al., Chang et al., and Lin and Tsai. We also provide several experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of authentication capability of the proposed scheme. In other words, our scheme maintains the secret image sharing and authentication ability while enhances the image quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{security}} of Message <b>Authentication</b> <b>Code</b> (MAC) schemes {{from the viewpoint of}} differential attack, and propose an attack that is effective against DES-MAC and FEAL-MAC. The attack derives the <b>secret</b> <b>authentication</b> key in the chosen plaintext scenario. For example, DES(8 -round) -MAC can be broken with 2 34 pairs of plain text, while FEAL 8 -MAC can be broken with 2 22 pairs. The proposed attack is applicable to any MAC scheme, even if the 32 -bits are randomly selected from among the 64 -bits of ciphertext generated by a cryptosystem vulnerable to differential attack in the chosen plaintext scenario...|$|R

40|$|A primary {{security}} {{challenge of}} the mobile agent paradigm is that of protecting the data carried by a mobile agent. With {{the growing popularity of}} e-commerce applications that use software agents, the protection of mobile agent data has become imperative. To that end, we evaluate the performance of four methods that protect the data integrity of mobile agents. While some techniques have been proposed in the literature, there has previously been no experimental study comparing the various alternatives. The set of integrity mechanisms that we investigate includes existing approaches known as the Partial Result <b>Authentication</b> <b>Codes</b> (PRACs), Hash Chaining, and Set <b>Authentication</b> <b>Code</b> methods, as well as a technique of our own design, which we refer to as the Modified Set <b>Authentication</b> <b>Code</b> method.

The experimental results showed that our Modified Set <b>Authentication</b> <b>Code</b> technique performed comparably to the Set <b>Authentication</b> <b>Code</b> method, showing some improvement in the key generation times and agent size.

40|$|AbstractInformation is {{typically}} transmitted in telecommunication systems {{in form of}} messages. Many applications nowadays demand protection of their content and/or authentication of the sender and recipient of the message. Message <b>Authentication</b> <b>Codes</b> are commonly used for the authentication purposes. They {{are very sensitive to}} any change of the message they are appended to. If one or more bits of the message change, Message <b>Authentication</b> <b>Codes</b> change about 50 % of their bits, making the message useless. A successful verification of Message <b>Authentication</b> <b>Codes</b> demands that all of bits of the received Message <b>Authentication</b> <b>Code</b> and of the bits of the recalculated Message <b>Authentication</b> <b>Code</b> from the received message are equal. Such a hard condition is not suitable for some applications. The introduction of a softer condition for the successful verification can improve the successful authentication of messages corrupted by transmission over a noisy channel. Algorithms are presented, which introduce robustness into the verification of messages protected by Message <b>Authentication</b> <b>Codes,</b> as well as an algorithm which not only verifies, but also corrects the messages corrupted due to the noisy channel...|$|R
