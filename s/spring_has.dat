5|$|This warbler {{gets its}} name from its simple {{distinctive}} song, a repetitive cheerful chiff-chaff. This song {{is one of the}} first avian signs that <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> returned. Its call is a hweet, less disyllabic than the hooeet of the willow warbler or hu-it of the western Bonelli's warbler.|$|E
5|$|In {{its native}} range, the {{sycamore}} {{is associated with}} a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree and produces a hard-wearing, creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and kitchen utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and honey is made by bees collecting the nectar.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins the}} day before an {{audience}} that Ai has obtained with Argaven Harge, the king of Karhide. Ai manages this through the help of Estraven, the prime minister, who seems to believe in Ai's mission, but {{the night before the}} audience, Estraven tells Ai that he can no longer support Ai's cause with the king. Ai begins to doubt Estraven's loyalty because of his strange mannerisms, which Ai finds effeminate and ambiguous. The behavior of people in Karhide is dictated by shifgrethor, an intricate set of unspoken social rules and formal courtesy. Ai does not understand this system, thus making it difficult for him to understand Estraven's motives, and contributing to his distrust of Estraven. The next day, as he prepares to meet the King, Ai learns that Estraven has been accused of treason, and exiled from the country. The pretext for Estraven's exile was his handling of a border dispute with the neighboring country of Orgoreyn, in which Estraven was seen as being too conciliatory. Ai meets with the king, who rejects his offer to join the Ekumen. Discouraged, Ai decides to travel through Karhide, as the <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> just begun, rendering the interior of the country accessible.|$|E
50|$|Although {{examples}} of <b>sprang</b> <b>have</b> been unearthed from {{as early as}} the bronze age, sprang was almost entirely undocumented in written records until the late nineteenth century when archaeological finds generated interest in Europe. Museum {{examples of}} <b>sprang</b> <b>had</b> been misidentified as knitting or lace until discoveries of ancient examples prompted reexamination of newer pieces. Subsequently, <b>sprang</b> <b>has</b> been identified in a variety of cultures and traditions across several continents. Its practice as a folk art waned during the twentieth century and <b>sprang</b> traditions <b>have</b> disappeared in most locales. Knitting <b>has</b> largely supplanted <b>sprang.</b>|$|R

25|$|Musetta {{suddenly}} appears; Mimì, {{who took}} {{up with a}} wealthy viscount after leaving Rodolfo in the <b>spring,</b> <b>has</b> left her patron. Musetta found her {{that day in the}} street, severely weakened by her illness, and Mimì begged Musetta to bring her to Rodolfo. Mimì, haggard and pale, is assisted onto a bed. Briefly, she feels as though she is recovering. Musetta and Marcello leave to sell Musetta's earrings in order to buy medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his overcoat (Vecchia zimarra—"Old coat"). Schaunard leaves with Colline to give Mimì and Rodolfo some time together. Mimì tells Rodolfo that her love for him is her whole life (aria/duet, Mimì and Rodolfo: Sono andati?—"Have they gone?").|$|E
25|$|The Wrythe {{lies between}} Carshalton village {{to the south}} and St Helier to the north-west. Its name is thought to derive from the rye that was once grown in this area, or from the Anglo-Saxon word rithe which means a small stream. During the time of the Roman {{occupation}} of the British Isles, a small spring was situated near the green, now adjacent to a BP garage. Roman activity in the area is confirmed by {{the fact that there was}} once a Roman Villa built in Beddington, just a couple of miles away, and a number of roads in the vicinity of Roman origin. The <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> since disappeared under ground and the culvert it feeds flows into the Wandle near Hackbridge.|$|E

25|$|Only one {{remake of}} Late <b>Spring</b> <b>has</b> {{so far been}} filmed: a {{television}} movie, produced to celebrate Ozu's centennial, entitled A Daughter's Marriage (Musume no kekkon), directed by the distinguished filmmaker Kon Ichikawa and produced by the Japanese pay television channel WOWOW. It was broadcast on December 14, 2003, {{two days after the}} 100th anniversary of Ozu's birth (and 40th anniversary of his death). Ichikawa, a younger contemporary of Ozu's, was 88 {{years old at the time}} of the broadcast. The film recreated various idiosyncrasies of the late director's style. For example, Ichikawa included many shots with vividly red objects, in imitation of Ozu's well-known fondness for red in his own color films (although Late Spring was not itself shot in color).|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, the Christian Evangelical {{religious}} movement, the Plymouth Brethren, {{was established in}} England. In 1865, {{a member of this}} movement, William Gibson Sloan, travelled to the Faroes from Shetland. At the turn of the 20th century, the Faroese Plymouth Brethren numbered thirty. Today, around 10% of the Faroese population are members of the Open Brethren community (Brøðrasamkoman). About 3% belong to the Charismatic Movement. There are several charismatic churches around the islands, the largest of which, called Keldan (The <b>Spring),</b> <b>has</b> about 200 to 300 members. About 2% belong to other Christian groups. The Adventists operate a private school in Tórshavn. Jehovah's Witnesses also have four congregations with a total of 121 members. The Roman Catholic congregation has about 170 members and falls under the jurisdiction of Denmark's Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen. The municipality of Tórshavn has an old Franciscan school.|$|E
25|$|The main {{sources of}} water supply for Damascus are the Fijeh and Barada springs. The Fijeh springs are {{a group of three}} large karstic springs - The Fijeh main spring, the Fijeh side spring and the Harouch spring - in the Barada gorge. The three springs used to {{contribute}} half the flow of the Barada River. The Barada spring is located North of the Fijeh springs close to the Lebanese border. The entire flow of all these springs is captured today, including through wells positioned around the springs. This is why it appears during the summer that the Barada <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> dried up, while its flow is actually being captured and transferred along the river to supply various towns in the Barada gorge as well as Damascus itself with drinking water. Water from the Barada and Fijeh springs is transferred to a mixing station near Dummar where it is being chlorinated and distributed to the city. The city’s water supply is complemented by well fields in the plains around the city. The flow of the springs is highly seasonal, lagging several months behind the precipitation because of snow melt and the karstic characteristics of the rocks from which they emerge. The flow of the Figeh springs is less than 4 m3/second during the low-flow period from July to December. However, it reaches a maximum of more than 12m3/second (average 1962-1991) in April.|$|E

Many of the series episodes deal with Spring's efforts to establish the Star Cops—he sets up a base of operations on the Moonbase, recruits new staff, roots out and dismisses corrupt officers and works to extend the Star Cops' reach first into the American space stations and then, {{at the end of the}} series, the far-flung reaches of the Mars colonies, all the while investigating whatever crimes occur along the way.|$|E
