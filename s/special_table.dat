6000|$|Vorticella {{being the}} wife of an {{important}} townsman had naturally the satisfaction of seeing 'The Channel Islands' reviewed by all the organs of Pumpiter opinion, and their articles or paragraphs held as naturally the opening pages in the elegantly bound album prepared by her for the reception of [...] "critical opinions." [...] This ornamental volume lay on a <b>special</b> <b>table</b> in her drawing-room close to the still more gorgeously bound work of which it was the significant effect, and every guest was allowed the privilege of reading what had been said of the authoress and her work in the 'Pumpiter Gazette and Literary Watchman,' the 'Pumpshire Post,' the 'Church Clock,' the 'Independent Monitor,' and the lively but judicious publication known as the 'Medley Pie;' to be followed up, if he chose, by the instructive perusal of the strikingly confirmatory judgments, sometimes concurrent in the very phrases, of journals from the most distant counties; as the 'Latchgate Argus,' the Penllwy Universe,' the 'Cockaleekie Advertiser,' the 'Goodwin Sands Opinion,' and the 'Land's End Times.' ...|$|E
60|$|The aged group, under care of sons or daughters, {{themselves}} {{worn and}} grey, passed on along the least-winding carriage-road towards the house, where a <b>special</b> <b>table</b> {{was prepared for}} them; while the Poyser party wisely struck across the grass {{under the shade of}} the great trees, but not out of view of the house-front, with its sloping lawn and flower-beds, or of the pretty striped marquee {{at the edge of the}} lawn, standing at right angles with two larger marquees on each side of the open green space where the games were to be played. The house would have been nothing but a plain square mansion of Queen Anne's time, but for the remnant of an old abbey to which it was united at one end, in much the same way as one may sometimes see a new farmhouse rising high and prim at the end of older and lower farm-offices. The fine old remnant stood a little backward and under the shadow of tall beeches, but the sun was now on the taller and more advanced front, the blinds were all down, and the house seemed asleep in the hot midday. It made Hetty quite sad to look at it: Arthur must be somewhere in the back rooms, with the grand company, where he could not possibly know that she was come, and she should not see him for a long, long while--not till after dinner, when they said he was to come up and make a speech.|$|E

30|$|The ‘studio match’ {{criteria}} {{uses the}} presence of tables designed to facilitate group work {{as a proxy for}} {{the presence of}} a studio classroom, a key feature of the SCALE-UP reform. Our survey asked respondents whether they had a specialized classroom for SCALE-UP and whether they had specific classroom features. We found that people's definitions of ‘specialized classroom’ vary and may include a renovated lab for some but not others. Furthermore, traditional classrooms can have classroom response systems, whiteboards on the wall, and/or projection capabilities. But the main purpose of the SCALE-UP room is to facilitate interaction. Of all the classroom features, round or <b>special</b> <b>tables</b> seemed to be a key to facilitating group work. We found that this captured 97 % of the people who claimed to have a specialized classroom so the table criterion appears to be a good proxy for the presence of an interactive classroom consistent with SCALE-UP. So, the studio match can take on binary values of 1 (<b>special</b> or round <b>tables</b> exist) or 0 (<b>special</b> or round <b>tables</b> do not exist).|$|R

If p→ 0 ^+, it gives as special case the log-Weibull (LW) distribution (White 1969; Lawless 2003). White (1969) obtained the means and variances of the order statistics of the LW distribution and listed these values in <b>special</b> <b>tables.</b> Examples of these tables to obtain weighted least squares estimates from censored samples from a Weibull distribution are also presented. The LW distribution is a very popular distribution for modeling lifetime data and phenomenon with monotone failure rates.|$|R
60|$|THE consulting-rooms of Dr Orion Hood, {{the eminent}} criminologist and {{specialist}} in certain moral disorders, lay along the sea-front at Scarborough, {{in a series}} of very large and well-lighted french windows, which showed the North Sea like one endless outer wall of blue-green marble. In such a place the sea had something of the monotony of a blue-green dado: for the chambers themselves were ruled throughout by a terrible tidiness not unlike the terrible tidiness of the sea. It must not be supposed that Dr Hood's apartments excluded luxury, or even poetry. These things were there, in their place; but one felt that they were never allowed out of their place. Luxury was there: there stood upon a <b>special</b> <b>table</b> eight or ten boxes of the best cigars; but they were built upon a plan so that the strongest were always nearest the wall and the mildest nearest the window. A tantalus containing three kinds of spirit, all of a liqueur excellence, stood always on this table of luxury; but the fanciful have asserted that the whisky, brandy, and rum seemed always to stand at the same level. Poetry was there: the left-hand corner of the room was lined with as complete a set of English classics as the right hand could show of English and foreign physiologists. But if one took a volume of Chaucer or Shelley from that rank, its absence irritated the mind like a gap in a man's front teeth. One could not say the books were never read; probably they were, but {{there was a sense of}} their being chained to their places, like the Bibles in the old churches. Dr Hood treated his private book-shelf as if it were a public library. And if this strict scientific intangibility steeped even the shelves laden with lyrics and ballads and the tables laden with drink and tobacco, it goes without saying that yet more of such heathen holiness protected the other shelves that held the specialist's library, and the other tables that sustained the frail and even fairylike instruments of chemistry or mechanics.|$|E

30|$|In the {{original}} SCALE-UP model, students sit in {{three groups of}} three at round tables, with computers or laptops provided for each individual, handheld whiteboards for each group, whiteboards on the walls as public thinking space, projection capabilities to share student work and a classroom polling system, like clickers (Beichner [2008]). Respondents were asked which specialized classroom equipment they had access to. Computers for each individual/group and <b>special</b> <b>tables</b> {{are the most popular}} classroom fixtures, found in approximately half of the surveyed departments. However, we felt that these features were not unique to SCALE-UP classrooms so we did not include them in our studio match index.|$|R
