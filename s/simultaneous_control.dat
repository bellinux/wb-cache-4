2500|$|Sonic Mania is a sprite-based side-scrolling {{platform}} game in {{the style}} of the early Sonic games released for the Sega Genesis. Players select one of three playable characters, each with their own unique abilities: Sonic can perform a [...] "drop dash" [...] which sends him rolling in a dash after a jump, Tails can fly and swim, and Knuckles can glide and climb walls. As with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992), players can either play as Sonic and Tails simultaneously, or allow Tails to be independently controlled by a second player. The game features unlockable gameplay modifiers, including the option to use Sonic's abilities from Sonic CD (1993) and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994) in place of the drop dash, and [...] "& Knuckles" [...] mode, which allows <b>simultaneous</b> <b>control</b> of any character and Knuckles.|$|E

In our Max/FTS-based experimental environment, a virtual object functions as input device for the editing of sound - the sound artist literally "sculpts" sounds by changing virtual object attributes (shape, position and orientation). We identified three sculpting methods and discuss one for use in physical and abstract mapping strategies. In pilot mapping experiments, the main problems we encountered were the search for interaction metaphors that can quickly be understood, incorporation of manipulation pragmatics in mappings, "touching" the virtual object and real-time computability. 1 Introduction We report in this paper on work in progress to develop gestural interfaces that allow for <b>simultaneous</b> multidimensional <b>control</b> [4].
