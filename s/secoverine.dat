40|$|The {{isolated}} perfused stomach of {{the mouse}} was used to study the effect of atropine and <b>secoverine</b> on bethanechol-induced gastric acid secretion and gastric motility. Both atropine and <b>secoverine</b> inhibited cholinergically induced gastric acid secretion and gastric motility. Inhibition of gastric acid secretion by atropine and <b>secoverine</b> occurred at a similar dose-range (10 (- 9) and 2 X 10 (- 9) M). <b>Secoverine</b> inhibited bethanechol-induced hypermotility at doses (10 (- 11) M and above) that were {{lower than those of}} atropine (2 X 10 (- 9) M and above) required to produce this effect. <b>Secoverine,</b> unlike atropine markedly inhibited gastric motility at lower doses than those which affected secretion...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} oral <b>secoverine</b> {{hydrochloride}} on neostigmine-stimulated sigmoid motility in 12 patients with {{irritable bowel syndrome}} was studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study. Both spontaneous and stimulated motor activity were significantly reduced by the compound in comparison with placebo. The most sensitive indices were the frequency of wave activity, maximum amplitude and motility index. Two patients reported mild dizziness after <b>secoverine...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} were done {{to investigate the}} presence and subtype of functionally presynaptic muscarinic receptors in cholinergic nerves of the guinea pig urinary bladder. Bladder strips were incubated with 3 H-choline and superfused with Tyrode’s solution containing eserine. Secreted 3 H-acetylcho-line was separated from 3 H-choline. The electrically evoked 3 H-acetylcholine secretion increased with the stimulation fre-quency. 3 H-Acetylcholine secretion was enhanced by musca-rinic antagonists, was depressed by carbachol and by alpha adrenoceptor agonists but was not influenced by drugs acting at beta adrenoceptors or purinoceptors. The rank order for the enhancing effect of muscarinic antagonist EC 50 values was propantheline < atropine < methylatropine < N-desethyloxy-butynin < UH-AH 37 < benzhexol < AQ-RA 741 < 4 -DAMP < procyclidine < emepronium < <b>secoverine</b> < oxybutynin <...|$|E
40|$|Tetrahydroaminoacndine (THA) and {{a variety}} of other nonclas-sical antagonists of {{muscarine}} receptors were studied for their ability to bind to primary and allostenc sites on muscarine recep-tors in rabbit hippocampal membranes. Competition curves be-tween 1 3 antagonists and 1 flM [3 H]pirenzepine (Kd = 3 nM) were simple mass action curves, but THA produced steeper curves, indicating positive cooperativity. Nonetheless, THA inhibited the binding of low concentrations of [3 H]pirenzepine, [3 H]N-methyls-copolamine, and [3 H]oxotremorine-M to Ml receptors with sim-ilar IC 50 values, indicating competition for primary sites. Antago-fists were also compared for their ability to bind to allosteric sites and to slow the dissociation of[3 H]pirenzepine from primary sites. THA was 6 - 8 -fold more potent than verapamil, d-tubocu-rare, quinidine, and <b>secoverine,</b> the next most effective allosteric agents, and THA was more effective. McN-A- 343, gallamine...|$|E
40|$|The {{action of}} 'selective' {{agonists}} and antagonists at muscarinic receptors mediating ileal contractions, {{and the rate}} and force of atrial contractions has been assessed. The effect of nicotinic receptor stimulation, catecholamine release and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) action on muscarinic activity has also been assessed. The nicotinic actions of carbachol did not affect its agonist potency nor the antagonist affinity data obtained when this agonist was used in atrial and ileal preparations. Antagonist data indicated that muscarinic receptors mediating the rate and force of atrial contractions did not differ. Differences in agonist potencies at these two muscarinic receptors were attributable to either differences in intrinsic efficacy or susceptibility to the action of acetylcholinesterase. The small differences in agonist potency observed between atrial and ileal muscarinic receptors were considered not sufficient to indicate receptor heterogeneity. The pirenzepine affinity data indicated that all three receptors are of the M 2 type. Affinity data using <b>secoverine</b> and 4 -diphenyl-acetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methiodide indicated that ileal and atrial muscarinic receptors differ. Data obtained using gallamine, pancuronium and stercuronium cannot be regarded as indicative of receptor affinity since the antagonism is not competitive; it did nonetheless corroborate the conclusion that ileal and atrial muscarinic receptors are different...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{profile of}} the muscarinic stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in rat olfactory bulb was investigated by using a number of antagonists with different selectivity for the muscarinic receptor subtypes. Schild analysis showed that this response was counteracted with the following rank order of potency: R(-) quinuclidinyl benzilate greater than atropine greater than RS(+/-) - 3 -quinuclidinyl xanthene- 9 -carboxylate hemioxalate greater than S(+) quinuclidinyl benzylate greater than 4 -diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methbromide greater than <b>secoverine</b> greater than methoctramine greater than dicyclomine greater than hexahydrosiladifenidol greater than p-fluorohexahydro-sila-difenidol greater than AF-DX 116 greater than pirenzepine. In the heart and corpus striatum, the antagonist rank orders of potency in counteracting the muscarinic inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity {{were consistent with the}} involvement of homogeneous populations of M 2 and M 3 receptors, respectively. Conversely, in the olfactory bulb, the pirenzepine inhibition curve of acetylcholine-stimulated enzyme activity was biphasic, with a major component of the response being inhibited with low affinity. These results indicate that more than one receptor subtype may participate in the stimulation of adenylate cyclase in rat olfactory bulb. The predominant receptor involved appears to be different from the M 1, M 2 and M 3 subtypes and pharmacologically equivalent to the m 4 gene product...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} effect of several muscarinic agonists on responses to sympathetic nerve {{stimulation of the}} isolated perfused ear artery of the rabbit was {{compared to that of}} acetylcholine in preparations pretreated with dyflos, cocaine and yohimbine. In general the potency of the agonists was similar to that observed at peripheral muscarinic sites except for arecaidine propargyl ester and 4 -(m-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxy) - 2 -butynyl trimethylammonium chloride (McN-A- 343). The {{inhibitory effect}} observed with N-benzyl- 3 -pyrrolidyl acetate methobromide (AHR- 602) was not exerted via muscarinic receptors. With carbachol (CCh) as an agonist, the antagonist 4 -diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4 -DAMP) was found to have a pKB value of 7. 74 and thus was 19 fold less active as an antagonist of responses to the agonist, than previously reported for guinea-pig ileum. When McN-A- 343 was used as the agonist, the slope of the Schild plot with the antagonist was significantly less than unity. It is suggested that an allosteric interaction of 4 -DAMP may be involved with this agonist. By use of an allosteric model, a pKB of 8. 56 for 4 -DAMP was obtained. <b>Secoverine</b> produced similar pKB values with either CCh (8. 19) or McN-A- 343 (8. 13) as the agonist...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{characteristics of}} muscarinic receptors in the rabbit iris sphincter muscle were studied and compared to M 3 receptors in rabbit urinary bladder smooth muscle. (+) -Cis-dioxolane induced concentration-dependent contractions of the iris sphincter muscle (pEC 50 = 6. 41 ± 0. 10, Emax= 181 ± 17 [*]mg, n= 38) and urinary bladder smooth muscle (pEC 50 = 6. 97 ± 0. 04, Emax= 4. 28 ± 0. 25 [*]g, n= 54). These contractions were competitively antagonized by {{a range of}} muscarinic receptor antagonists (pKB values are given for the iris sphincter muscle and the bladder smooth muscle, respectively) : atropine (9. 30 ± 0. 07 and 9. 40 ± 0. 04), AQ-RA 741 (6. 35 ± 0. 04 and 6. 88 ± 0. 03), darifenacin (9. 56 ± 0. 05 and 9. 12 ± 0. 05), methoctramine (5. 75 ± 0. 07 and 5. 81 + 0. 06), oxybutynin (8. 10 ± 0. 09 and 8. 59 ± 0. 06), pirenzepine (6. 79 ± 0. 05 and 6. 89 ± 0. 04), <b>secoverine</b> (7. 54 ± 0. 05 and 7. 66 ± 0. 05), p-F-HHSiD (7. 55 ± 0. 09 and 7. 50 ± 0. 05) and zamifenacin (8. 69 ± 0. 10 and 8. 36 ± 0. 06). A significant correlation between the pKB values in the bladder and the pKB values in the iris was obtained. In both tissues, the pKB values correlated most favorably with pKi values for these compounds at human recombinant muscarinic m 3 receptors. A reasonable correlation was also noted at human recombinant muscarinic m 5 receptors given the poor discriminative ability of ligands between m 3 and m 5 receptors. Overall, the data from {{this study suggest that}} the muscarinic receptors mediating contraction of the rabbit iris sphincter muscle and urinary bladder smooth muscle are similar and equate most closely with the pharmacologically-defined muscarinic M 3 receptor...|$|E
