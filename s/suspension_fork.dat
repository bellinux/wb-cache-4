50|$|<b>Suspension</b> <b>forks</b> {{have become}} {{increasingly}} sophisticated. The amount of travel available has typically increased. When <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> were introduced, 80-100 mm of travel was deemed sufficient for a downhill mountain bike. This amount of travel is now common for cross-country disciplines, whereas downhill forks typically offer 200 mm of travel for handling the most extreme terrain.|$|R

50|$|Many riders still {{prefer to}} ride a hardtail frame, and almost all {{mountain}} bicycle riders use a <b>suspension</b> <b>fork.</b> Notable <b>suspension</b> <b>fork</b> manufacturers include Marzocchi, Fox Racing Shox, RockShox, and (to a lesser extent) X-Fusion, RST, Suntour and Magura. Some bicycle manufacturers (notably Cannondale and Specialized) also make their own suspension systems to fully complement and integrate the bike set-up.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the past}} {{mountain}} bikes had a rigid frame and fork. In the early 1990s, the first mountain bikes with <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> were introduced. This made riding on rough terrain easier and less physically stressful. The first <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> had about 1½ to 2 inches (38 to 50 mm) of <b>suspension</b> travel. <b>Forks</b> {{are now available}} with 8 in of travel or more (see above under [...] "Design.") Bikes with front suspension and rigid, non-suspended rear wheels, or hardtails became popular nearly overnight. While the hardtail design has the benefits of lower cost, less maintenance, and better pedaling efficiency, it is slowly losing popularity due to improvements in full suspension designs.|$|R
50|$|Many newer {{mountain}} bikes {{have a full}} suspension design. In the past, {{mountain bikes}} had a rigid frame and a rigid fork. In the early 1990s, mountain bikes started to have front <b>suspension</b> <b>forks.</b> This made riding on rough terrain easier on a rider's arms. The first <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> had about 1½ to 2 inches (38 to 50 mm) of suspension travel. Soon after, some frame designers {{came out with a}} full suspension frame which gave riders a smoother ride throughout the ride.|$|R
50|$|Simons is {{a former}} motocross rider in his teens and early twenties and entrepreneur. He {{developed}} heat sinks for Koni shock absorbers to lower oil temperatures and then in 1974 he designed a shock absorber for the company that became Fox Shox. He then established his own company Dynamic Enterprises which became Simons Inc. developing pneumatic upgrade kits for <b>suspension</b> <b>forks.</b> This led to his own fork design and manufacture. He had two patents on <b>suspension</b> <b>forks,</b> one which, for upside down forks, he licensed to motorcycle and suspension manufacturers.|$|R

50|$|<b>Suspension</b> <b>fork</b> {{design has}} {{advanced}} {{in recent years}} with suspension forks becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse in design. The amount of suspension travel available has increased over time. When suspension forks were introduced, 80-100 mm of travel was deemed sufficient for a downhill mountain bike. Typically this amount of travel is now used in XC disciplines, with downhill forks now offering 150 to 200 mm of travel for handling extreme terrain. This is not the limit of <b>suspension</b> <b>fork</b> travel; for example, the Marzocchi Super Monster T offers 300 mm (12 inches) of travel.|$|E
50|$|Some manufacturers, such as Cannondale and Strida, offer a fork with {{a single}} leg. Many of Cannondale's single bladed forks, called Lefty, are <b>suspension</b> <b>forks,</b> in either {{conventional}} or inverted configurations. These forks use linear needle roller bearings on octagonal races to transmit the steering torque to the wheel, while conventional two bladed <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> use tubular linear plain bearings. Use of a Lefty fork requires a special Lefty hub, which attaches to the fork end {{by means of a}} screw that presses the hub onto the axle that is fixed to the fork.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002 132,000 Next Ultra Shock {{mountain}} bicycles with [...] "Ballistic 105" [...] front <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> were {{recalled in}} cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). There were 20 reports of the <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> breaking on the Next Ultra Shock bicycles, resulting in 19 riders suffering injuries that include abrasions, concussions and chipped teeth. By Us International Co. Ltd. manufactured the forks on these bicycles. These forks can break apart, causing riders to lose control, fall and suffer serious injury. The recall is being conducted {{in cooperation with}} the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) which previously announced the recall of about 103,000 of these forks sold on bicycles manufactured by Brunswick Corp. There have been 20 reports of the <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> breaking on the Next Ultra Shock bicycles, resulting in 19 riders suffering injuries that include abrasions, concussions and chipped teeth. The recall includes only on blue Next Ultra Shock bicycles, with model numbers 8524-14 and 8526-20 manufactured between April 1999 and November 9, 1999. Wal-Mart stores nationwide sold these mountain bikes from May 1999 through December 2000.|$|R
50|$|The Dirt Cross {{was very}} unusual design and is best {{described}} as a hybrid of a BMX and a mountain bike. It was fitted with 20 inch wheels, and the styling of the handlebars and frame {{were similar to those}} of a BMX, with dimensions designed to accommodate 6 to 10 year olds. Every Dirt Cross was fitted with 5 speed Shimano gears and a twist-grip gear controller as standard. It is possible that the design was influenced by the Strika as both bikes were fitted with imitation front <b>suspension</b> <b>forks.</b> Although children's bikes with functional <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> were available from Raleigh during the late 1990s, those fitted to Dirt Cross were purely cosmetic.|$|R
50|$|This {{new version}} has {{undergone}} changes {{as compared to}} the previous version in the cases of the updated bodywork and engine, now features VVA technology, assist and slipper clutch, hazard lamp, inverted front <b>suspension</b> <b>fork,</b> all-LED lighting system, full LCD panelmeter with shift indicator, and wider tyres.|$|E
5000|$|Will {{typically}} have 7 - 10 in of rear suspension travel, and be designed around a 7 - 8 in <b>suspension</b> <b>fork.</b> [...] The suspension sag is also {{much higher than}} cross-country bikes (25%-50% of total travel vs. 10%-20%) for a more supple ride at higher speeds.|$|E
50|$|The damper usually forces oil to {{pass through}} one or more small {{openings}} or shim stacks in the <b>suspension</b> <b>fork.</b> On some models, the spring, the damper, or both may be adjusted for rider weight, riding style, terrain, or any combination of these or other factors. The two components may be separated with the spring mechanism in one blade and the damper in the other.|$|E
5000|$|Turner {{brought in}} Greg Herbold {{as a test}} rider and company spokesman. In 1990 Herbold became the first world {{champion}} in downhill mountain biking riding {{one of the first}} <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> for mountain bikes made. In August that year the company manufactured its first 100 <b>suspension</b> <b>forks,</b> the RS-1. The start-up was financed by the East Asian bike component manufacturer Dia-Compe, the founders, and other investors. Dia Compe manufactured the next series of forks in addition to the original Aheadset, which the RS-1 utilised [...] Later Dia-Compe USA was bought out by Simons & Turner who disposed of its shares. From then the forks were primarily manufactured at RockShox in Mt.View, Ca.|$|R

5000|$|The frame styling of the Strika {{visually}} {{resembles a}} BMX {{although it was}} probably intended to resemble a motorbike. The most notable features are the imitation front <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> and the chunky padded saddle. The Strika was heavy compared to a similar size BMX and reputed to have ungainly handling qualities for stunt riding.|$|R
5000|$|Cannondale {{has also}} {{developed}} a <b>suspension</b> <b>fork</b> called the Lefty. It started with the [...] "Headshok" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "Fatty") forks. It uses 88 needle bearings to reduce friction for smooth travel with the bearings telescoping inside the steerer tube of the fork. This minimizes flexing of the fork legs and also reduces static friction, which must be overcome before the fork begins to travel.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990 John Rader, the {{designer}} of the Aheadset system (US Patent 5095770 A [...] ), gave exclusive licensing to Dia-Compe for the product. [...] Dia-Compe USA financed fledgling company RockShox {{in the development of}} the RS-1 <b>suspension</b> <b>fork.</b> The USA subsiduary of Dia-Compe was eventually purchased by RockShox in the 1990s. In 1992 Dia-Compe USA became Cane Creek Cycling Components and introduced the threadless headset (AheadSet®).|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Paul began riding {{mountain}} bikes {{and with his}} motorcycle experience longed for suspension. Paul began developing the first bicycle <b>suspension</b> <b>fork.</b> In 1989 or 1990, Turner approached Simons for help designing a <b>suspension</b> <b>fork</b> for mountain bikes. Turner had in 1987, {{with the help of}} Keith Bontrager, presented a full bike with front and rear suspension at the bicycle industry trade show in Long Beach. The industry was not impressed. Two years later Turner and his wife Christi were manufacturing suspension forks in their garage with parts bought from Simons Inc, who later partnered Turner when Steve and his wife, Deborah, mortgaged their home to buy out Dia Compe and move manufacturing to Mt. View, California in 1993. The R&D and Marketing groups remained in Boulder, Co. until moving to Mt. View, Ca in 1994 and then Santa Cruz in 1995. Manufacturing and Engineering move to San Jose, Ca in 1995. They worked with Thomas Dooley at TDA in Boulder, CO who created the current RockShox logo, and was the creative director for all marketing and advertising.|$|E
50|$|Rock Shox {{was one of}} many brands that marketed <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> for bicycles, {{others were}} Answer Manitou, Marzocchi and RST. During this time Fox Racing Shox also entered the bicycle industry. As the number of direct {{substitutes}} to Rock Shox' products increased, the company experienced difficulties in protecting its position as the leading manufacturer in the business.|$|R
5000|$|... “When {{we built}} the C40 {{we were the}} only ones to build carbon frames and all the {{mechanics}} and competitor technicians were saying that they would be too dangerous to use on cobbled roads, especially with the straight carbon forks. There was a company that wanted to fit <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> on the bicycle, but I wasn’t going to have <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> on the C40. The night before Paris- Roubaix I had Mr. Squinzi, the Mapei boss, on the phone to me raising his concerns about using such a delicate-looking thing. I told him that we’d done all of the tests that we could on the frame and the fork and we were certain there would be no problem. I had to take personal responsibility for {{what was going to happen}} and I spent all night worrying about it, barely able to sleep. But when I heard that there were 4 Mapei riders in the break, I knew I could relax.” ...|$|R

50|$|During {{this period}} (1994-1995) Tracy also dabbled as a {{professional}} downhill mountain bike racer. He raced for Yeti Bicycles and made appearances in the pro class at famous bike races such as the legendary Kamikaze at Mammouth mountain. During this time Penske developed a special upside down <b>suspension</b> <b>fork</b> for Yeti Cycles and Tracy. Kaiser Aerospace in partnership with Yeti Cycles built {{one of the first}} thermoplastic carbon fiber bicycles for Tracy at a cost of $US 500,000 to produce.|$|E
50|$|Contemporary city {{bikes are}} {{increasingly}} {{found in many}} European cities, including Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Dutch and Danish-made city bikes often include such features as a clear skirt guard, colors other than black, aluminum alloy or chromoly steel frame, front <b>suspension</b> <b>fork,</b> suspension seatpost, Hub dynamo, dynamo lighting with motion-and-darkness detection, magnetic lights, a 7- or 8-speed hub, adjustable kickstand, child seats, and a headlight integrated into the front fork. Newer German models, on the other hand, tend to incorporate a less is more philosophy.|$|E
50|$|SRAM {{purchased}} RockShox on February 19, 2002. They {{were one}} of the first companies to introduce a bicycle <b>suspension</b> <b>fork</b> for consumer use. Marketing and sales departments were relocated to Chicago, while product development remained in Colorado Springs. A SRAM factory in Taichung, Taiwan was converted to RockShox production after the acquisition. RockShox is responsible for producing bicycle suspension products including front suspension forks for both mountain biking (MTB) and pavement usage, rear suspension, suspension lockout remotes, maintenance products and a height adjustable seatpost called the Reverb.|$|E
5000|$|A key product release, {{the first}} true 29" [...] tire, was {{produced}} by an early supporter of the 29" [...] movement Wilderness Trail Bikes. The company introduced the first true 29" [...] tire, the Nanoraptor, in 1999. At about the same time, White Brothers produced the first commercially available 29" [...] <b>suspension</b> <b>forks.</b> Before then <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> used were forks designed for trekking bikes or hybrids. For many years, 29" [...] frames and bikes were usually only available from small little-known manufactures like Niner Bikes. Surly Bikes introduced their 29" [...] frameset, the Karate Monkey, in 2002. Gary Fisher Bicycles, a division of Trek Bicycles, became {{the first of the}} major manufactures to offer a line of 29" [...] bikes. Their lines never sold well until the introduction of single-speed 29" [...] bike the Rig, in 2004. Today, most bicycle manufacturers in the US market offer at least one 29" [...] bicycle or frame. Even companies that openly dismissed 29" [...] as a bad idea or passing trend, Specialized and Turner, are bringing 29" [...] wheels to market.|$|R
50|$|SunTour® (Maeda) was {{the most}} {{important}} Japanese manufacturer of bicycle components based in Osaka until 1988, when Sakae Ringyo Company (abbreviated S.R.), a major Japanese maker of aluminum parts, particularly cranks and seat posts, bought {{what was left of the}} bankrupt SunTour, and the combined companies are now known as SR-SunTour. SunTour reached a zenith of sales and commercial success from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. Its products range from <b>suspension</b> <b>forks</b> to derailleurs.|$|R
50|$|Newer <b>suspension</b> {{frame and}} <b>fork</b> designs have reduced weight, {{increased}} amount of suspension travel, and improved feel. Many lock out the rear suspension while the rider is pedaling hard or climbing, {{in order to}} improve pedaling efficiency. Most <b>suspension</b> frames and <b>forks</b> have about 4-6 inches (100-150 mm) of suspension travel. More aggressive <b>suspension</b> frames and <b>forks</b> made for downhill racing and freeriding have as much as 8 or 9 inches (200 or 230 mm) of suspension travel.|$|R
