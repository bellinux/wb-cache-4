While making the leap, the body's back should move rearwards until it {{is parallel to the}} ground. As the body reaches peak height, the kicking leg should snap toward the ball as the non-kicking leg is simultaneously brought down to increase the kick's power. Vision should <b>stay</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the ball until the foot strikes it. The arms should be used for balance and to diminish the impact from the fall.|$|E

[...] In comparison, the next, Bush presidency was criticized for many impulsive decisions that harmed the international standing of the U.S. in the world.

[...] " [...] Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from [...] "fucking around" [...] in the studio; [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while [...] "Criminal" [...] was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. [...] "Kill You" [...] was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song.
