40|$|AbstractThe {{existing}} {{models of}} switch-toughening seldom consider {{the effect of}} non-uniform ferro-elastic domain switching {{in the vicinity of}} a crack. To explore this issue, an evolution law for the volume fraction of the switched portion under applied electromechanical loading is established from the minimum energy principle. Based on this law, a switching model capable of dealing with the non-uniform distribution of switching strain is developed. The domain <b>switching</b> <b>zone</b> is divided into a saturated inner core and an active surrounding annulus. Mono-domain solution of ferro-elastic toughening is obtained under the model of small scale domain switching. Toughening for ferroelectrics with different poling states is estimated via Reuss type approximation. Two sets of solutions are obtained according to spherical and cylindrical inclusions. The interval of toughening defined by these two models covers the range of experimental data. The same conclusion is reached for the size of the <b>switching</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, the {{fracture}} toughening behavior of ferroelectric materials under different electromechanical loading conditions is predicted and compared to available experimental observations. A multi-axial, electromechanically coupled, incremental phenomenological constitutive model for ferroelectric ceramics is developed first. The constitutive model is then implemented within the {{finite element method}} to {{study the effects of}} electric field on the Mode I steady crack growth under plane stress and plane strain conditions. Toughening behaviors of electrically permeable cracks are simulated on both initially unpoled and poled materials with electric field applied in-plane or parallel to the crack front. The finite element results give detailed electromechanical fields, remanent strain and remanent polarization distributions, domain <b>switching</b> <b>zone</b> shapes and sizes, and the crack tip energy release rate. It is shown that the toughening is related {{to the size of the}} concentrated <b>switching</b> <b>zone</b> that is confined to a small region around the crack tip. The model predicts a range of phenomena that indicate that the toughening is dependent on both the level of electric filed applied and on the polarization state. In addition to the effects of electric field, the effects of the plane-stress constraint and transverse stress are also established in the out-of-plane poled cases. In a similar manner to the electrically permeable cracks, the crack growth simulations for electrically conducting crack face boundary conditions are also performed. The results predict the toughening variations under combined electromechanical loadings for poled or unpoled materials. The electromechanical fields from the finite element results are used to determine the stress and electric field intensity factors around the crack tip. The favorable comparison of the present model to the experimental observations suggest that ferroelectric switching behavior is more accurately modeled with an incremental plasticity formulation, rather than as an unstable phase transformation. The nonlinear studies of this dissertation not only explain most available experimental phenomena but also enhance the understanding of the nature of fracture in ferroelectric ceramics...|$|E

In particular, the effect of cyclic frequency and amplitude were assessed to develop a correlation between macrostructural changes and fatigue behaviour, both in the bulk and in crack-tip process zones. A variety of experimental methods were used. Raman scattering enabled the poling state of the ceramics can be determined. However, it could not distinguish between the different preferred orientations of in-plane c-domains. Conversely, neutron and X-ray diffraction technique can detect domain orientation distribution and the preferred direction of c-domains. In this study, neutron diffraction was used to probe domain switching behaviour in bulk samples while high spatial resolution X-rays were employed to analyse a <b>switching</b> <b>zone</b> near a crack tip. Under cyclic mechanical loading, domain switching and the accumulation of ferroelastic strain becomes saturated with increasing number of cycles. Moreover, time-dependent deformation was investigated. The results show that a domain forward-switching process occurs during creep deformation while a domain backward-switching process takes place during recovery. In addition, {{it was found that}} the frequency of applied stress affects the saturation of the ferroelastic strain while its magnitude has an influence on the level of strain accumulated.

Under cyclic electrical loading, the results present a strong link between the frequency of the applied field, remnant polarisation, domain switching and the resultant crack growth. The results show that polarisation fatigue, the size of the <b>switching</b> <b>zone,</b> and the crack growth rate is greater at lower loading frequency. The quantitative analysis of the time dependent mechanism as well as the effect of loading frequency and amplitude on domain switching was achieved by applying viscoelastic models.

40|$|A model {{based on}} domain {{switching}} around a crack tip was suggested to explain fracture and fatigue behavior of PZT- 4 piezoceramics. A domain switching criterion was proposed, and its validity {{was confirmed by}} the existing test data. It was found that stress and electric fields might promote or impede domain switching depending on their applied directions. ^ An FE algorithm {{in conjunction with the}} proposed domain switching criterion was developed to analyze the stress and electric fields for CT specimens. The domain switching zones and switching induced stress intensity changes were determined, and the intrinsic toughnesses in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the poling direction were thus obtained for PZT- 4. It was found that the electric field altered the switching types and <b>switching</b> <b>zone</b> size depending on its applied direction and magnitude. The variation of apparent toughness from the CT specimen under the electric fields resulted from the domain switching induced stress. Meanwhile, 2 -D near tip solutions were employed to evaluate the switching induced stress intensity factor in the framework of small scale switching. The results from near tip solutions are similar to those from FE solutions. ^ Poled and depoled compact tension specimens were performed. It was observed that the depoled material has isotropic toughness while the apparent toughness for poled materials was anisotropic in the different directions. Finite element analysis was performed for the poled CT specimen to extract intrinsic toughnesses. It was found that the intrinsic toughness is slightly anisotropic in the two directions. Domain switching was attributed to the anisotropy of apparent toughness. ^ Compact tension tests of PZT- 4 under cyclic electric and mechanical loads were conducted to successfully establish a Paris law type of fatigue crack growth model in terms of mechanical strain energy release rate. The different effects caused by the positive and negative electric fields on the fatigue crack growth were explained in terms of domain switching at the crack tip. ...|$|E
40|$|Ferroelectric {{materials}} have become preferred materials {{in a wide}} variety of electronic and mechatronic devices due to their pronounced dielectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric properties. The material macroscopic properties are related to the microscopic domain structure of the materials. To understand and predict the relation between the macroscopic properties and the domain structure, a continuum phase field model incorporating with the long-range elastic and electrostatic interactions is employed to simulate the ferroelectric/paraelectric phase transition, polarization switching under external loading, influence of applied strains on ferroelectric and dielectric properties, size effect of ferroelectric epitaxial islands and thin films, effect of long-range elastic interactions on toroidal moment in ferroelectric nanoparticles, and fracture toughness variation induced by domain switching near an electrically permeable crack tip in ferroelectrics. Phase field simulations were conducted to understand polarization switching under external electric or/and mechanical loading. The temporal evolution of the polarization switching shows that the switching is a process of nucleation, if needed, and growth of energy-favorite domains. The simulation results successfully reveal the hysteresis loop of macroscopic polarization versus the applied electric field, the butterfly curve of macroscopic strain versus the applied electric field, and the macroscopically nonlinear strain response to applied compressive stresses. The simulation results show that the paraelectric/ferroelectric phase transition temperature linearly increases with the applied mechanical strain under mechanical clamping conditions. Analogous to the classical Ehrenfest equation, a thermodynamics equation was derived to describe the relationship between the transition temperature and the applied strain. The change in the domain structure with temperature under applied inequiaxial strains is different from that under applied equiaxial strains. The simulations also illustrate the changes in the coercive field, the remanent polarization and the nonlinear dielectric constant with the applied strain. Phase field simulations were also conducted in real space by using different numerical methods, such as finite element analysis and finite difference method to study size effects of epitaxial ferroelectric islands, thin films, and free-standing ferroelectric nanoparticle. The simulations exhibit spatial polarization distributions with different types of domain walls in the epitaxial ferroelectric islands and find two critical thicknesses, at which the simulated material changes from a multi-domain state to a single-domain state and from ferroelectric phase to paraelectric phase, respectively. The two critical thicknesses and the domain wall types vary with the length-to-thickness ratio. The remanent polarization and the coercive field of the simulated ferroelectric films both decrease with decreasing film thickness. The phase field simulations on free-standing ferroelectric nanoparticles exhibit vortex patterns with purely toroidal moments of polarization and negligible macroscopic polarization when the spontaneous strains are low and the simulated ferroelectric size is small. However, a monodomain structure with a zero toroidal moment of polarization is formed when the spontaneous strains are high in small simulated ferroelectrics, indicating that, because of the long-range elastic interactions, high values of spontaneous strains hinder the formation of polarization vortices in ferroelectric particles. Phase field simulations were conducted to understand domain-switching-induced shielding or anti-shielding of an electrically permeable crack in a mono-domain ferroelectric material. Phase field simulations give not only the <b>switching</b> <b>zone</b> but also the explicit polarization distribution without any prior assumed switching criterion. The simulation results show that the switching- induced internal stresses shield the crack tip from the applied mechanical loads, resulting in switching-toughening. Although a mechanical load plays a predominant role in the domain switching near the electrically permeable crack, an applied electric field plays also an important role there. When the electric field is parallel to the original polarization direction, it reduces the shielding, whereas an anti-parallel electric field enhances the shielding. The simulated phenomenon is consistent with other theoretical predictions and some experimental observations. Moreover, the phase field simulations exhibit new switching features, such as head-to-tail arrangements of polarizations and appearance of domain walls...|$|E

On 30 October 2013, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff enacted Law 12876, establishing that the time <b>zone</b> <b>switch</b> would occur on Sunday, 10 November 2013. Since then, the state of Acre and 13 municipalities in the southwestern part of the state of Amazonas are again 5 hours behind UTC.|$|R
40|$|Strong inputs to neurons trigger complex {{biochemical}} {{events leading}} to synaptic plasticity. These biochemical events occur at many spatial scales, ranging from submicron dendritic spines to signals that propagate hundreds of microns from dendrites to the nucleus. ERKII {{is an important}} signaling molecule that is involved in many aspects of plasticity, including local excitability, communication with the nucleus, and control of local protein synthesis. We observed that ERKII activation spreads long distances in apical dendrites of stimulated hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal neurons. We combined experiments and models to show that this > 100 Î¼m spread was too large to be explained by biochemical reaction-diffusion effects. We show that two modes of calcium entry along the dendrite contribute to the extensive activation of ERKII. We predict the occurrence of feedback between biophysical events resulting in calcium entry, and biochemical events resulting in ERKII activation. This feedback causes a switch-like propagation of ERKII activation, coupled with enhanced electrical excitability, along the apical dendrite. We propose that this propagating <b>switch</b> forms <b>zones</b> on dendrites in which plasticity is facilitated...|$|R
