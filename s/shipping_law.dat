2500|$|Several {{countries}} use {{red flags}} with, in most cases, either the respective national flag or the Union Flag in the canton, patterned after the Red Ensign. British overseas territories fly the plain Red Ensign or a Red Ensign with the respective colonial {{arms in the}} fly. Saudi Arabia puts its national flag in the canton of an otherwise-green flag (the Saudi Arabian flag is hoisted with the flagpole to its right so the canton is in the upper {{right corner of the}} flag). Ghana stopped using its Red Ensign in 2003 with the adoption of a new merchant shipping act, which made the Ghanaian flag the proper national colors for Ghanaian ships. Similarly, Sri Lanka stopped using its Red Ensign in 1969 and uses the Sri Lankan flag as the civil ensign. Under the relevant <b>shipping</b> <b>law</b> for the Solomon Islands, the Shipping Act 1998, (No. 5 of 1998), the national flag of the Solomon Islands and not a Red Ensign is the appropriate flag: [...] "The National Flag of Solomon Islands shall be the national colours for a vessel registered under this Act." ...|$|E

Nonetheless, despite the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (now the European Community (the [...] "EC")) having been signed on 25 March 1957, {{it was not until}} the 1970s, that there was any serious attempt to develop European laws relating to shipping. During the 1970s, a number of attempts were made to develop laws in particular areas such as liner conferences, the environment and pilotage. It was not however until the 1980s, particularly 1986, that a serious body of EC <b>shipping</b> <b>law</b> evolved. On 22 December 1986, the Council of Ministers adopted four Regulations which lay the foundations for most of EC <b>shipping</b> <b>law.</b> In the 1990s and 2000s so far, the law has developed in various areas including competition and anti-trust law but also in the areas as safety, the environment, ports and employment.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of <b>ship</b> arrest <b>law</b> in the West and the East, namely the US and the People’s Republic of China (PRC), {{understanding}} the different approaches adopted in these countries’ maritime courts would be a topic of interest to both comparative lawyers and international traders. The tremendous volume of shipping activities {{taking place in the}} US and China makes the two countries popular forums for ship arrest proceedings. In the US, maritime imports accounted for 42 percent of all imports in 2004. In China, the container volume exported is expected to reach 100 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) by 2010. This article argues that a through comparative longitudinal study of these countries’ court practices concerning ship arrest, {{it may be possible to}} uncover any consistent approaches taken by the maritime courts. The aim of this article is twofold: (I) to provide an overview of the developments in <b>ship</b> arrest <b>law</b> in today’s US and China, and (ii) to contribute to the comparative study of the different approaches adopted in Chinese and US <b>ship</b> arrest <b>laws</b> by filling a gap in the existing literature in this area. The last section of the article is devoted to a review of the 2003 New Practice Direction, issued by the Supreme People’s Court, on Chinese maritime procedural law. As there are ten maritime courts in China, different interpretations of the ambiguous maritime statutes are inevitable. The discussion will focus on those approaches to <b>ship</b> arrest <b>laws</b> that were reviewed in the 2003 New Practice Direction. This article is designed to provide helpful information to European legal professionals who are new to <b>ship</b> arrest <b>law</b> practices in the Chinese maritime courts as well as to more experienced practitioners who may need to enforce a ship arrest order in the PRC’s jurisdiction.
