This same thin and snugness may allow the wearer's fingerprints {{to pass through}} the material. When discovered by authorities, latent fingerprints may also be recovered from the inside of these gloves.|$|R
50|$|A wetsuit {{must have}} a <b>snug</b> <b>fit</b> to work {{efficiently}} when immersed; too loose a fit, particularly at the openings (wrists, ankles, neck and overlaps) will allow cold water from the outside to enter continuously. Flexible seals at the suit cuffs aid in preventing heat loss in this fashion.|$|R

50|$|Beginning in the 1930s, jigsaw puzzles {{were cut}} using large {{hydraulic}} presses which now cost {{in the hundreds}} of thousands of dollars. The cuts gave a very <b>snug</b> <b>fit,</b> but the cost limited jigsaw puzzle manufacture only to large corporations. Recent roller press design achieve the same effect, at a lower cost. By the early 1960s, Tower Press was the world's largest maker of jigsaw puzzles, acquired by Waddingtons in 1969.|$|R

They are intended mainly for fecal incontinence, however {{they can also be}} useful for temporary urine containment, to maintain dignity while transferring from change room to pool. Manufacturers such as Discovery Trekking, Splash About and Theraquatics commonly utilize a stretch fabric to allow increased adjustability for a <b>snug</b> <b>fit.</b> They are washable and reusable. There are no disposable adult swim diapers.|$|R
2500|$|Fashion in fourteenth-century Europe {{was marked}} by the {{beginning}} of a period of experimentation with different forms of clothing. [...] Costume historian James Laver suggests that the mid-14th century marks the emergence of recognizable [...] "fashion" [...] in clothing, in which Fernand Braudel concurs. The draped garments and straight seams of previous centuries were replaced by curved seams and the beginnings of tailoring, which allowed clothing to more closely fit the human form. Also, the use of lacing and buttons allowed a more <b>snug</b> <b>fit</b> to clothing.|$|R
50|$|These tiles were {{reusable}} {{for up to}} 100 missions with refurbishment (100 missions {{was also}} the design lifetime of each orbiter). They were carefully inspected in the Orbiter Processing Facility after each mission, and damaged or worn tiles were immediately replaced before the next mission. Fabric sheets known as gap fillers were also inserted between tiles where necessary. These allowed for a <b>snug</b> <b>fit</b> between tiles, preventing excess plasma from penetrating between them, yet allowing for thermal expansion and flexing of the underlying vehicle skin.|$|R

2500|$|Though {{occasionally}} {{made with}} cast bronze, the pot-de-fer was essentially an iron [...] bottle {{with a narrow}} neck. It was loaded with powder and an iron arrow-like bolt, feathered with iron. It is believed that {{the middle of the}} bolt was likely wrapped in leather for a <b>snug</b> <b>fit,</b> necessary to enhance the thrust from the gaseous pressure within the cannon. However, this feature is not shown in manuscript illuminations. The cannon was set off through a small-diameter touchhole, where a red-hot wire could be thrust to set off an explosion and fire the cannon.|$|R

50|$|Glow plugs have {{a limited}} {{lifetime}} and users are advised to have several replacement plugs on hand. Replacement plugs must be the correct type; plugs for turbo engines are not compatible with plugs for standard engines. The plugs should be tightened a quarter-turn past a <b>snug</b> <b>fit</b> to avoid over-tightening. Glow plugs, like all incandescent objects, are extremely hot, and glow plugs should never be removed when hot. Likewise, {{care must be taken}} when fueling because a hot glow plug can ignite fuel. Overheating of the battery can also be dangerous and only well-made connectors should be used.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of making small recipient wounds {{is the ability}} to create a [...] "snug fit" [...] for the follicular unit grafts. Unlike the punch grafts and some mini-grafting techniques; each of which removes a small bit of tissue in the recipient area; the trimmed follicular unit grafts used in FUT fit into small, needle-made incisions without any need for removing tissue. This preserves the elasticity of the scalp and holds the tiny grafts snugly in place. After surgery, the <b>snug</b> <b>fit</b> facilitates wound healing and helps to ensure that the grafts will get enough oxygen from the surrounding tissue in order to maximize their survival.|$|R

50|$|The {{patterns}} {{used today}} {{date back to}} 1839. Each pair of Dents Heritage gloves is handmade in England by a Dents craftsman. Every glove is individually bench cut. Quirks, which are small, diamond-shaped pieces of leather, are hand sewn {{at the base of}} the fingers in order to provide a <b>snug</b> <b>fit.</b> Dents craftsmen also utilize a hand felling technique in which the cuff of the glove is stitched to the lining, improving the gloves' shape and comfort. Dents Heritage gloves are made with peccary skins, North American deerskin, and fine aniline Ethiopian hairsheep leathers. Heritage gloves are available in a handful of stores worldwide with a luxury price tag and should not be confused with the imported gloves sold in most stores.|$|R
500|$|The {{precursor}} to the underwire bra {{can be traced back}} to at least 1893, when New Yorker Marie Tucek was granted a patent [...] for a [...] "breast supporter". The breast supporter was described as a modification of the corset, and was very similar to a modern push-up bra designed to support the breasts. It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard, or other stiff material, shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts, following the contour of the breasts. It was covered with silk, canvas, or other cloth, which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each breast. The plate curved around the torso and ended near the armpits, held in place and adjusted to a <b>snug</b> <b>fit</b> by shoulder straps that crossed the back, forming an X-shape. It was secured with hook-and-eye closures.|$|R
40|$|An {{extender}} {{is defined}} {{to be an}} active manipulator worn by a human to increase his strength [6]. The human, in physical contact with the extender, exchanges power and information signals with the extender. The human arm, the extender, and the environment comprise the dynamic model of the extender system. In this paper, an expression for system performance is derived to determine the force augmentation of the extender. The stability {{and the performance of}} the extender are proven via simulation and via experiments with a single-degree-of-freedom hydraulic extender. The trade-off between performance and stability is discussed: the better the required performance (larger force amplification in this experiment), the narrower the stability range is.

5000|$|Neoprene resists {{degradation}} {{more than}} natural or synthetic rubber. This relative inertness makes it {{well suited for}} demanding applications such as gaskets, hoses, and corrosion-resistant coatings. It {{can be used as}} a base for adhesives, noise isolation in power transformer installations, and as padding in external metal cases to protect the contents while allowing a <b>snug</b> <b>fit.</b> It resists burning better than exclusively hydrocarbon based rubbers, resulting in its appearance in weather stripping for fire doors and in combat related attire such as gloves and face masks. Because of its tolerance of extreme conditions, neoprene is used to line landfills. Neoprene's burn point is around 260°C (500°F). [...] Neoprene foam is also used in many applications. Neoprene foam can be produced in either closed-cell or open-cell form. The closed-cell form is waterproof, less compressible and more expensive. The open-cell form can be breathable.|$|R
30|$|The {{fractures}} were managed {{with patients}} in supine {{position on a}} fracture table. A thigh bolster was routinely applied and a tourniquet was inflated in 210 out of 247 cases. The knee was flexed but no calcaneal traction was used for fracture reduction. A patellar tendon-splitting (transtendinous) approach was selected in all cases. Guide wire insertion was followed by sequential reaming in 0.5 -mm increments until the canal was reamed up to 1  mm greater than the selected diameter of the cannulated stainless steel tibial nail (Russel-Taylor, Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN). All the nails were introduced with a <b>snug</b> <b>fit</b> to the intramedullary cavity and were statically locked. The nail design allowed the insertion of a maximum of two screws proximally and two screws distally. However, {{the decision to use}} one or two screws at each side of the nail was made at the discretion of the attending surgeon.|$|R
40|$|Polyimide second-stage rod seals were {{evaluated}} {{to determine their}} suitability for applications in space station environments. The 6. 35 -cm (2. 5 -in.) K-section seal was verified for thermal cycling operation between room temperature and 478 K (400 F) and for operation in a 133 micron PA(0. 000001 mm Hg) vacuum environment. The test seal completed the scheduled 96 thermal cycles and 1438 hr in vacuum with external rod seal leakage well within the maximum allowable of two drops per 25 actuation cycles. At program completion, the seals {{showed no signs of}} structural degradation. Posttest inspection showed the seals retained a <b>snug</b> <b>fit</b> against the shaft and housing walls, indicating additional wear life capability. Evaluation of a molecular flow section during vacuum testing, to inhibit fluid loss through vaporization, showed it to be beneficial with MIL-H- 5606, a petroleum-base fluid, in comparison with MIL-H- 83282, a synthetic hydrocarbon-base fluid...|$|R
5000|$|Slim-fit pants or skinny jeans (when made of denim) have a <b>snug</b> <b>fit</b> {{through the}} legs and end in a small leg opening that can be {{anywhere}} from 9" [...] to 20" [...] in circumference, depending on size. Other names for this style include drainpipes, stovepipes, tight pants, cigarette pants, skinny jeans, pencil pants, skinny pants, gas pipes, and skinnies. Skinny jeans taper completely {{at the bottom of}} the leg, whereas drainpipe jeans are skinny but then the lower leg is straight instead of tapering and so they are often slightly baggier {{at the bottom of the}} leg than skinny jeans. In some styles, zippers are needed at the bottom of the leg to facilitate pulling them over the feet. Stretch denim, with anywhere from 2% to 4% spandex, may be used to allow jeans to have a super-slim fit. Skinny jeans come in a variety of colors and styles.|$|R
