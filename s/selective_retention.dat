40|$|A {{combination}} of a flotation/sedimentation experiment and sieve analysis for the reticulorumen (RR) contents of roe deer Capreolus capreolus Linnaeus, 1758, a browsing ruminant, showed {{that there was no}} correlation between particle size and particle density. Large particles were present in both the sedimented and the buoyant fraction, which is in accord with the reported absence of stratification of RR contents in browsing ruminants. Comparative sieve analysis of roe deer RR and caecal/rectal material demonstrated that there must be some <b>selective</b> particle <b>retention</b> in the browsing ruminant as well, as a certain fraction of large particles in RR contents does not occur in the caecal/rectal material. These results lead to the explanatory dilemma that, while <b>selective</b> particle <b>retention</b> is observed, it cannot be due to the mechanisms known to work in grazing ruminants...|$|R

40|$|Morphological {{characteristics}} of the forestomach and reports of the natural diet suggest that dikdiks should have a ‘moose-type’ forestomach physiology with a low degree of <b>selective</b> particle <b>retention.</b> This assumption was tested in feeding experiments with 12 adult Phillip’s dikdiks (Madoqua saltiana phillipsi) on 3 different intake levels, using cobalt-EDTA as a solute marker and a conventional chromium-mordanted fibre (< 2 mm; mean particle size 0. 63 mm) as particle marker. Body mass had no influence on retention time (RT) whereas food intake level clearly had. Drinking water intake {{was not related to}} solute marker RT. The particle marker was retained distinctively longer than the solute marker. Comparisons with results in larger ruminants and with faecal particle sizes measured in dikdiks suggested that the particle marker was above the critical size threshold, above which particle delay in the forestomach is not only due to <b>selective</b> particle <b>retention,</b> but additionally due to the ruminal particle sorting mechanism. A second study with a marker of a lower mean particle size (0. 17 mm) resulted in particle and fluid RT similar to those in other ‘moose-type’ ruminants. Even this smaller particle marker yielded RT that were longer than those predicted by allometric equations based on quarter-power scaling, providing further support for observations that small ruminants generally achieve longer RT and higher digestive efficiencies than expected based on their body size...|$|R

50|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>retention,</b> in {{relating}} to the mind, is the process whereby people more accurately remember messages that are closer to their interests, values and beliefs, than those that are in contrast with their values and beliefs, selecting what to keep in the memory, narrowing the information flow.|$|E

40|$|The gastric transit of {{floating}} and non-floating matrix dosage forms {{has been studied}} {{by means of a}} gamma scintigraphic imaging technique. Results indicate that, on the one hand, buoyancy and non-buoyancy of the forms lead to distinct intragastric behaviours and that, on the other hand, a <b>selective</b> gastric <b>retention</b> is operated in function of the diametral size of the matrix. Depending on the subject posture, standing or supine, the gastric residence period of the form is hence determined either by its buoyancy or by its size. As sustained drug delivery systems, the floating dosage forms globally offer several advantages which might be worth taking into account. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|Part of {{the reason}} why {{undecided}} voters are frequent message targets can be found in reinforcement theory. Reinforcement theory predicts that people with already developed opinions will selectively attend to and cognitively incorporate information that supports their own views.

50|$|Blind {{variation}} and <b>selective</b> <b>retention</b> (BVSR) is a phrase introduced by Campbell {{to describe the}} most fundamental principle underlying cultural evolution. In cybernetics, {{it is seen as}} a principle for describing change in evolutionary systems in general, not just in biological organisms. For example, it can also be applied to scientific discovery, memetic evolution, or genetic programming. As such, it forms a foundation for what has later been called universal Darwinism.|$|E
5000|$|The final {{mechanism}} behind reinforcement {{theory has}} to do with <b>selective</b> <b>retention</b> and recall. This phenomenon occurs when [...] "people remember only those items that are in agreement with their predispositions" [...] (Johnson-Cartee & Copeland, 1997, 94). The ease with which a person can recall information impacts the level and intensity of judgment related to the topic. For example, people who can easily recall an example related to the message are more likely to make an intense judgment about it (Shrum, 2002).|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo {{distinct}} sets of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) catalyze membrane fusion in the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi. The {{mechanism that}} controls Golgi localization of SNAREs remains largely unknown. Here we tested three potential mechanisms, including vesicle recycling between the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum, partitioning in Golgi lipid microdomains, and <b>selective</b> intra-Golgi <b>retention.</b> Recycling rates showed a linear relationship with intra-Golgi mobility of SNAREs. The cis-Golgi SNAREs had higher mobility than intra-Golgi SNAREs, whereas vesicle SNAREs had higher mobility than target membrane SNAREs. The differences in SNARE mobility were {{not due to}} preferential partitioning into detergent-resistant membrane microdomains. We propose that intra-Golgi retention precludes entropy-driven redistribution of SNAREs to the endoplasmic reticulum and endocytic compartments...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the {{particle size distribution}} in 245 faecal samples of 8 1 species of captive ruminants by a wet-sieving procedure. As a comparative measure, the modulus of fineness (MOF; Poppi et al. 1980) was used. Species were classified as frugivores (n= 5), browsers (BR, n= 16), intermediate feeders (IM, n= 35) and grazers (GR, n= 25). BR generally had {{a higher proportion of}} large particles, i. e. higher MOF values, than IM or GR of comparable size. These findings are in accord with reported lower fibre digestibility and less <b>selective</b> particle <b>retention</b> in BR, and are indicative of a difference in reticulo-ruminal physiology between the main ruminant feeding types. Possible consequences of the escape of larger particles from a browser's reticulo-rumen for the feeding of captive BR are briefly discussed...|$|R

50|$|These NK {{cells have}} the ability to elicit cell {{cytotoxicity}} in vitro, but at a lower level than peripheral NK cells, despite containing perforin. Lack of cytotoxicity in vivo {{may be due to the}} presence of ligands for their inhibitory receptors. Trophoblast cells downregulate HLA-A and HLA-B to defend against cytotoxic T cell-mediated death. This would normally trigger NK cells by missing self recognition; however, these cells survive. The <b>selective</b> <b>retention</b> of HLA-E (which is a ligand for NK cell inhibitory receptor NKG2A) and HLA-G (which is a ligand for NK cell inhibitory receptor KIR2DL4) by the trophoblast is thought to defend it against NK cell-mediated death.|$|E

Recent reports have demonstrated that ICG can selectively accumulate in primary HCC and extrahepatic metastases of HCC; additionally, ICG fluorescence imaging presented clear boundaries between tumors and normal tissue [2 – 5].

40|$|The {{fluorescent}} stain Hoechst 33342, when injected i. v. into mice, has an LD 50 of 300 micrograms g- 1. The stain exits rapidly {{from the}} blood, with a half-life of 110 sec following an injection of 10 micrograms g- 1, but remains bound within target cells, redistributing with a half-life longer than 2 h. This {{results in a}} gradient of drug binding outward from capillaries {{which can be used}} to estimate regional perfusion via fluorescence microscopy of frozen tissue sections. For tumour tissues that can be dispersed into single cell suspensions, intracellular Hoeschst 33342 can be quantified by flow cytometry, and cell populations can be {{selected on the basis of}} their fluorescence (distance from the vasculature) using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Our results in tumours and in spheroids indicate that the rate of stain uptake by different cell subpopulations in situ is much more dependent on stain delivery than on <b>selective</b> uptake. <b>Retention</b> of the stain in spheroids is sufficiently stable to allow cell sorting several hours post-injection. Hoechst 33342 thus appears to have considerable potential as an agent for quantifying tissue perfusion, and for allowing selection of tumour cell subpopulations to assess response to radiation and drugs...|$|R
40|$|Meiosis, {{the basis}} of sex, evolved through {{iterative}} gene duplications. To understand whether subsequent duplications have further enriched the core meiotic “tool-kit, ” we investigated the fate of meiotic gene duplicates following whole genome duplication (WGD), a common occurrence in eukaryotes. We show that meiotic genes return to a single copy more rapidly than genome-wide average in angiosperms, one of the lineages in which WGD is most vividly exemplified. The rate at which duplicates are lost decreases through time, a tendency that is also observed genome-wide and may thus {{prove to be a}} general trend post-WGD. The sharpest decline is observed for the subset of genes mediating meiotic recombination; however, we found no evidence that the presence of these duplicates is counterselected in two recent polyploid crops selected for fertility. We therefore propose that their loss is passive, highlighting how quickly WGDs are resolved in the absence of <b>selective</b> duplicate <b>retention.</b> Key words: meiosis, polyploidy, whole genome duplication, evolution, duplication, genome. Whole genome duplications (WGDs) represent an ideal system to study the evolution of meiotic genes; WGD is ini-tially accompanied by irregular meiosis and thereby creates both the necessity to adapt meiotic behavior and the oppor...|$|R
5000|$|When {{exposed to}} a stimulus, {{consumers}} may respond in entirely different ways due to individual perceptual processes.

[...] Selective comprehension is where the consumer interprets information {{in a manner that is}} consistent with their own beliefs. <b>Selective</b> <b>retention</b> occurs when consumers remember some information while rapidly forgetting other information. Collectively the processes of selective exposure, attention, comprehension and retention lead individual consumers to favor certain messages over others.

5000|$|Cosmic {{evolutionism}} {{and evolutionary}} analogism: Literary Theorists who would call themselves [...] "literary Darwinists" [...] or claim some close alignment with the literary Darwinists share one central idea: that the adapted mind produces literature and that literature reflects {{the structure and}} character of the adapted mind. There {{are at least two}} other ways of integrating evolution into literary theory: cosmic evolutionism and evolutionary analogism. Cosmic evolutionists identify some universal process of development or progress and identify literary structures as microcosmic versions of that process. Proponents of cosmic evolution include Frederick Turner, Alex Argyros, and Richard Cureton. Evolutionary analogists take the process of Darwinian evolution—blind variation and selective retention—as a widely applicable model for all development. The psychologist Donald Campbell advances the idea that all intellectual creativity can be conceived as a form of random variation and <b>selective</b> <b>retention.</b> Rabkin and Simon offer an instance in literary study. They argue that cultural creations [...] "evolve {{in the same way as}} do biological organisms, that is, as complex adaptive systems that succeed or fail according to their fitness to their environment." [...] Other critics or theorists who have some affiliation with evolutionary biology but who would not identify themselves as literary Darwinists include William Benzon (Beethoven's Anvil) and William Flesch (Comeuppance).|$|E

40|$|In {{domestic}} ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents – {{the results}} of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the <b>selective</b> particle <b>retention</b> in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests {{that the degree of}} this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species...|$|R

40|$|Are mobile {{creative}} workers mainly {{responsible for}} {{innovation in the}} creative industry because they mediate knowledge transfer and spill-over that are critical in creating new ideas? This paper explores the labour requirements of digital content production. Drawing on 323 digital content (DC) firm samples located in Seoul, South Korea, this paper explores the causal relationship between human resource practices and innovation. A logistic regression of the data reveals that the additive index {{of a set of}} organizational practices that aim to foster internal labor pool including <b>selective</b> hiring, <b>retention,</b> and R&D investment is a statistically significant predictor of innovative capacity of the digital content firms in Seoul. However, the additive index of incentive-based HR practices including high compensation and job security did not show a significant relationship with the innovative capacity of firms. This study provides preliminary evidence on the significance of internal organization, and in particular of the role of internal labor pools, in innovation. This study suggests that the leaders of creative industry firms, particularly those in the digital content industry, should carefully choose between exploitation and exploration in managing their creative workers and creative capacity, since these practices may shape the firm’s competitive advantage.

40|$|The thermal {{hydrolysis}} process (THP) {{has been}} proven to be an excellent pretreatment step for an anaerobic digester (AD), increasing biogas yield and decreasing sludge disposal. The goal of this work was to optimize deammonification for efficient nitrogen removal despite the inhibition effects caused by the organics present in the THP-AD sludge filtrate (digestate). Two sequencing batch reactors were studied treating conventional digestate and THP-AD digestate, respectively. Improved process control based on higher dissolved oxygen set-point (1 mg O- 2 /L) and longer aeration times could achieve successful treatment of THP-AD digestate. This increased set-point could overcome the inhibition effect on aerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB), potentially caused by particulate and colloidal organics. Moreover, based on the mass balance, anoxic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB) contribution to the total nitrogen removal decreased from 97 +/- A 1 % for conventional to 72 +/- A 5 % for THP-AD digestate treatment, but remained stable by <b>selective</b> AnAOB <b>retention</b> using a vibrating screen. Overall, similar total nitrogen removal rates of 520 +/- A 28 mg N/L/day at a loading rate of 600 mg N/L/day were achieved in the THP-AD reactor compared to the conventional digestate treatment operating at low dissolved oxygen (DO) (0. 38 +/- A 0. 10 mg O- 2 /L) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of passage rate {{is important for}} the concept of ruminant diversification. While supporters of Hofmann's 1989 feeding type classification claim that browsing ruminants have faster passage rates than grazing ruminants, other researchers consider the passage rate to depend on body size alone. To date, no convincing comparison of ruminant passage rates has been put forward. For comparative purposes, we suggest the use of the "selectivity factor", which is an expression of how much longer particles of a defined size (< 2 mm) are retained in the ruminant digestive tract than fluids. From the limited data available, it seems that grazing ruminants display selectivity factors between 1. 56 and 3. 80, whereas browsers have a much narrower range of 1. 14 - 1. 80. This suggests that browsers are not able to selectively retain particles as long as grazers. Intake of browsers, on the other hand, may not be limited by physical fill of the forestomach to the same degree as in grazers. This result can explain several observations on the digestive physiology of browsers, some of which have been linked to a rumen bypass mechanism. We propose that the ability for <b>selective</b> particle <b>retention</b> is a key factor for understanding the physiological consequences of ruminant diversification...|$|R
