5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
25|$|I'm {{not saying}} the whole {{audience}} {{gave us a}} standing ovation, but there was this sizable standing ovation there. And I thought: 'This is incredible, because no one's heard this number yet. This {{is the first time}} they're hearing it!' It obviously touched them, you know. And that was at the L.A. Forum, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> we were onto something with that one.|$|E
500|$|In his {{theatrical}} debut, Gyllenhaal starred on the London {{stage in}} Kenneth Lonergan's revival of This Is Our Youth at the Garrick Theatre in 2002. Gyllenhaal said, [...] "Every actor I {{look up to}} has done theatre work, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I had {{to give it a}} try." [...] The play, which had been a critical sensation on Broadway, ran for eight weeks in London's West End. Gyllenhaal received favorable critical reviews and an Evening Standard Theatre Award in the category [...] "Outstanding Newcomer".|$|E
60|$|SOAMES. I {{admit that}} I should {{probably}} not do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> should perhaps be wrong not {{to steal the}} turnip: I cant defend my reluctance to do so; but I think I should not do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> should not do so.|$|R

500|$|In the episode, Logan {{makes an}} obscene hand gesture {{known as the}} shocker, {{something}} that the UPN censors did not notice. Before the filming of [...] "Normal Is the Watchword", Rob Thomas informed actor Teddy Dunn, who played Duncan Kane, that he was planning remove the character from the show. Dunn {{has said that he}} was not too upset by the news, as he almost did not return for the season at all. On his role in the season, Dunn stated, [...] "And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> going in that I had a finite amount of episodes, so it was like any other job. It was week-to-week and then I went on my merry way." ...|$|E
500|$|Oxford cox Acer Nethercott said [...] "Our bowman {{came off}} {{his seat and}} could not {{continue}} properly – it was race over after that." [...] Regarding the rejected appeal, he claimed that the umpire [...] "had laid down to both coxes before the race {{that there was a}} way he wanted to conduct the race. [...] And then he did something completely different in the race." [...] Kennelly, the bowman, claimed he was [...] "100 per cent confident that if what happened didn't happen we would have won" [...] while Cambridge cox Kenelm Richardson stated [...] "The umpire was very good and told me to hold my line, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I was exactly where I needed to be".|$|E
500|$|I wanted {{somebody}} with a tremendous {{understanding of how to}} make a pop video, because my biggest challenge working with directors is that I am the director and I write the treatments and I get the fashion and I decide what it's about and it's very hard to find directors that will relinquish any sort of input from the artist. ... But Francis and I worked together. ... It was collaborative. He's a really pop video director and a filmmaker. He did I Am Legend and I'm a huge Will Smith fan, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> he could execute the video in a way that I could give him all my weirdest, most psychotic ideas ... But it would come across to and be relevant to the public.|$|E

500|$|Kinsler {{was then}} drafted {{a third time}} by the Texas Rangers in the 17th round (496th overall) in 2003 as a shortstop {{at the urging of}} area scout Mike Grouse. Grouse liked Kinsler's tools, makeup, desire, and gritty approach. In Grouse's {{scouting}} report, he wrote that Kinsler had a great feel for the game, athleticism, solid defensive skills, intensity, and leadership qualities. Grouse knew that Kinsler was probably being underrated by rival scouts who did not know that Kinsler had played with a foot stress fracture while at Missouri, [...] "so [...] really couldn't run like I knew he could. I'd seen him in Wichita the year before, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> he was a plus runner. Most people ... didn't know that, so they probably downgraded him. But I knew it, and I wasn't telling anybody." [...] Kinsler, for his part, says: [...] "I thought I was a lot better than a 17th round pick. I thought I belonged in the top 10 rounds." [...] Kinsler nonetheless agreed to sign with the Rangers on his 21st birthday, for $30,000.|$|E
2500|$|... "People {{laying down}} were saying, 'please help me'. I {{went over to}} one lady who was {{unconscious}} and said {{are you all right}} and someone said 'you just get away from them', then I thought with the other fellas on the road, you know, I better get out of here. There was two cars that had pulled up <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that there was help on its way, I just didn’t leave them stranded." ...|$|E
2500|$|Newman {{had written}} some songs for the album: [...] "My method of writing songs, which I hadn't used for 30 years, {{is to write}} them on {{acoustic}} guitar. They take an average of five minutes each. If it's not written in five minutes, it's {{not going to get}} written. I'd sit on the couch, play a bit, if I had some words from Graham, jam 'em in, record it to my iPhone, then I'd present a bunch of songs to Rob and Graham. Rob said , 'It sounds like the '70s' and Graham said, 'I hate acoustic guitar,' <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> we were onto a winner. That's so classic Wire." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, {{who does}} not appear on the {{recording}}, noted that the recording foreshadowed his departure from the band, stating: [...] "They did that while I {{was on the road}} touring for my solo record. [...] I knew that that was the ending because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me. That {{was one of the last}} straws for me, because nobody had said anything to me, and they recorded a song by one of my favorite bands. It was pretty clear I'm a big Rolling Stones fan, and they recorded the song without me. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that was it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Into the Wild {{was thus}} written by Kate Cary {{in about three}} months under the {{pseudonym}} [...] "Erin Hunter". Holmes then began to work behind the scenes, editing and supervising details. HarperCollins requested Holmes to produce a book every three months. Upon hearing this, Holmes invited Cherith Baldry into the team {{in order to keep}} up with the schedule. Holmes says she chose Baldry because [...] "her natural writing style was quite close to mine and Kate's, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that Cherith's voice would fit". Afterwards, Holmes began to like the idea of using cats, since she realized how thoughtful they can be in leading private lives without any humans realizing. The series is considered to be fantasy, and has also been labelled an [...] "animal adventure".|$|E
2500|$|Sirtis {{was delighted}} to {{get the chance to}} do some comedy in Star Trek: First Contact and said, [...] "I loved it because it opened the door to a {{different}} side of Troi we'd never seen before. That door has stayed open and that whole kind of wacky, zany Troi thing has continued into the next movie, which is great for me because I like to do things that are different." [...] Sirtis stated of her role in Star Trek: Nemesis, [...] "I sort of had an inkling that I {{was going to have a}} good part in this film because John Logan was such a big fan of the character. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that he would do her some justice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Holmes {{remembers that}} while editing Forest of Secrets, she thought: [...] "Hang on, this {{is turning into}} {{something}} special". While {{coming up with the}} idea of Bluestar giving up her kits to become leader, she remembers [...] "sitting at my keyboard, tapping away to unpeel the layers of emotion that must have led to her momentous decision, and suddenly realizing how real and vital the Clans' world had become to me". After that, Holmes says that the plot seemed to write itself out. HarperCollins requested Holmes to produce a book every three months. Upon hearing this, Holmes invited Cherith Baldry into the team in order to keep up with the schedule. Holmes says she chose Baldry because [...] "her natural writing style was quite close to mine and Kate's, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that Cherith's voice would fit".|$|E
2500|$|Perron {{followed}} {{up the next}} week with a second blog post on the subject. She interviewed Lane who states {{that she did not}} expect to be named during Portman's acceptance speech because a Fox Searchlight producer had asked her to stop giving interviews until after the Oscars were over: [...] "They were trying to create this façade that [...] had become a ballerina {{in a year and a}} half ... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> they didn't want to publicize anything about me." [...] Perron then states that Lane [...] "says she was more offended by that myth than any slight to her as a dancer who worked 'painstaking' hours on the set. She says she's talked to her colleagues about 'how unfortunate it is that, as professional dancers, we work so hard, but people can actually believe that it's easy enough to do it in a year. That's the thing that bothered me the most.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think they}} always had me in mind for Nova. But they needed someone to do the screen test, and you keep trying to employ your actors. So. I did the screen test. The part that {{was hard for me}} was {{actually}} doing the mask,where they put all that plaster on your face and you have to lie there still for a long time. Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Spurrier {{spoke about}} his NFL {{coaching}} experience during SEC Media Days in 2014. [...] "When I left Florida after 12 years, I thought I {{was going to}} coach in the NFL {{five or six years}} and retire to the beach, and play golf a bunch, and travel around, this, that and the other. But that was a bad plan. It was. Later you found out that was not a real good idea. But that's the way I was thinking back then.". [...] After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL. [...] "I went to the team that offered the most money instead of the best situation", he said. And in 2015, he told David Feherty that, [...] "The owner and the personnel guys, they picked the team. I couldn’t even pick the quarterback the second year. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it wasn’t going to work, but that's ok. I probably didn’t do a very good job, and the situation wasn’t what I was looking for, so {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E
2500|$|When she {{was interviewed}} for Blues & Soul in 2010, Rowland {{explained}} that the album would blend her urban roots with a strong dance music influence. [...] "I'd say {{the main difference between}} this new album and my previous albums, is that this time I wasn't afraid to take a risk. I didn't care whether it was urban, dance, hip hop, WHATEVER... I just wanted a great track that I could sing and that people would enjoy." [...] Part of the inspiration for the new sound on the album was wanting to do something different. In her interview with The Independent, she said [...] "For me, it was being kind of at a flat line with urban music and wanting something different ... when I did 'When Love Takes Over', it was easy to do it – it was almost like it happened before me in spirit and I walked right into it. ...<b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction." [...] Then in response to criticisms that her long-standing fans would not have their expectations met, she said [...] "I did not forget about my urban roots, nor will I ever ... That {{is one of the reasons}} I am here period ... I thank everyone for being so wonderful and so open to me trying something new. I won't let you down this record, I promise you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{also worked}} with several writers and {{producers}} on songs that {{failed to make the}} album. Toby Gad worked with Lewis including writing the song [...] "Unreachable" [...] with Lewis and Robbins. Taio Cruz was hired by Cowell to write and produce tracks for the album, and Irish Indie band The Script agreed to write a song, however, it was submitted too late. Production and songwriting team Xenomania were reported to have written five songs for Lewis's second album, described by songwriter Miranda Cooper as [...] "tragic songs with a twist." [...] Ne-Yo wrote songs for the album, including [...] "Can't Fight It". Lewis expressed interest in working with Chris Martin of Coldplay to give the album a rockier edge, though a collaboration never came to light. Several demos are said to be influenced by Coldplay, and Lewis collaborated with rock singer Aqualung. She was also reported to have worked with DJ Infamous, Claude Kelly, and Los Da Mystro. She worked with Timbaland in April 2009, and explained the reason for his tracks not appearing on Echo: [...] "I went in the studio with Timbaland and we vibed out. The thing is, on this album, {{there were a lot of}} people that I'd been with on the first album <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> them and we kinda got into the vibe straight away. Obviously I'm still getting to know Timbaland, it's kind of a continuing and evolving relationship, so this time he's not on the album, but hopefully next time he will be".|$|E
6000|$|... "One of {{the party}} to this outrage has confessed, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> all about it, Rover. The leader, I believe, was Lew Flapp, and his main {{supporters}} were Pender, Rockley, and Jackson." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her father {{lost his}} patience; {{it was a}} relief to be angry. [...] "No, <b>I</b> don't think <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you couldn't. And you ought to be ashamed of {{mentioning}} such a thing!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait {{a day or}} two and, I'll {{tell you}} a romance in return for yours. Your mother beckons to me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> Hester has come. Good night. I've had a charming time." ...|$|R
