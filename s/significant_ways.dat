5|$|The Lutheran {{calendar}} is most {{similar to}} the calendar of The Episcopal Church and thus to the Anglican Calendar of Saints, though it also bears resemblance to the Roman Calendar of Saints because it commemorates {{many of the same}} individuals. However, the Lutheran calendar differs from both in two very <b>significant</b> <b>ways,</b> aside from its emphasis on commemorating persons important to the Lutheran tradition.|$|E
5|$|The English and Danish editions {{differed}} in several <b>significant</b> <b>ways.</b> The English edition was somewhat shorter and more concise, and included newer information that Heilmann had acquired {{by studying the}} actual fossils of Archaeopteryx in Berlin, {{as well as from}} foreign scientists who sent him photographs and plaster casts. It also contained considerably less harsh language towards Boas and others with whom he disagreed. Curiously, the English edition did not contain the transformational sequences inspired by D'Arcy Thompson, though Heilmann still briefly acknowledged the use of his methods in reconstructing his Proavis.|$|E
5|$|Kent Hughes broke Olympic {{tradition}} in two <b>significant</b> <b>ways.</b> He decided to charge for television and newsreel {{footage of the}} Games where previously footage was provided free of charge. Secondly, following a suggestion from John Ian Wing, a 17-year-old apprentice carpenter from Melbourne, Kent Hughes instigated the now familiar closing ceremony tradition of the athletes of different nations parading together, instead of with their national teams, {{as a symbol of}} world unity. Kent Hughes's plan to charge for television and newsreel footage of the Games was strongly opposed in many circles, including the media, who believed that the Games were news and as such should be free, while Australian government authorities thought that providing free television coverage of the Games would lead to greater tourism opportunities. Brundage made no public comment on television rights for the Games but grasped the financial possibilities of charging for rights, devising a television rights fees policy following the Games, whereby television stations were forced to negotiate for televised rights for all future Games. This policy is believed to have netted the IOC over $12 billion since its inception at the 1960 Summer Olympics.|$|E

25|$|She {{made what}} is {{considered}} her most important work in the early 1960s anticipating in many respects the work of minimalists like Donald Judd and Ellsworth Kelly. She was unlike the minimalists is some <b>significant</b> <b>ways.</b> She named, for instance, many of her works after places and events that were important to her - a practice suggesting a narrative beyond and yet somehow contained by the sculpture.|$|E
25|$|While a class {{hierarchy}} {{is reflected in}} stratified housing structures, military classism differs from traditional class structures in some <b>significant</b> <b>ways</b> - namely, schooling and access to quality healthcare. Children of military personnel attend the same base schools regardless of rank, creating peer cultures that are usually not class-based, and providing equal access to educational resources. Similarly, all military personnel receive the same quality of healthcare by the same providers.|$|E

25|$|In the Ganges Delta {{many large}} rivers come together, both merging and bifurcating in a {{complicated}} network of channels. The two largest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra, both split into distributary channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining. This current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have changed course, sometimes altering the network of channels in <b>significant</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to requiring that certain foods be eaten for sacred purposes, the Israelite diet {{was shaped by}} religious practices which prohibited the consumption of certain foods, {{both in terms of}} the animals permissible for eating, and the manner of their preparation. The cuisine of the Israelites thus differed from that of their neighbors in <b>significant</b> <b>ways.</b> For example, ancient Mesopotamian recipes describe foods cooked with animal blood and milk added to meat stews; this would have been avoided by the ancient Israelites.|$|E
25|$|Oedipus was {{a figure}} {{who was also}} used in the Latin {{literature}} of ancient Rome. Julius Caesar wrote a play on Oedipus, {{but it has not}} survived into modern times. Ovid included Oedipus in Metamorphoses, but only as the person who defeated the Sphinx. He makes no mention of Oedipus' troubled experiences with his father and mother. Seneca the Younger wrote his own play on the story of Oedipus in the first century AD. It differs in <b>significant</b> <b>ways</b> from the work of Sophocles.|$|E

25|$|The {{elemental}} composition of Mars {{is different from}} Earth′s in several <b>significant</b> <b>ways.</b> First, Martian meteorite analysis suggests that the planet's mantle is about twice as rich in iron as the Earth's mantle. Second, its core is more rich in sulphur. Third, the Martian mantle is richer in potassium and phosphorus than Earth's and fourth, the Martian crust contains {{a higher percentage of}} volatile elements such as sulphur and chlorine than the Earth's crust does. Many of these conclusions are supported by in situ analyses of rocks and soils on the Martian surface.|$|E
25|$|Some {{important}} concepts: A {{formation is}} a formally named and defined geologic unit with unique characteristics. Those characteristics were created during a largely unbroken {{period of time}} and result from the specific depositional environment that the formation was laid down in. A member is a minor unit in a formation and a bed is a distinct subunit of a member. Groups are sets of formations that are related in <b>significant</b> <b>ways</b> such as, for example, all being deposited during a dry period that lasted millions of years or as the result of an ocean periodically flooding the same area over millions of years.|$|E
25|$|It is debated when Plato {{held his}} public lecture 'On the Good.' For {{the advocates of}} the Tübingen {{interpretation}} this is connected {{with the question of}} whether the unwritten doctrines belong to Plato's later philosophy or were worked out relatively early in his career. Resolving this question depends in turn upon the long-standing debate in Plato studies between 'unitarians' and 'developmentalists.' The unitarians maintain that Plato always defended a single, coherent metaphysical system throughout his career; developmentalists distinguish several different phases in Plato's thought and hold that he was forced by problems he encountered while writing the dialogues to revise his system in <b>significant</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|E

25|$|The first, {{descriptive}} task naturally {{requires a}} clarification of one's terms, above all, the word religion. Historians of religion have long underscored the problematic {{character of this}} term, noting that its usage over the centuries has changed in <b>significant</b> <b>ways,</b> generally {{in the direction of}} reification. The early psychologists of religion were fully aware of these difficulties, typically acknowledging that the definitions they were choosing to use were to some degree arbitrary. With the rise of positivistic trends in psychology {{over the course of the}} 20th century, especially the demand that all phenomena be measured, psychologists of religion developed a multitude of scales, most of them developed for use with Protestant Christians. Factor analysis was also brought into play by both psychologists and sociologists of religion, in an effort to establish a fixed core of dimensions and a corresponding set of scales. The justification and adequacy of these efforts, especially in the light of constructivist and other postmodern viewpoints, remains a matter of debate.|$|E
25|$|The pH {{level of}} a wine is the {{measurement}} {{of the amount of}} free (H+) hydrogen ions. It is related to the titratable acidity {{level of a}} wine but differs in <b>significant</b> <b>ways.</b> Low pH numbers indicate a high concentration of acids in a solution. While pure water is neutral with a pH of 7, wine tends to be more acidic with a pH between 3 and 4. As the acid levels in ripening grapes fall, the concentration of acids are lessening which means the pH level is rising. Yeasts, bacteria, phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins which influence color all have varying tolerance to wines with high pH levels. In general, wines with high pH value tend to have duller colors and less developed flavors and be more prone to wine faults caused by spoilage organisms which makes monitoring the pH levels of grapes during ripening a priority for viticulturists and winemakers.|$|E
25|$|To {{address these}} issues, Grampus, {{although}} similar in design {{to the traditional}} New England schooner, also differed in <b>significant</b> <b>ways.</b> She had a hull about two feet (0.6 meter) deeper than traditional schooners of similar length, giving her greater stability. She had a straight stem, rather than a raking one, and her stern was narrower and more raked, with her after portion approximating a V-shape, all changes which increased her hull length at the waterline. Her foremast was considerably shorter than her mainmast, and her rigging was designed {{so that she could}} carry a double-headed rig forward that allowed her to use a smaller jib that could be furled upon the approach of heavy weather and a fore staysail running from the foremast to near her stem. The result was a ship able to achieve higher sailing speeds, able to make more efficient use of her sails, with no need for crew members to work on her bowsprit during bad weather, and less likely to capsize in heavy seas.|$|E
