40|$|Future fully digital {{surgical}} visualization systems {{enable a}} wide range of new options. Caused by optomechanical limitations a main disadvantage of today’s <b>surgical</b> <b>microscopes</b> is their incapability of providing arbitrary perspectives to more than two observers. In a fully digital microscopic system, multiple arbitrary views can be generated from a 3 D reconstruction. Modern <b>surgical</b> <b>microscopes</b> allow replacing the eyepieces by cameras in order to record stereoscopic videos. A reconstruction from these videos can only contain the amount of detail the recording camera system gathers from the scene. Therefore, covered surfaces can result in a faulty reconstruction for deviating stereoscopic perspectives. By adding cameras recording the object from different angles, additional information of the scene is acquired, allowing to improve the reconstruction. Our approach is to use a fixed four-camera setup as a front-end system to capture enhanced 3 D topography of a pseudo-surgical scene. This experimental setup would provide images for the reconstruction algorithms and generation of multiple observing stereo perspectives. The concept of the designed setup is based on the common main objective (CMO) principle of current <b>surgical</b> <b>microscopes.</b> These systems are well established and optically mature. Furthermore, the CMO principle allows a more compact design and a lowered effort in calibration than cameras with separate optics. Behind the CMO four pupils separate the four channels which are recorded by one camera each. The designed system captures an area of approximately 28 mm × 28 mm with four cameras. Thus, allowing to process images of 6 different stereo perspectives. In order to verify the setup, it is modelled in silico. It can be used in further studies to test algorithms for 3 D reconstruction from up to four perspectives and provide information about the impact of additionally recorded perspectives on the enhancement of a reconstruction...|$|R

50|$|Gradually the {{operating}} microscope {{began to be}} used for ear operations. In the 1950s many otologists began to use it in the fenestration operation, usually to perfect the opening of the fenestra in the lateral semicircular canal. The revival of the stapes mobilization operation by Rosen, in 1953, made the use of the microscope mandatory, although it was not used by the originators of the technique, Kessel (1878), Boucheron (1888) and Miot (1890). Mastoidectomies began to be performed with the <b>surgical</b> <b>microscope</b> and so were the tympanoplasty techniques that became known in the early 1950s.

50|$|Today neurosurgeons {{are very}} proud to use microscopes in their procedures.

50|$|In {{the last}} ten to twenty years, there have been great {{innovations}} in the art and science of root canal therapy.

Many root canal procedures are done in one dental visit which may last for around 1-2 hours. Newer technologies are available (e.g. cone-beam CT scanning) that allow more efficient, scientific measurements to be taken of {{the dimensions of the}} root canal. Many dentists use dental loupes to perform root canal therapy, and the consensus is that root canals performed using loupes, or other forms of magnification (e.g. a <b>surgical</b> <b>microscope),</b> are more likely to succeed than those performed without them.

50|$|Dandy's 1938 {{description}} of surgery for clipping of an intracranial aneurysm {{is particularly important}} because it marked {{the birth of the}} subspecialty of cerebrovascular neurosurgery. An aneurysm is a sac that grows from the wall of an artery in the brain. When an aneurysm ruptures, 50% of patients die immediately and the remaining are similarly expected to die if the aneurysm ruptures again, as it is likely to do. In 1937, a ruptured intracranial aneurysm was a uniformly fatal condition. On March 23, 1937, Dandy performed a frontotemporal craniotomy (which he had learned from Heuer) and placed a hemostatic clip on the neck of a posterior communicating artery region aneurysm arising from the internal carotid artery. The technical prowess involved in carrying out this operation successfully can not be overstated, particularly without the benefit of the <b>surgical</b> <b>microscope</b> for magnification. Even today this type of surgery is arguably the most complex and riskiest procedure done by neurosurgeons. This represented {{the first time that a}} vascular problem of the brain was treated successfully with surgery in a planned fashion. This experience led Dandy in the later part of his career to treat successfully a variety of vascular problems of the brain in addition to aneurysms, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), carotid cavernous fistulas (CCFs), and cavernous malformations. In 1944, two years prior to his death, Dandy published a book entitled Intracranial Arterial Aneurysms in which he summarized his experience with these treacherous and technically formidable lesions. Currently, the Walter E. Dandy Professor of Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, Rafael J. Tamargo http://www.jhu.edu/~voyage/2005/Tamargo.htmhttp://www.neuro.jhmi.edu/profiles/tamargo.html, is a cerebrovascular neurosurgeon and the director of the Division of Cerebrovascular Neurosurgery http://www.neuro.jhmi.edu/cerebro/index.HTML, the field created by Dandy.|$|E

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characters, microsurgery procedure, extent of resection, pathology of MGs, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results. Thirty-eight patients had MGs (10 WHO grade III, 28 WHO grade IV). With YELLOW 560 [*]nm <b>surgical</b> <b>microscope</b> filter combined with neuronavigation, sodium fluorescein-guided gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 35 (92. 1 %) patients and subtotal resection in 3 (7. 69 %).

40|$|Optical {{instruments}} {{have become}} well {{integrated into the}} surgical setting to visualize tissue and improve patient outcome. <b>Surgical</b> <b>microscopes</b> and loupes magnify tissue to help prevent iatrogenic injury and guide delicate surgical techniques. The repair of injured vessels and nerves is necessary to restore sensory and motor function after traumatic injury (1). Although the repair of sensitive structures is performed {{with the aid of}} <b>surgical</b> <b>microscopes</b> and loupes to magnify the surgical field (2), surgeons are limited to the en face view that these devices provide. A technique capable of subsurface, three-dimensional (3 D), micrometer-scale imaging in real-time would permit the intraoperative monitoring of microsurgical procedures, offering immediate feedback to the surgeon and likely improve-ment in patient outcome. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical imaging technology (3) ideally suited for the rapid acquisition of micrometer-scale-resolution two-dimensional (2 D) and 3 D images of biologic tissues such as small vessels and nerves. OCT was first used to image the transparent structures of the human eye (4, 5) and has been used to help diagnose and track various macular diseases in a clinical setting (5, 6). More recently, the use of longer wavelengths, which are absorbed and scattered less in biologic tissue, has permitted imaging in nontransparent tissues (7 - 9), for example, in the preliminary assessment of vessels and nerves (10). OCT is well suited for integration with medical and surgical optical instruments, and imaging has been performed with a radial-imaging, flexible catheter-endoscope (11), as well as a handheld surgical probe and laparoscope (12). Recently, catheter-endoscope-based OCT imaging of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts has been demonstrated in vivo in an animal model (13). OCT can function as a type of "optica...|$|R
