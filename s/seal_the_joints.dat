40|$|Field {{failures}} of high temperature (category 111) plastic venting {{systems have been}} reported in the U. S. and Canada. This report presents the preliminary results of studies conducted at Battelle and CGRI, and includes preliminary recommendations for reducing the potential for failure of plastic Category 111 venting systems. Analysis of failed vent pipe materials indicates that in some installations the pipe and fittings exhibit environmental stress cracking upon exposure to the vent environment and stresses resulting from poor installation practices. The adhesives used to <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> also appear to degrade upon exposure to the vent environment in some installations. Degradation of the adhesive may allow the joints to seperate. Tests indicated that RADEL, the material currently used by vent pipe manufacturers, has a significantly higher resistant to environmental stress cracking than previously used materials when exposed to sulfuric acid, which is present in the vent environment. Also, use of an acid-resistant adhesive with a primer may improve joint durability. Preliminary recommendations include: using the new plastic material for vent pipe and fittings, reducing the residual stresses in the fabricated parts to 300 psi or less, improving the manufacturers' installation instructions to make them easier to use in the field, and continued testing of acid resistant adhesives/sealants to indentify materials that will remain serviceable for the life of the vent system. ...|$|E
40|$|INDOT (as well {{as several}} {{surrounding}} states) have observed that certain concrete pavements may show a susceptibility to joint deterioration. Unfortunately, {{by the time that}} this joint deterioration is observed it is often too late and costly partial depth repairs are needed. The deterioration is generally occurring in the joint behind the backer rod and joint sealant; as such, it is difficult to detect even if one is standing directly above the joint. This project investigated the use of electrical resistivity and ground penetrating radar as two techniques to detect premature joint deterioration. The thought process was that if the joint deterioration is determined at an early stage, low cost corrective actions can be taken to extend the life of the concrete. The electrical response was measured for mortars subjected to a temperature cycle from 23 °C to - 35 °C, with varying degrees of saturation, and varying salt concentrations. The resistivity increased as the degree of saturation was reduced due to the reduction in the volume of the conductive medium and increase in tortuosity. Changes in resistivity were detected when cracking occurred in the sample. The magnitude of these changes was similar to that detected using changes in the ultrasonic wave speed. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used effectively to detect fluid accumulation in the saw-cut joint behind the joint sealant. The typical GPR waveforms are however difficult and time consuming to interpret. A signal processing approach called, referred to as the CID, was used to obtain a single number that reflects the potential for fluid in the joint. Scalar waveform features and the computed CID can be used to estimate which joints may contain fluid thereby providing insights into which joint sealant sections may need to be repaired or when a sufficient number of joints may contain fluid suggesting a larger joint maintenance effort be performed to <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> or the concrete...|$|E

50|$|The O-rings {{were two}} rubber rings that formed a seal between two {{sections}} of the SRBs. The {{sections of the}} boosters were joined using tang and clevis <b>joints</b> and <b>the</b> rings were intended to <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> <b>joint,</b> while allowing for the inevitable movement between the sections under flight conditions. By design, pressure from within the booster was to push a fillet of putty into <b>the</b> <b>joint,</b> forcing <b>the</b> O-ring into its seat. The system never functioned as designed. The rings were supposed {{to sit in a}} groove and <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> between <b>the</b> sections of the booster.

40|$|Stone element {{pavements}} {{constitute a}} typical feature for many artistically valuable urban environments in Italy and Europe. Unfortunately, their deterioration under traffic loads may generate discontinuities in road surfaces compromising ride safety especially for two-wheeled vehicles. Along tramways, due to pumping phenomena, such discontinuities may become remarkable, with local very severe elevation and {{rotation of the}} blocks. Besides a loss of safety for two-wheeled vehicles, other consequences are higher noise and derailment of trams. A complex multibody simulation allowed {{to set up a}} method able to quantify the danger level according to the actual road condition. Classical maintenance of this type of distresses along tramways was shown to be not effective at all, needing continuous repair with high costs and without being able to assure safety for users. In order to improve road safety a new rehabilitation technique of the pavement was developed. Such technique is based on the use of a polyurethane resin (set up in collaboration with chemical partners) able to <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> creating a structural continuity between the stone blocks. As consequence, the blocks are not allowed to locally displace as high stability is reached whereas, in case of permanent deformation of the pavement due to subgrade or foundation, the structural continuity supplied by the resin allows generation of only very long wavelength unevenness, less dangerous for riders respect to local discontinuities. In this way the evolution of unevenness is totally controlled. Since 1999 many laboratory and in situ tests (run in very important and trafficked Milan roads - still under control), enabled to set up and validate the right formulation for the resin and the whole technique. Such technique is now becoming a practice in Milan rehabilitation works of stone pavements. All the experience became also of interest for an international workgroup aimed at studying methods to increase safety of urban roads when tramways are embedded into the pavement. The present paper describes the research and the main results obtained with the aim to transfer acquired experience and knowledge to other Municipalities with face similar safety problems...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{has been}} carried out during the spring of 2017 on behalf of Gavlegårdarna AB. This is a public housing company in Gävle (Sweden) which is a large energy consumer, over 200 million SEK per year, and has the ambitious goal of reduce its energy {{consumption}} by 20 % between 2009 and 2020. Many multi-family apartment blocks were built during the "million programme" in the 60 ’s and 70 ’s when thermal comfort was the priority and not the energy saving. Nevertheless, this perspective has changed and old buildings from that time have been retrofitted lately, but there are many left still. In fact, one of these buildings will be retrofitted in the near future so a valid model is needed to study the energy saving measures to be taken. The aim of this thesis is to get through a calibration process to obtain a reliable and valid model in the building simulation program IDA ICE 4. 7. 1. Once this has been achieved {{it will be possible to}} carry out the building’s energy performance assessment. IDA ICE has shown some limitations in terms of thermal bridges which has accounted for almost 15 % of total transmission heat losses. For this reason, it is important to make a detailed evaluation of certain joints between elements for which heat losses are abundant. COMSOL Multiphysics® finite element software has been used to calculate these transmittances and then use them as input to IDA ICE to carry out the simulation. Through an evidence-based methodology, although with some sources of uncertainty, such as, occupants’ behaviour and air infiltration, a valid model has been obtained getting almost the same energy use for space heating than actual consumption with an error of 4 % (Once the standard value of 4 kWh/m 2 for the estimation of energy use in apartments' airing has been added). The following two values have been introduced to IDA ICE: household electricity and the energy required for heating the measured volume of tap water from 5 °C to 55 °C. Assuming a 16 % of heat losses in the domestic hot water circuit, which means that part of the heat coming from hot water heats up the building. This results in a lower energy supply for heating than the demanded value from IDA ICE. Main heat losses have been through transmission and infiltration or openings. Windows account 11. 4 % of the building's envelope, thus the losses through the windows has supposed more than 50 % of the total transmission losses. Regarding thermal comfort, the simulation shows an average Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) of 12 % in the worst apartment. However, the actual value could be considerably lower since the act of airing the apartments has not been taken into account in the simulation as well as the strong sun's irradiation in summer which can be avoided by windows shading. So, it could be considered an acceptable level of discomfort. To meet the National Board of Housing Building and Planning, (Boverket) requirements for new or rehabilitated buildings, several measures should be taken to improve the average thermal transmittance and reduce the specific energy use. Among the energy saving measures it might be interesting replace the windows to 3 pane glazing, improve the ventilation system to heat recovery unit, <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> and intersections where thermal bridges might be or add more insulation in the building’s envelope...|$|E
