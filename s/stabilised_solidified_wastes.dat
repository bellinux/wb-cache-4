This method simulates the leaching process of the S/S hazardous waste disposed under a particular landfill condition when the S/S waste is more permeable than its surrounding materials or when the deterioration of the <b>solidified</b> <b>waste</b> form has reached a state that ground water can flow-through the waste via the porosity system of the S/S waste matrix. This paper describes a study on the long-term performance of the cement-based S/S heavy metal wastes using a flow-through leaching test method. Two series of leaching tests with different synthetic heavy metal waste samples were carried out. The S/S samples were made from five types of heavy metals with two kinds of binders. The metals were Pb 2 +, Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Ni 2 + (positive ions as nitrates), and Cr 6 + (a negative ion as potassium dichromate), and the binders were type I ordinary portland cement (OPC) and pulverised fuel ash (PFA). The model developed by Godbee and Joy for simulating the leaching behavior was modified to estimate the diffusivity parameter in this study. The results obtained indicate that since the matrix of the <b>solidified</b> <b>waste</b> in a flow-through leaching tests is always being degraded, the values of diffusivities increase continuously during the leaching period.

Results of the ninth year of data acquisition from the field testing are presented and discussed. During the continuing field testing, both portland type I-II cement and Dow vinyl ester-styrene waste forms are being tested in lysimeter arrays located at Argonne National Laboratory-East in Illinois and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The study is designed to provide continuous data on nuclide release and movement, as well as environmental conditions, over a 20 -year period...|$|R
40|$|Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) near Golden, Colorado is {{the first}} major nuclear weapons site within the DOE complex that has been {{declared}} a full closure site. RFETS has been given the challenge of closing the site by 2006. Key to meeting this challenge is the removal of all waste from the site followed by site restoration. Crucial to meeting this challenge is Kaiser-Hill's (RFETS Operating Contractor) ability to dispose of significant quantities of ''orphan'' wastes. Orphan wastes are those with no current disposition for treatment or disposal. Once such waste stream, generically referred to as Transuranic oils, poses a significant threat to meeting the closure schedule. Historically, this waste stream, which consist {{of a variety of}} oil contaminated with a range of organic solvents were treated by simply mixing with Environstone. This treatment method rendered a <b>solidified</b> <b>waste</b> form, but unfortunately not a TRUPACT-II transportable waste. So for the last ten years, RFETS has been accumulating these TRU oils while searching for a non-controversial treatment option...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. An Empirical Partitioning Leach Model (EPLEM), has been developed to describe the leaching of metal contaminants from <b>solidified</b> <b>wastes.</b> The model considers interactions between two components such as hydrogen ion and a metal. The hydrogen ion component in the bath diffuses into the solid to neutralize the high pH of the pore water. As a result, the metal contaminant mobilizes and leaches out from the solid into the bath. Empirical equations are used to describe chemical equilibrium in the model. One equation describes the partitioning of a metal contaminant between mobile and immobile phases in the <b>solidified</b> <b>waste</b> as a function of pH. Two types of partitioning are modeled. One describes reactions that are like precipitation. The other describes reactions that are like sorption. The second equation describes the change of solid phase acid neutralizing capacity (SANC) as a function of pH. This reaction determines pH of the pore water. These equations are combined with an existing diffusive transport model (Batchelor 1997) to make EPLEM. This model assumes that components are transported due to Fickian diffusion with local chemical equilibrium in the porous solid. The dynamic diffusion equation was solved by a modified Crank-Nicholson algorithm. The model has been applied to simulate a laboratory leach test (Monolith Leach Test) that was conducted by Kosson (I 993). The results of the model agree well with the laboratory leach data for copper, chromium, lead and zinc. Little difference was observed between simulations that assumed precipitation-like partitioning or sorption-like partitioning. Sensitivity analysis of four parameters was conducted to evaluate their effects on simulation results, which were expressed as observed investigate contaminant leaching behavior under the infinite bath assumption. Results were compared to experimental data from the Monolith Leach Test, which was conducted in a finite bath with specified leachate renewal frequency. Simulation results indicate that experimental data for Monolith Leach Test did not agree with simulation results of infinite bath condition over long-term period...|$|R
40|$|At the Savannah River Site (SRS), nuclear {{production}} reactors used deionizers {{to control the}} chemistry of the reactor moderator during their operation to produce nuclear materials primarily for the weapons program. These deionizers {{were removed from the}} reactors and stored as a legacy waste with no path to disposal due to the relatively high {sup 14 }C contamination (i. e., on the order of 20 curies per deionizer for 48 - 50 deionizers) and the low disposal limit of 4. 2 Ci previously established for the Intermediate Level Vault (ILV). The ILV is considered most appropriate facility within which to dispose these items due to the method of <b>solidifying</b> <b>waste</b> items with cementitious material inside concrete vaults. In previous analyses the {sup 14 }C ILV disposal limit was established at 4. 2 Ci resulting from the use of a very conservative method to analyze the dose received from atmospheric releases of gaseous {sup 14 }C. This investigation implemented a more rigorous evaluation of the physical and chemical processes influencing the release and migration of gaseous {sup 14 }C (as CO{sub 2 }) to obtain a more realistic estimate of atmospheric dose and to determine new ILV disposal limits...|$|R
