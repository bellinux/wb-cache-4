40|$|The {{present study}} tries to detect whether the {{nonlinear}} variability of human electrocardiographic <b>sinusal</b> R-R intervals exhibits a circadian rhythm (CR). The <b>sinusal</b> R-R intervals {{were provided by}} the Holter ECG of 10 (5 M, 5 F, 23 - 30 years old) clinically healthy volunteers. <b>Sinusal</b> R-R intervals were analysed by measuring the information entropy (E) of their nonlinear variability each hour of the Holter recording. The hourly-qualified E measurements were analysed for CR via a three-component harmonic regression method. Hourly-qualified values of <b>sinusal</b> R-R intervals were seen to exhibit a variability which oscillates with a significant CR. Hourly-qualified values of heart rate (HR) were also seen to show a variability corresponding to a significant CR. Finally, hourly-qualified measurements of E were found to show a variability oscillating with a significant CR. Hourly-qualified measurements of E document that the nonlinear variability of the human <b>sinusal</b> R-R intervals {{is characterized by a}} time structure. The CR of E documents that such a time structure is the expression of a biological rhythm oscillating with a 24 -h period. Accordingly, one can argue that the nyctohemeral variability of human <b>sinusal</b> R-R intervals results from a combination of chaos and periodicity. The chaotic component seems to be periodic, since it is structured in an oscillatory fashion over a 24 -h scale...|$|E

40|$|The aim of rhinosinusitis {{treatment}} is to restore <b>sinusal</b> eutrophism and to normalize ventilation and mucociliary transport. Frequently {{the improvement of}} <b>sinusal</b> physiological conditions {{is associated with a}} reduction of infections and pulmonary symptoms. The treatment of these diseases often requires the combination of medical and surgical strategies. In particular, the aim of the medical therapy is multiple: to treat the infection (with antibiotics), to reduce the mucosal swelling (with corticosteroids) and to improve mucus drainage (with mucolytics or muco-regulators). The use of atomized nasal douche, as a washing of the nasal fossas, is chosen because of its local action minimizing systemic adverse effects. The surgical {{treatment is}} secondary to medical failure, and it is focused on clearing the <b>sinusal</b> ostia in the sphenoethmoidal recess and the osteomeatal complex. In case of recurrent sinonasal diseases the importance of the surgical operation is represented {{by the fact that the}} medical treatment better reaches the target in the <b>sinusal</b> space. This study is focused on the primary medical treatment of acute recurrent rhinosinusitis. The patients who immediately needed surgical treatment were excluded from the study (because of the presence of an anatomical obstruction of the osteomeatal complex and/or the sphenoethmoidal recess, hence non-susceptible to improvement by medical therapy alone), and these patients were immediately addressed to undergo a CT scan examination in order to be involved in a future surgical programme. The medical treatment for those forms which do not require antibiotics (i. e. when infections are not involved), is based on the use of topical corticosteroids. While there are controversies on the real efficacy of adding mucolytic agents to the steroids, they are commonly prescribed in clinical practice, with the rationale of reducing viscosity and improving clearance of mucus in order to help the restoration of the physiological sinus conditions. The primary aim of the medical treatment is to reduce the number of acute episodes and thus to increase the time between the exacerbations, allowing a good quality of life without necessitating surgical procedure...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePurpose: Aerosol {{inhalation}} therapy {{is one of}} the methods to treat rhinosinusitis. However the topical drug delivery to the posterior nose and paranasal sinuses shows only limited efficiency. A precise <b>sinusal</b> targeting remains a main challenge for aerosol treatment of sinus disorders. This paper proposes a comparative study of the nasal deposition patterns of micron and submicron particles using planar gamma-scintigraphy imaging vs. a new 3 -dimensional (3 D) imaging approach based on SPECT-CT measurements. Methods: Radiolabelled nebulizations have been performed on a plastinated model of human nasal cast coupled with a respiratory pump. First, the benefits provided by SPECT-CT imaging were compared with 2 D gamma-scintigraphy and radioactive quantification of maxillary sinus lavage as reference for the sonic 2. 8 μm aerosol <b>sinusal</b> deposition. Then, the impact on nasal deposition of various airborne particle sizes was assessed. Results: The 2 D methodology overestimates aerosol deposition in the maxillary sinuses by a factor 9 whereas the 3 D methodology is in agreement with the maxillary sinus lavage reference methodology. Then with the SPECT-CT approach we highlighted that the higher particle size was mainly deposited in the central nasal cavity contrary to the submicron aerosol particles (33. 8 ± 0. 6 % of total deposition for the 2. 8 μm particles vs. 1 ± 0. 3 % for the 230 nm particles). Conclusion: Benefits of SPECT/CT for the assessment of radiolabelled aerosol deposition in rhinology are clearly demonstrated.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze electrocardiographic {{alterations}} during dental implant surgeries when local anesthetic agents were used. Materials and Methods: Twenty implants were placed in 18 healthy patients. An electrocardiogram and Wincardio software were used to gather recordings from 12 static leads every 2 minutes, continuously record coronary artery (D 2) derivations, and automatically measure the following electrocardiographic parameters: heart rate, duration and amplitude of the P wave, PR segment duration, ST segment deviation, QRS complex duration, and duration of the RR, QT, and corrected QT (QTc) intervals. Results: Analysis of variance of the values obtained at the different stages showed significant differences (P <. 05) for the heart rate and for the duration of the RR and QT intervals. The heart rate increased during the anesthesia, incision, and bone drilling stages, reaching a peak during drilling. Duration of the RR and QT intervals decreased during the incision and drilling stages. Among the electrocardiographic parameters individually assessed, several altered values were found for the duration of the P wave, the QRS complex, and the QT and QTc intervals. <b>Sinusal</b> tachycardia and bradycardia, <b>sinusal</b> arrhythmia, supraventricular extrasystole, ventricular extrasystole, and T-wave inversion were detected. Conclusion: Dental implant placement surgery may induce electrocardiographic alterations. The most frequently found arrhythmias were extrasystole and <b>sinusal</b> tachycardia. The anesthesia, incision, and bone drilling stages exhibited the highest heart rate values and the shortest durations of the RR and QT intervals.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic performance of a traditional imaging staging system for rhinosinusitis in the bone marrow transplantation (BMT) scenario. A retrospective cohort study was carried out at a bone marrow transplantation referral center involving subjects who underwent allogeneic or autologous BMT from September 1 st 2005 to September 31 st 2007 and later evolved with rhinosinusitis during the BMT inpatient period. Patients who had a previous history of <b>sinusal</b> disease or otolaryngologic surgery {{were excluded from the}} study. Data concerning mortality, the treatment of rhinosinusitis and BMT outcomes were extracted from medical files. The collected parameters were compared to the Lund-Mackay tomographic staging system score which was calculated based on available tomography films of each patient. A total of 85 BMT were performed and 23 allogeneic and 14 autologous (43. 5 %) BMT patients evolved with rhinosinusitis during transplantation. A significant association with LMS was found for the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), with a higher ANC (> 500 /mm 3) correlating with a higher LMS (Mean LMS for lower ANC 6. 08 and higher ANC 9. 71 points, p< 0. 05). Need for surgical management and post-BMT admissions, the resolution of the rhinosinusitis and overall mortality had no significant correlation with LMS. Patients with less than 500 neutrophils/mm 3 are known to be prone to more severe infections, but paradoxically showed lower LMS when developing rhinosinusitis. However, there were no differences in the main outcomes between those with higher and lower LMS. This would possibly lead to an equivocal assumption of a less severe disease. Severely neutropenic patients are probably not able to mount an effective inflammatory response capable of inducing significant tomographic abnormalities. So, this imaging study {{would not be able to}} adequately evaluate the extent of <b>sinusal</b> involvement. We thus conclude that LMS is not an adequate staging system to evaluate the severity of BMT <b>sinusal</b> disease. Rev. Bras. Hematol. Hemoter...|$|E

This retrospective study was carried out to assess the most valuable conventional radiologic and CT features in the diagnosis of <b>sinusal</b> and cerebral mycosis infections. The authors reviewed their personal series of 71 patients with malignant hematologic diseases who developed a fungal lesion: twenty-eight cases were selected, 10 of them with an autoptic diagnosis of cerebral fungal lesions and 18 with a bioptic diagnosis of paranasal fungal lesions. In 10 patients with encephalic lesions, CT enabled four main types of tomodensitometric alterations with fungine etiology to be singled out [...] i. e., ischemic lesions, brain abscesses, granulomatoses and meningitis with possible brain parenchyma involvement. In 18 patients with fungal sinusitis, radiography and CT showed three main types of alterations: sinus opacities, pseudocystic images within the sinus and bone erosions.

The following parameters were monitored before administration of anaesthesia (T 0), then after 15 (T 1), and 30 minutes (T 2) : systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure; heart rate; concentration of tele-exhaled carbon dioxide (PetCO 2) and percentage of peripheral saturation of haemoglobin (SPO 2); bleeding according to the Fromme-Boezaart scale at T 2. Mean arterial pressure values were maintained between 60 - 70 mmHg throughout surgery. At T 0, systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure and mean arterial pressure values were seen to overlap in the two groups. Both types of anaesthesia were effective in reducing the pressure values of T 0 -T 1 and T 1 -T 2 trends (p< 0. 0001). Systolic arterial pressure at T 1 is lower with total intravenous anaesthesia compared to isoflurane and fentanyl (p= 0. 02).

It induces blockade of the presynaptic release of acetylcholine causing a decrease in muscle contraction. Three kinds of general complications are reported: flu-like syndrome, fatigue and generalised botulism. Their physiopathological mechanisms are not well known, neither is the mechanism of BT diffusion. Along with this, {{there is evidence of}} retrograde transport of the toxin via the neuron since authors found the toxin, injected in peripheral muscle, in the central nervous system. Moreover, acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter in common for the sensorimotor system and the vegetative system. This retrograde transport is the cause of a motor effect on adjacent muscles to the injected muscle. However, we do not know the impact on the autonomic nervous system of the central location of the toxin. ObjectiveTest the hypothesis of cardiovascular autonomic effects of BT {{injected into}} the peripheral muscle in a population of stroke patients who need spasticity focal treatment. Material and methodsTwenty chronic hemiparetic patients will be tested. Our experimental setting includes: spontaneous baroreflex study, spectral analysis of <b>sinusal</b> variability, Finapres recording of heart rate and blood pressure during Ewing maneuvers, sudoral function with SUDOSCAN. We take these measures the day of injection, then 6 weeks later, which is the peak of TB muscular efficiency and 6 months later. ResultsPreliminary results on 5 spastic hemiparetic patients (mean age= 46, 6 years old; delay time from stroke= 3, 7 years) evaluated the day of injection and 6 weeks later found significant higher HR and BP at rest, without significant differences of <b>sinusal</b> variability nor Ewing score (baroreflex study analysis in process). DiscussionThis pilot study is the first one which analyses the link between autonomic system and BT injected in the skeletal muscle in the context of focal treatment of spasticity in a population of stroke patients...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionTo be {{integrated}} in the Sport and Physical Education Higher Institutes (SPEHI), the student must {{benefit from a}} standard medical assessment. ObjectivesDetermine the frequency of various cardiovascular anomalies and atypical aspects observed in Tunisian students before integration in the SPEHI. Patients and MethodsOur population was constituted of 1077 students (average age 19. 5 years, sex ratio 1. 3), consulted to obtain medical certificate authorizing integration at the SPEHI. ResultsThe clinical examination revealed a functional systolic breath in 26 cases, a mitral regurgitation systolic breath in 4 cases and a pulmonary regurgitation systolic breath in one case. The Electrocardiogram was normal in 761 students. An incomplete Right Bundle-Branch Block in 56 students, a complete RBB in 6 cases, a first-degree Atrio Ventricular Block in 6 case, a <b>sinusal</b> bradycardia in 30 cases, a permanent <b>sinusal</b> tachycardia in 42 cases, a narrow PR interval in 34 cases and Left Ventricular Hypertrophy according to Sokolow index in 18 cases and a repolarisation abnormalities in 19 cases. A Wolff Parkinson White syndrome was detected in 3 students. A cse of asymptomatic induced Brugada syndrome (by Flecaine Test). Other cardiovascular assessments were prescribed in 48 cases: 22 Stress test, 11 rhythmic recording, 3 blood pressure recording, 35 Echocardiography and eletrophysiological exploration in one student. They were all normal except for one case of tiny mitral regurgitation. No anomaly imposing inability of the sporting practice was found, but a medical follow-up is essential, {{particularly in the case}} of Brugada and WPW syndrome. The previous practice of a sport seems to influence the resting heart rate (p =. 0004.), The T amplitude (p = 0. 005), QRS axis (p= 0. 005) and the Sokolow index (p = 0. 01). ConclusionThis study suggests the interest of a systematic medical evaluation in particular cardiovascular assessment before integration at the SPEHI...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the role of MR imaging of {{malignant}} neoplasms through a particular layout that emphasizes: (a) the rationale for the application of imaging; (b) the factors influencing the selection of sequences, planes and their proper arrangement; (c) the correlation between MR findings, imaging staging and clinical decision making. Since in most cases surgery is the treatment of choice, the precise assessment of the local extent and spread of tumour {{plays a key role in}} planning the surgical approach and influences either the therapy and the prognosis. However, the degree of spatial/anatomical detail required in treatment planning significantly differs between surgery and radiotherapy. Planning of the examination technique focuses on: (a) assembling sequences and planes in the shortest time possible; (b) the solution of specific problems: distinction between neoplasm and retained secretions within nasosinusal cavities; staging of submucosal spread toward the anterior cranial fossa, the orbit, the pterygo-palatine and superior orbital fissures. Since the most effective barrier to spread of neoplasms beyond <b>sinusal</b> walls does not depend on the mineral content of bone, but on the periosteum, assessment of the integrity of periorbita or dura mater is an essential information. Although MR cannot detect focal erosions of the thin <b>sinusal</b> walls, it reliably demonstrates both residual barriers (periorbita and dura), even though the bone has been completely destroyed. However, the final decision concerning orbital exenteration is made according to intraoperative staging. MR imaging can accurately precise the degree of anterior cranial fossa involvement. Furthermore, since either MR and CT accurately indicate the need to perform an anterior craniofacial resection and adequately exclude neoplastic invasion requiring orbital exenteration, more comparative studies are required to demonstrate that MR preoperative staging of nasosinusal malignancies is cost-effective...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{presence}} of persistent mild inflammation {{is widely considered}} to provide the immunopathogenic basis for bronchial, nasal, or <b>sinusal</b> inflammation between critical phases and in asymptomatic periods. Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) is currently the most reliable marker of rhinobronchial inflammation, but its routine assessment is difficult as the test is available only in highly specialized centers. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the agreement between a new diagnostic method (extracellular electrical impedance tomography) and immunological and clinical symptom scores, anterior rhinomanometry, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) level, and blood eosinophil count in the clinical monitoring of respiratory tract inflammation before and after treatment of asthma or rhinitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven patients were studied; 73 had mild persistent asthma (PEFR > or = 20...|$|E
40|$|Background. Rehabilitation of edentulous jaws with implant-supported {{prosthesis}} {{has become}} a common practice among oral surgeons {{in the last three}} decades. This therapy presents a very low incidence of complications. One of them is the displacement of dental implants into the maxillary sinus. Dental implants, such as any other foreign body into the maxillary sinus, should be removed in order to prevent sinusitis. Methods. In this paper, we report a case of dental implant migrated in the maxillary sinus and removed by means of the bone lid technique. Results and Conclusion. The migration of dental implants into the maxillary sinus is rarely reported. Migrated implants should be considered for removal in order to prevent possible <b>sinusal</b> diseases. The implant has been removed without any complications, confirming the bone lid technique to be safe and reliable...|$|E
