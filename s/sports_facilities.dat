40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{geographical}} distribution of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Netherlands and evaluates the supply and proximity of such facilities {{in relation to}} area level deprivation and urbanity. In today?s context of financial austerity, many municipalities must critically assess their spending on sport provision. Most government funding to sports goes to construction and maintenance of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities,</b> so there is an increasing need for information and indicators by which to gauge the adequacy of such facilities. The current study draws on sports place theory and the deprivation amplification model to examine the presence, variety and proximity of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Netherlands {{as a whole and}} according to area level deprivation and urbanity. Data were provided by the <b>Sport</b> <b>Facility</b> Monitor, a national dataset offering geographical information on (nearly) all <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Netherlands. These data were linked with population statistics from Statistics Netherlands to allow spatial analyses. Our results indicate that by assessing the distribution of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> in a structured way, relevant information can be obtained for <b>sport</b> <b>facility</b> planning and <b>sport</b> participation policy. Furthermore, our results show that certain standard <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> are fairly evenly distributed throughout the Netherlands, irrespective of the local population size. For more specialised facilities, however, higher population thresholds appear to be required. We conclude that, even though there are inequalities in the distribution of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities,</b> the Netherlands overall provides a sufficiently dense sport infrastructure with various types of facilities offered in close proximity to most inhabitants...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades the {{understanding}} of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> in North America and Europe has changed from governmental responsibility to capital requirement of a private business. This mind-shift has resulted in an increased private share in financing and public-private partnerships in stadium ownership and operation. As professional sport teams are the primary users of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities,</b> a user contribution to the financing is an evident suggestion. Additionally, sport clubs are faced with a variety of real estate decisions. Any corporate real estate decision, however, has to be aligned with the overall business strategy. This strategy alignment is even more mandatory for <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> that differ significantly from other commercial real estate types e. g. in terms of tradability, utilization and risk. This paper takes a new look at <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> and analyses the implications of CRE strategies for the development, financing and management of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> considering their unique characteristics...|$|R
