50|$|Originally an {{agricultural}} area, {{by the late}} 19th Century the main local employer was the coal industry, although brickmaking and some quarrying also took place. Stanley railway station was opened in 1876 by the Great Northern Railway but was renamed West Hallam to avoid confusion with another station on the line. The station closed in 1964 and the last local colliery, the 'Stanley Pit' ended deep <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> in 1959 and closed completely in 1961.|$|E
50|$|The {{village of}} Holmewood was {{formed as a}} {{residence}} by The Williamthorpe Colliery Company from 1905 until 1970, when it closed due to {{the high cost of}} deep <b>seam</b> <b>mining.</b> The colliery was the main employer of the village and upon its closure, caused much unemployment within the area. As a consequence of the Margaret Thatcher Government in the late 1980s, plans were put in place to construct two large industrial estates to limit the high unemployment levels within the ex-colliery communities in the North Derbyshire Area. This industrial estate has now expanded to cover a much larger area and is known as the 'Holmewood Enterprise Zone'. Due to EU Government incentives, the site attracts high levels of investment from national-level companies.|$|E
40|$|Since {{outburst}} threshold limits {{were imposed}} on Bulli <b>seam</b> <b>mines</b> in 1994 {{the occurrence of}} coal and gas outburst incidents have virtually been eliminated from the Australian coal industry. With the reduction in incidents and therefore hazard to the industry {{there has been a}} corresponding drop in research effort in this area. Some mines have in recent years reviewed and raised threshold limit values and non-Bulli <b>seam</b> <b>mines</b> accept the method of threshold limit value determination introduced by GeoGAS, based upon the DRI 900 concept. Detailed analysis of gas desorption data from a variety of Australian coal mines, representing different coal seams with variable gas content, gas composition, rank, type, structure, etc., has been undertaken and the results indicate significant relationships which impact the accepted method of outburst threshold determination. The relationships are discussed and a new method of determining outburst threshold limits, applicable to non-Bulli <b>seam</b> <b>mines</b> is presented...|$|R
50|$|Foxfield was {{extensively}} modernised in the 1930s as all {{production from}} neighbouring Parkhall Colliery {{was moved to}} Foxfield. New coal screens were built and concrete headgears were constructed. The <b>seams</b> <b>mined</b> were the Dilhorne, Four Foot and Woodhead.|$|R
50|$|At peak {{production}} the colliery workforce {{could produce}} up to 33,000 tonnes of coal each year. Individual coal seams {{were used for}} different purposes: the Top Hard Seam {{was one of the}} most famous in the world due to its high commercial value, while the High Hazel <b>Seam,</b> <b>mined</b> from 1956 to 1983, supplied good quality domestic fuel.|$|R
30|$|The {{maximum height}} of the caving zone after No. 11 - 2 seam was mined was 8.0  m or 4 times of mining height, and {{internal}} strata of the caving zone collapsed irregularly. The mining-induced fractures developed 8.0 – 30  m above the mined No. 11 - 2 seam, which was 7.525 times of the <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> height, the fracture zone was about 65 ° upward from the seam open-off cut toward the goaf, the height of longitudinal joint growth was 4 – 20 times of the <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> height, the height of lateral joint growth is 20 – 25 times of the <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> height.|$|E
40|$|Surface mining-induced {{fissures}} {{formed in}} shallow coal <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> have serious impact on safety mining and water resources protection. This paper proposes {{a novel approach}} to study the formation mechanism and dynamic development of surface mining-induced fissures in shallow coal <b>seam</b> <b>mining.</b> This approach combines field tests, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulations based on the geological condition of shallow coal <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> in Chuancao Gedan Coal Mine. Two typical surface mining-induced fissures, step-type fissures and collapse-type fissures, are generated in shallow coal <b>seam</b> <b>mining.</b> The fissures with large vertical throw or horizontal opening severely impact water resource protection and surface ecological environment. Surface mining-induced fissures are generated periodically and changed dynamically with the advancing of working face. The vertical throw and horizontal opening of surface fissures are changed dynamically with the movement of loading key strata. The movement forms of loading key strata determine the morphological development of surface fissures. Downward sliding movement of broken rocks causes step-type fissures, while downward rotation movement leads to collapse-type fissures. The degree of the downward sliding and rotation of broken rocks determines the vertical throw and horizontal opening of surface fissures. This paper proposes mining technologies to reduce damaging ground fissures in shallow coal <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> and analyzes their control effects...|$|E

The theoretical analysis and numerical simulation are adopted to study the break mechanism of the rock layer in steeply dipping seam mining; Through the numerical simulation results shows that the basic features are obtained, which are the biggest stress coefficient, abutment pressure of plastic area, roof weighting step，and convergence between roof and floor in working face．Based on the pressure appearance of the steeply dipping <b>seam</b> <b>mining,</b> control technology is given for the working face support stability, the work equipment prevent tumble and glide，and adjacent rock {{in the period of}} pressure.

The sets of longwall mining technology and equipment had developed for thick coal <b>seams</b> longwall <b>mining</b> with high cutting, super high <b>seam</b> full-mechanized caving <b>mining</b> with high cutting, thin coal seam automated and intelligent mining, and complicated steep dipping seam, which could solve four typical coal <b>seams</b> working faces <b>mining</b> problems with safety supporting, automated mining, high production, high efficiency, and high recovery ratio.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{environmental impacts}} and hazards of coal <b>seam</b> gas <b>mining</b> in Australia are highly contentious and poorly understood. Concerns {{have been raised}} by communities, and the Australian government has incorporated management tools and strategies to address these concerns. The primary environmental issue associated with coal <b>seam</b> gas <b>mining</b> {{would be on the}} aquifers above the target coal seam. If the upper aquifers are affected in terms of quantity and quality, then there are cumulative impacts to the surface environment such as groundwater dependent ecosystems and surface waters. This paper will examine the Australian situation with regard to coal <b>seam</b> gas <b>mining</b> and present a methodology for rapid assessment of the potential impacts and hazards of coal seam gas extraction on aquifers and surface environments. A GIS analysis method for developing broad scale potential impact and hazard criterion for aquifers above the target coal zone are discussed. Current investigations and future research and development opportunities are explored...|$|R
40|$|Consensus on {{protective}} <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> {{technology to}} solve the problems of coal and gas outburst has been reached. For upper protective <b>seam</b> <b>mining,</b> the effect of pressure relief and permeability in the lower protected layers is determined by the distance between the seams. If the distance is small, the effect of pressure relief and permeability on the lower protected seams is better, but there will be more relief gas flows to the working faces of the protective seam, and gas control of the working faces will be more difficult...|$|E
40|$|Protective <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> is a {{major and}} {{critical}} regional measure to prevent coal and gas outbursts (CGO) in coal mines. In this study, a novel method for selecting protective seam against coal and gas outburst was studied {{on the basis of}} gas geology and rock strata control theories and principles for protective <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> and relevant regulations, which is that theories of gas geology were used to assess the outburst risk inherent in different seams of this mine, and then make preliminary selection of protective seams, and the technical feasibility of the proposed selection method was then analyzed using the theories and principles for protective <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> and relevant regulations. The case application study results show that the extraction of the upper protective seam (UPS) caused significant decreases in the predicative indicators of outburst risk in the outburst-prone seam and thereby prevented CGO, and the novel method can provide a theoretical basis for selecting protective seam against CGO...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGiven {{the first}} time for shallow thinner <b>seam</b> <b>mining,</b> this paper resorted to methods of field {{measurement}} and numerical simulation to research overlying strata movement law during shallow thinner <b>seam</b> <b>mining.</b> Through research, it was obtained that 20 m in front of coal wall was the region influenced by mining. In this region, advanced abutment pressure demonstrated law of single elastic. The pressure reached its peak value at coal wall and the fracture of rock beam occurred only in coal wall. When rock beam ruptured, there was no obviously deformation and other pressure behavior in roadway. As distance to coal wall increasing, pressure value was decreasing in rule of negative exponential...|$|E

50|$|High Shincliffe lies on Carboniferous Coal Measures, {{from which}} coal was mined {{for several decades}} during the nineteenth century. As {{elsewhere}} on the Durham coalfield, the principal <b>seam</b> <b>mined</b> was the Hutton Seam, as this was generally of sufficient thickness to make mining economically viable. Several other thinner <b>seams</b> were also <b>mined.</b> The strata dip southwards, and so the Hutton Seam lies at some depth. Moreover, several metres of boulder clay glacial drift is overlying, and is of sufficient depth to prevent any outcropping. Two sand pits can be found towards Shincliffe Village, and whilst of no economic value now, will have had some significance in times past. It can be speculated that these pockets of sand resulted from small rivers outflowing from retreating glaciers {{at the end of}} the last Ice Age about 10,000 years ago. Sand martins build their nests in these sand pits.|$|R
50|$|Vertical zoning in the orebody {{is shown}} by high iron and low {{manganese}} concentrations at the contacts, {{with an increase in}} manganese grade towards the centre of the body. Two <b>seams</b> are <b>mined</b> - the No.1 seam is on average 6 metres thick, with a depth of 400 metres at the N'Chwaning mine and a depth of 200 metres at the Gloria <b>mine.</b> The No.2 <b>seam</b> is stratigraphically placed above the No.1 <b>seam,</b> with ongoing <b>mining</b> using the N'Chwaning II infrastructure.|$|R
40|$|Multiple <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> {{interactions}} {{caused by}} full extraction mining, whether due to undermining or overmining, frequently involve tensile {{failure of the}} affected mine roof. The adverse ground control conditions may prevent mining for both safety and economic reasons. Prior researchers have identified the geometric, geologic and mining factors controlling multiple <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> interactions. This numerical study examines the mechanics of these interactions using a modeling procedure that 1) incorporates the essential constitutive behavior of the rock such as strain-softening of the intact rock and shear and tensile failure along bedding planes and 2) captures the geologic variability of the rock especially the layering of weak and strong rocks and weak bedding planes. Specifically, the numerical study considered the effect of vertical stress, interburden thickness, and the immediate roof quality of the affected seam in both undermining and overmining situations. The models show that for overburden-to-interburden thickness (OB/IB) ratios of less than 5, interactions do not occur, and that for OB/IB more than 50, extreme interaction is a certainty. In between, {{the possibility of an}} interaction was found to depend on gob width-to-interburden thickness ratio, site specific geology and horizontal stress to rock strength ratio in addition to the OB/IB ratio. The models also showed that horizontal stress was profoundly altered well above or below a full extraction area and that these changes are likely to influence {{the success or failure of}} multiple <b>seam</b> <b>mining.</b> The role of horizontal stress in multiple <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> interactions has received little attention in prior investigations. Four factors control the mechanics of multiple <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> interactions: 1. vertical stress concentration 2. horizontal stress concentration 3. stress re-direction 4. bedding plane slip bands A combination of vertical and horizontal stress increase and high stress gradients in the vicinity of full extraction areas re-orients principal stresses into a very unfavorable direction. This seemingly small stress re-orientation has a profound adverse effect on bedded rock...|$|E

Based on the {{instance}} of extremely thick coal <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> under aquifer in Gonggeyingzi Coal Mine, the theoretical calculation for {{the height of}} water flowing fractured zone in this coal mine was 30. 6 m and calculation model was established. Analyzed by the UDEC software, the surface displacement of backfill mining was 1532 mm and the height of overburden rock plastic zone was 36. 5 m. Compared with 135 m away from coal roof to aquifer, slicing backfill mining under aquifer was confirmed {{to be safe and}} feasible based on the theoretical calculation and analysis of UDEC. The results provided the basis for the safety of extremely thick coal <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> under aquifer in this coal mine...|$|E
5000|$|Other {{mines in}} the area {{exploited}} the shallower Sewickley Coal Seam, largely above the river level {{to the north and}} east. Between 1901 and 1913, for example, the Parker Run Coal and Coke Company operated a mine just east of Rivesville, shipping coal by rail and barge. In 1910, this mine employed 60 miners. [...] In 1913, it employed 10 laborers and 25 miners to take 500 tons of coal a day. The coal in this seam was over 6 feet thick, but higher in sulfur than the Pittsburgh <b>seam.</b> <b>Mines</b> in the Sewickley seam were opened earlier and mined out earlier than the mines in the Pittsburgh Seam.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} effects in multi-seam mining depends on many {{factors such as}} local geological and geotechnical conditions, <b>mining</b> depth, <b>seam</b> sequencing, and <b>mining</b> method employed, etc. The paper discusses preliminary study on the {{interaction effects}} in underground mining of double extra-thick coal seams in Mae Moh coalfield in Thailand. The Mae Moh mine is currently operated as open pit mine by EGAT (Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand) {{and it is the}} largest open -pit lignite mine in Thailand. In the near future, the final pit limit of the mine will be reached and underground mining will be commence d from the final highwall in the depth of 400 - 600 m from the surface.

Through research, the important laws and features had been obtained, such as, initial pressure step, periodical pressure step, the obvious partition of periodical weighting, the unitary elasticity distribution of front abutment pressure, and the stress shell morphology over the mining rock, which provides important characteristic for roof control and foundation for the powered support selection...|$|E
40|$|Abutments form {{due to the}} {{redistribution}} of stresses around excavations. In longwall mining, these stresses can redistribute {{in front of the}} longwall panel (front abutment), over the chain pillars and intersections (side abutments) and into the goaf (goaf abutments). Front abutments are a key factor for barrier pillar design and can significantly affect secondary support performance. Front abutments for single <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> operations can be detected using empirical methods, however these methods are not useful for multiple <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> operations. This paper investigates the effects multiple <b>seam</b> <b>mining</b> has on the extent of the front abutment, requiring the secondary support to be installed well ahead of the retreating longwall face. This paper focuses on the examination of longwall abutments by analysing GEL extensometer data in order to identify the point where the total displacement exceeds 3 mm. Preliminary results suggest that the remnant pillars located in upper workings increase the detection distance by 125 % and the goaf abutments in the upper workings decrease the total range by 50 %. The secondary support framework suggests that the bolting advance rate and the longwall retreat rate should be accounted for when determining the lag distance...|$|E
40|$|In China, thin {{coal seam}} {{are rich in}} {{resources}} and complex in conditions, however, the characteristics such as narrow mining space, {{the low level of}} mechanised technology, bad working environment and the high cost of mining, directly restrict the development of mining safety and high-efficiency.

30|$|Within the {{research}} area, those surface water-bearing formations with {{a depth of}} 2 – 15  m are called near-surface aquifer. It can be found through comparing water content profiles (Fig.  4) during coal mining process that the water content of near-surface aquifer before mining (Fig.  4 a) is high, after the coal <b>seam</b> is partly <b>mined</b> (Fig.  4 b), water content decreases, water bearing deteriorates, when the coal <b>seam</b> is completely <b>mined</b> up, water content of zones {{in the back of}} mining point is significantly larger than that of zones in the front due to mining influence. After the coal <b>seam</b> is totally <b>mined,</b> the strata endure deposition stable period and water bearing recovers to the state before mining, which indicates water bearing of near-surface aquifer has obvious recovery trend over time after mining.|$|R
30|$|In modern {{coal mining}} process, water bearing {{property}} of surface formations has self-healing trend. In general, water content of near-surface strata is relatively low before mining, influenced by coal mining, water contents of near-surface formations decrease after the formations begin to loose, after long-term (10  months) recovery, fractures of the near-surface strata become more developed and conductivity increases, fissure water of near-surface strata filtrates downward and water content increases. Influenced by coal mining, resistivity of far-surface aquifer {{increases in the}} mining process, in post-mining deposition stable period, local ground water of the aquifer infiltrates, resistivity decreases, and its water bearing basically recovers to the pre-mining state. Water bearing of coal roof become worse during mining. This indicates that water bearing self-healing capability of near-surface strata is higher, while that of roof strata adjacent to the coal <b>seam</b> <b>mined</b> is lower.|$|R

40|$|Australia is <b>mining</b> {{at greater}} <b>seam</b> {{thicknesses}} than most similar western countries {{and particularly the}} US. The approaches developed by other countries and previous research and innovation are not necessarily directly transferable. Furthermore, the increasing scale of production in thick seam longwalls challenges the maintenance of safe and healthy face environments in Australian collieries. High production rates, longer faces and higher ventilation quantities and velocities further exacerbate dustiness. An ACARP funded scoping study has been undertaken to examine dust problems that are being faced by Australian thick <b>seam</b> longwall <b>mine</b> operators, evaluate options and recommend priorities for improvement. The study involved a number of stages. A detailed survey of six Australian thick <b>seam</b> <b>mine</b> operators to identify individual mine issues was undertaken.

40|$|The 1994 {{outburst}} threshold limits {{imposed on}} coal mines {{operating in the}} Bulli seam were lower than the conservative value proposed by Lama in 1991. Equally conservative is the DRI 900 method for outburst threshold limit determination. A number of mines have encountered areas {{where it has been}} difficult, if not impossible, to reduce the seam gas to below the prescribed threshold limit prior to the arrival of roadway development machinery, despite extensive inseam gas drainage. In such situations these mines can experience lengthy production delays or even loss of reserves. Several Bulli <b>seam</b> <b>mines</b> have completed reviews of their outburst risk management which led to increasing their threshold limits. These mines have been operating safely, without outburst, for some four years. The method of determining the outburst threshold limits applicable to non-Bulli <b>seam</b> coal <b>mines</b> also hold a high degree of conservatism which is discussed. The need for re-appraisal of the threshold limits undertaken is reported, based on the further data analysis. The process of gas desorption methodology and the optimum gas content is one particular aspect of this study as it has a clear influence on the established values of the recognised threshold limits. The study has demonstrated that there is justification to increase the operating threshold limits to values of 12 m 3 /t for 100 % CH 4 and 8 m 3 /t for 100 % CO 2.
