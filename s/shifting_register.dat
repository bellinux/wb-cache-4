40|$|Register {{windowing}} {{has become}} a common sight in high speed processors, reducing the memory traffic required to preserve register contents over subroutine invocations. However, approaches to register windowing have changed little since their introduction. In this article, the current windowing schemes (namely fixed-sized and variable-sized) are pre-sented, along with methods of implementation. A number of disadvantages with these systems are identified, and the requirements for an improved register windowing mechanism defined. A new register windowing paradigm is presented, known as <b>Shifting</b> <b>Register</b> Windows, {{which is designed to}} meet these requirements. This windowing system is first given in overview, followed by a more de-tailed description of the underlying model. Finally, a performance analysis of the model is presented, and conclusions drawn on speed and efficiency. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{multiplier}} {{is one of}} the key hardware {{blocks in}} most digital and high performance systems such as FIR filters, digital signal processors and microprocessors etc. With advances in technology, many researchers have tried and are trying to design multipliers which offer either of the following- high speed, low power consumption, regularity of layout and hence less area or even combination of them in multiplier. The architecture considerably lowers the switching activity of conventional multipliers. The modification to the multiplier which multiplies A by B Include the removal of the <b>shifting</b> <b>register,</b> direct feeding of A to the adder, bypassing the adder whenever possible, using a ring counter instead of a binary counter and removal of the partial product shift. The simulation result for 8 bit multipliers shows that the proposed low power architecture lowers the total power consumption by 35. 25 % and area by 52. 72 % when compared to the conventional architecture. Also the reduction in power consumption increases with the increase in bit width...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this brief, an {{efficient}} technique for implementation of soft-error-tolerant <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> is presented. The proposed technique uses two implementations {{of the basic}} registers with different structures operating in parallel. A soft error occurring in either <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> causes the outputs of the <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> to differ, or mismatch, {{for at least one}} sample. The <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> are specifically designed so that, when a soft error occurs, they produce distinct error patterns at the <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> output. An error detection circuit monitors the basic <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> outputs and identifies any mismatches. An error correction circuit determines which <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> is in error based on the mismatch pattern and selects the error-free <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> result as the output of the overall error-protected system. This technique is referred to as structural dual modular redundancy (DMR) since it enhances traditional DMR to provide error correction, as well as error detection, by means of <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> modules with different structures. The proposed technique has been implemented and evaluated. The system achieves a soft error correction rate of close to 100 % for isolated single soft errors and has a logic complexity significantly less than that of conventional triple modular redundancy. This is achieved using a Cadence 180 nm CMOS technology. Index Terms—Dual modular redundancy (DMR), <b>shift</b> <b>registers,</b> finite impulse response (FIR), soft errors...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} multi-message authentication to combat adversaries with infinite computational capacity. An authentication framework over a wiretap channel (W_ 1,W_ 2) is proposed to achieve information-theoretic security {{with the same}} key. The proposed framework bridges the two research areas in physical (PHY) layer security: secure transmission and message authentication. Specifically, the sender Alice first transmits message M to the receiver Bob over (W_ 1,W_ 2) with an error correction code; then Alice employs a hash function (i. e., ε-AWU_ 2 hash functions) to generate a message tag S of message M using key K, and encodes S to a codeword X^n by leveraging an existing strongly secure channel coding with exponentially small (in code length n) average probability of error; finally, Alice sends X^n over (W_ 1,W_ 2) to Bob who authenticates the received messages. We develop a theorem regarding the requirements/conditions for the authentication framework to be information-theoretic secure for authenticating a polynomial number of messages in terms of n. Based on this theorem, we propose an authentication protocol that can guarantee the security requirements, and prove its authentication rate can approach infinity when n goes to infinity. Furthermore, we design and implement an efficient and feasible authentication protocol over binary symmetric wiretap channel (BSWC) by using Linear Feedback <b>Shifting</b> <b>Register</b> based (LFSR-based) hash functions and strong secure polar code. Through extensive experiments, it is demonstrated that the proposed protocol can achieve low time cost, high authentication rate, and low authentication error rate.
