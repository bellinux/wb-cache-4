5|$|A {{more recent}} {{critical}} review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 {{to explain this}} shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst {{at the same time}} offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not <b>stepped</b> in the hold/keelson, but instead was <b>stepped</b> in the lower deck 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the water line. Whereas the shorter mizzen <b>stepped</b> in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen <b>stepped</b> in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if <b>stepped</b> in the hold.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} phase {{transitions in}} a solid-on-solid model where double-height <b>steps</b> {{as well as}} single-height <b>steps</b> are allowed. Without the double-height <b>steps,</b> repulsive interactions between up-up or down-down <b>step</b> pairs {{give rise to a}} disordered flat phase. When the double-height <b>steps</b> are allowed, two single-height <b>steps</b> can merge into a double-height <b>step</b> (<b>step</b> doubling). We find that the <b>step</b> doubling reduces repulsive interaction strength between single-height <b>steps</b> and that the disordered flat phase is suppressed. As a control parameter a <b>step</b> doubling energy is introduced, which is assigned to each <b>step</b> doubling vertex. From transfer matrix type finite-size-scaling studies of interface free energies, we obtain the phase diagram in the parameter space of the <b>step</b> energy, the interaction energy, and the <b>step</b> doubling energy.
