500|$|Either/Or {{established}} Kierkegaard's {{reputation as}} a respected author. Henriette Wulff, {{in a letter to}} Hans Christian Andersen, wrote, [...] "Recently a book was published here with the title Either/Or! It is supposed to be quite strange, the first part full of Don Juanism, skepticism, et cetera, and the second part toned down and conciliating, ending with a sermon that is said to be quite excellent. The whole book attracted much attention. It has not yet been discussed publicly by anyone, but it <b>surely</b> <b>will</b> be. It is actually supposed to be by a Kierkegaard who has adopted a pseudonym...." ...|$|E

Pratt's son, Charles Millard Pratt, became Secretary of Standard Oil. For many of his competitors, Rockefeller had merely to show them his books so they could see what they were up against and make them a decent offer. If they refused his offer, he told them he would run them into bankruptcy and then cheaply buy up their assets at auction. But this was not intended to eliminate competition entirely. In fact, his partner Pratt said of that accusation [...] "Competitors we must have...if we absorb them, it <b>surely</b> <b>will</b> bring up another." ...|$|E

[...] AOL's The Boot also liked the video, writing, [...] "If the storyline itself doesn't make you fall head over heels, the gorgeous scenery <b>surely</b> <b>will,</b> as the clip was shot in various picturesque places around the world." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Taste of Country noted that the video was [...] "heart-pinching". The Tennessean wrote that the [...] "sweet sentimentality should score with fans of ... 'Need You Now'." [...] However, Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed the video [...] "sugary". Robbie Daw of Idolator wrote, [...] "Lady A's [...] "Just A Kiss" [...] video got us choked up after one viewing.

500|$|The {{ceremony}} was opened by Dobriansky {{followed by a}} rendition of the U.S. national anthem, [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". [...] Senyshyn then read the invocation in English and Ukrainian and Roman Smal-Stocki, president of the memorial committee, spoke {{about the significance of}} the monument. [...] Perhaps the most prominent attendee was former U.S. President Eisenhower, who was chosen to unveil the statue. [...] Before he did so, Eisenhower was cheered for several minutes as the crowd chanted [...] "We Like Ike!" [...] Following a 12-minute speech, Eisenhower unveiled the statue, calling Shevchenko a Ukrainian hero and stated: [...] "For my hope is that your magnificent march from the shadow of the Washington Monument {{to the foot of the}} statue of Shevchenko will here kindle a new world movement in the hearts, minds, words and actions of men; a never-ending movement dedicated to the independence and freedom of peoples of all captive nations of the entire world." [...] He also said the statue represented [...] "millions of oppressed" [...] in Eastern Europe and [...] "gives them constant encouragement to struggle forever against Communist tyranny, until, one day final victory is achieved, as it most <b>surely</b> <b>will</b> be." [...] Following the unveiling, the Ukrainian Choral Societies of America led the crowd in a musical rendition of Shevchenko's poem [...] [...] Additional speeches were then made by several U.S. Representatives and Archbishop Ioan Theodorovych of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church gave the benediction. [...] The ceremony concluded with the crowd singing Ukraine's national anthem, Shche ne vmerla Ukraina (English: Ukraine Has Not Yet Died).|$|E
2500|$|Lastly, private {{organizations}} such as Mercy Corps and WWF has begun to address the crisis in terms of fuelwood caused deforestation by introducing fuelwood plantations {{as well as provide}} training for rural people to build fuel efficient cooking stoves. [...] While these efforts <b>surely</b> <b>will</b> help, they are by no means a solution to the problem. [...] With citizens so dependent on fuelwood and charcoal for their energy basic needs (i.e. cooking) and livelihood, until the country is able to provide citizens with alternative sources of energy (i.e. electricity and alternative jobs)the situation will likely not improve.|$|E
2500|$|This was reaffirmed by the {{national}} Left Bloc deputy Lu√≠s Fazenda who indicated {{that the loss of}} the parties aligned with {{the national}} government, served to indicate the unpopularity of the national government's policies on austerity, reiterating that [...] "it should make the Prime Minister rethink [...] because this is the first today of several defeats that [...] <b>surely</b> <b>will</b> face...". [...] Following her party's loss of one of their two seats, Zuraida Soares indicated that election resulted in a more bi-polarized concentration in the two mainline parties (PS and PSD), and that her party would continue to [...] "criticise, combat and vote on issues proposal-by-proposal", even as she hoped that the PS government would continue to defend Azorean autonomy and minimize the effects of the Troika.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of May 9, Karolina was calmer and gave an {{interview}} upon returning home. Surrounded by friends and neighbors she told reporters, [...] "Before the doctors found that Elsie's lungs were free from water and discovered reasons for believing she had been strangled, I knew she had been murdered. A picture of the crime has been in my mind since {{the second week of}} her disappearance, and I am convinced that when the truth is known, as it <b>surely</b> <b>will</b> be, it will be shown that she was choked to death a week from April 8 when she was kidnapped on her way to visit her 'auntie.'"

2500|$|After the {{collision}} with the iceberg at 11:40 pm on 14 April 1912, Navratil placed Michel and Edmond in Collapsible D, the last lifeboat successfully launched from the ship. Michel, although not quite {{four years old}} at the time, later claimed to remember his father telling him, [...] "My child, when your mother comes for you, as she <b>surely</b> <b>will,</b> tell her that I loved her dearly and still do. Tell her I expected her to follow us, so that we might all live happily together in the peace and freedom of the New World." [...] The elder Navratil died in the sinking, and his body was recovered by the rescue ship, Mackay-Bennett. In his pocket was a revolver. Because of his assumed Jewish surname, he was buried in Baron de Hirsch Cemetery, Halifax, a Jewish cemetery in Nova Scotia.|$|E
2500|$|The Hungarians, however, were {{repeatedly}} {{defeated by}} the Romanians. By the middle of July 1919, Hungary had begun a major offensive against the Romanian invasion. The Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esperey, wrote to Marshal Ferdinand Foch on 21 July 1919: [...] "We {{are convinced that the}} Hungarian offensive will collapse of its own accord... When the Hungarian offensive is launched, we shall retreat to the line of demarcation and launch the counteroffensive from that line. Two Romanian brigades will march from Romania to the front in the coming days, according to General Fertianu's promise. You see, Marshal, we have nothing to fear from the Hungarian army. I can assure you that the Hungarian Soviets will last no {{more than two or three}} weeks. And should our offensive not bring the Kun regime down, its untenable internal situation <b>surely</b> <b>will.</b>|$|E

2500|$|This {{conclusion}} {{on human}} unity {{was supported by}} monogenism, including John Bachman's evidence that intercrossed human races were fully fertile. Proponents of polygenism opposed unity, but the gradual transition from one race to another confused them {{when they tried to}} decide how many human races should count as species: Louis Agassiz said eight, but Morton said twenty-two. Darwin commented that the [...] "question whether mankind consists of one or several species has of late years been much agitated by anthropologists, who are divided into two schools of monogenists and polygenists." [...] The latter had to [...] "look at species either as separate creations or as in some manner distinct entities". but those accepting evolution [...] "will feel no doubt that all the races of man are descended from a single primitive stock". Although races differed considerably, they also shared so many features [...] "that it is extremely improbable that they should have been independently acquired by aboriginally distinct species or races." [...] He drew on his memories of Jemmy Button and John Edmonstone to emphasise [...] "the numerous points of mental similarity between the most distinct races of man. The American aborigines, Negroes and Europeans differ as much from each other in mind as any three races that can be named; yet I was incessantly struck, whilst living with the Fuegians on board the Beagle, with the many little traits of character, shewing how similar their minds were to ours; and so it was with a full-blooded negro with whom I happened once to be intimate." [...] Darwin concluded that [...] "...when the principles of evolution are generally accepted, as they <b>surely</b> <b>will</b> be before long, the dispute between the monogenists and the polygenists will die a silent and unobserved death." ...|$|E
