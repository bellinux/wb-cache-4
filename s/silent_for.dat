5|$|Dhumavati's worship is {{performed}} in {{the night in a}} cremation ground, bare-bodied {{with the exception of a}} loincloth. The fourth lunar day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) is considered the special day to perform her puja (worship). The worshipper should observe a fast and remain <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> a whole day and night. They should also perform a homa ("fire sacrifice"), wearing wet clothes and a turban, repeating the goddess' mantra in a cremation ground, forest, or any lonely place.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, William Fitz Osbern gave a fiery speech {{against the}} oppression of the poor at Paul's Cross and incited a riot which saw the cathedral invaded, halted only by an appeal for calm by Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury. Osbern barricaded himself in nearby St Mary-le-Bow and was later executed, after which Paul's Cross was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> many years.|$|E
5|$|After {{stepping}} down as chairman, he was unanimously elected to an honorary position of president, a role he kept until 1894, {{and was named}} the first-ever life member of the League in 1895. The role {{was that of a}} figurehead with little actual authority, but he was used as a mediator to resolve league disagreements. In {{the second half of the}} decade McGregor's failure to attend many committee meetings led to criticism from John Bentley, his successor as president. Bentley's criticism achieved the desired effect; from 1899 until his health deteriorated in 1910, McGregor seldom missed a meeting. During this period McGregor was noted for his reserved nature. He was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> large parts of committee meetings, but would contribute enthusiastically on the occasions he felt his input was necessary.|$|E

5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E
5|$|In week five, on Day 33, Big Brother punished Charlie for {{discussing}} nominations, {{telling him}} to remain <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of the}} day or else face the public vote. Later, Dogface and Kris were similarly punished, also for discussing nominations. All three failed to keep quiet and faced the public vote, along with Halfwit and Marcus, who received the most nominations. On Day 35, the housemates failed the circus-themed shopping task and received a basic shopping budget. On Day 37, Kris became the sixth person to be evicted from the House with 63.0% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty-two Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested. Between 23 November and 26 December 1952, ninety-five {{soldiers}} were court martialed and tried by General Court-Martial in fifteen separate trials. Ninety-one {{were found guilty}} and sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass court-martial of the Korean War. According to cultural historian Silvia Álvarez Curbelo, the government of Puerto Rico, {{caught in the middle}} of a potentially damaging affair that could jeopardize its political agenda, kept <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> nearly two months. Finally, the incidents were made known by a local newspaper alerted by several letters written by the imprisoned soldiers to their families. Secret negotiations between the U.S. and Puerto Rican governments took place and the Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens moved quickly to remit the sentences and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved.|$|E

In {{the event that the}} aircraft ACARS unit has been <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> longer than a preset time interval, the ground station can ping the aircraft (directly or via satellite). A ping response indicates a healthy ACARS communication.|$|E

25|$|Sketches of {{information}} on the older organ are available mostly through personal accounts. An elderly parishioner recounted helping out on Sundays as a young boy by operating the manual air pump of the organ. By the 1960s, the Gallery Organ became so dilapidated that it remained <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> nearly two decades.|$|E
25|$|Acute accents are {{sometimes}} added to loanwords where a final e is not <b>silent,</b> <b>for</b> example, maté from Spanish mate, the Maldivian capital Malé, saké, and Pokémon from the Japanese compound for pocket monster, {{the last three}} from languages which do not use the Roman alphabet, and where transcriptions do not normally use acute accents.|$|E
25|$|Comparisons {{have also}} been drawn with Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, for the {{presence}} of two central characters who almost appear to be two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing Questions, impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> long periods of time.|$|E

25|$|Fans honored Earnhardt {{by holding}} three fingers aloft {{on the third}} lap of every NASCAR Winston Cup race. Meanwhile, NASCAR's {{television}} partners also went <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> the third lap, a practice that was repeated until the 2002 race at Rockingham, and in the 2011 Daytona 500, ten years after his death. Later in 2001, some of these gestures were also done in remembrance {{of the victims of}} the September 11 attacks.|$|E
25|$|The {{wings are}} short but strong, with the wing muscle ratio being around 22% {{of the body}} weight. In spite of the {{strength}} of their flight, trogons do not fly often or for great distances, generally flying {{no more than a few}} hundred metres at a time. Only the montane species tend to make long distance flights. Shorter flights tend to be direct and swift, but longer flights are slightly undulating. Their flight can be surprisingly <b>silent</b> (<b>for</b> observers), although that of a few species is reportedly quite noisy.|$|E

25|$|On August 10, 2005, Pirro {{announced}} she would seek the Republican nomination to challenge first-term incumbent senator Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, in the 2006 election for U.S. Senator from New York. Other Republicans who announced campaigns {{for the nomination}} were John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers, William Brenner, an attorney in Sullivan County, and attorney Edward Cox, the son-in-law of former president Richard Nixon. In a widely publicized moment when she was declaring her candidacy, Pirro misplaced page 10 of her speech and went <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> 32 seconds, something that is widely considered to have damaged her campaign before it even started.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln Cathedral {{reportedly}} received £100,000 {{in exchange}} for the right to film there, with filming there occurring between August 15 and 19, 2005, mainly within the cloisters of the cathedral. The cathedral's bell, which strikes the hour, was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> the first time since World War II during that time. Although it remained a closed set, protesters led by a 61-year-old woman named Sister Mary Michael demonstrated against the filming. Sister Mary Michael spent 12 hours praying on her knees outside the cathedral in protest against what she saw as the blasphemous use of a holy place to film a book containing heresy.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of the {{regulation}} of gene expression through chemical, non-mutational changes in DNA structure. The theory of epigenetics in cancer pathogenesis is that non-mutational changes to DNA can lead to alterations in gene expression. Normally, oncogenes are <b>silent,</b> <b>for</b> example, because of DNA methylation. Loss of that methylation can induce the aberrant expression of oncogenes, leading to cancer pathogenesis. Known mechanisms of epigenetic change include DNA methylation, and methylation or acetylation of histone proteins bound to chromosomal DNA at specific locations. Classes of medications, known as HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, can re-regulate the epigenetic signaling in the cancer cell.|$|E
