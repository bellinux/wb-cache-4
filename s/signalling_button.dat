50|$|The {{multi-mode}} switch {{consists of}} three settings: Off, Signal, and On. When the switch is set to Signal, the user is able to press and hold a button located just above the switch to turn the light on, and it will switch off again when the button is released. This allows users to signal using Morse code. When the switch is moved up to the On position, the flashlight remains on without any further user interaction. The modern MX-991/U also features a switch guard which was not present in previous variants as issued in the Vietnam War. The switch guard was suggested as an improvement from soldiers during the war, and later added to prevent unintentional operation of the flashlight. This helped to prevent soldiers from accidentally giving their position away in the dark should equipment, clothing etc press the <b>signal</b> <b>button</b> or move the switch.|$|R

Evidence has begun to accumulate that traumatic experiences are physically and psychologically unhealthy. A victim of child sexual abuse is often reluctant to disclose the abuse experiences and may cope by suppressing thoughts about the abuse. Studies have shown that thought suppression correlates with increased skin conductance in the short-term and with physical and psychological symptom reporting in the long-term. The link between non-disclosure of child sexual abuse, physiological reactivity to intrusive thoughts about the abuse, and long-term health was investigated in two phases. During Phase One, 802 university women completed a series of self-report measures that assessed childhood sexual experiences, intrusive cognitions, parental support, and physical and psychological health. Abuse subjects also wrote a description of their abuse experiences. Eighteen women who reported child sexual abuse experiences, no adult rape, and no past disclosure of their abuse were matched with 18 abused disclosers and 18 non-abused controls on age, ethnic status, and education. Non-disclosers were predicted to report more intrusive thoughts, be more physiologically reactive to their intrusive thoughts, and to report more health problems. During Phase two, skin conductance levels (SCL) were continuously measured while subjects pressed a <b>signal</b> <b>button</b> under three conditions: (1) randomly, (2) when they experienced intrusive thoughts about a white bear while attempting to suppress thoughts about white bears, and (3) when they experienced intrusive child sexual abuse thoughts while attempting to suppress these thoughts. Non-disclosers did not differ from disclosers in number of intrusive thoughts, avoidance behaviors, or emotional reactions to intrusive thoughts. Abuse severity was a better predictor of these behaviors. There were no differences between non-disclosers and disclosers in number and magnitude of SCL responses to intrusive thoughts about white bears or child sexual abuse experiences. For both abused groups, intrusive thoughts about child sexual abuse were significantly less arousing than intrusive thoughts about white bears or randomly pressing the <b>signal</b> <b>button.</b> There were no differences between the three groups in long-term health. Overall, non-disclosure of child sexual abuse had no impact on physiological responses in the short-term nor did it correlate with health problems in the long-term...|$|R
50|$|Events are {{organized}} into Classes. A class {{is a collection}} of events that somehow belong together. There are classes for ALARM, MEASUREMENTS, CONTROL, INFORMATION, etc. Currently VSCP specifies about 25 classes, but has room for many more 1. Each class is on its turn subdivided into types. A type further specifies the event within the class. For instance, events of Class 20 (0x14) are INFORMATION events. In this class there is a subtype 1 (0x01) <b>BUTTON</b> <b>signaling</b> a <b>button</b> being pressed. In this same INFORMATION class there are also types to signal ON, OFF, BELOW LIMIT, etc. Likewise in class measurements there are types to signal temperature, current, voltage, etc. Having all these classes and types defined makes the nodes speak the same language.

40|$|BACKGROUND: One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} features of psychopathy is the reduced ability to successfully learn and adapt overt behavior. This {{might be due to}} deficient processing of error information indicating the need to adapt controlled behavior. METHODS: Event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral components of error-monitoring processes were investigated in 16 individuals with psychopathy and in 18 healthy subjects. A letter version of the Eriksen flanker task was used in two conditions. The first condition (normal condition) required participants to press one of two buttons depending on the identity of the target stimulus. The second condition (signaling condition) required them to signal each time they had committed an error by making a second press on a <b>signaling</b> <b>button.</b> Early stages of error monitoring were investigated by using the error-related negativity (ERN/Ne) and post-error slowing as indexes. Later stages were explored by examining the error positivity (Pe) and signaling rates. RESULTS: Both groups showed similar ERN amplitudes and amounts of post-error slowing. The psychopathic group exhibited both reduced Pe amplitudes and diminished error-signaling rates compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with psychopathy show intact early error processing and automatic behavioral adaptation but have deficits in later stages of error processing and controlled behavioral adaptation. This is an indication that individuals with psychopathy are unable to effectively use error information to change their behavior adequately...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} a {{question}} of debate whether immediate error corrections in speeded forced-choice reaction time tasks require an error detection signal from the performance monitoring system or whether they reflect delayed correct responses that are executed after the premature error like in a horserace. In contrast, signaling the error by pressing a response button that is unrelated to the primary task is based on error detection. The present study investigates {{the similarities and differences}} between immediate error corrections and signaling responses by means of behavioral and event-related potential data. In a within-subject design, participants performed two sessions of the flanker task. In one session, errors had to be corrected by immediately pressing the correct response, in the other session, errors had to be signaled by pressing an error <b>signaling</b> <b>button.</b> Compared to the signaling session, in the correction session, more errors and error corrections were made, reaction times were shorter, and the amplitude of the error-related negativity (ERN) was reduced. Whereas the error significance did not seem to differ across session, participants have most likely reduced the motor threshold in the correction session to enable efficient immediate corrections. This interpretation is supported by the lateralized readiness potentials and is consistent with the response conflict monitoring hypothesis of the ERN. The present study demonstrates that differences in error corrections may be attributable to differences in motor threshold. We conclude that the error signaling procedure is a more direct and reliable way to behaviorally test the functional integrity of the performance monitoring system than the instruction to correct errors. The consequences for studies in patients and with pharmacological challenges are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Complex <b>signals</b> {{with the}} <b>button</b> {{ambiguity}} function {{can provide the}} distance and speed of target independent estimation. The signal with the symmetrical linear frequency modulation has this property {{in the class of}} signal with frequency modulation. Problem statement: To show that in the class of signals frequency-shift is <b>signal</b> with <b>button</b> ambiguity function. Such signal is a signal with the quadratic frequency intra-modulation. The potential characteristics research of signal with the quadratic frequency intra-modulation: The signal with quadratic frequency modulation and its properties are considered, analytic form of signal and its spectrum are shown, figures of amplitude spectra of signal are drawn, and figures of ambiguity diagram, crosscorrelation functions and response ambiguity function in strong and weak fields are shown. The comparison of the signal with the quadratic frequency intramodulation and the signal with the symmetrical linear frequency modulation are shown. The result of research is that the ambiguity function form of a signal with the quadratic frequency intramodulation comes nearer to button in the strong correlation field and it has X ? for min the weak correlation field. The autocorrelation function of the signal with the quadratic frequency intra-modulation has some constant level which decreases with signal base increasing. It is revealed that autocorrelation function of the signalhas no side lobes. It improves resolution capability of a weak signal against the strong signal. The pedestal level of the autocorrelation function of this signal is a little lower than pedestal level of the autocorrelation function of the signal with the symmetrical linear frequency modulation. Properties of section of crosscorrelation function to two peaks and effect of these properties are considered. Signals with the quadratic frequency intramodulation are expedient for using in the sonar of submarines, because in case of submarines detection the case of multiple targets existence is the improbable. Conclusions: Conclusions about advantages and disadvantages of this signal are pre-sented. The advantages are as follows: the autocorrelation function and the cross-correlation function of the signal with the quadratic frequency intra-modulation have no side lobes. The pedestal level of the autocorrelation function has level of smaller 0. 1 for a signal with base 50. The cross-correlation function width feebly depends on speed of the target. The disadvantages are as follows: the direction of target movement can't be understood. It is compensated by existence of prior information about the target direction. ?????????? ?????? ? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ??? ???????????, ????????? ????????????? ?????? ??????? ? ??? ???????, ??????? ???????????? ??????? ???????? ? ?????? ?????, ????????? ??????? ????????????????, ??????? ????????????????????? ??????? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????????? ? ??????? ??????? ? ?????? ??????????. ??????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????????????????? ??????? ?? ??? ???? ? ??????????? ????? ???????. ????????? ????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ? ???????????? ???????? ??????????. ??????? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ???????, ??????? ?????? ?????? ???????????????? ? ??????? ????????????? ???????...|$|R

The complication of the multichannel locations highways realization of echo signal as the multichannel Doppler-beat frequency highway on the base of matched filters or correlators is estimated. The block diagrams analysis result testifies that the realization of the multichannel Doppler-beat frequency correlator is technically more difficult. In this scheme there is the difficult block with the formation of a probing signal with parallel releases of the so-called Doppler copies. Conclusions: The number of the Doppler channels in the radar locations highway determined by maximum target velocity by the falling possible level of the noise immunity and of the distance resolution and the range rate resolution of probing signal that is used. The use of the considered complicated signals any types provides the identical number of processing channels. The use of the signal with pseudorandom sequence supports the high time security, the high power security and the high structural security. ???????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?? ????????? ? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ? ???????????? ???????? ????????? ??????????, ???????????, ???????????????, ????????????, ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ??????????????? ????????. ??????? ?????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????????? ??????? ???????? ? ????????? ?????????? ????????????????. ??????????? ???????????? ??? ??????????? ????? ???????????? ???????. ??????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ? ???? ??????????????? ?? ???????????? ??????? ?????? ?? ???? ????????????? ???????? ??? ???????????? ? ??????????????? ??????????????? ??????????? ????...|$|R

The potential characteristics of 2 nd degree, 3 d degree and 4 th degree frequency modulated probing signals are analyzed and compared. Investigation of potential characteristics of 3 d degree and 4 th degree frequency modulated probing signals. Features of 2 nd degree, 3 d degree and 4 th degree frequency modulated probing signals are considered. Comparison of these signals autocorrelation functions is held.

Comparison of potential range resolutions and potential resolutions of these signals speed are conducted. Dependence of the probing signals potential characteristics increasing the intra-frequency modulation degree is investigated. Conclusions. Increasing the degree of frequency modulated does not result to a substantial increase in peak splitting cross-correlation function. Level pedestal signal grows and potential resolutions range of signals worsen with increasing degree of frequency modulated. Potential resolutions of signals speed are not changing increasing degree of frequency moduated. ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ? ????????? ?????????? ??????, ??????? ? ????????? ???????. ??????? ????????? ?????????????????? ??????? ???? ????????. ??????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????????????????? ??????? ?? ??? ???? ? ??????????? ????? ???????. ????????? ????????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????????? ?? ????????? ? ???????? ???? ????????. ??????? ?????? ???????????? ????????? ????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ??????? ???????????????? ????????? ?????????...|$|R
