40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look for}} {{nonuniform}} rotating beams that are isospectral to a <b>given</b> <b>uniform</b> nonrotating beam. A rotating nonuniform beam is isospectral to the <b>given</b> <b>uniform</b> nonrotating beam if both the beams have the same spectral properties, i. e., both the beams have {{the same set of}} natural frequencies under a given boundary condition. The Barcilon-Gottlieb type transformation is proposed that converts the governing equation of a rotating beam to that of a uniform nonrotating beam. We show that there exist rotating beams isospectral to a <b>given</b> <b>uniform</b> nonrotating beam under some special conditions. The boundary conditions we consider are clamped-free and hinged-free with an elastic hinge spring. An upper bound on the rotation speed for which isospectral beams exist is proposed. The mass and stiffness distributions for these nonuniform rotating beams which are isospectral to the <b>given</b> <b>uniform</b> nonrotating beam are obtained. We use these mass and stiffness distributions in a finite element analysis to show that the obtained beams are isospectral to the <b>given</b> <b>uniform</b> nonrotating beam.

The first Q natural frequencies of the <b>given</b> <b>uniform</b> Euler-Bernoulli beam are determined using analytical solution. The first Q natural frequencies of a non-uniform beam are obtained {{with the help of}} finite element modeling. In order to obtain the non-uniform beams isospectral to a <b>given</b> <b>uniform</b> beam, an error function is designed, which calculates the difference between the spectra of the <b>given</b> <b>uniform</b> beam and the non-uniform beam.

Numerical results show the existence of the isospectral non-uniform beams for a <b>given</b> <b>uniform</b> beam, which occur as local minima. Non-uniform beams isospectral to a damaged beam, are also explored using the proposed methodology to illustrate the fact that accurate structural damage identification is difficult by just frequency measurements.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{constructing}} a feature extractor which combines Mallat's scattering transform framework with time-frequency (Gabor) representations. To do this, we introduce a class of frames, called <b>uniform</b> <b>covering</b> frames, which includes a variety of semi-discrete Gabor systems. Incorporating a <b>uniform</b> <b>covering</b> frame with a neural network structure yields the Fourier scattering transform S_ F. We prove that S_ F propagates energy along frequency decreasing paths and its energy decays exponentially {{as a function of the}} depth. These quantitative estimates are fundamental in showing that S_ F satisfies the typical scattering transform properties, and in controlling the information loss due to width and depth truncation. We introduce the truncated Fourier scattering transform and the fast Fourier scattering transform algorithm, and illustrate the algorithm's performance. The time-frequency covering techniques developed in this paper are flexible and give insight into the analysis of scattering transforms.

Superphosphate was included in some of the experiments as a comparison. The investigations showed that: Superphosphate applied at equivalent rates of elemental P gave the largest initial increase in soil and herbage concentrations of P but was no more effective at raising the soil and herbage concentrations of this element than basic slag or rock phosphate in the long term. The application of basic slag and rock phosphate gave increases in soil and herbage concentrations of P which were comparable to those obtained with superphosphate but were more slow acting Basic <b>slag</b> <b>gave</b> an increase in the concentration of P in an organic soil which was high in P (> 10 mg/kg) but gave only a slight increase of P in the herbage.
