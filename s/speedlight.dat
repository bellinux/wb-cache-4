50|$|At {{high end}} or {{exclusive}} nightclubs, professional photographers will take publicity photos of patrons, {{to use in}} advertising for the nightclub. Digital SLR cameras and <b>speedlight</b> flash units are used. Concert photography and event photography are used to provide clubgoers with a memorable keepsake as well as promote their venue. Since several years, some nightclubs and in particular techno clubs pursue a strict no photo policy {{in order to protect}} the clubbing experience, and smartphone camera lenses of visitors are taped up with stickers when one enters the venue.|$|E
50|$|<b>Speedlight</b> is {{the brand}} name used by Nikon Corporation for their {{photographic}} flash units, used since the company's introduction of strobe flashes in the 1960s. Nikon's standalone Speedlights (those not built into the company's cameras) have the SB- prefix {{as part of their}} model designation. Current Speedlights and other Nikon accessories make up part of Nikon's Creative Lighting System (CLS), which includes the Advanced Wireless Lighting, that enables various Nikon cameras to control multiple Nikon flash units in up to three separate controlled groups by sending encoded pre-flash signals to slave units.|$|E
5000|$|With {{location}} {{shooting the}} spill fill variable {{will cause the}} same lighting strategy to produce different result. Outdoors there is no spill fill created by artificial sources which is why cap style <b>speedlight</b> modifiers perform differently outdoors and large indoor spaces which reflect very little spill fill. Skylight outdoors is [...] "spill fill" [...] in the sense it reflects {{the light of the}} sun in a way the photographer can't control unless a reflector or flash is used to modify the three f/stop difference in brightness that typically occurs between direct sun and shade.|$|E
50|$|Nikon <b>Speedlight</b> SB-5000 is {{the first}} model {{featuring}} 2.4GHz radio communication for slave and master mode which has already been introduced by Canon models. I weights 420g, slightly heavier than the SB-9XX units. The menu system is similar to SB-700 and 9XX series. It uses a dot matrix display with led illumination unlike SB-700 and 9XX series' EL illuminator. The modeling button makes a return. It is slightly {{more powerful than the}} previous models however still less powerful than the SB-800. The head contains a fan activated after a short period of use to prevent overheating. This feature promotes more frequent and consecutive flashes without heat issues.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1976, Nippon Kogaku {{introduced}} the Nikon <b>Speedlight</b> SB-2 (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-5 (guide number 105/32 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-6 (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and SB-7E (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) electronic flashes. Note that the F2 {{did not use}} a standard ISO hot shoe to mount flash units. Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank. Manually rewinding film could not be done with a flash mounted in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank.

5000|$|In general relativity, light {{follows the}} {{curvature}} of spacetime, hence when light passes around a massive object, it is bent.

In General Relativity the speed of light depends on the gravitational potential (aka the metric) and this bending {{can be viewed as a}} consequence of the light traveling along a gradient in light <b>speed.Light</b> rays are the boundary between the future, the spacelike, and the past regions.

40|$|Red-eye is a {{very common}} problem in flash {{photography}} which can ruin a good photo by introducing color aberra-tion into the subject’s eyes. Previous methods {{to deal with this}} problem include special <b>speedlight</b> apparatus or flash mode that can reduce the red-eye effect, as well as post-capture red-eye correction software. This paper presents a new approach to detect and correct red-eye defects au-tomatically by combining flash and non-flash digital im-ages. It is suitable to be incorporated into compact digital cameras that support continuous shooting. Such a camera would eliminate red-eye immediately after image capture. Unlike existing approaches, our method is simple, fast and can recover the true color of the eyes. 1...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Dental {{photography}} plays {{important role}} in the transfer of information between dentists as well as in communication between them and the dental technicians. It is very important to take precise photos of external and internal morphological characteristics of the teeth. There are different methods for that. The aim is to establish a protocol for registration of internal morphological characteristics of teeth by digital dental photography. Material and methods: For the accomplishment of the aim 60 intact frontal teeth of 30 patients aged between 18 and 20 years were photographed. The following basic and additional devices for dental photography were used: 1. Digital SLR (DSLR) : • Body - Nikon D 90 • Lens - Nikon AF-S Micro Nikkor 105 f / 2. 8 G VR • Flash - Nikon SB-R- 200 <b>Speedlight</b> remote kit R 1 2. Lingual contraster 3. Reflective disk with silver surface Lingual contraster was placed behind the respective tooth when taking photos. Light reflector was placed sideways near patient’s head. The head of the flash that is near to the reflector was oriented towards it. The other flash on the opposite side, activated at a minimum power, was directed to the tooth row. Results: Internal characteristics of the tooth - enamel cracks, translucency, transparency, opacity and opalescence were easily and predictably recorded by the described methodology. Conclusions: The method suggested by us can be successfully used for recording the internal morphological characteristics of the tooth...|$|E
