Objective: To develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride and its active metabolite, (R,S) - 1 -{ 2 -[2 -(3 -methoxyphenyl) ethyl]-phenoxy}- 3 -(dimethylamino) - 2 -propanol (M- 1), {{in order to}} predict DDIs between <b>sarpogrelate</b> and the clinically relevant cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 D 6 substrates, metoprolol, desipramine, dextromethorphan, imipramine, and tolterodine. Methods: The PBPK model was developed, incorporating the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride, and M- 1 {{based on the findings}} from in vitro and in vivo studies. Subsequently, the model was verified by comparing the predicted concentration-time profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters of <b>sarpogrelate</b> and M- 1 to the observed clinical data. Finally, the verified model was used to simulate clinical DDIs between <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride and sensitive CYP 2 D 6 substrates. The predictive performance of the model was assessed by comparing predicted results to observed data after coadministering <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride and metoprolol. Results: The developed PBPK model accurately predicted <b>sarpogrelate</b> and M- 1 plasma concentration profiles after single or multiple doses of <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride. The simulated ratios of area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration of metoprolol in the presence of <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride to baseline were in good agreement with the observed ratios. The predicted fold-increases in the area under the curve ratios of metoprolol, desipramine, imipramine, dextromethorphan, and tolterodine following single and multiple <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride oral doses were within the range of ≥ 1. 25, but < 2 -fold, indicating that <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride is a weak inhibitor of CYP 2 D 6 in vivo. Collectively, the predicted low DDIs suggest that <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride has limited potential for causing significant DDIs associated with CYP 2 D 6 inhibition. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the feasibility of applying the PBPK approach to predicting the DDI potential between <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride and drugs metabolized by CYP 2 D 6. Therefore, it would be beneficial in designing and optimizing clinical DDI studies using <b>sarpogrelate</b> as an in vivo CYP 2 D 6 inhibitor.

40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) {{is a major}} {{complication}} of metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension. Comorbidity of these diseases is the factor exacerbating CKD progression. Statins are commonly used in patients with metabolic disorders to decrease the risk of cardiovascular complications. <b>Sarpogrelate,</b> a selective antagonist of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 2 A receptor, inhibits platelet aggregation and is used to improve peripheral circulation in diabetic patients. Here, we investigated the effects of <b>sarpogrelate</b> and rosuvastatin on CKD in mice that were subjected to a high fat diet (HFD) for 22 weeks and a single low dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg). When mice were administrated <b>sarpogrelate</b> (50 mg/kg, p. o.) for 13 weeks, albuminuria and urinary cystatin C excretion were normalized and histopathological changes such as glomerular mesangial expansion, tubular damage, and accumulations in lipid droplets and collagen were significantly improved. <b>Sarpogrelate</b> treatment repressed the HFD/STZ-induced CD 31 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 2 expressions, indicating the attenuation of glomerular endothelial proliferation. Additionally, <b>sarpogrelate</b> inhibited interstitial fibrosis by suppressing the increases in transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1). All of these functional and histological improvements were also seen in rosuvastatin (20 mg/kg) group and, notably, the combinatorial treatment with <b>sarpogrelate</b> and rosuvastatin showed additive beneficial effects on histopathological changes by HFD/STZ. Moreover, <b>sarpogrelate</b> reduced circulating levels of PAI- 1 that were elevated in the HFD/STZ group. As supportive in vitro evidence, <b>sarpogrelate</b> incubation blocked TGF-β 1 / 5 -HT-inducible PAI- 1 expression in murine glomerular mesangial cells. Taken together, <b>sarpogrelate</b> and rosuvastatin may be advantageous to control the progression of CKD in patients with comorbid metabolic disorders, and particularly, the use of <b>sarpogrelate</b> as adjunctive therapy with statins may provide additional benefits on CKD...|$|E

40|$|Subcutaneous {{arteriovenous}} fistula in {{the forearm}} {{is a common}} vascular access for hemodialysis. However, primary failure of native fistula occurs because of either thrombosis formation within the first several weeks after surgery or immature vein dilatation. To evaluate the effect of platelet inhibition on fistula thrombosis and maturation failure, we used an antiplatelet agent, <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride, in our study. The study was designed as an open-label, parallel, prospective, randomized study for 8 weeks, comparing patients receiving <b>sarpogrelate</b> 300  mg/day (<b>sarpogrelate</b> group, n= 33) with controls receiving no medication (n= 46). The primary outcome was fistula patency failure determined by pulse Doppler ultrasound examination of the arteriovenous fistula performed 8 weeks after surgery. Pulse wave velocity was also measured to determine the ankle brachial pressure index (ABI). The drug was well-tolerated and did not increase bleeding events during the 8 -week study period. In the <b>sarpogrelate</b> group, patency failure occurred in 1 of 33 patients (3. 0 %), and the occlusion rate was significantly lower (P= 0. 001) than that {{in the control group}} (3 of 46 patients; 6. 5 %). Average blood flow rate in the <b>sarpogrelate</b> group was 546 ± 174 mL/min, and was significantly higher (P= 0. 036) than 448 ± 183  mL/min in the control group. However, the diameter of the shunt vessel in the <b>sarpogrelate</b> group was 5. 2 ± 1. 3  mm, which was not different from 5. 1 ± 0. 6  mm in the control group. The Vmax was not significantly different between two groups (1. 01 ± 0. 56  m/sec in the <b>sarpogrelate</b> group and 0. 89 ± 0. 66 m/sec in the control group). In all patients (n= 79), blood flow correlated with ABI (r= 0. 34, P= 0. 045).

40|$|Abstract Background Contrast-induced {{nephropathy}} (CIN) is {{a serious}} clinical problem associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Although some agents including hydration with saline are being prescribed to prevent renal deterioration in these high risk patients, their efficacy is not clearly defined and debatable. Therefore additional prophylactic pretreatments are needed. Methods/Design The present study aims to investigate differences in occurrence of CIN after <b>sarpogrelate</b> premedication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 268 participants, aged 20 - 85 years with a clinical diagnosis of CKD will be recruited. They will be randomly allocated {{to one of two}} conditions: (i) routine treatment without <b>sarpogrelate,</b> and (ii) routine treatment with <b>sarpogrelate</b> (a fixed-flexible dose of 300 mg/day). The primary outcome is the occurrence of CIN during 4 weeks after receiving contrast agent. Discussion As of May 2010, there were no registered trials evaluating the therapeutic potentials of <b>sarpogrelate</b> in preventing for CIN.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether a serotonin blocker, <b>sarpogrelate,</b> improves exercise capacity as a result of vasodilation of coronary collateral channels in patients with effort angina. Background. Serotonin has been reported to decrease coronary collateral blood flow by collateral vasoconstriction in a canine model, suggesting that platelet activation in feeding coronary arteries of the collateral network has the potential to cause collateral vasoconstriction. Methods. The subjects consisted of 22 patients with effort angina and reproducible ischemic threshold (group A, 11 patients with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 2 or 3 flow of the ischemia-related coronary artery and Rentrop’s collateral index 0 or 1; group B, 11 patients with TIMI grade 0 or 1 flow and Rentrop’s collateral index 2 or 3). We repeated the symptom-limited treadmill exercise test using the Balke–Ware protocol and exercise tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with and without pretreatment with 200 mg orally administered <b>sarpogrelate.</b> Each exercise test was performed at 9 : 00 a. m. on different days. The order of tests with and without <b>sarpogrelate</b> was randomized. Results. In group A, <b>sarpogrelate</b> increased neither exercise time at 0. 1 mV ST depression nor double product at 0. 1 mV ST depression. In contrast, in group B <b>sarpogrelate</b> increased the exercise duration at 0. 1 mV ST depression from 181 ± 112 (SD) to 248 ± 131 s (p < 0. 05) and also increased the double product at 0. 1 mV ST depression by 21 % (p < 0. 01). The severity score using myocardial perfusion scintigraphy at the same workload was significantly (p < 0. 01) decreased by 37 % in group B, but not in group A (11 %), due to the <b>sarpogrelate</b> treatment. Conclusions. <b>Sarpogrelate</b> augments flow reserve of the collateral circulation and improves exercise capacity in anginal patients with well-developed collaterals.

40|$|Abstract 5 -Hydroxytryptamine type 2 antagonists {{are used}} to treat {{symptomatic}} peripheral arterial disease. How-ever, it remains unknown {{as to whether the}} administration of <b>sarpogrelate,</b> a 5 -hydroxytryptamine type 2 antagonist, improves the prognosis after endovascular therapy for crit-ical limb ischemia (CLI). We performed a retrospective analysis using a database of 386 Japanese patients under-going endovascular therapy for CLI. Sixty-seven patients were treated with <b>sarpogrelate,</b> and we compared their prognosis with that of an equal number of background-matched controls extracted from the population. The primary end point was the first event of either major amputation or death from any cause, and amputation-free survival was evaluated. The follow-up period was 21 ± 18 months (mean ± standard deviation), and 58 end points were observed. Patients treated with <b>sarpogrelate</b> had a signifi-cantly higher amputation-free survival rate than their matched controls (P = 0. 036). The hazard ratio for the end point and its 95 % confidence interval was 0. 57 (0. 34 – 0. 97).

40|$|Pravastatin is a lipid-lowering {{agent that}} attenuates atherosclerosis. However, the multifactorial {{pathogenesis}} of atherosclerosis requires other drugs with different anti-atherogenic mechanisms.

Although <b>sarpogrelate</b> alone did not significantly reduce atherosclerotic plaque areas, co-treatment with pravastatin significantly decreased aortic lesions compared to those of the pravastatin alone treated group.

40|$|Background and objectives: <b>Sarpogrelate</b> {{has been}} shown to reduce {{albuminuria}} in diabetic nephropathy. For examination of whether this is based on the same mechanisms as angiotensin II receptor blockers or thiazolidinedione, effects of <b>sarpogrelate</b> on atherosclerotic inflammatory molecules and their relations to albuminuria in patients who had diabetes and had already been treated with angiotensin II receptor blockers and with or without thiazolidinedione were examined. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Forty patients who had diabetes with nephropathy and arteriosclerosis obliterans and had already been treated with angiotensin II receptor blocker (n 40) were randomly assigned to <b>sarpogrelate</b> (300 mg/d; n 20) or aspirin group (100 mg/d; n 20). Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 were measured at baseline and 16 wk after administration. Results: Only the <b>sarpogrelate</b> group showed increases in plasma adiponectin and decreases in both plasma and urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 and albumin-to-creatinine ratio levels. Moreover, percentage change of monocyte che-moattractant protein- 1 level correlated positively to that of albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Even when the <b>sarpogrelate</b> group was further divided into two groups with (n 9) or without thiazolidinedione (n 11), changes in monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 or albumin-to-creatinine ratio did not differ. Conclusions: <b>Sarpogrelate</b> can reduce albuminuria and plasma and urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 levels while increasing plasma adiponectin in diabetic nephropathy.

Methods and Results: Rats were treated 3 days before surgery with or without 5 mg*kg-l-day-I <b>sarpogrelate,</b> and the left coronary artery was ligated for 3 weeks to induce MI. <b>Sarpogrelate</b> reduced the mortality from 40 % to 30 %, infarct size from 35 % to 25 %, and left ventricular end diastolic pressure from 15 mm Hg to 10 mm Hg in MI rats.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{selective}} 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist <b>sarpogrelate</b> {{has been}} clinically used for treatment in atherosclerotic diseases. However, it remains unknown whether administration of <b>sarpogrelate</b> inhibits intimal hyperplasia seen in autologous vein grafts. Therefore, {{we sought to}} clarify this question using an experimental rabbit vein graft model. MethodsMale rabbits {{were divided into two}} groups: a control group and a sarpogrelate-treated group. The jugular vein was interposed in the carotid artery in reversed fashion for 4 weeks and intimal hyperplasia of the grafted vein was measured (n = 8, in each group). Acetylcholine (ACh) -induced endothelium-dependent relaxation was tested by precontraction with prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α, 5 μM) (n = 5, in each). endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and superoxide production of these veins were also assessed. ResultsThe suppression of intimal hyperplasia was significantly greater in the sarpogrelate-treated group than in the control group. ACh induced an endothelium-dependent relaxation in the sarpogrelate-treated group (but not in the control group). In endothelium-intact strips from the sarpogrelate-treated group, the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor nitroarginine enhanced the PGF 2 α-induced contraction and blocked the ACh-induced relaxation. Immunoreactive eNOS protein expression was similar between the two groups but superoxide production (estimated from ethidium fluorescence) in endothelial cells was significantly smaller in the sarpogrelate-treated group. ConclusionThe present results indicate that in vivo blockade of 5 -HT 2 A receptors leads to an inhibition of intimal hyperplasia in rabbit vein graft. It is suggested that an increased function of endothelium-derived NO through a reduction in endothelial superoxide production may be a possible underlying mechanism for this. These novel findings support the clinical usefulness of <b>sarpogrelate</b> for preventing intimal hyperplasia in vein graft after bypass grafting. Clinical RelevanceIntimal hyperplasia is a major obstacle to patency after vein grafting. Despite a diverse array of trials to prevent it, a satisfactory therapeutic strategy for clinical use has not been established. We report here the inhibitory effect of 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist, <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride on the development of vein graft intimal hyperplasia. In addition, we demonstrate that <b>sarpogrelate</b> showed endothelium-dependent relaxation through a reduction in endothelial superoxide production in vitro. Because the clinical benefits and safety of <b>sarpogrelate</b> have been established to a certain extent through long-term clinical usage, the study provides further evidence to support the clinical investigation of the role of <b>sarpogrelate</b> in prevention of intimal hyperplasia in venous bypass grafting...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that <b>sarpogrelate,</b> a selective 5 -HT 2 A antagonist, showed a potent inverse agonist activity to constitutively active mutant (C 322 K) of human 5 -HT 2 A receptor (5 -HT 2 AR). However, {{it remains to}} be unknown about the actual mechanism of this mutant for its constitutive activation as well as inverse agonist activity of <b>sarpogrelate.</b> Our model shows that mutation (C 322 K) of 5 -HT 2 AR causes electronic repul-sion between positively charged Arg 173 (3. 50) and Lys 322 (6. 34) residues resulting outward movement of the C-terminus of transmembrane helix (TMH) III. This motion of TMH III leads to a partially active structure of the receptor, which may be a key step in receptor activation. The structural model of the partially active receptor also indicates that the binding of <b>sarpogrelate</b> to the constitutively active receptor causes an inward swing of TMH III to an inactive receptor structure. Therefore, the present study may suggest that the elec-tronic repulsion causing outward movement of the C-terminus of TMH III may be the key step for constitu-tive activation of mutant C 322 K of 5 -HT 2 AR and the inward movement of TMH III causes the inverse agonist activity of <b>sarpogrelate.</b> Key words 5 -HT 2 A receptor; mutation; constitutive activity; molecular modeling; electronic repulsion It has been established that many G-protein coupled recep-tors (GPCRs) can exist in a constitutively active form in th...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Sarpogrelate</b> is a {{selective}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) receptor subtype 2 A antagonist which blocks 5 -HT induced platelet aggregation and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. We compared {{the efficacy of}} sarpogrelate-based dual antiplatelet therapies {{for the prevention of}} restenosis and target lesion revascularization (TLR) rates comparing with that of clopidogrel after percutaneous endovascular interventions (EVIs) of femoropopliteal (FP) arterial lesions. Methods: This prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial recruited a total of 120 patients with successful EVI of FP lesions at seven centers across China between January 2011 and June 2012. Patients were randomized to receive either <b>sarpogrelate</b> (100 mg trice daily for 6 months, n = 63) or clopidogrel (75 mg once daily for 6 months, n = 57). All patients also received oral aspirin (100 mg once daily for 12 months). Clinical follow-up was conducted up to 12 months postprocedure. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups in basic demographic data. The restenosis rate was higher in the clopidogrel group (22. 80 %) than in <b>sarpogrelate</b> group (17. 50 %), but there was no significant difference between these two groups (P = 0. 465).

Autotomy was observed in the foot on the R. F. T. C side, in proportion to the increase in the R. F. T. C temperature above 60 ℃. Normal responses of digit spread, grip strength and foot drop in motor function were reduced immediately after R. F. T. C treatment, and then recovered slowly at a rate dependent on the temperature. A nociceptive test based on heat stimulation of the plantar showed temporary hyperalgesia on the R. F. T. C side. A touch sensitivity test for mechanical stimulation using Von Frey hair filaments was more sensitive on the R. F. T. C side. with increased temperature. It was concluded that these rats had similar characteristics to a neuropathic pain model. In a second study, we adrninistered <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride orally to rats with R. F. T. C applied to the sciatic nerve at 70 ℃ for 45 seconds. Each rat was then examined for 8 weeks. In the <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride group, the R. F. T.

Following a single-blind placebo run-in period of 6 weeks, 364 (309 male and 55 female) patients (59. 2 ± 8. 4 years, mean SD) were randomized to receive <b>sarpogrelate</b> 200 mg bid, 200 mg tid or placebo for 24 weeks with a follow-up of 8 weeks. The primary objective was the increase of absolute claudication distance (ACD) {{at the end of}} treatment (week 24) compared to placebo. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed on the log-transformed percentage of baseline ACD: loge (ACD/baseline). A responder analysis (defined as a 50 % improvement in ACD) was also performed. There was a marked training/placebo effect on the ACD which persisted up to 16 weeks. At 24 weeks the primary objective did not reach statistical significance (200 mg bid vs placebo, p = 0. 225; 200 mg tid vs placebo, p = 0. 580). In the responder analysis, 200 mg bid showed a statistically significant difference vs placebo (p = 0. 035). In the exploratory analysis with completers (patients completing all treadmill tests), there was a statistical difference in ACD/baseline change for 200 mg bid (p = 0. 035) and in the responder analysis for 200 mg tid (p = 0. 044) at 24 weeks compared to placebo.

Other rabbits underwent 30 min of ischemia and 48 h of reperfusion, {{and the effect of}} SG on the infarct size was investigated in the absence and presence of a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, chelerythrine (5 mg/kg, intravenously), or a mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate sensitive potassium (KATP) channel blocker, 5 -hydroxydecanoate (5 -HD) (5 mg/kg, intravenously). In another series, the effect of SG on PKC isoforms in cytosol and membrane fraction was assessed after a 20 -min global ischemia in isolated rabbit hearts. ResultsInterstitial serotonin levels were markedly increased during 30 -min ischemia in in vivo and isolated hearts, and the increases were inhibited by SG in each. The infarct size was reduced by SG (27 ± 2 % vs. 40 ± 3 % of control). This effect was blocked by chelerythrine and 5 -HD, respectively. <b>Sarpogrelate</b> further enhanced the ischemia-induced translocation of PKC-ϵ to the membrane fraction. ConclusionsSarpogrelate reduces the myocardial infarct size by inhibiting the serotonin release followed by enhancement of PKC-ϵ translocation and opening of the mitochondrial KATP channel in ischemic myocytes...|$|E
40|$|A bolus {{injection}} of 5 -HT (32 μg/kg) {{into the right}} atrium immediately induced Bezold-Jarisch reflex (hypotension, bradycardia and apnea) and delayed bronchoconstriction (assumed by decreased air flow and increased intrapleural pressure) in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats. This bronchoconstrictor response was mimicked by α-methyl- 5 -HT (5 -HT 2 -receptor agonist : 32 μg/kg), and 5 -methoxytryptamine (5 -HT 2 - and 5 -HT 4 -receptor agonist : 32 μg/kg), but not by 1 -phenylbiguanide (5 -HT 3 -receptor agonist : 16 μg/kg) or cisapride (5 -HT 4 -receptor agonist : 32 μg/kg). To {{study the effects of}} 5 -HT and α-methyl- 5 -HT on the airway dynamics, lung conductance (GL) and lung compliance (CL) were calculated from flow rate, tidal volume and intrapleural pressure curves. Dose response curve (DRC) of 5 -HT on GL or CL was not affected by granisetron (5 -HT 3 -receptor antagonist : 0. 05 mg/kg), but DRC of α-methyl- 5 -HT was significantly shifted to the right. Subsequently, both the DRCs of 5 -HT and α-methyl- 5 -HT were shifted to the right by <b>sarpogrelate</b> (5 -HT 2 -receptor antagonist : 0. 3, 1. 0 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the bronchoconstriction of 5 -HT and α-methyl- 5 -HT (respectively 32 μg/kg) were either abolished or potently reduced by bilateral, cervical vagotomy, but the bronchoconstriction response to 5 -HT was partly recovered at 128 μg/kg. Peak response latency of GL were 9. 14 ± 0. 39 sec in 5 -HT (32 μg/kg), suggesting that the response might be originated at the bronchial vascular bed. These results suggest that, at least in the rat, 1) 5 -HT-induced bronchoconstriction is mediated by 5 -HT 2 -receptor, but not by 5 -HT 3 - or 5 -HT 4 -receptor, 2) <b>sarpogrelate</b> antagonizes 5 -HT-induced bronchoconstriction in a dose-related manner, 3) 5 -HT-induced bronchoconstriction is potently augmented by vagal reflex, but is primarily mediated by a direct action in the airway, 4) the possible site of action of intravenous 5 -HT is the bronchial, not the pulmonary vascular bed...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) plays a role in the pathogenesis of vein graft spasms. It is suggested that smooth muscle 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptors contribute to 5 -HT-induced contraction, while endothelial 5 -HT 1 B receptors contribute to the 5 -HT-induced endothelium-mediated relaxation. We recently found that chronic administration of the selective 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride (SH) enhances the function of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) in rabbit vein grafts. However, it is unknown if such treatment modulates 5 -HT-induced vasospasm in vein grafts, and if so, what the underlying mechanisms are. MethodsMale rabbits were divided into two groups: a control group and an SH-treated group. The jugular vein was interposed in the carotid artery in reversed fashion. Isometric tension was examined using vein grafts after 4 weeks. 5 -HT (10 − 8 - 10 − 6 M) -induced contraction was obtained in each group in the absence or presence of the NO synthase inhibitor l-NG-nitroarginine (l-NNA). The expression of 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptors was examined immunohistochemically. ResultsThe 5 -HT induced a concentration-dependent contractions in both groups. l-NNA did not significantly modify the 5 -HT-induced contraction in the control group but enhanced it in the SH group. The 5 -HT 1 B receptor antagonist GR 55562 inhibited the 5 -HT-induced contraction in the control group, while it increased the sensitivity of contraction to 5 -HT in the SH-treated group in the absence (but not in the presence) of l-NNA. Positive immunoreactivities against 5 -HT 1 B and 5 -HT 2 A receptors were identified in endothelial and medial regions of vein grafts in both groups, and the expression of 5 -HT 2 A receptors (but not 5 -HT 1 B receptors) was significantly less in the SH-treated group than in the control group. ConclusionChronically administered SH to rabbits upregulates the autoinhibitory mechanism by 5 -HT through a release of NO from endothelium via an activation of endothelial 5 -HT 1 B receptors, thus attenuating its own contraction in vein grafts. Furthermore, such SH treatment downregulates the expression of smooth muscle 5 -HT 2 A receptors, thus further attenuating the 5 -HT-induced contraction. These novel findings further support the clinical usefulness of SH in vein graft spasm after bypass grafting. Clinical RelevanceIt {{has been suggested}} that 5 -HT plays a role in the pathogenesis of vein graft spasms. It is suggested that smooth muscle 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptors contribute to 5 -HT-induced contraction, while endothelial 5 -HT 1 B receptors contribute to the 5 -HT-induced endothelium-mediated relaxation. However, it is unknown if chronic administration of 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist SH modulates 5 -HT-induced vasospasm in vein grafts. We report here that such treatment attenuates the 5 -HT-induced contraction. In addition, we demonstrate the possible underlying mechanism. Because the clinical benefits and safety of <b>sarpogrelate</b> have been established to a certain extent through long-term clinical usage, the study provides further evidence to support the clinical investigation of the role of <b>sarpogrelate</b> in vein graft spasm after bypass grafting...|$|E
40|$|C ardiovascular {{disease and}} stroke are {{predominant}} {{causes of death}} in developed countries. Rupture of athero-sclerotic plaque in an artery wall and the ensuing thrombotic events are the triggers for acute ischemic injury in these diseases. Platelet activation and aggregation play key roles in this process of atherothrombosis. Anti-platelet drugs thus provide the primary therapeutic strategy to combat these diseases. Dual therapy with aspirin and clopi-dogrel is the current standard of care for most patients, but it has significant limitations. This provides an impetus for developing new anti-platelet drugs. One new drug has received FDA approval recently; prasugrel targets the platelet P 2 Y 12 receptor, just like clopidogrel.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride (SH), a selective serotonin 2 A receptor antagonist, on diabetic nephropathy in a type 2 diabetes mouse model. We treated db/m and db/db mice with SH (30 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Rat renal proximal tubule cells (NRK- 52 E) and mouse macrophages (Raw 264. 7) were stimulated by high glucose (30 mM glucose) or LPS (100 ng/ml) with or without SH (20 μM). We found that SH treatment increased serum adiponectin level and decreased urinary albumin, macrophage infiltration to glomeruli, and renal inflammatory and fibrosis signals, which were highly expressed in diabetic mice. Proximal tubule cells treated with high glucose (30 mM) also showed increased inflammatory and fibrosis signals. However, SH (20 μM) treatment reduced these changes. Moreover, SH treatment inhibited LPS-stimulated macrophage migration and activation. These findings suggest that SH ameliorates diabetic nephropathy not only by suppressing macrophage infiltration, but also by anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects...|$|E

40|$|Addition of {{cilostazol}} or <b>sarpogrelate</b> to {{the standard}} dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel has been implemented in patients that underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stents in Korea. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple antiplatelet therapies. This retrospective cohort study was performed using the Korean National Insurance Claim Data of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2014. The study cohort population consisted of patients with ischemic heart diseases {{and a history of}} PCI. They were treated with antiplatelet therapy of aspirin, clopidogrel (AC); aspirin, clopidogrel, cilostazol (ACCi); or aspirin, clopidogrel, <b>sarpogrelate</b> (ACSa) during the index period from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011. During the follow-up period up to December 31, 2014, the major adverse cardiac or cerebral events (MACCE) including death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization, and ischemic stroke were assessed. Bleeding complications were also evaluated as adverse drug events. Out of 93, 876 patients with PCI during the index period, 69, 491 patients started dual (AC) or triple therapy (ACSa or ACCi). The clinical outcomes of comparing ACSa and ACCi therapy showed beneficial effects in the ACSa group in the prevention of subsequent cardiac or cerebral events. After Propensity score-matching between ACSa and ACCi groups, there were significant differences in MI and revascularization, with corresponding HR of 0. 38 (95 % CI, 0. 20 - 0. 73) and 0. 66 (95 % CI, 0. 53 - 0. 82) in ACSa vs. ACCi at 12 months, respectively. At the 24 -month follow-up, the triple therapy groups (ACS or ACC) had a higher incidence of MACCE compared to the dual therapy (AC) group; ACSa vs. AC HR of 1. 69 (95 % CI, 1. 62 - 1. 77); ACC vs. AC HR of 1. 22 (95 % CI, 1. 06 - 1. 41).

40|$|Objective: Adverse event reports (AERs) {{submitted}} to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to assess the bleeding complications induced by the administration of antiplatelets and to attempt to determine the rank-order of the association. Methods: After a deletion of duplicated submissions and the revision of arbitrary drug names, AERs involving warfarin, aspirin, cilostazol, clopidogrel, ethyl icosapentate, limaprost alfadex, <b>sarpogrelate,</b> and ticlopidine were analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools {{were used for the}} quantitative detection of signals, i. e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Results: Based on 22, 017, 956 co-occurrences, i. e., drug-adverse event pairs, found in 1, 644, 220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, 736 adverse events were listed as warfarin-associated adverse events, and 147 of the 736 were bleeding complications, including haemorrhage and haematoma. Both aspirin and clopidogrel were associated with haemorrhage, but the association was more noteworthy for clopidogrel. As for bleeding complications related to the gastrointestinal system, e. g., melaena and haematochezia, the statistical metrics suggested a stronger association for aspirin than clopidogrel. The total number of co-occurrences was not large enough to compare the association with bleeding complications for the other 5 antiplatelets. Conclusions: The data strongly suggest the necessity of well-organized clinical studies with respect to antiplatelet-associated bleeding complications. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePlasma 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT; serotonin), {{released}} from blood platelets, {{plays a major}} role in the human cardiovascular system. Besides the effect of endogenous serotonin, many drugs targeting serotonergic receptors are widely used in the general population (antiobesity agents, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antimigraine agents), and may enhance the cardiovascular risk. Depending on the type of serotonin receptor activated and its location, the use of these compounds triggers acute and chronic effects. The acute cardiovascular response to 5 -HT, named the Bezold-Jarish reflex, leads to intense bradycardia associated with atrioventricular block, and involves 5 -HT 3, 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D, 5 -HT 7 and 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 B receptors. The chronic contribution of 5 -HT and its receptors (5 -HT 4 and 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 B) in cardiovascular tissue remodeling, with a particular emphasis on cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and valve degeneration, will be explored in this review. Finally, through the analysis of the effects of <b>sarpogrelate,</b> some new aspects of 5 -HT 2 A receptor pharmacology in vasomotor tone regulation and the interaction between endothelial and smooth muscle cells will also be discussed. The aim of this review is to emphasize the cardiac side effects caused by serotonin receptor activation, and to highlight their possible prevention by the development of new drugs targeting this system...|$|E
40|$|Antiplatelet {{agents are}} a {{cornerstone}} {{in the treatment}} of acute arterial thrombotic events and in the prevention of thrombus formation. However, existing antiplatelet agents (mainly aspirin, the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole and clopidogrel) reduce the risk of vascular events only by about one quarter compared with placebo. As a consequence, more efficacious antiplatelet therapies with a reduced bleeding risk are needed. We give an overview of several new antiplatelet agents that are currently investigated in secondary stroke prevention: adenosine 5 -diphosphonate receptor antagonists, cilostazol, <b>sarpogrelate,</b> terutroban and SCH 530348. There are unique features in secondary stroke prevention that have to be taken into account: ischaemic stroke is a heterogeneous disease caused by multiple aetiologies and the blood–brain barrier is disturbed after stroke which may result in a higher intracerebral bleeding risk. Several small randomized trials indicated that the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel might be superior to antiplatelet monotherapy in the acute and early post-ischaemic phase. There is an ongoing debate about antiplatelet resistance. Decreasing response to aspirin is correlated independently with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, there is still no evidence from randomized trials link-ing aspirin resistance and recurrent ischaemic events. Similarly, randomized trials have not demonstrated a clinical significantly decreased antiplatelet effect by the concomitant use of clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors. Nevertheless, a routine use of this drug combination is not recommended...|$|E
40|$|Background—Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) {{is a key}} {{molecule}} {{in chronic}} inflammation and has been implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis. Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine; 5 -HT) causes vascular contraction and proliferation, but its role in atherogenesis has not been clarified. We investigated the effects of 5 -HT on IL- 6 synthesis in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Methods and Results—IL- 6 levels in the culture medium of VSMCs were determined by ELISA. IL- 6 mRNA accumulation was determined by use of a Quantikine mRNA colorimetric quantification kit. NF-kB activation was tested by gel retardation assay. 5 -HT induced IL- 6 production by VSMCs in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with increased IL- 6 mRNA accumulation and nuclear factor-kB activation. The effect of 5 -HT on IL- 6 production was significantly inhibited by the 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist ketanserin and the selective 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist <b>sarpogrelate.</b> Conversely, the 5 -HT 2 receptor agonist a-methyl- 5 -HT increased IL- 6 production. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C, but not the protein kinase A inhibitor KT 5720, suppressed 5 -HT–induced IL- 6 production. The effect of 5 -HT was also abolished in PKC-depleted VSMCs after pretreatment with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate for 24 hours. Conclusions— 5 -HT acts on 5 -HT 2 A receptors and increases IL- 6 synthesis in human VSMCs at least partially through a PKC-dependent pathway. These results suggested that 5 -HT may contribute to inflammatory activation of the vessel...|$|E

SP has been reported to inhibit 5 -HT induced coronary artery spasm, increase in intracellular calcium and smooth muscle cells proliferation. This study was undertaken to test that SP suppresses the development of atherosclerosis due to high cholesterol diet (HCD) by decreasing blood viscosity and oxidative stress. For this purpose, 29 rabbits were divided into four groups: control group (normal diet); normal diet group with SP at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day; HCD group fed 1 % cholesterol; and HCD group with SP at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day. After 90 days of the experi-ment, blood samples were collected and the animals were killed; the thoracic aorta was stained by the Oil Red O staining method. The results indicate that plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and malondialdehyde were increased in rabbits fed HCD. Plasma viscosity and whole blood viscosity were also higher in the HCD group than that in normal diet group. Treatment with SP prevented these alterations induced by HCD whereas this agent had no significant effect in rabbits fed normal diet. Morphological examination of the aorta revealed that SP treatment prevented the formation of foam cells and atherosclerotic plaque. It is suggested that the beneficial effects of SP in atherosclerosis may be due to actions on blood viscosity, lipid levels and oxidative stress...|$|E
40|$|Although 5 -HT 2 A serotonergic antagonists {{have been}} used to treat {{vascular}} disease in patients with diabetes mellitus or obesity, their effects on leukocyte-endothelial interactions have not been fully investigated. In this study, we assessed the effects of <b>sarpogrelate</b> hydrochloride (SRPO), a 5 -HT 2 A receptor inverse agonist, on leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in obesity both in vivo and in vitro. In the in vivo experiment, C 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed a high-fat high-fructose diet (HFFD), comprising 20 % fat and 30 % fructose, with or without intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg/day SRPO for 4 weeks. The body weight, visceral fat weight, and serum monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 levels in the mice increased significantly with the HFFD, but these effects were prevented by chronic injections of SRPO. Intravital microscopy of the femoral artery detected significant leukocyte-endothelial interactions after treatment with HFFD, but these leukocyte-endothelial interactions were reduced in the mice injected with SRPO. In the in vitro experiment, pre-incubation of activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) induced THP- 1 cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions, but the adhesion was reduced by pretreatment of PRP with SRPO. A fluorescent immunobinding assay showed that PRP induced significant upregulation of E-selectin in HUVECs, but this upregulation was reduced by pretreatment of PRP with SRPO. In other in vitro conditions, pre-incubation of THP- 1 cells with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate increased the adhesion of THP- 1 cells to activated HUVECs under rotational conditions, but this adhesion was reduced by pretreatment with SRPO. Western blotting analysis showed that protein kinase C α activation in THP- 1 cells was inhibited by SRPO.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy and safety profile of DP-R 202 and Anplag⁎⁎Trademark: Anplag® Tab (Yuhan Corp, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Tab in patients with PAD. MethodsThis study was a 12 -week, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, active-controlled, parallel group comparative Phase III clinical trial. One hundred fifty-one volunteer patients with PAD were randomized to receive DP-R 202 300 mg once daily or Anplag Table 100 mg TID for 12 weeks. The primary end point was a change in patient assessment of lower leg pain intensity with the use of a visual analog scale (VAS) after 12 weeks of treatment. Results after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment were compared with baseline and between treatment groups, and all patients were assessed for adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory data, and vital signs. FindingsTwo hundred thirty-one patients from 25 medical centers were assessed, and 151 were enrolled and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Seventy-five patients received DP-R 202 300 mg once daily and 76 patients received Anplag Table 100 mg TID for 12 weeks. Analysis of the change in lower leg pain intensity as determined by VAS score between baseline and week 12 (mean [SD], 20. 72 [20. 06] mm vs 15. 55 [21. 44] mm) suggested that DP-R 202 was not inferior to Anplag Tab, and no significant differences were found in the secondary end points.
