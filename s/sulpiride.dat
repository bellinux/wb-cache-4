25|$|Prolactin is {{available}} commercially {{for use in}} animals, but not in humans. It is used to stimulate lactation in animals. The biological half-life of prolactin in humans is around 15–20 minutes. The D2 receptor {{is involved in the}} regulation of prolactin secretion, and agonists of the receptor such as bromocriptine and cabergoline decrease prolactin levels while antagonists of the receptor such as domperidone, metoclopramide, haloperidol, risperidone, and <b>sulpiride</b> increase prolactin levels. D2 receptor antagonists like domperidone, metoclopramide, and <b>sulpiride</b> are used as galactogogues to increase prolatin secretion and induce lactation in humans.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{side effects}} {{have also been}} {{reported}} when taking atypical antipsychotics. In males antipsychotics reduce sexual interest, impair sexual performance with the main difficulties being failure to ejaculate. In females there may be abnormal menstrual cycles and infertility. In {{both males and females}} the breasts may become enlarged and a fluid will sometimes ooze from the nipples. Sexual adverse effects caused by some anti-psychotics are a result of an increase of prolactin. <b>Sulpiride</b> and Amisulpiride and in less extense Risperdone and paliperidone cause a high increase of prolactin.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{prescribing}} {{medication for}} these conditions which often resolve spontaneously, recommendations {{have pointed to}} improved skin hygiene, good hydration via fluids, good nutrition, and installation of padded bed rails with use of proper mattresses. [...] Pharmacological treatments include the typical neuroleptic agents such as fluphenazine, pimozide, haloperidol and perphenazine which block dopamine receptors; these are {{the first line of}} treatment for hemiballismus. [...] Quetiapine, <b>sulpiride</b> and olanzapine, the atypical neuroleptic agents, are less likely to yield drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia. [...] Tetrabenazine works by depleting presynaptic dopamine and blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors, while reserpine depletes the presynaptic catecholamine and serotonin stores; both of these drugs treat hemiballismus successfully but may cause depression, hypotension and parkinsonism. [...] Sodium valproate and clonazepam have been successful in a limited number of cases. Stereotactic ventral intermediate thalamotomy and use of a thalamic stimulator {{have been shown to be}} effective in treating these conditions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to most other neuroleptics which block both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, <b>sulpiride</b> is more selective and acts {{primarily as a}} dopamine D2 antagonist. <b>Sulpiride</b> appears to lack effects on norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine, or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulpiride</b> was {{discovered}} {{as a result}} of a research program by Justin-Besançon and C. Laville at Laboratoires Delagrange who were working to improve the anti-dysrhythmic properties of procainamide; the program led first to metoclopramide and later to <b>sulpiride.</b> Laboratoires Delagrange was acquired by Synthelabo in 1991 which eventually became part of Sanofi.|$|E
50|$|The benzamide neuroleptics (including <b>sulpiride,</b> amisulpride, and sultopride) {{have been}} shown to {{activate}} the endogenous gamma-hydroxybutyrate receptor in vivo at therapeutic concentrations. <b>Sulpiride</b> was found in one study in rats to upregulate GHB receptors. GHB has neuroleptic properties and it is believed binding to this receptor may contribute to the effects of these neuroleptics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sulpiride</b> is a {{selective}} antagonist at dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. This action dominates in doses exceeding 600 mg daily. In doses of 600 to 1,600 mg <b>sulpiride</b> shows mild sedating and antipsychotic activity. Its antipsychotic potency compared to chlorpromazine is only 0.2 (1/5). In low doses (in particular 50 to 200 mg daily) its prominent feature is antagonism of presynaptic inhibitory dopamine receptors accounting for some antidepressant activity and a stimulating effect. Therefore, {{it is in}} these doses used as a second line antidepressant. Additionally, it alleviates vertigo.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sulpiride</b> can be {{synthesized}} from 5-aminosulfosalicylic acid. Methylating {{this with}} dimethylsulfate gives 2-methoxy-5-aminosulfonylbenzoic acid, which {{is transformed into}} an amide using 2-aminomethyl-1-ethylpyrrolidine as the amine component and carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) as a condensing agent.|$|E

Levosulpiride is its purified levo-isomer and is sold in India for similar purpose. So far it has not been approved in the United States, Canada and Australia. The drug is chemically and clinically similar to amisulpride.|$|E
5000|$|Pregnancy: Animal studies did {{not reveal}} any {{embryotoxicity}} or fetotoxicity, nor did limited human experience. Due to insufficient human data, pregnant women should be treated with <b>sulpiride</b> only if strictly indicated. Additionally, the newborns of treated women should be monitored, because isolated cases of extrapyramidal side effects have been reported.|$|E
50|$|Lactation failure can {{be treated}} with a galactagogue (lactation-promoting agent) such as a D2 {{receptor}} antagonist like domperidone, metoclopramide, or certain antipsychotics like chlorpromazine, haloperidol, <b>sulpiride,</b> or risperidone, an oxytocic such as oxytocin or an analogue like carbetocin or demoxytocin, with GH (or potentially with a growth hormone secretagogue, alternatively), or with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).|$|E
5000|$|Dopamine {{receptor}} antagonists including typical antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine), fluphenazine, haloperidol (Haldol), loxapine, molindone, perphenazine, pimozide, thioridazine, thiothixene, and trifluoperazine, the atypical antipsychotics such as amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine (Seroquel), risperidone (Risperdal), <b>sulpiride,</b> and ziprasidone, and antiemetics like domperidone, metoclopramide, and prochlorperazine, among others, {{which are}} used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as antipsychotics, and nausea and vomiting.|$|E
5000|$|Although it is {{considered}} a [...] "safe" [...] medicine, it is, like <b>sulpiride,</b> strictly contraindicated for patients {{under the age of}} 18 due to its effects during the process of puberty. This is likely related to its side effects on levels of the hormone prolactin, which is involved in sexual development. There are also insufficient clinical data on the other side effects in adolescents.|$|E
50|$|Tiapride is a {{drug that}} {{selectively}} blocks D2 and D3 dopamine receptors in the brain. It is used to treat a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders including dyskinesia, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, negative symptoms of psychosis, and agitation and aggression in the elderly. A derivative of benzamide, tiapride is chemically and functionally similar to other benzamide antipsychotics such as <b>sulpiride</b> and amisulpride known for their dopamine antagonist effects.|$|E
50|$|Sultopride (trade names Barnetil, Barnotil, Topral) is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic of the benzamide {{chemical class}} used in Europe, Japan, and Hong Kong {{for the treatment}} of schizophrenia. It was launched by Sanofi-Aventis in 1976. Sultopride acts as a selective D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It has also been shown to have clinically relevant affinity for the GHB receptor as well, a property it shares in common with amisulpride and <b>sulpiride.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{often an}} {{isolated}} condition, ALO sometimes occurs {{in conjunction with}} blepharospasm which may complicate the diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, several diseases as well as medications {{have been reported in}} association with ALO. It has been reported in cases of extrapyramidal disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, parkinsonism, progressive supranuclear palsy, hydrocephalus, motor neuron disease, Shy-Drager syndrome and various lesions in the brain. Medications that have been associated include lithium, <b>sulpiride,</b> and a meperidine analog, 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine.|$|E
50|$|Sulpiride's {{primary use}} in {{medicine}} {{is in the}} management of the symptoms of schizophrenia. It has been used as both a monotherapy and adjunctive therapy (in case of treatment-resistance) in schizophrenia. It has also been used in the treatment of dysthymia. Augmentation with <b>sulpiride</b> has also been tried as a strategy for accelerating antidepressant response in patients with major depressive disorder. There is also evidence of its efficacy in treating panic disorder.|$|E
5000|$|Metoclopramide {{was first}} {{described}} by Louis Justin-Besançon and Charles Laville in 1964, while {{working to improve}} the anti-dysrhythmic properties of procainamide. [...] That research project also produced the product <b>sulpiride.</b> [...] The first clinical trials were published by Tourneu et al. in 1964 and by Boisson and Albot in 1966. [...] Justin-Besançon and Laville worked for Laboratoires Delagrange [...] and that company introduced the drug as Primperan in 1964. Laboratoires Delagrange was acquired by Synthelabo in 1991 which eventually became part of Sanofi.|$|E
50|$|DNMT inhibitors {{have also}} been shown to {{increase}} levels of the reeling protein and GAD67 in cell cultures. Some of the current DNMT inhibitors, however, like zebularine and procainamide, do not cross the blood brain barrier and would not prove as effective a treatment. While DNMT inhibitors would prevent the addition of a methyl group, there is also research done on DNA demethylate inducers, which would pharmacologically induce the removal of methyl groups. Current antipsychotic drugs, like clozapine and <b>sulpiride,</b> have been shown to also induce demethylation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulpiride</b> has a {{relatively}} low order of acute toxicity. Substantial amounts may cause severe but reversible dystonic crises with torticollis, protrusion of the tongue, and/or trismus. In some cases all the classical symptoms typical of severe Parkinson's disease may be noted; in others, over-sedation/coma may occur. The treatment is largely symptomatic. Some or all extrapyramidal reactions may respond to the application of anticholinergic drugs such as biperiden or benzatropine. All patients should be closely monitored for signs of long QT syndrome and severe arrhythmias.|$|E
50|$|Due to neuroferritinopathy’s genetic etiology, the {{disorder}} is not currently curable. Furthermore, progression of {{the disorder}} is unable to be effectively halted. Therefore current treatment focuses on managing symptoms of the disorder. No medication is available to treat all symptoms. Botox {{has been shown to}} help with focal dystonia. The dopamine depleter Tetrabenazine shown to help with involuntary movements. Symptoms affecting movement (dystonia) have also been treated with L-Dopa, orphenadrine, benzhexol, <b>sulpiride,</b> diazepam, clonazepam, and deanol. Parkinsonian symptoms were not decreased by L-Dopa. Iron supplements should be avoided.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{side effects}} {{have also been}} {{reported}} when taking atypical antipsychotics. In males antipsychotics reduce sexual interest, impair sexual performance with the main difficulties being failure to ejaculate. In females there may be abnormal menstrual cycles and infertility. In {{both males and females}} the breasts may become enlarged and a fluid will sometimes ooze from the nipples. Sexual adverse effects caused by some anti-psychotics are a result of an increase of prolactin. <b>Sulpiride</b> and Amisulpiride and in less extense Risperdone and paliperidone cause a high increase of prolactin.|$|E
50|$|In several {{clinical}} trials, clocapramine {{has been}} compared to other neuroleptic agents. Against haloperidol, though {{there was no significant difference}} in efficacy at the end of the study, clocapramine tended to be superior in alleviating motor retardation, alogia, and thought disorder, and also produced fewer side effects. Against <b>sulpiride,</b> clocapramine demonstrated more favorable effects in the treatment of both positive and negative symptoms, including motor retardation, delusions, hallucinations, and social isolation, though it produced more side effects. Against timiperone, clocapramine showed lower efficacy against both positive and negative symptoms and produced more side effects such as dyskinesia, insomnia, constipation, and nausea.|$|E
50|$|According to the {{epigenetic}} hypothesis, {{drugs that}} shift {{the balance in}} favour of demethylation have a potential to alleviate the proposed methylation-caused downregulation of RELN and GAD67. In one study, clozapine and <b>sulpiride</b> but not haloperidol and olanzapine were shown to increase the demethylation of both genes in mice pretreated with l-methionine. Valproic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, when taken in combination with antipsychotics, is proposed to have some benefits. But there are studies conflicting the main premise of the epigenetic hypothesis, and a study by Fatemi et al. shows no increase in RELN expression by valproic acid; that indicates {{the need for further}} investigation.|$|E
50|$|In a 2013 {{study in}} a {{comparison}} of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, amisulpride was ranked second, demonstrating high effectiveness. 11% more effective than olanzapine (3rd), 32-35% more effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, and 25% less effective than clozapine (1st). Although according to other studies {{it appears to have}} comparable efficacy to olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia. Amisulpride augmentation, similarly to <b>sulpiride</b> augmentation, has been considered a viable treatment option (although this is based on low-quality evidence) in clozapine-resistant cases of schizophrenia. Another recent study concluded that amisulpride is an appropriate first-line treatment for the management of acute psychosis.|$|E
50|$|Amisulpride is an {{antipsychotic}} medication used {{to treat}} schizophrenia. In Italy, it is also used {{as a treatment for}} dysthymia. It is usually classed with the newer generation of antipsychotics, the so called atypical antipsychotics. Chemically it is a benzamide and like other benzamide antipsychotics, such as <b>sulpiride,</b> it is associated with a high risk of elevating blood levels of the lactation hormone, prolactin (thereby potentially causing the absence of the menstrual cycle, breast enlargement, even in males, breast milk secretion not related to breastfeeding, impaired fertility, impotence, breast pain, etc.), and a low risk, relative to the typical antipsychotics, of causing movement disorders. It has also been found to be slightly more effective in treating schizophrenia than the typical antipsychotics.|$|E
50|$|Atypical {{antipsychotics}} are {{the second}} generation, {{and serve as}} an alternative method of treating tics. These medications have more selective dopamine blocking effects, or block serotonin with some blocking of dopamine. The medications in this class used to treat tics include risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, clozapine, aripiprazole, tiapride, and <b>sulpiride.</b> Atypical antipsychotics appear to have lower risks of neurological side effects such as tardive dyskinesia when used short-term, but longer trials are needed to confirm this. Some of the side effects associated with these medications are insomnia, weight gain, and school phobia. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and increased risk of diabetes are concerns with these medications. There is empirical support {{for the use of}} risperidone, and less support for the others.|$|E
