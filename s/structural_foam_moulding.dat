40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{research}} project Hybridmould 21, studies on the mouldability of <b>structural</b> <b>foams</b> using hybrid <b>moulds</b> have been carried out. Hybrid injection moulds are an increasingly considered alternative for prototype series or short production runs of large dimension parts. In this solution for injection moulds the moulding elements (blocks or other inserts) are manufactured in alternative metallic materials or in synthetic materials typically using rapid prototyping techniques. <b>Structural</b> <b>foams,</b> known since the 70 s, are moulded by injection moulding without using the high pressures typically used in injection moulding. The formation of the <b>structural</b> <b>foam</b> results from the dispersed gaseous phase, which derives from the expansion of a chemical blowing agent usually compounded in a compatible masterbatch. In this project various thermoplastics and thermosets were used, namely, PP, ABS and PUR, us-ing a hybrid mould instrumented for the monitoring of temperature, pressure and expansion force. The mould-ing block was manufactured by vacuum casting of an epoxy composite. In this paper are mainly discussed the results obtained on liquid injection moulding polyurethane resins in the hybrid mould. QREN contract 2010 / 013307 – Project Hybridmould 2...|$|R

40|$|Integral <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> (IFM) is an {{economical}} way {{to produce}} castings with integrated cellular structure, i. e. a solid {{skin and a}} foamed core. IFM {{has been known for}} polymers for more than four decades and is well established in industrial production. Polymer integral foam parts are accepted as a material system with own properties which simplifies designs, reduces production costs and weight, and increases stiffness and overall strength. On the other hand, integral <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> for metals is a new field of research. The development of metal based integral <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> processes at WTM moves along analogous paths as that of polymers by transferring and adapting successful moulding technologies for polymer integral foam to metals. Two moulding techniques for metal integral foam are presented, a low and a high pressure process. In the low pressure process, the molten metal charged with blowing agent is injected into a permanent steel mould without completely filling it. In this case, the mould gets eventually filled by foam expansion. In the high pressure process foaming is initiated by expansion of the mould cavity after it has been filled completely with the mixture of the metal melt and the blowing agent. The moulded parts are characterized with respect to their cellular structure, density profile and pore size distribution. Mechanical properties such as stiffness and damping behaviour are discussed.

40|$|This is {{a journal}} article. It was {{published}} in the journal, Plastics, rubber and composites : macromolecular engineering [© Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining] and is also available at: [URL] polyurethane (PU) <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> process involves the use of sacrificial release agents (SRAs) that are both costly and harmful to the environment. This research proposes the use of low surface energy, polymer substrates, as a means of eliminating SRAs from the <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> process. Previous work identified the major factors affecting the ability of a polymer surface to release a PU foam part as being the surface energy and surface roughness of the substrate, and the proportion of isocyanate in the foam. The research described here has built upon these results and quantified the effects of each factor by using a D optimal design of experiment structure. Crucially it has also been shown that, given the surface energy of a polymer substrate, its roughness and the composition of the foam, it is possible to predict whether or not unaided release should be possible, and a model has been produced in order to allow this prediction for the foams under consideration. This capability will provide the PU <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> industry with the possibility of identifying polymeric mould materials, and levels of finishing for these moulds, which have the potential to allow the elimination of SRAs from the production process...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of large plastic parts, in small series and at low cost, requires {{the development of}} alternative tools and materials. <b>Structural</b> <b>foams</b> (SF) are a good solution, when the {{production of}} thicker parts with good properties is the specification. They allow obtaining lightweight parts with high stiffness and good dimensional stability, due to their sandwich-like structure constituted by a cellular core and two solid skins. The porous core results from {{the addition of a}} blowing agent in the polymeric matrix. These materials are applied in urban furniture, automotive, nautical and aerospace industries. The most used process to produce SF is the low pressure <b>foam</b> <b>moulding,</b> which is a short shot process, with impression pressures below 4 MPa. Thus, the use of hybrid moulds with moulding blocks obtained by rapid prototyping routes is seen as a viable alternative for SF injection moulding. This work reports on a study of the influence of processing conditions on the aesthetical, morphological, and mechanical properties of SF mouldings of high-impact polystyrene (HIPS-SF). The results compare the effect of the use of hybrid moulds to conventional moulds on the surface aspect of the circular centre gated mouldings.
