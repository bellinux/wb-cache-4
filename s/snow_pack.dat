5|$|The cirque where Castle Lake {{is found}} {{is a classic}} Northern Hemisphere cirque. The cirque {{headwall}} (the highest part of the mountain where the glacier began to form) was in the south or southwest, and {{the part of the}} mountain that sloped downward to the northeast was away from the prevailing winds. The resulting shaded area was sheltered from direct sun, and from the evaporating effects of wind. These conditions encouraged snow which had fallen in the winter to remain throughout the summer and fall, creating a year-round <b>snow</b> <b>pack</b> which grew deeper each year.|$|E
5|$|It {{also has}} a more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the <b>snow</b> <b>pack</b> {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E
5|$|Many day hikes can {{be taken}} in the park. Back-country camping is allowed at campsites along the trails. A permit is {{required}} and {{can be obtained from}} certain visitor centers or arranged for in advance. Much of Glacier's back country is usually inaccessible to hikers until early June due to accumulated <b>snow</b> <b>pack</b> and avalanche risk, and many trails at higher altitudes remain snow packed until July. Campgrounds that allow vehicle access are found throughout the park, most of which are near one of the larger lakes. The campgrounds at St. Mary and at Apgar are open year-round, but conditions are primitive in the off-season, as the restroom facilities are closed and there is no running water. All campgrounds with vehicle access are usually open from mid-June until mid-September. Guide and shuttle services are also available.|$|E

40|$|Snow {{roots are}} {{specialized}} structures recently {{discovered in the}} Caucasian alpine snow-bed plant Corydalis conorhiza. They form extensive networks that grow into <b>snow</b> <b>packs</b> against gravity, most probably to gather nitrogen from snow. Here we test the hypothesis that snow roots are true winter organs, i. e., they should already start growth early in winter to lay down the infrastructure for N capture from <b>snow</b> <b>packs</b> well before their melt-out. This would require winter surface and soil temperatures continuously close to or above freezing. Excavations of snow roots from <b>snow</b> <b>packs</b> in January and May, accompanied by temperature recordings and anatomical observations, supported our hypothesis. These findings complete the annual cycle of snow root phenology. They also emphasize the evolutionary and ecological significance of these specialized winter organs. Moreover, their likely association with a particular abiotic temperature and snow regime will facilitate the search for snow roots in other species. Â© 2013 The Ecological Society of Japan...|$|R
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1852, McClellan {{published}} a manual on bayonet tactics that he had translated from the original French. He also received an assignment to the Department of Texas, with orders to perform a survey of Texas rivers and harbors. In 1853 he participated in the Pacific Railroad surveys, ordered by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, to select an appropriate route for the planned transcontinental railroad. McClellan surveyed the western portion of the northern corridor along the 47th and 49th parallels from St. Paul to the Puget Sound. In so doing he demonstrated a tendency for insubordination toward senior political figures. Isaac Stevens, governor of the Washington Territory, became dissatisfied with McClellan's performance in scouting passes across the Cascade Range. McClellan selected Yakima Pass without a thorough reconnaissance and refused the governor's order to lead a party through it in winter conditions, relying on faulty intelligence about the depth of <b>snow</b> <b>pack</b> in that area. In so doing, he missed three greatly superior passes in the near vicinity, {{which would be the}} ones eventually used for railroads and interstate highways. The governor ordered McClellan to turn over his expedition logbooks, but McClellan steadfastly refused, most likely because of embarrassing personal comments that he had made throughout.|$|E

50|$|An unusual {{confluence}} of weather events made the floods particularly severe. The winter preceding the floods had produced abnormally high rainfall and relatively low snowfall. The heavy rains saturated ground soil and raised river levels throughout January 1996. In late January, a heavy snowstorm padded <b>snow</b> <b>packs</b> throughout the region. This {{was followed by}} a deep freeze that lasted for six to ten days. The new layer of snow was quickly melted by a warm subtropical jetstream which arrived on February 6. The jetstream brought along further rains. The combination of the additional rain, the saturated ground, and the melting <b>snow</b> <b>packs</b> engorged dozens of streams and tributaries, which in turn flooded into the region's major rivers.|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{studies show}} that the darkening of snow and ice by black carbon (BC) {{deposition}} is a major factor for the rapid disappearance of arctic sea ice, mountain glaciers and <b>snow</b> <b>packs.</b> This study provides one of the first direct measurements for the efficient removal of black carbon from the atmosphere by snow and its subsequent deposition on the <b>snow</b> <b>packs</b> of California. The early melting of the <b>snow</b> <b>packs</b> in the Sierras is one of the contributing factors to the severe water problems in California. BC concentrations in falling snow were measured at two mountain locations and in rain at a coastal site. All three stations reveal large BC concentrations in precipitation, ranging from 1. 7 ng/g to 12. 9 ng/g. The BC concentrations in the air after the snow fall were negligible suggesting an extremely efficient removal of BC by snow. The data suggest that below cloud scavenging, rather than ice nuclei, was the dominant source of BC in the snow. A five-year comparison of BC, dust, and total fine aerosol mass concentrations at multiple sites reveals that the measurements made at the sampling sites were representative of large scale deposition in the Sierra Nevada. The relative concentration of iron and calcium in the mountain aerosol indicates that one-quarter to one-third of the BC may have been transported from Asia...|$|R

25|$|The Tongue River is fed by winter <b>snow</b> <b>pack</b> {{from the}} higher {{elevations}} of the Big Horn Mountains, early snow runoff {{of the lower}} elevations in the drainage basin, and ground water from springs in the drainage basin. The river rises in March and April due to snowmelt in the lower elevations, and again in June as summer weather melts the higher elevation <b>snow</b> <b>pack.</b> The flow {{of water in the}} upper river during the summer is generally steady, but in the later months of a dry summer, irrigation will reduce the lower river to a few pools of water connected by a small trickle. The river is generally frozen during the winter months.|$|E
25|$|When skiing, the {{friction}} between the snow and skis causes wax to abrade and remain in the <b>snow</b> <b>pack</b> until spring thaw. Then the snowmelt drains into watersheds, streams, lakes and rivers, thereby changing the chemistry {{of the environment and}} the food chain. Perfluorocarbons in ski wax are heat resistant, chemically and biologically stable, and thus environmentally persistent.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} subject to {{flooding}} due to high rainfall amounts {{and some of the}} deepest <b>snow</b> <b>packs</b> in the country, sometimes triggered by a Pineapple Express, a weather pattern that brings central Pacific wind and rain to the northwest.

50|$|American Pinyon pine cone {{production}} is most commonly found at an elevation between 6,000 ft and 8,500 ft, and ideally at 7,000 ft. This {{is due to}} higher temperatures at elevations lower than 6,000 ft during the spring, which dry up humidity and moisture content (particularly <b>snow</b> <b>packs)</b> that provide for the tree throughout the spring and summer, causing little nourishment for pine cone maturity.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} very young (0. 2 Ma) and well {{preserved}} deposits of water bearing debris flows in Istok crater, Mars. Debris flows postdate the latest dust-ice mantle emplacement.

25|$|On February 28, 2011, the North Fork Creek, part {{of which}} runs beneath the Lehman's store, overflowed its banks, flash {{flooding}} the store. The 50-year flood was caused by thawing temperatures, an ice and <b>snow</b> <b>pack</b> that clogged a five-foot culvert that drained water away from the store site, and a storm that brought 1/2 inch of rain in less than 15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|These factors {{contribute}} to the metamorphism of snow, i.e. the process of reshaping snow crystals into smaller, more rounded ice grains, which in turn consolidates and settles the <b>snow</b> <b>pack.</b> Increased density increases strength by joining of grains though sintering and freezing of melted water. New-fallen snow may have a density of 150 - 200kg/m3. Whereas a snowmobile can pack snow to a density of 300 - 350kg/m3, the densities required for recreational trails are 450kg/m3 and for racing, 500kg/m3 or higher.|$|E
5000|$|Retreat of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan glaciers and <b>snow</b> <b>packs.</b> The {{cause is}} {{attributed}} to rising air temperatures that are more pronounced in elevated regions, a combined warming effect of greenhouse gases and the Asian Brown Cloud.

25|$|Grooming {{attachments}} â Attachments {{for large}} groomers include: a front blade, a tiller, a renovator and track setter. The leading front blade repositions snow {{in front of}} the machine for trailing equipment to recondition. The renovator digs into the <b>snow</b> <b>pack</b> to aerate and mix the old and new snow up to 30cm deep, as needed. The tiller attached behind the machine conditions the snow into aa soft, granular consistency, ready for its comb, which packs the snow into a finished surface. For setting classic tracks, the groomer trails special pans, which mould the tracks. Attachments for snowmobiles perform the same functions at a smaller scale and include a roller to compact the snow over a wide swath and a drag to level the snow behind the roller.|$|E
25|$|Extreme flood events often {{result from}} {{coincidence}} such as unusually intense, warm rainfall melting heavy <b>snow</b> <b>pack,</b> producing channel obstructions from floating ice, and releasing small impoundments like beaver dams. Coincident events may cause extensive flooding {{to be more}} frequent than anticipated from simplistic statistical prediction models considering only precipitation runoff flowing within unobstructed drainage channels. Debris modification of channel geometry is common when heavy flows move uprooted woody vegetation and flood-damaged structures and vehicles, including boats and railway equipment. Recent field measurements during the 2010â11 Queensland floods showed that any criterion solely based upon the flow velocity, water depth or specific momentum cannot account for the hazards caused by velocity and water depth fluctuations. These considerations ignore further {{the risks associated with}} large debris entrained by the flow motion.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 Halloween {{blizzard}} was {{a powerful}} storm that caused a period of heavy snowfall and ice accumulation, which affected parts of the Upper Midwest of the United States, from October 31 to November 3, 1991. Over {{the last week of}} October 1991 a large storm system over the Atlantic Ocean (1991 Perfect Storm) blocked most of the weather patterns over the eastern half of the United States, and in turn moisture from the Gulf of Mexico was funneled straight northward over the affected region. By the time the precipitation stopped falling many cities in the eastern half of Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin had witnessed record early-season snowfall accumulations, while parts of southern Minnesota and northern Iowa were crippled by a large ice storm. Arctic air that was pulled southward behind the storm had combined with the heavy <b>snow</b> <b>pack</b> to produce many record low temperatures. Between the blizzard and the ice storm 22people were killed and over 100 were injured.|$|E

25|$|The Great Plains {{ecoregion}} comprises {{a number}} of water bodies which play an integral role in its unique hydrology. There are thirteen rivers that {{are considered to be}} located within the Great Plains region. Most of the rivers that originate in the Rocky Mountain region in the west are a source of irrigation for farms. These rivers benefit greatly from melted <b>snow</b> <b>pack</b> from the mountains, which feeds the rivers during the growing season. Another water source in the Great Plains is wetlands, with the greatest concentrations located in the northern glaciated region of the plains. Up to half of areas in the northern Great Plains are wetlands. These, as well as the wetlands in the Nebraska Sandhills, serve as major breeding, staging, and nesting habitat for migratory waterfowl. Playas, or temporary lakes, in the southwestern United States also provide habitats for migrating waterfowl from Canada and the United States during the winter.|$|E
25|$|On Nunivak, most {{indigenous}} {{plants were}} traditionally gathered {{by women and}} children when the men were harvesting other available resources (e.g., caribou, waterfowl, seal). While fresh spring greens provided a welcome addition to the diet, which in winter was based largely on dried and stored foods, other greens were harvested throughout the year as they ripened, and used {{with some of those}} stored for winter use. With the melting of the island's <b>snow</b> <b>pack,</b> local greens and berries not picked during the previous fall's harvest, begin to appear and were added to the local diet. Depending on the time the ice pack began to break up, Cup'ig families would leave their winter villages and move to spring seal camps. Cup'ig men would journey out along the ice to harvest arriving sea mammals (i.e., seals, walrus) while the women would spend much of their time harvesting available plant resources (greens and seaweeds) and shellfish. Early spring plants included: marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), sour dock (Rumex arcticus), wild celery (Angelica lucida), wild lettuce (Draba borealis or D. hyperborea), wild parsnip (Ligusticum hultonii), wild rhubarb (Polygonum viviparum), mountain sorrel (Oxyria digylla), Pallas buttercup (Ranunculus pallasii), and Labrador tea (Ledum pallustre decumbens).|$|E
