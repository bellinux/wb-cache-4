However, it quickly becomes lost in the strip mines of the area. The creek resurfaces in an iron-filled pool west of Interstate 81. It runs west through another <b>strip</b> <b>mine</b> before passing into Schuylkill County.|$|E

The ground {{movement}} laws due to wide <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> under deep-lying seams {{has been}} studied with the experiment of similar material model, {{and the results of}} experiment could analysis qualitatively that it is feasible for wide <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> under deep-lying seams. Taking 25 mining area of Hemei 9 th mine as geologic background, the model of wide <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> under deep seams has been made, which was used to study on the deformation of overburden and the ground movement laws. The results of experiment show that the properties and thickness of strata play a control role on the deformation, and the key strata play a core role; the deformation was dispersed with wide <b>strip</b> <b>mining.</b> When the width of <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> and protective coal pillar are scientific and reasonable, the purpose of increasing the width of <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> under the condition of controlling deformation could be achieved, and the entire mining area would be formed a flat subsidence basin. These achievements provide a scientific basis for solving the problem for the ground buildings protection in the conditions of wide <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> under deep-lying seams, and that also provide some references for further studying on the method of wide <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> under deep-lying seams...|$|R

5|$|At 10:03:11, near Indian Lake and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, {{the plane}} {{crashed into a}} field near a {{reclaimed}} coal <b>strip</b> <b>mine</b> known as the Diamond T. Mine owned by PBS Coals in Stonycreek Township in Somerset County. The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the flight impacted at 563mph (906km/h, 252m/s, or 489 knots) at a 40-degree nose-down, inverted attitude. The impact left a crater eight to ten feet deep (c. 3m), and 30 to 50 feet wide (c. 12m). All 44 people on board died. Many media reports and eyewitness accounts said {{the time of the}} crash was 10:06 or 10:10; an initial analysis of seismographic data in the area concluded that the crash occurred at 10:06, but the 9/11 Commission report states that this analysis was not definitive and was retracted. Other media outlets and the 9/11 Commission reported the time of impact as 10:03, based on when the flight recorders stopped, analysis of radar data, infrared satellite data, and air traffic control transmissions.|$|E

In total, 19 of the 50 strikebreakers died during the massacre, and another was murdered shortly after.

No action was taken to enforce a truce.|$|E
25|$|Strip mining {{eliminates}} existing vegetation, {{destroys the}} genetic soil profile, displaces or destroys wildlife and habitat, alters current land uses, {{and to some}} extent permanently changes the general topography of the area mined. Adverse impacts on geological features of human interest may occur in a coal <b>strip</b> <b>mine.</b> Geomorphic and geophysical features and outstanding scenic resources may be sacrificed by indiscriminate mining. Paleontological, cultural, and other historic values may be endangered due to the disruptive activities of blasting, ripping, and excavating coal. Stripping of overburden eliminates and destroys archeological and historic features, unless they are removed beforehand.|$|E
25|$|On April 1, 1922 the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) began a {{nationwide}} strike {{against the man}} with a mask, (A.K.A. Bloody Williamson). W. J. Lester, owner of the Southern Illinois Coal Company, operated a <b>strip</b> <b>mine</b> about halfway between Herrin and Marion, Illinois. Lester at first complied with the strike. He had only recently opened the mine, and massive startup debts made him negotiate with the UMWA to allow his mine to remain open, as long as no coal was shipped out. Under the agreement, some United Mine Workers members were allowed to continue working during the strike. Lester told an associate that local union leaders were friendly with him; however, he was warned this did not mean he had any control over the ordinary members.|$|E

25|$|The second Campbell County {{victim was}} found on April 3, 1985, but her hair color is unknown, which does not {{immediately}} indicate she {{was a victim of}} the Redhead Murderer. She was believed to have died between 1981 and 1984, one to four years before. Unlike the other victims, she was younger, between 9 and 15, when the others were estimated to be over 16. She was located by a passerby about 200 yards off Big Wheel Gap Road, four miles southwest of Jellico in Campbell County, some distance from interstate 75, near a <b>strip</b> <b>mine.</b> The cause of this girl's death is unknown, as her remains were partial, but still may be homicide. Thirty-two bones, including her skull, were all that were recovered from the scene. Her skull allowed facial reconstruction. She wore a necklace and bracelet made of plastic buttons from clothing. There were a pair of boots recovered that were size 5, which may not belong to the victim, and a few scraps of clothing. Due to the condition of her body, her height, weight, eye color and hair color were not possible to estimate.|$|E
25|$|Thousands of coal {{fires are}} burning around the world. Those burning {{underground}} {{can be difficult}} to locate and many cannot be extinguished. Fires can cause the ground above to subside, their combustion gases are dangerous to life, and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface wildfires. Coal seams can be set on fire by spontaneous combustion or contact with a mine fire or surface fire. Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition. The coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen (air) can no longer reach the flame front. A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire. Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO2, amounting to 2â€“3% of the annual worldwide production of CO2 from fossil fuels. In Centralia, Pennsylvania (a borough located in the Coal Region of the United States), an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill, located in an abandoned anthracite <b>strip</b> <b>mine</b> pit. Attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and it continues to burn underground to this day. The Australian Burning Mountain was originally believed to be a volcano, but the smoke and ash come from a coal fire that has been burning for some 6,000 years.|$|E
