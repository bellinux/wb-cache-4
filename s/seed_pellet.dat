40|$|The {{effect of}} initial {{inoculum}} {{density of the}} antagonistic bacterial strains Pseudomonas fluorescens 135 and Pseudomonas corrugata 2140 (10 (3) to 10 (8) CFU per <b>seed</b> <b>pellet)</b> on sugar beet seedling colonisation, in situ bioluminescence and antagonistic activity towards Pythium ultimum was investigated. Populations of the bacteria colonising sugar beet root systems approached an apparent carrying capacity of 10 (5) to 10 (6) CFU per plant after 12 d growth, irrespective of inoculum density. This meant an up to 320 -fold population increase at low inoculum densities and a decrease at high densities. Population densities of both bacteria and their corresponding in situ bioluminescence (resulting from luciferase enzyme expression from the inserted luxAB genes) reached highest levels in the hypocotyl region and in the upper root region 0 - 20 mm below seed level (10 (4) - 10 (6) CFU/cm section, 10 (1) - 10 (3) RLU/cm section) and decreased with root depth. In situ bioluminescence, which indicates physiological activity, was measurable at lowest antagonist initial inoculum density (10 (3) CFU per <b>seed</b> <b>pellet)</b> and did not increase significantly with increasing inoculum density. Bioluminescence was also significantly correlated with population density. For Pseudomonas fluorescens B 5, the total population size per plant and downward colonisation of the root (below 40 mm depth) increased significantly with antagonist inoculum density applied to the seeds. For Pseudomonas corrugata 2140, no significant influence of initial inoculum density on root colonisation was observable. Survival and dry weight of sugar beet seedlings in Pythium infested soil increased significantly with increasing inoculum density of Pseudomonas fluorescens B 5, whereas for Pseudomonas corrugata 2140, initial densities of 10 (4) to 10 (6) CFU per seed resulted in maximal survival of plants...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas putida 40 RNF {{applied to}} seed pellets reduced the {{occurrence}} of Pythium damping-off of sugar beet. A density of 6 × 107 40 RNF per pellet reduced Pythium damping-off from 70 to 26 % when seeds were sown in artificially infested soil (250 propagules Pythium ultimum per g dry soil). The efficacy of 40 RNF was dependent on its density in the <b>seed</b> <b>pellet</b> (in the range 2 × 104 - 6 × 108 per pellet) and {{on the number of}} propagules of Pythium in soil. 40 RNF declined to or stabilized at approximately 1 × 106 per pellet 3 days after planting, and this was independent of the inoculum density. This indicated that the crucial steps resulting in damping-off of sugar beet caused by Pythium ultimum must occur within 3 - 4 days of sowing. 40 RNF reduced pericarp colonization by P. ultimum by 43 % 48 h after planting and caused a 68 % {{decrease in the number of}} sporangia of P. ultimum in the surrounding soil (0. 0 - 5. 0 mm). P. putida 40 RNF also reduced pre and post-emergence damping-off (from 69. 5 to 37. 5 %) caused by indigenous populations of Pythium species in an infested soil and this was as effective as the fungicide hymexazol (69. 5 to 40 %) ...|$|E

Pigs fed meal and pelleted diets containing sunflower seeds roasted to a roaster exit temperature of 264 of (low roast) were more efficient (F/G) than pigs fed raw sunflower seed diets in meal form. Pelleting raw, low roast, and high roast sunflower seed diets significantly improved F/G compared to raw sunflower seed and basal diets fed in meal form. These results indicate that meal diets containing 25 % low roasted sunflower <b>seeds</b> or <b>pelleted</b> diets containing 25 % raw or low roasted sunflower seeds can be fed to weaned pigs with no reduction in performance...|$|R
50|$|Blowguns are {{depicted}} in paintings on pre-Columbian pottery and are mentioned in many Mesoamerican myths. Back then and today, the Maya use a blowgun to hunt birds and small animals with spherical dry <b>seeds</b> and clay <b>pellets.</b> The clay ammunition is made {{slightly larger than}} needed (to allow for shrinkage and refinement) and stored in a shoulderbag. The outside of the dry clay pellet is shaved off and burnished right before use.|$|R

Since physics never {{works for}} the coyote, he uses it as a weapon by baiting the Road Runner's bird <b>seed</b> with iron <b>pellets</b> and {{mounting}} a bomb and a magnet on an old-fashioned clamp-on roller skate; however, the magnetic force {{is strong enough to}} separate the skate into two pieces, leaving the bomb close to the coyote. A puzzled Wile E. pokes his head up from his hiding place and is obliterated by the bomb.|$|R
40|$|Hydroxyapatite (HA) {{is widely}} being {{researched}} for hard tissue replacement for its good osseointegration and biocompatibility property. However, the inferior antibacterial property of HA {{often results in}} infection at host site, and this leads to rejection of the implant. The antibacterial property of silver (Ag) is well known {{and in the past}} decade or so, the application of Ag is reinvented in medicinal applications like catheters, vascular grafts and orthopaedic implants. In this respect, the present work reports the synthesis of Ag doped HA using hot pressing in argon atmosphere. This work also reports the effect of HA-Ag composition on bacterial colonisation during in vitro study. The bactericidal property of Ag doped HA has been investigated against magnetotactic bacteria, a `magnetite' containing bacteria. Magnetotactic bacteria were <b>seeded</b> onto <b>pellets,</b> and the adhesion of bacteria was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. It was confirmed that incorporation of Ag in HA leads to improved bactericidal property...|$|R
