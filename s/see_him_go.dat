25|$|On May 1, 1862, Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler, with {{an army of}} 5,000 men, {{occupied}} the city of New Orleans without resistance. Butler was a former Democratic party official, lawyer, and state legislator. General Butler {{was one of the}} first Major Generals of Volunteers of the Civil War appointed by Abraham Lincoln. He had gained glory as a Massachusetts state militia general who had anticipated the war and carefully prepared his six militia regiments for the conflict. At the start of hostilities he immediately marched to the relief of Washington, D.C., and despite a lack of orders had occupied and restored order to Baltimore, Maryland. As a reward Butler was made commander of Fortress Monroe, on the Virginia Peninsula. There he gained further political renown as the first to practice confiscation of fugitive slaves as contraband of war. This practice was made a later policy of war by Congress. Due to these and other astute political maneuvers, Butler had been chosen to command the army expedition to New Orleans. Because of his lack of military experience and military success, many were happy to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E
500|$|Scheyer {{said his}} eye had healed from the {{traumatic}} injury that he {{suffered in the}} NBA Summer League. On March 14, he had a D-League career-high 21 points and 7 assists against Sioux Falls Skyforce, the next night he broke those personal records with 24 points and 8 assists, and four nights later he scored a new career-high 27 points which included five three-pointers. [...] In 24 regular and post-season games, he averaged 13.1 points, 4.0 assists, and 4.0 rebounds as the team finished the season as runner-up in the championship. [...] Coach K said: [...] "He got back on the horse. He did very well.... I'd like to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> play internationally and be a key guy." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{the episode}} {{exploring}} the new clairvoyant abilities of Negga's Raina, executive producer Maurissa Tancharoen noted {{the irony of}} this, as Raina {{had spent much of}} her time on the series obsessed with another character who she believed was clairvoyant. On the death of his character in the episode, Kassianides said, [...] "I'm sad to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>go,</b> [...] I'm happy to see someone like that get their comeuppance". Noting that the character was originally intended to be killed off in [...] "A Hen in the Wolf House", Kassianides felt that the way Bakshi and his relationships had developed throughout the season was [...] "fantastic" [...] and made the character's final sacrifice a much more [...] "beautiful" [...] death.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, it was {{reported}} that Wellard was to be killed off. A show insider explained: [...] "Wellard has been a much-loved character and everyone will be sad to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>go.</b> But if you think about it, Wellard was not a puppy when he arrived on Albert Square, so he would be over 100 in dog years by now. It makes sense for him to bow out of the show gracefully." [...] Raddings commented: [...] "I used to take Kyte on set everyday but I found the scenes when Wellard was put down too hard to watch so I asked someone else to take her to filming." [...] The scene in which Wellard was euthanised had to be re-edited, as Kyte could be seen breathing when supposedly dead. At the time of his death, Wellard had been in EastEnders for 14 years, making him one of the show's longest-running characters, and its longest-serving pet.|$|E
500|$|While Rochussen {{had been}} glad to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>go,</b> {{back in the}} Netherlands van Hoëvell fared better politically. He was vindicated when the {{government}} canceled the acceptance of his forced resignation, and he was cleared of any wrongdoing in the events of May 1848. The publication of the Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië, which had stopped at his expulsion from Batavia, was resumed in 1849, now in a less repressive environment. For some pamphlets, he used the pseudonym Jeronymus. In September 1849, {{he was elected to}} the House of Representatives of the Netherlands for the Liberal party and he remained a member of parliament until 1862. He was one of only a handful of Dutch parliamentarians who had actually been to the East Indies, and often spoke eloquently on colonial matters in parliament. He became [...] "one of the most ferocious critics" [...] of the Cultivation System, the government-run system (already criticized by W.Bosch and others) that demanded that the local peasantry set aside a significant portion of their land to grow crops for the Dutch to export. Van Hoëvell was a proponent of private ownership, and argued that the system, besides being immoral, was also economically ineffective. His criticism of Dutch colonial practices extended to the Dutch West India Company; he was a supporter of abolitionism at a time when Dutch colonists owned tens of thousands of slaves, mainly on plantations in Surinam.|$|E

He had alienated the SARFU executive, and on 27 September he resigned as national {{coach at the}} start of a disciplinary hearing began into allegations that his comments had brought the game into disrepute.

Rockne later recalled that Kirk and Gipp had been [...] "practically inseparable" [...] and reflected on his disappointment in losing the talented Kirk.

[...] Kirk played with Notre Dame a couple of seasons before he entered Michigan and not one was more sorry to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> to the Wolverines than I was.

2500|$|The American scholar John Halperin called Mansfield Park the [...] "most eccentric" [...] of all Austen's {{novels and}} her {{greatest}} failure, attacking {{the book for}} what he called an inane heroine, a pompous hero, a ponderous plot and [...] "viperish satire". Halperin called the Bertram family appalling characters full of self-righteousness, debauchery and greed, as their own financial advantage seems to be their only interest. Halperin observed that when Sir Thomas leaves for Antigua, only Price is sad to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>go,</b> for which she is rewarded by being told she is still immature. Halperin argued that the problem with the novel was the scenes set in Portsmouth are much more interesting than those in Mansfield Park, and Austen having portrayed the people living in Mansfield Park as greedy, selfish and materialistic for most of the novel, then presents life at Mansfield Park in idealised terms in the last chapters.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first goal}} of the season came in a 3–0 win at Yeovil Town on 24 August, which was quickly {{followed}} up by his first career hat-trick in a 5–1 win at Millwall on 14 September, which {{was also the first}} league hat-trick by a Derby player since Paul Simpson in April 1996. After a 1–0 defeat at Nottingham Forest, with the club having won only once in the last six matches, having failed to win at home, and lying in 14th place, manager Nigel Clough was sacked. Bryson was saddened by the move, saying it came as a [...] "shock", adding that Clough [...] "has been excellent for me, he brought me down from Scotland and gave me my chance in England. So obviously I was sad to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>go.</b> But it happens in football {{and you just have to}} get on with it." [...] Clough was replaced by Steve McClaren and Bryson said that he was looking forward to working with the new manager.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the show's flexibility, Arbuckle stated, [...] " [...] One Tree Hill doesn't focus {{exclusively}} on the teenagers, but also stretches out to include dedicated subplots for their parents and other adults." [...] He said {{there is not much}} of a maturity gap between the two sides. [...] "stead, to keep the structure somewhat separate, the respective focuses are on different emotions. For the teens, it's love; for the adults, it's revenge." [...] For example, one of the audience's main concerns has been [...] "Who should Lucas end up with?" [...] "If you're a huge fan of One Tree Hill, chances are you've had a debate at some point about who Lucas Scott should ultimately settle down with," [...] stated Don Williams of BuddyTV.com.

In December 2016, Walsh confirmed we would continue to judge the series through 2018, stating he had signed through [...] "the next two years".

2500|$|On September 10, 2003, during warm-ups in Chicago {{during a}} tight pennant race, Newman {{took a turn}} in the batter's box during warm-ups to take some fun hits. Shortly after completion, Newman {{collapsed}} {{on the field and}} was immediately rushed to the hospital. After several tests, it was determined he had suffered a brain hemorrhage. His wife Deborah and Twins general manager Terry Ryan remained at the hospital with him throughout the stay where he remained unconscious until September 26. During that time, Gardenhire struggled to keep his team focused while all dealt with their feelings for Newman. Minnesota Twins center fielder Torii Hunter said of Newman, [...] "For me, I think it hurt me more than anybody to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> down like that, because this is the guy who pretty much taught me the game, and how to play the game hard." [...] While Newman was away from the team, his jersey, number 62, was hung in the dugout for each game as a salute. On October 4, 2003, after being released from the hospital, Newman threw out the first pitch prior to Game 3 of the Twins American League Divisional Series versus the New York Yankees. Gardenhire waved Newman's jersey to fans and was visibly emotional to have him back on the field with him after his long hospital stay.|$|E
