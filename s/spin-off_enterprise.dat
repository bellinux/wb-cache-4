40|$|What does {{it means}} for local {{residents}} to account publicly for olfactory nuisances in their environment, to share their experiences, and, above all, to render objectivable what could appear, at first glance, as sheer subjectivities? Relying on an Actor-Network Theory (ANT) approach to technical democracy, a Belgian case study where knowledge co-production between citizens, university, and a <b>spin-off</b> <b>enterprise</b> is described and debated. Between the odor emission source (industry, waste disposal,…) and the odor immission realities (reception) there are an heterogeneity of both natural and social factors that render the flux of odorous molecules more or less challenging to trace. This story is about both technical and social traceabilities. This story is about the intimate, but problematic, relations between electronic noses and human lookouts (Vigies), where the identity of impacted residents and the aerial characteristics of the odors are closely related. The very intimate (recalcitrant) trajectories of air causes interesting mode of associations between key protagonists: {{a change in the}} protocol of measurements and it’s the nature of the relations between them that is transformed. In terms of governance, the direct involvement of citizens in the odor monitoring in direct collaboration with the industry (odor source) offers a kind of “management of proximity” that contrasts with the more classic mode of regulation by public authorities.

40|$|The {{coastal areas}} of Terracina and Sabaudia were decreed to be {{protected}} environments by Latium Region, {{with the objective of}} promoting the repopulation of the fish. Protection of the areas is guaranteed by special underwater artificial barriers which prevent illegal fishing. The underwater barriers consist of modular units placed on the sea-bottom to protect a total area of about 250. 000 m 2. The structure “atolls” runs parallel to the coastline, forming an artificial protective “reef” that allows many fish species to procreate and develop in a safe ambient. These artificial barriers permit a sustainable sea-culture of high-quality of marine organisms. Appropriate regulations and strategies between cooperative agreements or <b>spin-off</b> <b>enterprise</b> have to be drawn up to ensure a successful management of the project, and the economic benefits to the local population that will derive from this new ecologically sustainable extensive sea-culture of many ichthyic species: Palinurus elephas, Scyllaroides latus, Paeneus and Homarus, Maja squinado, sea anemone, sole, plaice, octopus, gilt-head sea bream, sea bass, base, moray-eel, etc., which will be caught at fixed fishing stations, by underwater fishing or by specific and selective fishing techniques, will be sold with a Certificate of Environmental Origin and Quality, in line with the mission of the protected coastal areas. Correct management of these protected coastal areas will guarantee the success of the project, which is to recreate the fish community of the coastal areas, to save and protect the species involved, and to provide new jobs directly and indirectly to the local population...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, the {{competitiveness}} {{and economic growth}} of the of the EU fell significantly {{below the level of}} its greatest economic competitor, the USA (EC [2004]). In the meanwhile, the Far-Eastern global economic region performed variously, mostly influenced by the economic performance of the two other major global economic blocks. So the EU announced to make efforts to increase its pace of growth and he level of employment, especially focusing on supporting innovation (EC [2000]). Though the integration of the economic systems {{has been going on for}} decades (the Economic and Monetary Union), its effects fell far behind the expected level. However another factor emerged from the economic reality: the so called European Paradox (Cresson-Bangemann [1995])., according to whichthe results of RTDI activities are a lot less utilized than in the USA, despite the large number of excellent European results published. One of the main causes of this phenomenon could be, that the innovation system in the EU is more in the state sector. And presumably this is responsible for a significant part of the missing European economic growth. Mapping the innovation system, scholars identified an important element of the knowledge utilization processes: the <b>spin-off</b> <b>enterprise.</b> EU policy makers decided to promote their operation by constructing a suitable legal environment for their existence, and help their creation and operation by other possible means. However for this cause, the situation needed to be surveyed. The European Commission supported the work of a research consortium on the INDICOM project, which conducted an international survey of high-tech spin-off enterprises and the technology transfer organizations (TTOs), which “gave birth” to them. These results will be analyzed in this present article...|$|E
40|$|Much of {{the current}} {{empirical}} literature on academic spin-off formation focuses either on relevant framework conditions or on the potential academic entrepreneurs' opportunity-seeking process. The interdependency of these two important factors, in contrast, remains understudied, {{even though it is}} theoretically well established in general entrepreneurship literature. Against this background this article makes the case for an integrated consideration of motivation and framework conditions. It demonstrates how this approach can convincingly explain changes in prevalent modes of spin-off creation in developing and transforming economies. To do so, data from 68 academic <b>spin-off</b> <b>enterprises</b> from China are investigated...|$|R

40|$|Recently, some {{university}} {{spin-off firms}} {{have begun to}} substantially contribute to the technological upgrading of China's economy. The corresponding academic literature, however, does not yet deal with spin-off activities of Chinese universities in a comprehensive and theoretically sound way. Currently, most articles on Chinese spin-offs focus on case studies {{of the most prominent}} government-sponsored enterprises in Beijing. This paper aims to contribute to the literature in a more comprehensive manner by providing a theoretical discussion of spin-off formation in a developing and transforming economy, and by presenting results from a comparative study based on data from 82 interviews with <b>spin-off</b> <b>enterprises</b> in three metropolitan regions in China. The study shows that under the initial framework conditions, government-driven spin-off formation has indeed proved an appropriate solution for technology transfer at Chinese universities. Many of the companies thus formed, however, suffer from defective incentive structures and lack of performance. Consequently, since lifting or easing restrictive regulations, the formerly unique model of Chinese spin-off formation has been complemented by a surge of entrepreneurial spin-off formation...|$|R
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} based on an {{analysis}} on some aspects concerning the innovation process in two different university <b>spin-off</b> <b>enterprises</b> in Bergen-region. The cases concerns ecofriendly technologies compared to conventional solutions. These technologies address highly relevant products that lead to more sustainable production, processes and areas of use. The attempt to analyse the innovation process will especially focus on the influence of other important organizations and institutions and how they interact. This includes inter-firm links, collaboration with other research institutions and governmental institutions. Learning processes, feedback from customers, funding systems and the importance of knowledge and information flows are some key issues that are addressed. The theoretical approach for this study includes literature within economic geography, including theories around innovation systems and technology transfer. The empirical findings based on semi-structured interviews by the founders and other key informants in other organizations like the regional technology transfer office were conducted fall 2011. I have also used secondary sources such as company reports, websites, media articles, governmental reports and secondary statistics. The major findings have reviled several complexities concerning motivation, structures, systems and geographies around these processes. </p...|$|R
30|$|Given the Chinese context, {{particularly}} the political system, {{it is inevitable}} that the State has {{a central role in the}} innovation processes. Especially for profound industrial projects, it would be difficult to achieve the desired goals without the central control and coordination of the state. In spite of such fact, a statist model is not necessarily the only option, though it is more or less the case in the national innovation system in China. As China is huge and diverse, it has been argued that provinces are the basic units for developing innovation systems in China (Chen and Guan 2011). The specific Triple Helix models for innovation may differ across regions, depending on local economic development conditions. Among those, the most successful ones must properly handle two issues: one is about the IP protection when it comes to the technology transfer from academia to industry and the other is about how to promote bottom-up initiatives. While China is still striving for building up effective IP protection system, in the current situation the companies that more effectively participated in Triple Helix interactions are the university <b>spin-off</b> <b>enterprises</b> and the firms in science parks. In a situation where there is less trust between academia and industry due to the weak protection of intellectual rights in China, establishing national science parks coordinated by the State is practically useful, especially for national priority projects.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a thorough understanding of the change of ownership and property rights in the context of China in transition, with all the political and social implications that the process entails. This study aims both to understand and challenge the basic theoretical underpinnings of conventional property rights theory, to examine what the received wisdom of the private property rights perspective offers and to discover to what extent it is applicable in the Chinese transitional context. Through an extensive literature review, {{this research}} argues that the mainstream property-rights school fails to consider the institutional and organisational context of the societies in which economic institutions operate. This study evaluates the basic and most widely believed paradigm of institutional change - that of the Washington property rights school - and challenges it with empirical evidence. This study evaluates different models of institutional change and generates an original institutional approach to the change of property rights in the context of China-in-transition. Research for this PhD adopts an institutional methodological approach in an empirical study of the change of property rights and ownership of high-tech <b>spin-off</b> <b>enterprises</b> in China. This research is micro in approach providing a bird’s - eye view of the evolution of property rights and ownership of Chinese enterprises in the context of transition through multiple case studies of high-tech spin-offs. The research identifies the strong presence of the state associated with the evolution of high-tech spin-offs in transitional China, the process of which has also been characterised by fuzzy property rights and public entrepreneurship as two key stepping stones of development. The research findings indicate that the appropriate structure of property rights over productive assets is a dependent variable as opposed to an explanatory variable, as suggested by the property-rights schoo...|$|R
30|$|The {{problem of}} {{studying}} {{the development of}} small <b>enterprises</b> (<b>spin-off)</b> created with the participation of universities, and cooperating with them is given the highest priority in the literature.

And matching spheres of activity is not a significant factor (Gottschalk et al. 2009). Experience shows the importance of preliminary integration of the founders of a small enterprise in business networks: a successful business is rarely left by them when registering a new firm. It indirectly indicates that large-sized firms are created with the participation of external firms or former employer.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a case study of}} what is {{recognized}} as one of the more successful projects in any country in the Europe and Central Asia region, not to mention in the poorest country of the region-Moldova. The ARIA project shows new ways to attack some of the most intractable problems of private sector development in Europe and Central Asia: how to facilitate reorganization and liquidation bankruptcies; how to promote small and medium <b>enterprise</b> <b>spin-offs</b> and new start-ups; and how to promote new learning at the enterprise level, both in the form of"Marshall Plan"programs with more advanced post-socialist countries, as well as continuous improvement programs (such as those adapted from Japanese programs). The prime mover for these programs is the quasi-public restructuring agency, ARIA, which was established as part of the Moldova Private Sector Development I loan. ARIA was structured to try to combine private sector entrepreneurship with a public function in the process of restructuring and bankruptcy. The study tries to account for the strategies and innovations that lead to results. And it tries to connect the ARIA strategy to past development literature by viewing the study through Albert Hirschman's work on social learning and change.

The Sunshine Coast region of South East Queensland is characterised by: rapid population growth, part fuelled by in-migration of lifestyle-seeking seniors; a relatively low socio-economic performance that reflects the aging end of the demographic structure; and a high level of social capital inherent in the educational and professional attainments and experience of the seniors in the population. Seniors include a significant proportion of people categorized as the productive aging in that they are over 50 years of age and who may seek to maintain and enhance their self-worth through contributing to their communities through their creative and enterprising capital. Collectively these characteristics provide a challenge and an opportunity for the USC and other organizations to enhance the productivity of the region by innovatively engaging the creative and enterprising capacities of the productive aging through educational, research training, research and associated <b>spin-off</b> initiatives and <b>enterprises.</b> The question is being addressed by USC researchers at practical and theoretical levels.

The actuality of the theme {{is related to the}} need to create different groups of SMEs, given the importance that they have in the economy and the creation of new innovative <b>enterprises</b> (<b>spin-offs)</b> due to the implementation and marketing of knowledge products through the development of innovation activities and technology transfer and cooperation between SMEs and research institutions/universities. The {{purpose of this article is}} to show what companies are of “spin-off” type, the context in which there was necessary for creating them, their interaction with research organizations/universities, possible barriers to create such companies and the benefits of their creation. The following methods have been used in this article: analysis and generalization of literature, analytical materials, legislation creating innovative business abroad. As a result, it was found that “spin-off” companies are a new business model and one of the most effective and meaningful mechanisms to transfer and direct marketing knowledge from universities and public research institutions, or large companies with scientific activity. They are small businesses based on innovations and new technologies whose intellectual capital originates from organizations with scientific activity. These companies are designed to contribute to innovation, growth and jobs at local and national level and revenue generation. They are flexible and dynamic, they have great potential for growth, giving rise to fields and markets, and playing a key role in the development of high-tech clusters.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of networks in rural industrial clusters, {{in particular in}} the context of China has been paid more attention to in the world. Applying the theory and techniques of social network analysis (SNA), this study is with particular regard to the business network relationships and their evolutionary dynamics of steel measuring tape manufacturing clustered in Nanzhuang Village, Yucheng County of Henan Province, China, which is important for better understanding the industrial and regional development in less developed rural areas. From data collected by comprehensive questionnaire survey in 2002 and mass interviews with 60 enterprises and assembling families and several government authorities in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008, four types of networks are identified: spin-off, consulting, communication and cooperative. The characteristic of these networks is outlined in detail. Compared with the high-tech clusters of typical developed areas, the networks that have evolved in traditional manufacturing clusters are more affected by emotive linkages. The cluster networks are shown to exhibit a polycentric hierarchical structure. The family relationships are the dominate <b>spin-off</b> channels of <b>enterprises,</b> while the supply and demand relationships and the mobility of the skilled workers are also important paths of network learning, and the cooperation relationships are comparatively stable. Besides the root enterprises, the middle-sized enterprises are comparatively more active than small-sized enterprises, and the intermediary agencies and the service institutions act as bridges of the inter-enterprises cooperation. By analysis of the structure of networks and the interactions between the networks, the four stages of network evolution are also identified. The four stages are dominated by the family networks, the internal division production networks, the local innovation networks and the global supply networks respectively, and they play different roles in cluster development...|$|R
