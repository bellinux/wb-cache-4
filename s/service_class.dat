25|$|The SS service medals were {{manufactured}} by two firms Deschler of Munich and Petz & Lorenz of Unterreichenbach. The medals were die struck {{and had a}} metal composition of different alloys such as bronze, tin, copper and zinc. All levels of the long service awards were held on blue ribbons (See images). The 12 years and 25 years <b>service</b> <b>class</b> awards normally had the SS runes service branch embroidered into the ribbons (See images). These awards were presented in a black case, which bore white or silver wash SS runes posted on the top center of the box cover. Both medals, the twelve and twenty-five-year medals, have the tear-drop suspension loop.|$|E

40|$|Quality-of-Service (QoS) {{support is}} an {{essential}} feature in recent and upcoming networking standards. Applications running on these networks can specify appropriate <b>service</b> <b>classes</b> for their connection flows so that the flows are treated accordingly. However, current internet applications (legacy applications) cannot benefit from this facility as they are designed using the best-effort scheme. Effective QoS support to applications with unspecified <b>service</b> <b>classes</b> can be provided through our proposed intelligent QoS Manager. This paper describes the important features {{that can be used}} to determine <b>service</b> <b>classes</b> and discusses how machine learning can be incorporated into a QoS Manager, enabling it to distinguish different types of application flows and assign them appropriate <b>service</b> <b>classes.</b> Experiments using 10 -fold cross-validation (CV), 33 % hold-out (HO) and the learner's specific features lead to the selection of PART (Frank & Witten, 1998) as the classifier of the framework.

40|$|Abstract — We present two on-demand MAC {{protocols}} {{to provide}} differentiated <b>service</b> <b>classes</b> over multiple beam antennas. We use embedded feedback from neighboring nodes to synchronize data communication at multiple beams. The protocols use multilevel queues to organize data, and employ {{a quality of}} service (QoS) aware packet scheduler to facilitate disparate traffic flows. We further present a novel paradigm in wireless channel access – receiver initiated choice of sender (RICS). RICS organizes the senders into multilevel queues providing an elegant method to bias the probability of channel award to these nodes. Simulation results demonstrate successful provision for multiple <b>service</b> <b>classes.</b> Keywords- Differentiated <b>service</b> <b>classes,</b> multiple beam antennas, medium access control, Quality of Service, wireless ad hoc networks.

Optical burst switching (OBS) {{is one of the most}} promising switching technologies to cope with heavy traffic diversity. To satisfy the bandwidth requirement in OBS networks, the recent literature suggests two efficient techniques: one is based on offset time and the other is on wavelength reservation. In this paper, we analyze the wavelength reservation based technique to support a given number of <b>service</b> <b>classes.</b> We describe a Markov model to estimate the blocking probabilities of various <b>service</b> <b>classes.</b> Simulation is conducted at one of the output ports of a core node to validate the model...|$|R
