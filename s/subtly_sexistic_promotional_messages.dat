40|$|Choosing {{the content}} of <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> {{is a part of}} the {{activities}} of integrated marketing communication. As far as organic products in the world are concerned, research related to the choice of <b>promotional</b> <b>message</b> content is the object of much attention, primarily based on the conduct of research among the consumers of these product (information for defining the aim of promotion, creating and testing <b>promotional</b> <b>messages,</b> selecting media and media mix, and determining the number and frequency of promotional events). Promoting domestic organic products also inevitably implies conducting consumer-centred marketing research, in order to choose the appropriate <b>promotional</b> <b>message.</b> In this respect, this article defines several goals: study the choice of the <b>promotional</b> <b>message</b> content in relation to other activities of integrated marketing communication; consider this question in the context of relevant foreign market research into organic product consumers; determine the level of marketing research, which could be used for approaching the issue from the domestic perspective; and establish which recommendations and implication could be generated when domestic organic products are concerned...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between sacred concepts and secular companies is naturally problematic as their core values oppose one another: {{on the one}} hand, religion is concerned with human interests based on concepts of divine morality, {{and on the other}} hand, secular companies centre on commercial and capitalist goals. The problematic nature of this relationship is implied in The Broadcasting Act of 1989 which prohibits television and radio networks from broadcasting any advertisements from 6 am until midday on Sundays and for the entirety of Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Christmas Day (The Broadcasting Act, 1989). Although The Act suggests that it is inappropriate to promote secular companies during times of religious observance, the inclusion of religious elements in secular <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> is not covered by The Act, the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) or the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). Thank God for Commercials is a reaction to the practice of religious iconography being used within the secular frameworks of television <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> which promote secular companies. It is the observation of this practice, in conjunction with the positioning of The Broadcasting Act, BSA and the ASA, that provides the direction for my research in this thesis. This research investigates television <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> in order to answer the research question, “How is religious iconography incorporated in television <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> that promote non-religious companies?” In order to answer this question the research employs a triangulation method that combines content and discourse analysis to examine <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> which appear within a 90 hour sample of prime-time, free-to-air, terrestrial television broadcasting in New Zealand...|$|R

40|$|Enterprise social {{networks}} (ESNs) often fail {{if there are}} few or no contributors of content. <b>Promotional</b> <b>messages</b> are among the common interventions used to improve participation. While most users only read others’ content (i. e. lurk), contributors who create content (i. e. post) account for only 1 % of the users. Research on interventions to improve participation across dissimilar groups is scarce especially in work settings. We develop a model that examines four key motivations of posting and lurking. We employ the elaboration likelihood model to understand how <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> influence lurkers’ and posters’ beliefs and participation. We test our model with data collected from 366 members in two corporate Google⁺ communities in a large Australian retail organization.

40|$|In {{the world}} of visual {{communication}} many message-making strategies are used to convey information to a defined audience. The ways in which these strategies are used can greatly impact the meaning and success of a graphic design solution. Often strong emotion is employed to intentionally influence a defined audience. In addition, the format and context in which facts are presented in a message are also greatly effective. When looking at the potential communication power that solutions can hold, {{it is important to}} assess the types of messages being communicated and related ethical responsibilities that accompany them. This thesis study focuses on single-page, printed <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> specifically created to have strong influences on their respective viewers. When creating <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> the client may have specific motives, responsibilities, content and requirements that the designer should be aware of. Both the client and designer may share the responsibility for how that content is represented. The audiences of these messages are also responsible to think critically about the messages being presented to them. This thesis aims to define clearly the ethical responsibilities of the client, designer and audience when examining <b>promotional</b> <b>messages.</b> These definitions are defined through research done within the areas of graphic design and related fields, and the analysis of the semantic and syntactic decisions made in relation to selected, relevant <b>promotional</b> <b>messages.</b> The analysis of existing <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> led to a design application that focuses on the development of multiple, potential symbols for a single entity in order to examine how the interpretation of a message varies when different message-making strategies are used. The strategies used in this application focus on specific syntactic decisions that relate to the diverse factual and emotional goals of each solution...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} what features of social media – <b>promotional</b> <b>messaging</b> or peer networks – can increase physical activity. Method: A 13 -week social media-based exercise program {{was conducted at}} a large Northeastern university in Philadelphia, PA. In a randomized controlled trial, 217 graduate students from the University were randomized to three conditions: a control condition with a basic online program for enrolling in weekly exercise classes led by instructors of the University for 13  weeks, a media condition that supplemented the basic program with weekly online <b>promotional</b> media <b>messages</b> that encourage physical activity, and a social condition that replaced the media content with an online network of four to six anonymous peers composed of other participants of the program, in which each participant {{was able to see}} their peers' progress in enrolling in classes. The primary outcome was the number of enrollments in exercise classes, and the secondary outcomes were self-reported physical activities. Data were collected in 2014. Results: Participants enrolled in 5. 5 classes on average. Compared with enrollment in the control condition (mean =  4. 5), <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> moderately increased enrollment (mean =  5. 7, p =  0. 08), while anonymous social networks significantly increased enrollment (mean =  6. 3, p =  0. 02). By the end of the program, participants in the social condition reported exercising moderately for an additional 1. 6  days each week compared with the baseline, which was significantly more than an additional 0. 8  days in the control condition. Conclusion: Social influence from anonymous online peers was more successful than <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> for improving physical activity.

40|$|Communicating an appropriate, timely defined {{message to}} the target {{audience}} {{is a key element}} in the process of marketing communication with the consumer. The promotional strategy of an enterprise should be created by a professional team that distinguishes the target consumers from the general public, knows the vision, mission and portfolio of the company in details. The primary goal should be achieved with the <b>promotional</b> <b>message</b> that will be presented to current and potential users of the products/services. Therefore the importance of the precise approach in the process of creation of the <b>promotional</b> <b>message</b> should be in terms of encoding, choice of the device, media and media plan, i. e. the time aspect of the broadcast. The research indicates that it is a common practice in our national companies to leave the realization of this issue entirely to the media, or the message to be created by the owner or employees who do not have appropriate knowledge for successful implementation of the promotion, resulting in meager messages with inappropriate elements in content, completely wrong promotion, observed through the prism of the ultimate consumer. This paper analyzes the work of Macedonian enterprises and the media in terms of their individual involvement in the creation of advertising messages and the preparation of the media plan, based on personal interviews conducted in enterprises and few of the Macedonian media.

In the mid- 1990 s DHAB, with support from Danida and the World Bank, began testing a new approach to {{rural sanitation}} promotion using social marketing to motivate household demand coupled with toilet construction by local masons. Over the years the approach has evolved into a successful rural sanitation programme which operates on three primary principles: 1. Zero hardware subsidy – households pay the full cost of toilet construction and maintenance themselves. 2. Use of marketing communications and a set of non-health related <b>promotional</b> <b>messages</b> (found to be the main motivations for toilet construction in rural Benin) to stimulate household demand for sanitation 3. Development of the capacity of small-scale private sector to provide quality construction services and offer a selection of low-cost toilet technologies.

The results {{presented in the}} project {{are based on the}} analysis of self-gathered promotional wordings in the Portuguese press from 2006 - 2008. The project is divided into 8 chapters reflecting individual linguistic discipline and verbal level. Advertising is mainly one-way communication originating from a company and going to anonymous parties, not a specified potential customer group. First of all, the <b>promotional</b> <b>message</b> has to catch the recipient's attention; secondly, it should inform about product purchase benefits in the best way. The conative function ranks first among the linguistic functions. Printed advertising has a verbal-iconic character. The brand name in advertising represents minimal linguistic utterance. Primarily, I devoted the chapter on pragmatics to conversational maxim denials. <b>Promotional</b> <b>messages</b> often don't adhere to relevancy and quality. They usually deputize indirect verbal acts. Expressions such as aqui and agora predominate in the temporal and local area of deixis and they refer the utterance to the moment and place of the speech.

To do so, Bruce Fraser’s definition and classification of DMs will be used to analyse the corpus. Results show that the DMs investigated share the common pragmatic function of ‘topic orientation markers’, i. e., they signal an aspect of the organization of the ongoing discourse. Semantically, however, they have different – but very specific – relationships with the surrounding segments of discourse. More specifically, the authors of the texts preferably use DMs to signal that a warning, a reminder, or some advice, will follow in the next segment...|$|R
