50|$|Szirtes {{lives in}} Wymondham, Norfolk, having retired from {{teaching}} at the University of East Anglia in 2013. He is married to the artist Clarissa Upchurch, with whom he ran The <b>Starwheel</b> Press and who {{has been responsible for}} most of his book jacket images.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tailstock}} {{was also}} of completely new design. The quill could be fed by three different methods: Rapidly {{by a large}} <b>starwheel,</b> by worm reduction via a smaller handwheel, or automatically by geared connection to the saddle. The transverse adjustment of the centre was done by an eccentric mechanism. The centre was protected from overload by a spring arrangement.|$|E
50|$|The Kraemer Elektronik tablet testing {{system was}} the first {{automatic}} tablet hardness testing system for auto-regulation at tablet presses. Invented by the german mechanical engineer Mr. Norbert Kraemer in Darmstadt/Germany. The tablets are separated by a feeder chute and moved on a horizontal <b>starwheel</b> through different testing stations. The Kraemer Elektronik automatic tablet testing systems measure weight, thickness, diameter/length, width and hardness of tablets and capsules.|$|E
50|$|The {{program was}} encoded on a punched card {{and could be}} {{prepared}} on any keypunch (a keypunch would operate even if no program card was in place). The program card was wrapped around the program drum, and clamped in place. The drum rotated as the card being punched moved through the punching mechanism. The holes in the program card were sensed by an array of <b>starwheels</b> that would cause levers to rise and fall as {{the holes in the}} program card passed beneath the <b>starwheels,</b> activating electrical contacts. The program was encoded in the top six rows 12,11,0,1,2,3. If the optional Second Program feature was installed, another program could be encoded in the bottom six rows 4,5,6,7,8,9. A switch let the operator select which program to use. The central cover on the keypunch could be tilted open toward the operator and a locking lever released, allowing the program drum to be removed and replaced.|$|R
40|$|The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) {{system is}} {{considered}} one of the leading technologies for waste heat recovery applications. In order to increase the overall efficiency, design improvements and optimization analyses are necessary. The expander is the key component to convert the thermal energy in useful work. Several volumetric and turbine expanders have been investigated. Among volumetric machines, scroll, twin-screw and vane-type expanders are the main technologies. Recently, a number of experimental studies on single screw expanders (SSE) have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of employing such machine as an ORC expander. The single screw configuration presents a number of advantages over twin screw including balanced loading of the main screw, long working life, high volumetric efficiency. In this paper, a detailed geometry-based multi-chamber model of a single screw expander is presented. The model is based on a rotation-dependent function that entirely describes the geometry of the engaging surface between the screw rotor and the <b>starwheels.</b> The computation of the swept volume at each angular step and the inlet conditions, enables the solution of the system of differential equations governing the thermodynamic problem. The level of details of the model, which includes heat transfer losses, oil-flooded mixing and leakage paths calculation, allows the investigation of the impact of design changes to the expander machine performance. The validation of the proposed model is realized with experimental data obtained from an ORC set up which employs a SSE and Solkatherm (SES 36) as working fluid. Test results have shown a maximum isentropic efficiency of 67 % at 3000 rpm. The model predicts the mass flow rate and the power output within ± 10 % and ± 15 % respectively...|$|R
