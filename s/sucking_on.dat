5|$|Maggie is the {{youngest}} child of Homer and Marge, and sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often seen <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> her red pacifier and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face (this running gag is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she cannot talk. She is a counterpart to Lisa Simpson. However, she did appear to talk in the first Tracey Ullman Show short.|$|E
5|$|Groening {{thought that}} it would be funny to have a baby {{character}} that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scene}} when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched {{all over the}} building, staring at the family and quietly <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a {{reference}} to his own cameo appearance in the film. The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in Citizen Kane, in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches {{his wife in the}} musical.|$|E

25|$|Treatment is by reassurance, as the {{condition}} is benign, and then by correction of any predisposing factors. This may be cessation of smoking or cessation/substitution of implicated medications or mouthwashes. Generally direct measures to return the tongue to its normal appearance involve improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue before sleep. This promotes desquamation of the hyperparakeratotic papillae. Keratolytic agents (chemicals to remove keratin) such as podophyllin are successful, but carry safety concerns. Other reported successful measures include sodium bicarbonate mouthrinses, eating pineapple, <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> a peach stone and chewing gum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sucking</b> <b>on</b> {{the nipple}} offsets {{the fall in}} {{prolactin}} as the internal stimulus for them is removed. The sucking activates mechanoreceptors {{in and around the}} nipple. These signals are carried by nerve fibers through the spinal cord to the hypothalamus, where changes in the electrical activity of neurons that regulate the pituitary gland increase prolactin secretion. The suckling stimulus also triggers the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary gland, which triggers milk let-down: Prolactin controls milk production (lactogenesis) but not the milk-ejection reflex; the rise in prolactin fills the breast with milk in preparation for the next feed.|$|E
25|$|Language {{development}} and processing begins before birth. Evidence {{has shown that}} there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud {{during the last few}} weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.|$|E

500|$|The song is a rap {{performed}} by the character Bart Simpson about his trouble-making antics. Groening has described it as [...] "the tragic story of Bart Simpson, a bad youth gone worse." [...] The Simpsons cast member Nancy Cartwright, who voices Bart on the show, provided the character's voice in [...] "Deep, Deep Trouble" [...] as well. The characters Homer Simpson and Maggie Simpson are also featured, with Homer ranting at Bart, and Maggie <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> her pacifier {{to the beat of}} the song.|$|E
500|$|Named after Henry Ford's son, Edsel Ford, the Edsel {{made its}} debut as a {{separate}} car division on September 4, 1957, for the 1958 model year. The front grill was said by critics to look like [...] "an Oldsmobile <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> a lemon". [...] It ended up being a marketing blunder that not only cost Ford almost $250 million ($ million in 2013 dollars), but also turned the word Edsel into an enduring metaphor for failure. [...] The car sold poorly and production for the final 1960 model year had ceased by November 1959.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons are {{a family}} {{who live in a}} fictional [...] "Middle America" [...] town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety {{inspector}} at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another. The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in [...] "I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot". Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes.|$|E

500|$|The Simpsons {{fly through}} a tipping metal water tower and Bob cuts {{a big hole}} into Hell. Maggie, now giant-sized after {{entering}} the reactor room during Pre-show 2, appears and grabs Bob and slams him into the vehicle, which almost plummets into Hell before it is saved by Professor Frink. Bob then steals Maggie's pacifier and tells her that she must destroy Springfield to get it back. Riders then take a ride through Springfield with references to the original opening sequence before encountering Maggie again, who mistakes their car for a new pacifier, and sucks on them repeatedly, before spitting them out (getting riders wet), onto overhead power lines and catapulting them into the Simpsons' house by crashing right through the front door. While Maggie is <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> the riders, the aroma of baby powder is released.|$|E
500|$|Plath's fellow confessional {{poet and}} friend Anne Sexton commented: [...] "Sylvia and I would talk {{at length about}} our first suicide, in detail and in depth—between the free potato chips. Suicide is, after all, the {{opposite}} of the poem. Sylvia and I often talked opposites. We talked death with burned-up intensity, both of us drawn to it like moths to an electric lightbulb, <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> it. She told the story of her first suicide in sweet and loving detail, and her description in The Bell Jar is just that same story." [...] The confessional interpretation of Plath's work has led to some dismissing certain aspects of her work as an exposition of sentimentalist melodrama; in 2010, for example, Theodore Dalrymple asserted that Plath had been the [...] "patron saint of self-dramatization" [...] and of self-pity. Revisionist critics such as Tracy Brain have, however, argued against a tightly autobiographical interpretation of Plath's material.|$|E
500|$|At the Golden Globe ceremony, Angry Dad wins, and Homer takes {{credit in}} his {{acceptance}} speech for creating the film, {{to the dismay of}} Bart. Homer takes credit at many other awards ceremonies. Angry Dad soon receives an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short Film. [...] Out of frustration against Homer for taking the credit, Bart attempts to distract Homer from going by making him and Marge go on an attraction tour in Los Angeles while he and Lisa attend the awards. However, Homer gets recognized by others who take him to the ceremony. Homer arrives in time to see Angry Dad win the Oscar. Bart goes up to accept the Oscar and thanks Lisa for having the idea to make the film into a short film, the animation studio, and Homer. Touched by this, Homer gets up on stage with Bart and apologizes to him for taking all the credit, and the two agree to cut up the Oscar and give a piece to everyone on the animation team. Bart asks if Homer had gotten a replacement from the Academy, but Homer confides to him that the Award is only five dollars on eBay, while Maggie is <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> the replacement.|$|E

The state in which in this town is located is never specified, however they do have snow and {{sometimes}} wear sweaters in the fall. [...] It's a running joke in the show to be as vague and ambiguous as possible whenever hinting at which U.S. state the town of Springfield might be located in. [...] Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality.

Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of Anomalocaris ("abnormal shrimp") was a comedy of errors. The name was initially {{given to a}} fossil that looked like the rear end of a shrimp-like crustacean. Walcott classified a ring-like fossil he called Peytoia {{as a kind of}} jellyfish, and another poorly preserved fossil he called Laggania as a holothurian (sea cucumber). After many plot twists, Derek Briggs started dissecting another ill-defined fossil in very thin slices and found a pair of Anomalocaris-like structures on one end of a specimen of Laggania, which also had a specimen of Peytoia attached just behind those of Anomalocaris. After dissecting more specimens and finding similar configurations, Briggs and Whittington concluded that the whole assemblage represented a single animal, which was named Anomalocaris because that was the earliest name assigned to any of its parts. This animal's body was fragile and usually disintegrated before it could be fossilized. But the complete animal had tough grasping appendages (Anomalocaris), a tough, ring-like mouth with teeth on the inner edge (Peytoia) and a long, segmented body (Laggania) with flaps on the sides that enabled it to swim with a Mexican wave motion, and perhaps to turn quickly by putting the flaps on one side into reverse. This monster was over [...] long when other animals were only a few inches at most. Nedin suggested in 1999 that the animal was capable of taking heavily armored trilobites apart, possibly by grabbing one end of their prey in their jaws while using their appendages to quickly rock {{the other end of the}} animal back and forth, causing the prey's exoskeleton to rupture and allowing the predator to access its innards. In 2009 Hagadorn found that anomalocarid mouthparts showed little wear, which suggests they did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells. Computer modeling of the Anomalocaris mouthparts suggests they were in fact better suited to <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> smaller, soft-bodied organisms. Although Whittington and Briggs concluded that Anomalocaris did not fit into any known phylum, research since the 1990s has concluded that it was closely related to Opabinia and to the ancestors of arthropods. In 2009 a fossil named Schinderhannes bartelsi, an apparent relative of Anomalocaris, was found in the Early Devonian period, about 100million years later than the Burgess Shale.|$|E
2500|$|However, milk {{production}} can be [...] "artificially" [...] and intentionally induced {{in the absence}} of any pregnancy in the woman. This is called induced lactation, while a woman who has lactated before and restarts is said to relactate. This can be done by regularly <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> the nipples (several times a day), massaging and squeezing the female breasts, or with additional help from temporary use of milk-inducing drugs, such as the dopamine antagonist Domperidone. In principle—with considerable patience and perseverance—it is possible to induce lactation by <b>sucking</b> <b>on</b> the nipples alone.|$|E
