In this paper, we analyze the interlinking between <b>seed</b> <b>product</b> line and license contract signed between the seed company and the upstream agbiotech firm which owns the Genetically Modified (GM) trait. We show that if the farmers are sufficiently heterogeneous, the seed company prefers to price discriminate by supplying both GM and conventional seeds. In those circumstances, despite higher efficiency of the GM seed, the price increase is such that the farmer’s surplus decreases. This loss may even outweigh the aggregate gains of the seed and the agbiotech companies, thereby leading to a total welfare loss...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the specific marketing activities that contribute most to the performance improvement of seed producer cooperatives (SPCs) in Ethiopia. Both quantitative and qualitative procedures were adopted to extract information from knowledgeable and experienced experts using structured questionnaires. Results indicate that clear differences exist between Ethiopian SPCs in their intensity and quality of execution of marketing activities, indicating that these activities are managed and controlled by SPCs themselves. However, the similarity in patterns of intensity and quality of execution of marketing activities shows that these effects cannot be disentangled in the Ethiopian SPCs context. Ethiopian SPCs performed well on marketing activities related to interfunctional coordination, but poorly on activities associated with competitor orientation. SPCs are likely to perform better when they use a variety of marketing activities including quality control of product (<b>seed),</b> <b>product</b> differentiation, managing customer and supplier relationships, responding to customers and competitors, customer and competitor assessment, leadership, integration of activities, and interconnections among committees and members. Hence, to provide value to customers SPCs need to have resources and the capabilities to coordinate these resources in order to execute marketing activities efficiently and effectively. <br/...|$|E

This overview is, followed by measurements of the comparative and competitive advantages of the South African and Argentinean sunflower seed industries. Two indexes are used to calculate the comparative and competitive advantages namely the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) and the Relative Revealed Comparative Trade Advantage (RTA) index. The results show that South African sunflower seed has a competitive advantage in their primary form, however the value added sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>products</b> show a competitive disadvantage which is opposite to that of Argentina’s sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>products.</b> The finding that South Africa is only competitive in the primary sunflower seed market was calculated by means of trade data. Factors that affect the competitiveness of the sunflower industry were identified to indicate why value added sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>products</b> experience a competitive disadvantage. In the analysis {{it was found that the}} South African sunflower industry is price driven. Since price plays an important role in the competitiveness of the industry, imports of cheaper sunflower crude and refined oils are considered to pose a major threat to the industry. Crushing margins has increased over the last few years due to higher sunflower oil and sunflower oilcake prices. In order to increase the competitiveness of the South African sunflower seed industry, it needs to; be more cost competitive; improve quality; launch new products; invest in new technologies and improve the innovativeness. Emphasis should be placed on the value added <b>seed</b> <b>products</b> as this is where South Africa has a competitive disadvantage. Health issues are of great importance to the local as well as global market and the production of a healthier vegetable oil has become a necessity for this industry. Innovation in this commodity will lead to great improvement in the competitiveness of the sunflower seed industry. Investment towards research and innovation is necessary in order to keep up with the changing environment. The competitiveness of the sunflower seed industry in South Africa cannot be achieved without the help of the government. Policy issues must be put in place to avoid the dumping of cheaper crude vegetable oils as well as bottled cooking oils in South Africa. Master...|$|R
40|$|Drought {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{important}} environmental factor contributing to crop yield loss, especially in soyabean [Glycine max (L.)

Decline of N 2 fixation with soil drying causes yield reductions due to inadequate N for protein production, which is the critical <b>seed</b> <b>product.</b> In this paper, we present a combined physiological and breeding research effort to develop soyabean lines that have diminished sensitivity of N 2 fixation to drought. A preliminary physiological screen was used to identify lines that potentially expressed N 2 fixation drought tolerance. One hundred progeny lines derived from a cross between Jackson, a cultivar proven to have N 2 fixation tolerance to drought, and KS 4895, a high-yielding line, were tested in the screen. Seventeen lines were identified for subsequent yield trials in moderate- and low-yielding rainfed environments. Two lines, found to have higher yields than commercial checks in these environments were then tested in the greenhouse for their N 2 fixation activity in drying soil. Nitrogen fixation activity was found to persist at lower soil water contents than exhibited by the sensitive parent. These two soyabean lines offer a genetic resource for increased yields under rainfed conditions as a result of decreased sensitivity of N 2 fixation to water defici...|$|E

In this study, analyses were performed to determine the levels and incidence of aflatoxins (AFs) in peanut products, tree nuts, spices, and Coix seeds; ochratoxin A (OTA) in wheat and roasted coffee, as well as OTA and AFs in rice; and citrinin (CIT) in red yeast rice (RYR) products. A total of 712 samples from nine different food categories were collected between 2012 and 2013. The samples were analyzed over 2 years for AFs, OTA, and CIT by methods recommended by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. These official analytical methods were extensively validated in-house and through interlaboratory trials. The analytical values of suspected contaminated specimens were confirmed by liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify the specific mycotoxin present in the sample. We show that 689 samples (96. 8 %) complied with the regulations set by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. AFs were found in four peanut-candy products, one peanut-flour product, one pistachio product, one Sichuan-pepper product, and one Coix <b>seed</b> <b>product.</b> All had exceeded the maximum levels of 15 parts per billion for peanut and 10 parts per billion for other food products.

This study was conducted to assess the suitability of oil brassicas species in rain-fed warm areas of Iran. This research was performed for three years in Agricultural Research stations of Gonbad (Golestan). Twenty varieties and hybrids (B. napus, B. rapa, B. juncea) were compared in RCBD with three replications under rain fed conditions. Each plot had 4 rows 5 -meter long. Combined analysis results indicated that there were significant differences at 1 % probability level among years and varieties for No. of days to maturity, No. of pod per plant, oil%, oil and seed yield. The highest seed yield was obtained in the 2 nd year (2103. 48 kg. ha), followed by the 1 th and 3 rd year (1771. 50 and 1575. 13 kg. ha, respectively). Namely, year environment factor had a significant effect on the rape <b>seed</b> <b>product.</b> j- 98 - 102. 51 - 5 (B. juncea), Alexandra and comet (Spring B. napus) showed the highest seed yield (2484, 2326 and 2290 Kg. ha, respectively). Regression analysis via step by step method explained that No. of pod per plant and oil percentage had significant positive effects (508. 53 and 96. 48 respectively) and No. of days to maturity significant negative effect (- 78. 63) on the seed yield. Factor analysis extracted four factors. Factor loading of the first three eigen values showed that the first three factors explained 98. 794 %, sum of variance. Rates of first, second and third factors were 45. 575 %, 36. 816 % and 16. 403 %, respectively. The first factor, second factor and third factor were named productivity factor (seed yield and oil yield), sink factor (No. of pod per plant), fixed capital factor (No. of day to maturity and plant height) respectively. Generally, j- 98 - 102. 51 - 5, Alexandra and comet varieties are advisable for Fall planting under rain fed conditions in Gonbad area because they had the highest seed yield and earliness. Also, we can introduce less No. of days to maturity (earliness) and more No. of pod per plant as select index under rain fed conditions in Gonbad...|$|E
