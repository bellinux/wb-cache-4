50|$|The {{inscription}} on the fragment Sö 245, {{which is about}} 0.6 meters in height in the upright position, consists of runic text within a band and a depiction of a bird standing on {{what appears to be}} a cross. The depiction of the bird on the cross is very similar to that depicted on inscription <b>Sö</b> 270 <b>in</b> Tyresta, which has been interpreted as being a cock.
