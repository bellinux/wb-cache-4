60|$|Margaret Murdockson {{stated that}} she, for some time, {{believed}} {{her daughter had}} actually destroyed the infant in her mad fits, and that she gave the father to understand so, but afterwards learned that a female stroller had got it from her. She showed some compunction at having <b>separated</b> <b>mother</b> and child, especially as the mother had nearly suffered death, being condemned, on the Scotch law, for the supposed murder of her infant. When it was asked what possible interest she could have had in exposing the unfortunate girl to suffer for a crime she had not committed, she asked, if they {{thought she was going}} to put her own daughter into trouble to save another? She did not know what the Scotch law would have done to her for carrying the child away. This answer was by no means satisfactory to the clergyman, and he discovered, by close examination, that she had a deep and revengeful hatred against the young person whom she had thus injured. But the paper intimated, that, whatever besides she had communicated upon this subject was confided by her in private to the worthy and reverend Archdeacon who had bestowed such particular pains in affording her spiritual assistance. The broadside went on to intimate, that, after her execution, of which the particulars were given, her daughter, the insane person mentioned more than once, and who was generally known by the name of Madge Wildfire, had been very ill-used by the populace, under the belief that she was a sorceress, and an accomplice in her mother's crimes, and had been with difficulty rescued by the prompt interference of the police.|$|E

40|$|Starting from a {{life course}} perspective, this study aims to gain more insight into {{mobility}} patterns of recently <b>separated</b> <b>mothers,</b> focusing especially on moves {{to the location of}} their own mother: the maternal grandmother. <b>Separated</b> <b>mothers,</b> having linked lives with their own mothers, may benefit from their practical and emotional support. Additionally, the grandparents' home can be a (temporary) place to stay shortly after divorce. Data come from the System of social statistical datasets (Statistics Netherlands). This unique dataset combines longitudinal data from a vast number of administrative registers. It covers the complete Dutch population, making it exceptionally well suited for life course and mobility research. We studied mothers with minor children between 1 / 1 / 2008 and 31 / 12 / 2010. Our study included 579, 500 mothers, of whom about 8, 800 (1. 5 %) experienced a separation in 2008. <b>Separated</b> <b>mothers</b> moved to the grandmother's municipality more often than non-separated mothers, which might be partially motivated by the need for childcare. They also coresided with the grandmother more than non-separated movers, mostly because of a vulnerable socio-economic position. Although often temporary, coresidence appears to have a prolonged impact on the mothers' location choice; mothers frequently stayed in the grandmother's municipality after moving out. Finally, our results indicated that some mothers seemed to use the parental home as a stepping stone to cohabit with a new partner. © 2016 The Authors.

40|$|This article aims to {{contribute}} to the discussion of how adult children affect the well-being of their older parents by investigating the importance of living in close geographic proximity. We investigate whether having children at all, and/or having them geographically proximate, contributes differently to the well-being of older persons living with and without a partner. We enriched survey data for the Netherlands (N = 8, 379) with municipal register data and regressed life satisfaction of persons aged 65 + on having children and three different measures of geographic proximity. Having children contributes to the well-being of older men with a partner. There is evidence for a positive association between proximity of children and parental well-being, in particular for widowed and <b>separated</b> <b>mothers</b> and for <b>separated</b> fathers. Our findings suggest that close proximity may be a condition under which adult children can significantly add to the well-being of widowed and <b>separated</b> <b>mothers</b> and <b>separated</b> fathers...|$|R

50|$|The last {{disappearance}} to {{be included}} on the list was Sinnott in 1998. Since then, no case of disappearances has been of a nature so unexplained and random as {{to be added to}} this list.. A convicted rapist, Larry Murphy has been suspected of being responsible for the disappearances of Annie McCarrick, JoJo Dollard and Deirdre Jacob, all of whom vanished close to the area where Murphy lived at the time. Eva Brennan and Fiona Pender have also been linked to the murders of Antoinette Smith, a 27-year-old <b>separated</b> <b>mother</b> of two, who went missing in July 1987. Her body was discovered the following June in a shallow grave at Kilakee, {{in the foothills of the}} Dublin mountains and Patricia Doherty, a 34 year old, disappeared while on her way to go shopping on December 23, 1991. In June 1992, her remains were found by men digging turf in the same area of the mountains. Although it is possible that a serial killer may have been involved in some of the disappearances, it is important to note that the suspect in Fiona Sinnott’s case is a man that was well-known to her.|$|E

In 1890, the first Filipino Augustinian sisters made their Religious profession and they helped in caring the orphans. The small community continued to grow and survived {{the crisis of the}} Philippine Revolution in 1896, but it was the Spanish-American War in 1898 that <b>separated</b> <b>Mother</b> Rita from her 16 Filipino Sisters who were then ordered to return to their homes. In 1897,after 13 years as Superior of the Orphanage, Mother Rita was appointed Mistress of Novices, although not for long. Despite her pleas to remain with them she was obliged by the Augustinian Father to go back to Spain. In the spirit of obedience, she left on March 13, 1899. In her subsequent and continuous communications, she expressed her deep longing to return to the Philippines to live with the Sisters and the people she has learned to love. Just when there was hope for her return, her accidental fall caused a slipped disk in her spinal column. After intense pain and suffering, Mother Rita died in Barcelona, Spain on May 14, 1904, in the same religious community where she made her first profession on August 21, 1873.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} family structure on high school graduation by race and gender {{using data from the}} first twenty-one waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and recently available retrospective marital histories. The nature of the data allows for a more complete specification of family structure than has been heretofore possible. The analysis tests the hypothesis that the negative effect on educational attainment often associated with living in a mother-only or stepfather family stems primarily from the reduced level of economic resources available to these households. Empirical findings indicate that living with a widowed, divorced, or <b>separated</b> <b>mother</b> has little or no effect on educational attainment once we control for economic status. However, living in a stepfather family appears to have a persistent negative effect on high school graduation rates. Family structure · education · income...|$|E

40|$|In this {{position}} paper—one of six care practice papers published by Lamaze International and reprinted here with permission—the value of keeping {{mothers and their}} babies together {{from the moment of}} birth is discussed and presented as an evidenced-based practice that helps promote, protect, and support normal birth. The paper is written for childbearing women and their families. Babies held skin-to-skin with their mothers cry less often, breathe easier, and stay warmer than babies who are <b>separated</b> from their <b>mothers.</b> They also instinctively attach to the breast and begin breastfeeding, usually within one hour of birth. The advantages of rooming-in for mother and baby are also discussed.
