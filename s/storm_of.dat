5|$|At {{the time}} it was thought that Alpha was the twenty-second <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> the season, and so was the storm which broke the 1933 season's record for most storms in a single season. However post-season {{analysis}} revealed that there was also a previously unnoticed subtropical storm on October4, which made Alpha the twenty-third <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> the season. Alpha was the first tropical storm to be assigned a Greek-alphabet name after the list of hurricane names was exhausted.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave off}} the Bahamas organized into Tropical Depression Six {{on the afternoon}} of July 21. The depression became the sixth named <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> the season only two hours later, the first time the sixth <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> the season had ever formed that early in the season. The storm headed northward from the Bahamas, then northeast over the Atlantic, becoming disorganized by July 24 under the effects of shear and drier air. It moved erratically, inching closer to Bermuda while barely remaining a tropical storm. Bermuda received some strong wind gusts, but was otherwise unaffected. Tropical Storm Franklin then accelerated north and northeast, roughly paralleling the East Coast of the United States, and intensified to near hurricane strength. Eventually, Franklin became extratropical along the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash of Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E

5|$|During this season, 14tropical {{depressions}} formed {{of which}} seven attained tropical storm status. One tropical storm was operationally {{classified as a}} tropical depression but was reclassified in post-analysis. Three tropical cyclones reached hurricane status of which only one became a major hurricane, which is a Category3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Hurricane Emily was the costliest <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> the season, causing $80.3million in damage (1987USD) as it ravaged the Dominican Republic and Bermuda. Tropical Depression Fourteen was the deadliest <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> the season, causing six deaths as it passed across Jamaica.
