30|$|Historically, {{the fashion}} handbag has partly been {{determined}} by its function, with some features remaining constant, {{such as a}} place for money, cosmetics, keys, handkerchief, diary, note pad, pencil, and even printed literature such as a novel or commercial pocket book. Riding in {{a car in the}} early 20 th century, a passenger could be wrapped in a blanket wearing a cap or veil, and sheltered under thick goggles; often, the fashionable passenger held a flat Morocco leather bag in her arms. Its simple form, in varying sizes, stored readily available items: gloves, stole, vials. This was the prelude to the handbag and fashion bag, which flourished in the 20 th and 21 st centuries (Louis Vuitton 2017). After World War I, women needed handbags for utility purposes because they increasingly occupied jobs outside the home. In the 20 th century, the fashion bag took on both utility and fashion; utilitarian and fashionable bags became known worldwide. In the 1930 s, the clutch bag was very popular and during and after World War II, a shoulder bag was functional, first as part of the military, and later gaining widespread popularity. In the 1970 s, a trend of the hippy style was to incorporate various fabric patches and twisted thread bags; in the 1980 s, <b>sports</b> <b>bags</b> were popular; and by the 1990 s, the fashion handbag was being designed to consider both ergonomics and function (Jeon 2005).|$|E
