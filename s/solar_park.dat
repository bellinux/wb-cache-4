5|$|Many solar {{photovoltaic}} power stations have been built, mainly in Europe. As of July 2012, the largest photovoltaic (PV) {{power plants in}} the world are the Agua Caliente Solar Project (USA, 247 MW), Charanka <b>Solar</b> <b>Park</b> (India, 214 MW), Golmud <b>Solar</b> <b>Park</b> (China, 200 MW), Perovo <b>Solar</b> <b>Park</b> (Russia 100 MW), Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant (Canada, 97 MW), Brandenburg-Briest Solarpark (Germany 91 MW), Solarpark Finow Tower (Germany 84.7 MW), Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station (Italy, 84.2 MW), Eggebek <b>Solar</b> <b>Park</b> (Germany 83.6 MW), Senftenberg Solarpark (Germany 82 MW), Finsterwalde <b>Solar</b> <b>Park</b> (Germany, 80.7 MW), Okhotnykovo <b>Solar</b> <b>Park</b> (Russia, 80MW), Lopburi Solar Farm (Thailand 73.16 MW), Rovigo Photovoltaic Power Plant (Italy, 72 MW), and the Lieberose Photovoltaic Park (Germany, 71.8MW).|$|E
5|$|Some {{examples}} of such solar clusters are the Charanka <b>Solar</b> <b>Park,</b> where there are 17 different generation projects; Neuhardenberg, with eleven plants, and the Golmud solar parks with total reported capacity over 500MW. An extreme example is calling all of the solar farms in the Gujarat state of India a single <b>solar</b> <b>park,</b> the Gujarat <b>Solar</b> <b>Park.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once the <b>solar</b> <b>park</b> {{has been}} commissioned, the owner usually enters into a {{contract}} with a suitable counterparty to undertake operation and maintenance (O). In many cases this may be fulfilled by the original EPC contractor.|$|E
50|$|Gujarat <b>Solar</b> <b>Parks</b> are <b>solar</b> power {{generating}} <b>parks</b> {{being constructed}} in Gujarat, India. A {{total of about}} 1100 MW are commissioned as of March 2016, with individual <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> ranging from hundreds of kW to 40 MW capacity.|$|R
50|$|In December 2014, the Government of India {{introduced}} {{a scheme to}} establish at least 25 <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> and Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects, adding over 20 GW of installed solar power capacity. The Central Government provides financial support {{for the construction of}} these solar projects. In February 2017, the Union Cabinet increased the total number of planned <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> to 50 with a total capacity of 40 GW. By April 2017, 34 <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> were under construction across 21 states.|$|R

5|$|The availability, {{locality}} {{and capacity}} of the connection to the grid is a major consideration in planning a new <b>solar</b> <b>park,</b> and can be a significant contributor to the cost.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of a <b>solar</b> <b>park</b> {{is a function of}} the climatic conditions, the equipment used and the system configuration. The primary energy input is the global light irradiance in the plane of the solar arrays, and this in turn is a combination of the direct and the diffuse radiation.|$|E
5|$|As {{the cost}} of solar {{electricity}} has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} the 850MW Longyangxia Dam <b>Solar</b> <b>Park,</b> in Qinghai, China.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Energiekontor {{started to}} develop <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> with {{photovoltaic}} panels.|$|R
50|$|Its {{business}} consists {{mainly in}} the development and commissioning of <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> projects (land identification, sourcing of solar panels and plant equipment, sourcing of civil works, connection to the local electricity grid) and in managing and maintaining those parks, including on behalf of third parties investors the company sells its <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> to. In march 2015, the company, advised by Conquest Advisory, sold two <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> in South West France. Later in the same year, it was awarded a licence for the construction of 48 MW in Chile, after having acquired 72MW in May in the country, and won a bid for 54 MW in Punjab, India.|$|R

5|$|Deserts are {{increasingly}} seen as sources for solar energy, {{partly due to}} low amounts of cloud cover. Many successful solar power plants have {{been built in the}} Mojave Desert. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) making them the largest solar power installation in the world. Large swaths of this desert are covered in mirrors, including nine fields of solar collectors. The Mojave <b>Solar</b> <b>Park</b> is currently under construction and will produce 280MW when completed.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stations}} are sited {{within a few}} kilometres of a suitable grid connection point. This network needs {{to be capable of}} absorbing the output of the <b>solar</b> <b>park</b> when operating at its maximum capacity. The project developer will normally have to absorb the cost of providing power lines to this point and making the connection; in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid, so it can accommodate the output from the plant.|$|E
5|$|The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550MW {{power plant}} in Riverside County, California, that uses {{thin-film}} CdTe-modules made by First Solar. As of November 2014, the 550 megawatt Topaz Solar Farm was the largest photovoltaic {{power plant in}} the world. This was surpassed by the 579 MW Solar Star complex. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} Longyangxia Dam <b>Solar</b> <b>Park,</b> in Gonghe County, Qinghai, China.|$|E

50|$|Since 2014 Baturina {{has been}} {{developing}} a project to generate, use and market renewable energy in Europe. The venture {{is responsible for the}} construction and commercial operation of <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> in the south and south-east of Europe. The total investment into the project by Baturina’s structures could reach € 20 million in the coming year. Currently the company owns <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> in the south of Italy and in Greece. The next acquisitions under consideration are in Greece and Cyprus. The company is developing a subproject that consists in applying the technology that allows saving the energy obtained from renewable sources, which constitutes a whole new system of wise energy consumption. Another trend within the energy project is constructing and servicing individual <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> located mostly on the roofs of enterprises - the consumers of energy.|$|R
50|$|In December 2014, the Government of India {{introduced}} {{a scheme to}} establish at least 25 <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> and Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects to add over 20 GW of installed solar power capacity. The Central Government provides financial support {{for the construction of}} these solar projects. As of December 2016, the Central Government has provided in-principle approval to set up 34 <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> across 21 states. Each power project has a minimum capacity of 500 MW.|$|R
5|$|The first 1 MWp <b>solar</b> <b>park</b> {{was built}} by Arco Solar at Lugo near Hesperia, California {{at the end of}} 1982, {{followed}} in 1984 by a 5.2 MWp installation in Carrizo Plain. Both have since been decommissioned, though Carrizo Plain is the site for several large plants now being constructed or planned. The next stage followed the 2004 revisions to the feed-in tariffs in Germany when a substantial volume of solar parks were constructed.|$|E
5|$|UK {{projects}} were originally {{concentrated in the}} South West, but have more recently spread across the South of England and into East Anglia and the Midlands. The first <b>solar</b> <b>park</b> in Wales came on stream in 2011 at Rhosygilwen, north Pembrokeshire. As of June 2014 there were 18 schemes generating more than 5MW and 34 in planning or construction in Wales.|$|E
5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a <b>solar</b> <b>park,</b> is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E
50|$|There are two <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> in {{development}} in the town. When finished, {{it will be the}} Paraíba's largest <b>solar</b> power <b>park.</b> It has allotted 60 MW of solar power capacity to 2 solar project developers, the Usina Fotovoltaica Malta and the Usina Fotovoltaica Angicos I. This is expected to bring in investments of R$300 million.|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> were, at {{the time}} they became operational, the largest in the world or their continent, or are notable for the reasons given: ...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a hybrid {{approach}} {{to design a}} nation-wide capacitated network of <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> (SPs) as well as <b>solar</b> and wind-assisted <b>parks</b> (SWAPs) (i.e., parks that generate both solar and wind energy) for two separate countries: Nigeria and Ghana. We take into account geographical, demographical and meteorological characteristics.|$|R
5|$|A third {{approach}} achieves some of {{the output}} benefits of tracking, with a lesser penalty in terms of land area, capital and operating cost. This involves tracking the sun in one dimension – in its daily journey across the sky – but not adjusting for the seasons. The angle of the axis is normally horizontal, though some, such as the <b>solar</b> <b>park</b> at Nellis Airforce Base, which have a 20° tilt, incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation – effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{concentrated}} {{solar power}} plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, in the Mojave Desert of California, is the largest solar power plant in the world. Other large {{concentrated solar power}} plants include the 150 MW Solnova Solar Power Station and the 100 MW Andasol solar power station, both in Spain. The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project, in the United States, and the 221 MW Charanka <b>Solar</b> <b>Park</b> in India, are the world's largest photovoltaic plants. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, {{but most of the}} deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff.|$|E
25|$|The 579 {{megawatt}} Solar Star {{project in}} California was the world's largest {{photovoltaic power station}} when completed in 2015. It was superseded later that year by the Longyangxia Dam <b>Solar</b> <b>Park</b> in China.|$|E
500|$|A {{minority}} of utility-scale <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> are configured on buildings and so use building-mounted solar arrays. The majority are 'free field' systems using ground-mounted structures, usually {{of one of}} the following types: ...|$|R
5|$|A <b>solar</b> <b>park's</b> income {{derives from}} the sales of {{electricity}} to the grid, and so its output is metered in real-time with readings of its energy output provided, typically on a half-hourly basis, for balancing and settlement within the electricity market.|$|R
50|$|The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) financed two <b>solar</b> <b>parks</b> in Kazakhstan. The first one, 50MW Burnoye Solar 1, was {{established}} in April 2014. The second one, known as Burnoye Solar 2, is also 50MW and will {{be located in the}} Zhambyl region.|$|R
25|$|Over 30 GW of {{utility-scale}} photovoltaic {{power plants}} were under {{development in the}} United States in 2015. The largest is the 2,700 MW Westlands <b>Solar</b> <b>Park,</b> in Kings County, California. The Blythe Solar Power Project is a 485 MW photovoltaic station under construction in Riverside County, California. The 300 MW Sonoran Solar Project in Arizona, is a photovoltaic solar power plant that is being planned by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar granted approval for the project in December 2011.|$|E
