2500|$|The KSADS-E, {{which is}} the {{epidemiological}} version of the KSADS, is a tool to interview parents about possible psychopathology in children from preschool onward. It was developed by Puig-Antich, Orvaschel, Tabrizi, and Chambers in 1980 as a structured interview. The tool examines both past and current episodes, focusing on the most severe past episode and the most current episode. However, this tool does not rate symptom severity; it should only be used to assess {{presence or absence of}} symptomatology. This version of the K-SADS introduced screening questions, which, if negative, allowed skipping the remaining diagnostic probes. [...] Furthermore, the K-SADS-E also includes “skip out” criteria when assessing other diagnostic disorders (ADHD, PTSD, etc.), allowing those that <b>screen</b> <b>positive</b> to immediately be interviewed for all of the symptoms regarding that diagnosis, and those that screened negative could “skip out” of being interviewed on the remaining symptoms.|$|E

We used the Perceptions Regarding Investigational Screening for Memory in Primary Care (PRISM-PC) questionnaire to measure the characteristics of patients who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for dementia but refused further diagnostic assessment. METHODS: Survey of patients ≥ 65 years old without a diagnosis of dementia attending primary care clinics in Indianapolis, IN, in 2008 and 2009. RESULTS: Five hundred and fifty-four individuals completed the PRISM-PC and 63 <b>screened</b> <b>positive.</b> Of those, 21 (33 %) accepted and 42 (67 %) refused diagnostic assessment. In adjusted models, having larger stigma domain scores and living alone were significantly associated with increased odds of refusing the diagnostic assessment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare obese {{patients}} <b>screening</b> <b>positive</b> or negative for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on pretreatment body mass index (BMI), weight loss following a 16 week clinic-based behavioral weight loss program, weight loss attempts, dietary and physical activity habits, perceived difficulty of weight control skills, and eating self-efficacy. DESIGN: Patients who completed a behavioral weight loss program were approached to complete questionnaires on ADHD and eating habits. Medical charts were reviewed to obtain weight at pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: Participants (N= 63) were 75 % female, mean age was 49 (SD= 10. 3), mean body mass index (BMI) was 41. 4 kg/m² (SD= 6. 8) and 30 % <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for ADHD on the Adult ADHD Symptom Rating Scale. Participants <b>screening</b> <b>positive</b> for ADHD did not have a higher BMI at baseline (p= 0. 41), but reported more previous weight loss attempts (p= 0. 01) and lost less weight (p= 0. 02) than participants who screened negative.

40|$|Many {{adolescents}} who die by suicide have never obtained mental health services. In response to this, the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention recommends screening for elevated suicide risk in emergency departments (EDs). This cross-sectional {{study was designed}} to examine 1) the concurrent validity and utility of an adolescent suicide risk screen for use in general medical EDs and 2) the prevalence of <b>positive</b> <b>screens</b> for adolescent males and females using two different sets of screening criteria. Participants were 298 adolescents seeking pediatric or psychiatric emergency services (50 % male; 83 % white, 16 % black or African American, 5. 4 % Hispanic). The inclusion criterion was age 13 to 17 [*]years. Exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, no parent or legal guardian present to provide consent, or abnormal vital signs. Parent or guardian consent and adolescent assent were obtained for 61 % of consecutively eligible adolescents. Elevated risk was defined as 1) Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire-Junior [SIQ-JR] score of ≥ 31 or suicide attempt in the past 3 [*]months or 2) alcohol abuse plus depression (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test- 3 [AUDIT- 3] score of ≥ 3, Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale- 2 [RADS- 2] score of ≥ 76). The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT) were used to ascertain concurrent validity. Sixteen percent (n[*]=[*] 48) of adolescents <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for elevated suicide risk. Within this group, 98 % reported severe suicide ideation or a recent suicide attempt (46 % attempt and ideation, 10 % attempt only, 42 % ideation only) and 27 % reported alcohol abuse and depression. Nineteen percent of {{adolescents who}} <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> presented for nonpsychiatric reasons. One-third of adolescents with <b>positive</b> <b>screens</b> were not receiving any mental health or substance use treatment. Demonstrating concurrent validity, the BHS scores of adolescents with <b>positive</b> <b>screens</b> and the POSIT scores of those with <b>positive</b> <b>screens</b> due to alcohol abuse and depression indicated substantial impairment.

Method: ED patients aged 14 – 20 years (n = 1, 920) completed a computerized questionnaire. The analyses compared {{the rates of}} ED use between patients who screened positive for an eating disorder {{and those who did}} not and examined the reasons for ED use amongst patients with eating disorders. Results: ED patients who screened positive for eating disorders were significantly more likely to have previously visited the ED and, on average, utilized the ED at a rate 1. 6 times higher than patients who screen negative for eating disorders. The most common chief complaints among patients who <b>screen</b> <b>positive</b> for eating disorders were abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal‐related problems. Discussion: Patients with eating disorders utilize the ED more frequently than those without and commonly present for complaints seemingly unrelated to their eating disorder. © 2012 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} The ODHIN trial found that training and support and financial reimbursement increased {{the proportion of}} patients that were screened and given advice for their heavy drinking in primary health care. However, {{the impact of these}} strategies on professional accuracy in delivering screening and brief advice is under-researched and is the focus of this paper. Method From 120 primary health-care units (24 in each jurisdiction: Catalonia, England, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden), 746 providers participated in the baseline and the 12 -week implementation periods. Accuracy was measured in two ways: correctness in completing and scoring the screening instrument, AUDIT-C; the proportion of screen negative patients given advice, and the proportion of <b>screen</b> <b>positive</b> patients not given advice. Odds ratios of accuracy were calculated for type of profession, and for intervention group: training & support; financial reimbursement; and, internet-based counselling. Results. 32 of 36, 711 questionnaires were incorrectly completed, and 65 of 29, 641 screen negative patients were falsely classified. At baseline, 27 % of screen negative patients were given advice, and 22. 5 % <b>screen</b> <b>positive</b> patients were not given advice. These proportions halved during the 12 -week implementation period, unaffected by training. Financial reimbursement reduced the proportion of <b>screen</b> <b>positive</b> patients not given advice (OR = 0. 56, 95 % CI= 0. 31 to 0. 99, p< 0. 05). Conclusion. Although the use of AUDIT-C as a screening tool was accurate, a considerable proportion of risky drinkers did not receive advice, which was reduced with financial incentives...|$|E
40|$|The {{burden of}} HIV disease {{has shifted from}} {{traditional}} AIDS-defining illnesses to serious non-AIDS-defining comorbid conditions. Research aimed at improving HIV-related comorbid disease outcomes requires well-defined, verified clinical endpoints. We developed methods to ascertain and verify end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and validated screening algorithms within the largest HIV cohort collaboration in North America (NA-ACCORD). Individuals who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> among all participants in twelve cohorts enrolled between January 1996 and December 2009 underwent medical record review to verify incident ESRD or ESLD using standardized protocols. We randomly sampled 6 % of contributing cohorts to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ESLD and ESRD screening algorithms in a validation subcohort. Among 43, 433 patients screened for ESRD, 822 <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> of which 620 met clinical criteria for ESRD. The algorithm had 100 % sensitivity, 99 % specificity, 82 % PPV, and 100 % NPV for ESRD. Among 41, 463 patients screened for ESLD, 2, 024 <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> of which 645 met diagnostic criteria for ESLD. The algorithm had 100 % sensitivity, 95 % specificity, 27 % PPV, and 100 % NPV for ESLD. Our methods proved robust for ascertainment of ESRD and ESLD in persons infected with HIV...|$|R
40|$|The Pediatric Symptom Checklist, a brief psychosocial {{screening}} questionnaire, {{was used}} in a multi-center study of pediatric dermatology clinics (n= 377). Overall rates of <b>positive</b> <b>screening</b> indicated that approximately 13 % of patients <b>screened</b> <b>positive,</b> a rate similar to findings in primary care pediatric settings. Examining the sample in greater detail demonstrated that children whose dermatologic disorder is perceived {{to have a greater}} impact on their appearance are at higher risk for psychosocial dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe Iowa Department of Public Health I-Smile program {{provides}} dental screening and care coordination to over 23, 000 low-income and Medicaid-enrolled children per year. The {{purposes of this}} study were to evaluate I-Smile program effectiveness to ensure that Medicaid-enrolled children obtained dental treatment after having been screened and to determine the factors associated with failure to receive dental care after screening through the I-Smile program. MethodsBased on I-Smile program priorities, we limited our sample to children younger than 12 years of age who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for decay and who linked to a paid Medicaid claim for dental treatment (n = 1, 816). We conducted bivariate analyses to examine associations between children 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s characteristics who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for decay and received treatment within 6 months of their initial screening. We also performed multivariate logistic regression to assess the association of sociodemographic characteristics with receipt of treatment among children who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for decay. ResultsEleven percent of children <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for decay. Nearly 24 percent of children with decay received treatment based on a Medicaid-paid claim. Being 5 years or older [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) : 1. 48, confidence interval (CI) : 1. 17, 1. 88] and not having a dental home (aOR: 1. 90, CI: 1. 41, 2. 58) were associated with higher odds of not receiving dental treatment. ConclusionsChildren 5 years and older and without a dental home were less likely to obtain dental treatment. Opportunities exist for the I-Smile program to increase the numbers of at-risk children with dental homes and who obtain dental care after screening.
