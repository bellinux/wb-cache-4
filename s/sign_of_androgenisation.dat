40|$|The 2 D: 4 D {{ratio is}} the {{quotient}} between the index and ring finger lengths {{and is a}} non-direct indicator <b>of</b> <b>androgenisation.</b> If prenatal testosterone levels in the amniotic fluid are high then the probability increases of developing lower ratio values. It {{has been suggested that}} people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and their parents may have highly androgenised brains, and for this reason the 2 D: 4 D ratio is used as a marker of such idiosyncrasies. This study aims to analyse if parents of people with ASD differ from the general population in several parameters <b>of</b> <b>androgenisation</b> related to the 2 D: 4 D ratio. The sample was composed of 43 parents of offspring with ASD and 42 controls who had the 2 D: 4 D ratio measured, answered several trait questionnaires, and had their testosterone and cortisol levels measured. Although there were no differences between groups in the 2 D: 4 D ratio, the left hand of the ASD parents showed greater predictive ability to explain empathy and autism quotients, cooperative behaviour, and cortisol levels. In addition, the severity of the symptoms of their offspring was predicted only with male parents. The results indicate that the 2 D: 4 D ratio could be used together with other parameters as an indicator of the likelihood of developing autistic traits in offspring...|$|R
40|$|It is {{becoming}} evident that oral hormonal contraceptives –besides being well established contraceptives – seem to become important medications for many functional or organic disturbances. So far, clinical effectiveness {{has been shown}} for treatment as well as prevention of menstrual bleeding disorders and menstrual-related pain symptoms. Also {{this is true for}} premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual disphoric disorder (PMDD). Particular oral contraceptives (OCs) containing anti-androgenic progestogens were shown to be effective medications for treatment <b>of</b> <b>androgenisation</b> symptoms (seborrhea, acne, hirsutism, alopecia). Through perfect suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis OCs have proven to be effective in elimination of persistent follicular cysts. Endometriosis/adenomyosis related pain symptoms are well handled similar to other drugs like Gonadotropine Releasing Hormone agonists but are less expensive, with less side effects, and possibility to be used for longer periods of time. This is also true for myoma. Pelvic inflammatory disease, rheumatoid arthritis, menstrual migraine, and onset of multiple sclerosis are prevented or delayed. Bone density is preserved and asthma symptoms improved. Endometrial hyperplasia and benign breast disease can be controlled. There is definitely a significant impact on risk reduction regarding endometrial, ovarian, and colon cancers. In conclusion, it needs to be recognized that oral combined hormonal contraceptives (estrogen / progestogen combination) are – besides being reliable forms of contraception – are cost-effective medications for many medical disorders in women. Therefore, thes...|$|R

From 1900 onwards, Ell pushed {{for the creation of}} a network of scenic reserves along Christchurch's Port Hills, linked by the Summit Road and with a network of rest-houses to allow travellers and walkers to refresh themselves. Three of these rest-houses, designed by architect Samuel Hurst Seager, were completed during Ell's lifetime: the <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Bellbird, <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Kiwi, and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Packhorse. The last, and grandest, the <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Takahe, was not completed until long after Ell’s death, in 1949. All four houses were built of local stone, and designed to blend in with the landscape. The <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Kiwi and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Takahe still function as commercial rest stops serving refreshments while the <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Bellbird survives only as a shelter, but is still a useful stopping place for a picnic and the starting point for some short walks.
