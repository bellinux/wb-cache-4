5|$|Dunstan pursued similar reforms {{with respect}} to Indigenous Australians. In 1962, the Aboriginal Affairs Bill was {{introduced}} to liberalise constraints that had been placed on Indigenous Australians {{in the past and}} had effectively resulted in segregation. The initial proposal still retained some restrictions, placing more controls over full-blooded Aborigines. Dunstan was prominent in Labor's opposition to the double standards, and called for abolition of race-based restrictions, saying that <b>social</b> <b>objectives</b> could be achieved without explicit colour-based schemes. He was successful in forcing amendments to liberalise controls on property and the confinement of Indigenous Australians to reserves. However, his attempt to remove the different standards required of part and full-blooded Aborigines failed, as did his proposal to ensure that {{at least half of the}} members of the Aboriginal Affairs Board be Indigenous Australians. Despite the passage of the bill, restrictions remained in place and Dunstan questioned the policy of assimilation of Aborigines, which he saw as the diluting of their distinctive cultures.|$|E
