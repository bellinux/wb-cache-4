30|$|As manual traffic data {{collection}} is deemed infeasible as discussed above, {{the need for}} automated traffic {{data collection}} for roundabouts arises. Unlike relatively developed systems/tools for automated data collection for highways, those for automated traffic data collection for roundabouts are relatively scarce in the literature. The most relevant work to automated traffic data collection for roundabouts is those for signalized/un-signalized intersections [5, 6, 19, 20]. In [5, 6], wireless sensors were designed and used for detection of individual vehicle passing similar to how the loop inductor works for detection and counting of highway traffic. A sensor is typically placed close to the <b>stopping</b> <b>line</b> of each lane (but {{in the middle of}} the lane), and a vehicle was detected and recorded when it drove past it. When a vehicle makes a turn, ideally it is first detected by the sensor from the source lane and then by the sensor from the destination lane. In this way, vehicle turning volumes, which are a very desirable type of traffic data for intersections, can be automatically collected. However, the sensor approach has a fundamental algorithm limitation in that a cross-turning (for instance from North to East) may not be distinguished from a right turn (for instance from South to East), which results in inherent counting errors [19]. Besides, the sensor approach may collect only turning volumes, not other types of traffic data such as vehicle speed, waiting time and accepted/rejected gap sizes. If extending the sensor approach for intersections to roundabouts, the situation would be similar that only vehicle volume from entrances/exits may be collected. Therefore, the senor approach for intersections is not considered acceptable for traffic data collection of roundabouts.|$|E
50|$|Traffic {{signals in}} most areas of Europe are located at the <b>stop</b> <b>line</b> on {{same side of the}} {{intersection}} as the approaching traffic (there being both right- and left-hand traffic) and are often mounted overhead as well as on side of the road. At particularly busy junctions for freight, higher lights may be mounted specifically for trucks. The <b>stop</b> <b>line</b> alignment is done to prevent vehicles blocking any crosswalk and allow for better pedestrian traffic flow. There may also be a special area a few meters in advance of the <b>stop</b> <b>line</b> where cyclists may legally wait but not motor vehicles; this advanced <b>stop</b> <b>line</b> is often painted with a different road surface with greater friction and a high colour, both for the benefit of cyclists and for other vehicles. The traffic lights are mounted so that cyclists can still see them.|$|R
