2500|$|The Sifre {{taught that}} when Moses saw the merciful manner of Aaron's death, Moses {{concluded}} {{that he would}} want to die the same way.

At that moment, Moses concluded that one would be happy to die that way. And that is why God later told Moses in [...] that Moses would die [...] "as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people," [...] for that was the manner of death that Moses had wanted.|$|E
