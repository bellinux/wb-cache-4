5|$|According to a DJ Premier fan blog, The Source's {{website and}} other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and {{was said to}} lack health insurance. He had <b>surgery</b> for kidney stones, with a stent placed to relieve the pressure. He needed {{follow-up}} <b>surgery</b> but St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, the site that performed the previous <b>surgery,</b> has requested that he make a deposit toward the next <b>surgery,</b> because he has missed several follow-up visits. The hospital {{said it would not}} turn away uninsured patients in the emergency room. DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on which he describes his medical issue and the larger goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer long-term health care solutions. In April 2013, Campbell recovered from <b>surgery</b> and moved into post-medical care.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative <b>surgery</b> to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during <b>surgery</b> to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before <b>surgery</b> in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by <b>surgery.</b> No potentially curative treatment exists except <b>surgery,</b> but most people have advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time of diagnosis. People with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though not cured - with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other palliative care measures. These are also used as additional therapies after <b>surgery</b> in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so).|$|E

40|$|Objective: Laparoscopy {{has gained}} {{worldwide}} popularity {{during the past}} 2 decades; however, it remains unclear whether repeat <b>surgeries</b> are affected by primary <b>surgeries.</b> Our objectives were to explore whether laparoscopy is the preferred choice for repeat <b>surgeries</b> in managing recurrent adnexal tumors and whether primary <b>surgeries</b> affect the choices. Materials and methods: Women who were covered by the National Health Insurance, Taiwan, and received repeat <b>surgeries</b> for recurrent adnexal tumors in Taiwan during 1999 – 2009 were identified. Results: A total of 135, 793 women who received either laparotomy or laparoscopy for benign adnexal tumors were identified. Of them, 6609 women were admitted for repeat <b>surgeries</b> for recurrent adnexal tumors. The rates of using same-type operations (i. e., laparotomy-to-laparotomy or laparoscopy-to-laparoscopy) for repeat <b>surgeries</b> were 50. 25 % and 79. 01 % for laparotomy and laparoscopy, respectively (p <  0. 0001). Conclusion: The choices of repeat <b>surgeries</b> were different after primary <b>surgeries</b> for recurrent adnexal tumors between the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups...|$|R
