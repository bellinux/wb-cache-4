25|$|A serious {{difficulty}} arises if the variables are not {{measured in the}} same units. First consider measuring distance between a data point and the curve – what are the measurement units for this distance? If we consider measuring distance based on Pythagoras' Theorem then {{it is clear that}} we shall be adding quantities measured in different units, and so this leads to meaningless results. Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different curve). To avoid this problem of incommensurability it is sometimes <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the Mahalanobis distance from the points to the line, providing a maximum-likelihood solution; the unknown precisions could be found via analysis of variance.|$|E

He <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [...] he convinced me {{it might be}} a good idea. We talked about it for a little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [...] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it was going to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of Back to the Future was {{finished}} in February 1981 and presented to Columbia, who put the film in turnaround. [...] "They {{thought it was a}} really nice, cute, warm film, but not sexual enough," [...] Gale said. [...] "They <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> take it to Disney, but we decided to see if any other of the major studios wanted a piece of us." [...] Every major film studio rejected the script for the next four years, while Back to the Future went through two more drafts. During the early 1980s, popular teen comedies (such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's) were risqué and adult-aimed, so the script was commonly rejected for being too light. Gale and Zemeckis finally decided to pitch Back to the Future to Disney. [...] "They told us that a mother falling in love with her son was not appropriate for a family film under the Disney banner," [...] Gale said.|$|E

The film portrays a fictional nuclear war between the United States/NATO and the Soviet Union/Warsaw Pact. After the film, a panel discussion is presented in which Carl Sagan <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need {{to reduce the number of}} nuclear weapons as a matter of [...] "planetary hygiene".

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{the discussions}} about public spheres got a new biopolitical twist. Traditionally the public spheres had been {{contemplated}} as to how free agents transgress the private spheres. Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have, drawing on the late Michel Foucault's writings on biopolitics, <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> reconsider the very distinction between public and private spheres. They argue that the traditional distinction is founded on a certain (capitalist) account of property that presupposes clear-cut separations between interests. This account of property is (according to Hardt and Negri) based upon a scarcity economy. The scarcity economy is characterized by an impossibility of sharing the goods. If [...] "agent A" [...] eats the bread, [...] "agent B" [...] cannot have it. The interests of agents are thus, generally, clearly separated.|$|E

2500|$|Instead, Anselm <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> owe God {{a debt of}} honor: [...] "This is {{the debt}} which man and angel owe to God, and no one who pays this debt commits sin; but every one who does not pay it sins. This is justice, or uprightness of will, which makes a being just or upright in heart, that is, in will; {{and this is the}} sole and {{complete}} debt of honor which we owe to God, and which God requires of us." [...] Having failed to render to God this debt, {{it is not enough to}} restore the justice originally owed, but the offense to God's honor must be satisfied, too. [...] "Moreover, so long as he does not restore what he has taken away, he remains in fault; and it will not suffice merely to restore what has been taken away, but, considering the contempt offered, he ought to restore more than he took away." [...] This debt creates an imbalance in the moral universe; God cannot simply ignore it according to Anselm. The only way to satisfy the debt was for a being of infinite greatness, acting as a man on behalf of men, to repay the debt of justice owed to God and satisfy the injury to divine honor. In light of this view, the [...] "ransom" [...] that Jesus mentions in the Gospels would be a sacrifice and a debt paid only to God the Father.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, {{following}} his final term at Carlisle, Standing Bear, {{armed with a}} recommendation by Captain Pratt, returned home to the Rosebud Agency, Rosebud, South Dakota, where he was hired as an assistant at the reservation's school at the salary of three hundred dollars a year. In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Luther moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother Ellis Standing Bear to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. [...] Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Luther became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle’s little general store. [...] One day {{they were talking about}} the delay in mail delivery. [...] “I told my uncle that John Wanamaker, the man for whom I had worked in Philadelphia, was Postmaster-General, and that I would write and see if we could not have a post office established at his camp. [...] I <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker received my letter, he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who was one of our missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, but I took care of the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.|$|E
