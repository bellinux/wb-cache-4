Zuihō was also initially equipped with four twin 25mm Type 96 light AA guns, also in <b>sponsons</b> {{along the sides of}} the hull. In 1943, her light AA armament was increased to 48 twenty-five mm guns. The following year, an additional twenty 25mm guns were added in addition to six 28-round AA rocket launchers.|$|E

5|$|The ship's primary {{armament}} {{consisted of}} a dozen 40-caliber 12.7cm Type 89 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts. Their <b>sponsons</b> were positioned to allow them some measure of cross-deck fire. Katsuragi was also equipped with 22 triple 25mm Type 96 and thirty single Type 96 AA gun mounts, most on <b>sponsons</b> {{along the sides of}} the hull. These guns were supplemented by six 28-round AA rocket launchers. For defense against submarines, the carrier was fitted with six depth charge throwers and carried between six and ten depth charges for them.|$|E
5|$|Six {{external}} hardpoints {{were located}} {{along the bottom}} of the helicopter, with two under each wing and two on the fuselage under the <b>sponsons.</b> The two inner wing hardpoints could carry pods of three TOW anti-tank missiles. 2.75-inch (70mm) rockets in 7-rocket or 19-rocket launchers could be carried on the four wing hardpoints. The two fuselage mounts were dedicated to carrying external fuel tanks. The wing hardpoints were also plumbed to allow the carriage of additional fuel tanks if required.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifeboats}} onboard equipment {{includes the}} latest in electronic equipment including radar, a chart plotter and VHF radio direction finding equipment. Running around {{the outside of the}} hull is an inflatable tube constructed of tough Nylon weave. This tube, or <b>Sponson</b> is made up of separate compartments. If one of the compartments is accidentally punctured then the others will remain inflated. Should all the compartments become compromised the lifeboat would still be capable of floating without the <b>sponson.</b> The <b>sponson</b> allowing the boat to operate in rough seas and provides fendering when going alongside other vessels.|$|R

5|$|The cruisers' hulls were {{constructed}} with transverse steel frames with yellow pine planking {{up to the}} upper deck. A layer of Muntz metal sheathing covered the hull to protect the wood from shipworm. The stem and sternposts {{were constructed}} with steel and timber. A bronze naval ram was fitted at the bow. The hull was divided into ten watertight compartments, and a double bottom was installed below the boiler rooms. The ships were good sea boats, but they rolled badly and the <b>sponsons</b> for the main guns caused severe vibration. Since Geier was laid down after the other five ships entered service, she was redesigned slightly to discard the <b>sponsons,</b> and so she did not suffer from bad vibration. They were very maneuverable, except for turns into the wind when steaming at low speed. The ships had a crew of 9officers and 152enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one cutter, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|Westland also {{manufactured}} SAR {{versions of}} the Sea King for the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the German Navy and the Belgian Air Force. On SAR variants, the cabin was enlarged by a stretch of the fuselage behind the door; another key feature, used for additional flotation in the unusual event of a water landing, inflatable buoyancy bags were housed inside the aircraft's <b>sponsons.</b> Upgrades and changes made to SAR Sea Kings include the addition of radar warning receivers, a cargo hook for the underslung carriage of goods, and the redesigning of the cockpit for compatibility with night vision goggles.|$|E
5|$|In early 1924, Florida {{took part}} in the Fleet Problem III maneuvers, where she and her sister Utah acted as stand-ins for the new s. In June 1924, Florida was taken out of service for a {{modernization}} at the Boston Navy Yard, which lasted from 1 April 1925 to 1 November 1926. During the reconstruction, her deck armor was strengthened and anti-torpedo blisters were installed to increase her resistance to underwater damage. Her secondary battery was rearranged to improve its efficiency, and four of her 5-inch guns, which were mounted in <b>sponsons,</b> were removed. She was also reboilered with four White-Forster oil-fired models that had been removed from the battleships and battlecruisers scrapped {{as a result of the}} Washington Naval Treaty. Her Parsons turbines were replaced with new Curtis geared turbines and her two funnels were trunked into one stack. The rear lattice mast was replaced with a pole mast, which was moved further aft. Her two submerged torpedo tubes were also removed.|$|E

25|$|Named America and {{launched}} 22 June 1914, trials began {{the following day}} and soon revealed a serious shortcoming in the design: the tendency for {{the nose of the}} aircraft to try to submerge as engine power increased while taxiing on water. This phenomenon had not been encountered before, since Curtiss' earlier designs had not used such powerful engines. In order to counteract this effect, Curtiss fitted fins to the sides of the bow to add hydrodynamic lift, but soon replaced these with <b>sponsons</b> to add more buoyancy. Both prototypes, once fitted with <b>sponsons,</b> were then called Model H-2s incrementally updated alternating in succession. These <b>sponsons</b> would remain a prominent feature of flying boat hull design in the decades to follow. With the problem resolved, preparations for the transatlantic crossing resumed, and 5 August 1914 was selected {{to take advantage of the}} full moon.|$|E
25|$|Note: These <b>sponsons</b> {{were also}} fitted with aircraft-style hardpoints {{that allowed the}} {{mounting}} of XM159B/XM159C 19-tube 2.75"-rocket launchers or M18/M18A1 7.62×51mm gun pods.|$|E

25|$|The Seastar's {{fuselage}} {{is composed}} of a fiberglass composite material, which is corrosion-proof {{as well as being}} less prone to leaks in comparison to rivetted metal hull counterparts. Unlike typical floatplanes, which are often conversions of land-based aircraft, the Seastar has a low vertical center of gravity, achieved in part by carrying all of its fuel within its <b>sponsons</b> instead of the wings. The <b>sponsons,</b> which provide stability while submerged on the water, are shaped to break surface tension and to generate considerable lift during the acceleration performed during takeoff; they also accommodate the main landing gear. Other flying boats often retract the landing gear into the hull instead. The landing gear can be optionally removed and reinstalled when needed; a special 'water mode' for the landing gear is also present which prevents their deployment during a water-based landing.|$|E
25|$|The main {{armament}} of Yoshino {{consisted of}} four separate Elswick QF 6 inch /40 naval guns behind gun shields, which were placed as {{bow and stern}} guns and in <b>sponsons</b> near the bridge. Secondary armament consisted of eight Elswick QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I–IV quick-firing guns mounted {{on the sides of}} the hull and 22 QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss guns.|$|E

More exotic materials include carbon fiber and foam core. Some kayaks are hand-built from plywood or wood strips covered with fiberglass. Skin-on-frame kayaks are built on wood or aluminum frames covered in canvas, dacron, or other fabrics, and may include inflatable tubes called <b>sponsons.</b>|$|E
