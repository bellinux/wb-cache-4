500|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza, Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening, and Ushkowitz, from the Broadway revival of The King and I. The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele. Colfer had no previous professional experience, but reminded Ryan {{of the character of}} Kurt from The Sound of Music, and was thus cast as Kurt Hummel. He originally auditioned for Artie with the song [...] "Mr. Cellophane", however Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him. Colfer commented on his casting: [...] "I'm <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> be a part of something that is so new and different and so needed at this time.

[...] In addition, Forcella positively compared the character growth of Nellie Bertam to Michael Scott, noting [...] "the most heartwarming moment [...] her scene with Pam, in which Nellie was <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> have made a friend, reminded me of so many Michael Scott moments of the past." [...] Brett Harrison Davinger from The California Literary Review wrote moderately positive of the episode, saying, [...] "Tonight's episode worked for the most part thanks to the ever reliable Robert California and the usually reliable Jim and Dwight: Partners." [...] However, he did retroactively criticize season eight for not elaborating on the problems facing Dunder Mifflin until [...] "Turf War". In addition, he called the premise of Andy seeking Wallace's help [...] "iffy ... even if it was predictable". Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave wrote, [...] "The immediate, don't over-analyze opinion here is that 'Turf War' is a top three episode of season 8, with a chance of it being number one." [...] Furthermore, he concluded that the episode [...] "was good, very good, and a nice way to get set for the season/series finale. ... The Office can still bring it when it wants to." ...|$|E

She explained that she had wanted to work with Hunter again for some time, and was happy to be able to film another music video alongside him. In an interview with MTV News, Carey described her feelings regarding the video, as well as sentiments towards the video's director, Hunter: [...] "But I was <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> work with him again 'cause ever since 'Honey' I've been trying to relive the splendor of that moment. It's more of just a plain beauty piece with sentimental overtones, but it was great to work with Paul again." [...] Following a tale of love and separation, the video alternates between two different time frames. The first of these involves a tearful Carey in the present, while the second invokes memories of a relationship with a former lover (played by Dolce & Gabbana model Christian Monzon). When questioned regarding a possible relationship with Monzon, Carey said [...] "Erm, how do we play this? OK, he’s a very nice guy, he's been in a fabulous Dolce & Gabbana advert - did you see it?

500|$|The storyline began {{on-screen}} when Nicole {{started dating}} Elliot Gillen (Paul Pantano). He had a vendetta against Roman and kidnapped Nicole and Geoff {{and left them}} stranded out at sea. They washed up on a deserted island and were forced to survive without food and clothing. Describing the effect it had on Nicole and Geoff, James stated: [...] "They have no food, shelter or clothing. [...] They find moments to make each other laugh, though, and realise how much they mean to one another." [...] Geoff had strong religious views and {{did not believe in}} premarital sex. However, the environment they were in caused him to let his guard down and they slept together. Lewis told TV Week that all the pair could think of whilst trapped was being rescued and their feelings for one an other. He added that [...] "the fact they were both pretty much naked didn't help". He concluded the fact they were both kids, trying to keep warm - that then [...] "stuff happens". Geoff was left [...] "guilt-ridden" [...] because he gave into temptation. He did not regret it, but acknowledged that he wanted to save his virginity until marriage. Therefore, Geoff saw no other option but to propose to Nicole. Lewis stated, [...] "He's not 100% sure about that either, but he feels that if they're going to have sex, a wedding is the only solution." [...] Describing Nicole's reaction he said that she was [...] "dumbfounded" [...] by his offer, as she had believed he was acting strange because he wanted to dump her. Nicole refused when she realised his reasons for proposing. According to James, the moment managed to ruin their passion, she also commented that: [...] "Nicole has liked Geoff for ages and was <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> have got together with him - but now he's spoiled it." [...] James also admitted she was trilled to learn Nicole would turn down his proposal. James later opined that Nicole was [...] "the one" [...] for Geoff, but did not believe that Geoff was [...] "the one" [...] for Nicole.|$|E
500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E
