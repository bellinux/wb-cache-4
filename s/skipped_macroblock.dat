40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{macroblock}} skip-mode prediction algorithm to reduce the computational effort of video encoders. The algorithm classifies each macroblock as “skipped ” or “not skipped ” by estimating the energy of low-frequency quantized coefficients prior to coding, making it possible to significantly reduce computation by not coding these <b>skipped</b> <b>macroblocks</b> Results show that the algorithm can achieve substantial computational savings with only a small degradation in rate-distortion performance. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for the optimized {{selection of the}} SKIP coding mode in H. 264 /AVC, when applied to High Definition video sequences, for real time services. By resorting to Motion Segmentation and Detection strategies, the number of <b>skipped</b> <b>macroblocks</b> within each encoded frame is increased, thus allowing to speed up significantly the encoding process, without affecting the final quality, thanks to the high amount of visual information carried by High Definition video formats...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new Inter Macroblock type within the H. 264 (or MPEG- 4 AVC) video coding standard that can further improve coding efficiency by exploiting the temporal correlation of motion within a sequence. This leads {{to a reduction in}} the bits required for encoding motion information, while retaining or even improving quality under a Rate Distortion Optimization Framework. An extension of this concept within the <b>skip</b> <b>macroblock</b> type of the same standard is also presented. Simulation results show that the proposed semantic changes can lead to up to 7. 6 % average bitrate reduction or equivalently 0. 39 dB quality improvement over the current H. 264 standard...|$|R
30|$|As the {{proposed}} McFIS {{would be a}} better choice of a reference frame especially for smooth areas, true background and uncovered background areas compared to the other four previous frames, we have introduced a new <b>skip</b> <b>macroblock</b> (MB) condition by comparing current MB and its co-located MB in the McFIS. If the difference between these two MBs is small then we consider the current MB as skipped MB. The rationality of the new skipped MB is that small changes between the current MB and the co-located MB in the McFIS indicate that the current MB is a part of a stable background, thus no need to encode (due to no motion and small residual error) it rather than just simply copy it from the McFIS.|$|R
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of video services on power limited platforms, {{it is necessary to}} consider both performance-centric and constraint-centric signal processing techniques. Traditionally, video applications have a bandwidth or computational resources constraint or both. The recent H. 264 /AVC video compression standard offers significantly improved efficiency and flexibility compared to previous standards, which leads to less emphasis on bandwidth. However, its high computational complexity is a problem for codecs running on power limited plat- forms. Therefore, a technique that integrates both complexity and bandwidth issues in a single framework should be considered. In this thesis we investigate complexity adaptation of a video coder which focuses on managing computational complexity and provides significant complexity savings when applied to recent standards. It consists of three sub functions specially designed for reducing complexity and a framework for using these sub functions; Variable Block Size (VBS) partitioning, fast motion estimation, <b>skip</b> <b>macroblock</b> detection, and complexity adaptation framework. Firstly, the VBS partitioning algorithm based on the Walsh Hadamard Transform (WHT) is presented. The key idea is to segment regions of an image as edges or flat regions {{based on the fact that}} prediction errors are mainly affected by edges. Secondly, a fast motion estimation algorithm called Fast Walsh Boundary Search (FWBS) is presented on the VBS partitioned images. Its results outperform other commonly used fast algorithms. Thirdly, a <b>skip</b> <b>macroblock</b> detection algorithm is proposed for use prior to motion estimation by estimating the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients after quantisation. A new orthogonal transform called the S-transform is presented for predicting Integer DCT coefficients from Walsh Hadamard Transform coefficients. Complexity saving is achieved by deciding which macroblocks need to be processed and which can be skipped without processing. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves significant complexity savings with a negligible loss in rate-distortion performance. Finally, a complexity adaptation framework which combines all three techniques mentioned above is proposed for maximizing the perceptual quality of coded video on a complexity constrained platform...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel face-assisted video coding scheme {{to enhance the}} visual quality of the face regions in video telephony applications. A skin-color based face detection and tracking scheme is proposed to locate the face regions in real-time. After classifying the macroblocks into the face and non-face regions, we present a dynamic distortion weighting adjustment (DDWA) scheme to drop the static non-face macroblocks, and the saved bits are used to compensate the face region by adjusting the distortion weighting of the face macroblocks. The quality of face regions will thus be enhanced. Moreover, the computation originally required for the <b>skipped</b> <b>macroblocks</b> can also be saved. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method can significantly improve the PSNR and the subjective quality of face regions, while the degradation introduced on the non-face areas is relatively insensitive to human perception. The proposed algorithm is fully compatible with H. 263 standard, and the low complexity feature makes it well suited to implement for real-time applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|Today’s H. 264 /AVC coded videos {{have a high}} quality, high data-compression ratio. They {{also have}} a strong fault tolerance, better network adaptability, and have been widely applied on the Internet. With the {{popularity}} of powerful and easy-to-use video editing software, digital videos can be tampered with in various ways. Therefore, the double compression in the H. 264 /AVC video {{can be used as}} a first step in the study of video-tampering forensics. This paper proposes a simple, but effective, double-compression detection method that analyzes the periodic features of the string of data bits (SODBs) and the <b>skip</b> <b>macroblocks</b> (S-MBs) for all I-frames and P-frames in a double-compressed H. 264 /AVC video. For a given suspicious video, the SODBs and S-MBs are extracted for each frame. Both features are then incorporated to generate one enhanced feature to represent the periodic artifact of the double-compressed video. Finally, a time-domain analysis is conducted to detect the periodicity of the features. The primary Group of Pictures (GOP) size is estimated based on an exhaustive strategy. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|DCT-based CODECs such as MPEG- 4 Visual and H. 263 “skip ” many macroblocks during {{encoding}} {{of typical}} video sequences (i. e. no coded data is transmitted for these macroblocks). This paper describes an algorithm that predicts macroblocks {{that are likely}} to be skipped by the encoder. The algorithm estimates the increase in distortion due to not coding (<b>skipping)</b> each <b>macroblock.</b> Macroblocks that can be skipped with little or no increase in distortion are not coded, resulting in substantial computational savings without significantly affecting ratedistortion performance. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{consideration}} of better motion compensation techniques for inter-frame prediction {{is one of}} the key reasons why the new H. 264 (MPEG- 4 AVC) video coding standard can achieve considerably better coding efficiency compared to older standards such as MPEG- 2 / 4 and H. 263. These include the use of multiple references and block sizes, a better interpolation filter for subpixel motion compensation, and more efficient exploitation of the spatio-temporal correlation between motion vectors of adjacent blocks through the {{consideration of}} SKIP and DIRECT modes. In this paper we introduce additional methods into H. 264 that further enhance motion compensation and can lead to additional improvements in coding efficiency. This is achieved by further exploiting motion vector temporal correlation through the introduction of a new DIRECT macroblock type and an enhancement to the existing <b>Skip</b> <b>Macroblock</b> type within Predictive (P) slices. These new macroblock types can lead to a considerable reduction in the bits required for encoding motion information, while retaining or even improving quality under a Rate Distortion Optimization Framework. Our simulation results suggest that the proposed improvements can lead up to 7. 6 % average bitrate reduction or equivalently 0. 39 dB quality improvement over the current H. 264 standard. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new motion vector prediction method {{that could be used}} within multiple picture reference codecs, such as the H. 264 (MPEG- 4 AVC) video coding standard. Our method considers for each candidate motion vector the temporal distance of its corresponding reference picture compared to the current one for the generation of the predictor motion vector. This allows for more accurate motion vector prediction, and better exploitation of the temporal correlation that may exist within a video sequence. Furthermore, we also {{introduce a}} modification to the <b>SKIP</b> motion vector <b>macroblock</b> mode, according to which not only the motion vectors but also the reference indices are adaptively generated. Simulation results suggest that our proposed methods, combined with an improved Rate Distortion optimization strategy, if implemented within the existing H. 264 codec, can allow for a considerable performance improvement of up to 8. 6 % bitrate reduction compared to the current H. 264 standard...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve a high {{compression}} ratio, the H. 264 /AVC standard has incorporated {{a large number of}} coding modes which must be evaluated during the coding process to determine the optimal rate-distortion tradeoff. The coding gains of H. 264 /AVC arise at the expense of significant coder complexity which may not be desired for mobile devices with limited battery life. One coder process that has been identified as having potential for achieving computation savings is the selection between skipping the coding of a macroblock and coding of the macroblock in one of the remaining coding modes. In low-motion subsequences, a large percentage of macroblocks are “skipped”, that is, no coded data are transmitted for these macroblocks. By estimating which macroblocks are to be skipped during the coding process, significant savings in computation can be realized, since the coder then does not evaluate the ratedistortion costs of all candidate coding modes. In this work we place this skip versus code decision in a Bayesian framework. We use the rate-distortion cost difference between coding and <b>skipping</b> a <b>macroblock</b> as the single decision feature and determine an appropriate decision threshold following modeling of the cost difference’s class-conditional PDFs. Finally, in order to further limit system complexity, we model the threshold’s parameters as functions of application- and sequence-specific characteristics, namely, the quantization parameter and an activity factor. This results in a decision threshold that is only a function of these two characteristics, which are either known or easily measured. It is shown that this approach can result in a time savings of over 80 % for low-motion sequences at a negligible decrease or, in certain cases, a slight increase in quality over a reference H. 264 codec...|$|R
