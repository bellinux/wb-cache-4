500|$|Following a {{trial at}} the club, Gill signed for Cheltenham Town on 25 February 2004 on a non-{{contract}} basis {{until the end}} of the season. He was given a one-year contract for the 2004–05 season and, at the age of 34, played in all 46 league games; he believed that all the fitness work he did during rehabilitation from his knee injury had given him a new lease of life. Gill acted as regular deputy when club captain John Finnigan was unavailable through injury. For the following season, he was given another one-year contract, with an option for 2006–07 if he managed to play 20 games during the season. Not only did he start twice that number, he contributed to the club reaching the final of the League Two play-offs at the Millennium Stadium. His starting place and winners' medal, achieved with the help of his [...] "excellent last-ditch defending", went some way to alleviate the disappointment of missing the 2001 League Cup final. In addition, his <b>sales</b> <b>experience</b> enabled the players to look smart for the occasion; expecting to be wearing tracksuits for their big day because the club was unable to afford a set of new suits, Gill persuaded a local outfitters to supply a set of suits at reasonable cost. While at Cheltenham Town he became a fan favourite and even had a song created by the fans who jokingly sung about his less than impressive goal scoring abilities, [...] "If Jerry scores, We're on the pitch, if Jerry scores, We're on the pitch!"
