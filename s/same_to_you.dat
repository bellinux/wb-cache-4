500|$|Aratus of Sicyon, the strategos of the Achaean League, {{tried to}} re-take Tegea and Orchomenus {{in a night}} attack. Efforts from inside the city failed, though, and Aratus quietly retreated, hoping to remain unnoticed. Cleomenes {{nonetheless}} discovered the plan and {{sent a message to}} Aratus asking about the goal of his expedition. Aratus replied that he had come to stop Cleomenes from fortifying Belbina. Cleomenes responded to this by saying: [...] "If it's all the <b>same</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> write and tell me why you brought along those torches and ladders." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{would have}} given the <b>same</b> pledge <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Lucy, and purely on your own account. It would be too much <b>to</b> cause <b>you</b> <b>to</b> mourn for your brother's--" ...|$|R
60|$|BERTLEY. <b>Same</b> <b>to</b> <b>you!</b> Ah! Ann! I've {{got into}} {{touch with her}} young husband--he's coming round.|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{may seem}} {{nonsense}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{is not the}} <b>same</b> <b>to</b> her. <b>You</b> must be forbearing, Ethel. Remember that dependence is prone to morbid sensitiveness, especially in {{those who have a}} humble estimate of themselves." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 4. Is thy {{body to be}} disfigured, dismembered, starved, hanged, or burned for {{the faith}} and {{profession}} of the gospel? Why, a Creator can either prevent it, or, suffering it, can restore it the very <b>same</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> again, with great and manifold advantage. He that made <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> be now what thou art, can make <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> be what thou never yet wast. It doth not yet appear what we shall be, further than only by general words (1 John 3:2; Phil 3:21).|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, {{if it is}} the <b>same</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> ma'am, I {{would rather}} stand while I'm here. In the refectory, of course, it's different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{pass the}} bottle. Save the glass for company. Thanks! That hits the spot. The <b>same</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> My first drink in three months! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Three {{together}} and one {{somewhere on the}} outskirts. If it's all the <b>same</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> old thing, I'll have {{the one on the}} outskirts." ...|$|E
5000|$|Antonio: Well, tell me now, what lady is the <b>same</b> <b>To</b> whom <b>you</b> swore {{a secret}} pilgrimage That <b>you</b> today promised <b>to</b> tell me of? (MOV 1.1.119-121) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Aunt Sarah {{has been}} saying exactly the <b>same</b> <b>to</b> me. <b>You</b> can't think how eloquent Aunt Sarah has been. And her energy has quite {{surprised}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|OCTAVIUS. She is the <b>same</b> <b>to</b> everybody, Jack: <b>you</b> {{know her}} ways.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if it's all the <b>same</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> sir, I should say, Damn the Congress, {{but then}} I'm no politician, {{but only a}} {{business}} man." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Do {{you hear}} that, Betsy?' said Mrs Jiniwin, in a warning voice. 'How often have I said the <b>same</b> words <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and almost gone down my knees when I spoke 'em!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Only {{yesterday}} I heard Mademoiselle Potin {{doing that}} very <b>same</b> thing <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> [...] "It {{is that you}} do not care, Master Steve. It {{is that you do}} not care. You do not want to care.") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But what harm {{has been}} done you? From what you {{yourself}} have told me, I know that Miss Crawley has said the <b>same</b> thing <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that she has said <b>to</b> your father. <b>You</b> can't but admire her for the feeling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Discharged!" [...] cried Dorothy. [...] "Why, I {{never was}} {{discharged}} in my life, and I don't intend to be. If it's all the <b>same</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> I'll resign." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's very prettily said, and I {{wish the}} <b>same</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Only you mustn't be so down like. There's Maryanne; {{she says you}} haven't a word for her now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On what grounds, Mr. Fitzgerald!" [...] she said, repeating his question; [...] "surely I need hardly tell you. Did not my son say the <b>same</b> thing <b>to</b> <b>you</b> yesterday, as {{he walked}} with you down the avenue?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This gentleman {{came under}} a misapprehension," [...] Violet answered. [...] "I am sorry, but the <b>same</b> thing applies <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I {{do not receive}} gentlemen here." ...|$|R

60|$|RANDALL. If it's all the <b>same</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> I had rather you didn't {{play them}} on me. You evidently don't quite {{understand}} my character, or my notions of good form.|$|E
6000|$|... "If it's {{just the}} <b>same</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> old chap," [...] said Rob, coolly, [...] "I won't be eaten to-day. You {{can make a}} pie of that fellow on the ground." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If the Greek king," [...] {{said the}} fisherman, [...] "had spared the physician, {{he would not}} have thus died. The <b>same</b> thing applies <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Now I am going <b>to</b> throw <b>you</b> into the sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{knowledge}} {{can never be}} of the <b>same</b> profit <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> sold <b>to</b> any other person, as sold to me.
