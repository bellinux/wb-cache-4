A systematic study of the available data (cross <b>sections,</b> <b>barrier</b> and spin distributions) in rare-earth nuclei is presented. 1 Introduction It is by now well established that to describe fusion cross sections one needs to include coupling of relative motion to other degrees of freedom [1, 2]. These extra degrees of freedom yield a distribution of barriers [3] and consequently enhance the cross <b>section</b> below the <b>barrier</b> [4, 5]. Enhancement of fusion cross sections due to coupling of levels in colliding nuclei to the relative motion, has opened a new avenue for testing nuclear structure models. The rec [...] ...|$|R

OpenMP is an API that supports multi platform shared memory programming model and shared-memory programs are typically executed by multiple threads. The use of multi threading can enhance the performance of application but its excessive use can degrade the performance. This paper describes a novel approach to avoid bottlenecks in application and provide some techniques to improve performance in OpenMP application. This paper analyzes bottleneck performance as bottleneck inhibits performance. Performance of multi threaded applications is limited {{by a variety of}} bottlenecks, e. g. critical <b>sections,</b> <b>barriers</b> and so on.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of diploma thesis is {{to evaluate the}} impact of the geological structure on the hydrogeological conditions in the northeastern part of Stráž block. The study area in northern Bohemia is characterised by Cenomanian and Turonian sandstone aquifers, which are horizontally divided by Lower Turonian aquitard. The thesis focuses groundwater level analysis and study hydrogeological impacts of faults, neovolcanic veins and disturbances of rock environment caused by uranium mining. First part of the study presents description of general geological and hydrogeological conditions in the area with summary of previous investigations and reports. Various hydraulic interventions during mining, which have great impact on the groundwater level situation are described. Based on the data from collected boreholes, contour maps of groundwater level are prepared to study its shape and temporal changes. Hydraulic communication through aquitard and through Stráž fault zone have been examined by correlations of groundwater levels. The results of the study confirm sealing effect of Stráž fault zone in the examined <b>section.</b> <b>Barrier</b> effect of the neovolcanic veins has been confirmed on several locations and examples of increased hydraulic conductivity as the result of fault disturbances have been located [...] . ...|$|R
