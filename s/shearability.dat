50|$|The {{design of}} press tools is an {{engineering}} compromise. A sharp edge, strength, and durability are ideal, but a sharp edge {{is not very}} strong or durable, so blades for metal work tend to be square-edged rather than knife-edged. Typical workpiece materials include aluminum, brass, bronze, and mild steel because of their outstanding <b>shearability</b> ratings. Stainless steel is not sheared as often due to its tendencies to work-harden.|$|E

Because the role of thickness enters into our theory in an essential way, it is an exact version of what has been called the theory of ‘‘moderately thick’ ’ rods.) In particular, we study how the theory and constitutive restrictions depend upon the choice of the base curve, and we show how this choice has major qualitative consequences, which are illustrated with several concrete examples.

40|$|The {{equilibrium}} equations for the isotropic Kirchhoff rod {{are known}} to form an integrable system. It is also known {{that the effects of}} extensibility and <b>shearability</b> of the rod do not break the integrable structure. Nor, as we have shown in a previous paper does the effect of a magnetic field on a conducting rod. Here we show, by means of Mel'nikov analysis, that, remarkably, the combined effects do destroy integrability; that is, the governing equations for an extensible current-carrying rod in a uniform magnetic field are nonintegrable. This result has implications for possible configurations of electrodynamic space tethers and may be relevant for electromechanical devices...|$|E

40|$|The {{equilibrium}} equations for an isotropic Kirchhoff rod {{are known}} to be completely integrable. It is also known that neither the effects of extensibility and <b>shearability</b> nor the effects of a uniform magnetic field individually break integrability. Here we show, by means of a Melnikov-type analysis, that, when combined, these effects do break integrability giving rise to spatially chaotic configurations of the rod. A previous analysis of the problem suffered from the presence of an Euler-angle singularity. Our analysis provides an example of how in a system with such a singularity a Melnikov-type technique can be applied by introducing an artificial unfolding parameter. This technique can be applied to more general problems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is {{very common}} to use {{pre-stressed}} beam models in the structure design. However in the nonlinear domain, the modal analysis remains difficult especially when <b>shearability</b> is taken into account. This work aims to study the natural vibrations of pre-stretched nonlinear shearable Timoshenko beam using Cosserat continuum mechanics. In this paper, a three dimensional nonlinear beam model is first developed. Then we analyse waves which are superimposed on a finite pre-stretch state. Namely, analytical dispersion relations are given for different values of pre-strech. The complete spectrum, including propagating and evanescent traction-slash compression, shear and bending modes, of a pre- stretched shearable beam is calculated through dispersion pattern. Spectrum strongly depends on initial pre-stress value. A significant qualitative and quantitative difference with the classical Timoshenko beam theory is pointed out even for small pre-stretch values...|$|E
