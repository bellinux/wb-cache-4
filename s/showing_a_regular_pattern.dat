40|$|Tropical dry {{forests are}} highly {{endangered}} ecosystems {{that have been}} scarcely studied. Many species within these forests suffer regeneration problems due to unsustainable management regimes. In particular, a regeneration problem has been detected in a forest of tara (Caesalpinia spinosa), a neotropical tree of high ecological and economic value, in Atiquipa (Peru). The study of the spatial patterns and population structure of forests can help us understand their dynamics and evaluate the effects of management. In this article, we analyse the stand demographic structure, spatial distribution and patterns of plant interactions in tara forests. We evaluate whether the regeneration problem in Atiquipa is strictly local or a problem of general concern and investigate the most probable causes. Four tara stands were selected at different localities in Peru. Two stands (Andurco and Polán) had a reverse J-shaped diametric structure, typical of stable self-replacing forests, although Polán had a low number of young trees, indicating an incipient regeneration problem. The Lloque histogram was skewed (with a maximum in seedlings 61 cm), indicating over-exploitation {{in the past and}} present forest regeneration. Maguey had a low number of regenerates, with peaks in some intermediate diametric classes, which may indicate natural regeneration problems or some past management. Spatial distribution of tara trees did not depart from the null model (�random distribution), typical of trees dispersed by zoochory. Maguey was an exception, <b>showing</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>pattern</b> at short distances, possibly associated with past management (like selective cuttings and/or plantations). These results suggest that in most of the analysed stands the current forest management (i. e. excessive seed collection or grazing) limits tara forest regeneration. However, the only stand with a protected status presented a clear tendency toward population increase. Bivariate analyses revealed an aggregated pattern between seedlings and adult trees. Moreover, the plant-plant interaction study showed that seedlings were associated with woody vegetation. These positive associations highlight a facilitative effect that ameliorates stressful microclimatic characteristics and/or protects tara seedlings from herbivory. The results of this study support some recommendations for sustainable management, such as controlled stocking rate, limited seed collection and promotion of bush cover...|$|E

40|$|Equal-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) is {{a method}} used to {{introduce}} severe plastic deformation into a metallic billet without changing its geometry. In special cases, strain localization occurs and a pattern consisting of regions with high and low deformation (so-called shear and matrix bands) can emerge. This paper studies this phenomenon numerically adopting two-dimensional finite element simulations of one ECAP pass. The mechanical behavior of aluminum is modeled using phenomenological plasticity theory with isotropic or kinematic hardening. The effects of the two different strain hardening types are investigated numerically by systematic parameter studies: while isotropic hardening only causes minor fluctuations in the plastic strain fields, a material with high initial hardening rate and sufficient strain hardening capacity can exhibit pronounced localized deformation after ECAP. The corresponding finite element simulation results <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>pattern</b> of shear and matrix bands.

40|$|Data on the {{daylight}} behaviour of humpback dolphins Sousa chinensis were collected during sea- and land-based surveys undertaken in Algoa Bay, Eastern Cape, South Africa, throughout a three year period. Dolphin activities/behaviour were categorised as: 'feeding', 'travelling', 'opportunistic feeding', 'socialising and playing', 'resting' and 'other'. It seems apparent that behaviour determines the spatial {{geometry of the}} dolphin group, but not the group size. The surfacing-breathing interval is similar for 'feeding', 'opportunistic feeding', and slow 'travelling', but differs considerably from the pattern displayed during fast 'travelling'. Daylight behaviour of humpback dolphins is dominated by 'feeding' and <b>shows</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>pattern</b> which is probably governed by the diurnal cycles of their prey. Generally, 'feeding' peaks {{in the morning and}} gradually decreases {{through the rest of the}} day.

The only significant seasonal difference is in the frequency of 'social/sexual' behaviour which peaks in summer.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an overview of the issues in the phonological voicing rule ‘rendaku’, which affects compounds, and its relation to phonological phrasing and syntax in Japanese. Previous analyses have focused on the direction of branching, the category of compounds, and accentedness in the hope of shedding light on a complex aspect of Japanese phonology. Since rendaku is assumed to apply only at word boundaries, it {{has been used as a}} test of word-hood by Poser (1984; 1990) in his analysis of a special class of prefixes that appear to allow a minor phrase boundary between them and the root to which they attach. This is unusual because the prefixes and stems appear to resist internal modification, which does imply that these are syntactic words that have phonological boundaries where there is no syntactic boundary. This indirect model of syntax to phonology mapping is investigated to see whether there really is such a syntax-phonology mismatch in such examples. Contrary to Poser’s analysis, what is shown here is that these prefixes can trigger rendaku in some cases, which suggests an alternative syntactic analysis. Furthermore, evidence from accentedness and scope relations <b>shows</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>pattern</b> that explains the presence of a phrasal accent contour, and a lexicalist approach is used to account for the structure of prefixed examples.

40|$|The Kovdor {{phlogopite}} deposit, one of {{the largest}} on Earth, occurs in the northwestern part of the Kovdor carbonatite-bearing alkaline-ultrabasic complex, Kola Peninsula, Russia. The Main phlogopite lode is situated in the central part of a semicircular zone of phlogopite-rich rocks; its morphology is similar to some bodies of granitic pegmatites, hosted in granites, and has a zonal structure. The rocks of the marginal part are monomineralic and consist of giant crystals (up to 2 m across) of diopside, whereas near the center are zones of forsterite–phlogopite, forsterite and apatite rocks. A microtextural study of the phlogopite-bearing bodies <b>shows</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>pattern</b> of spatial arrangement of the main minerals. All grew from the contacts of individual vein-like bodies toward the center. The chemical composition of the main rock-forming minerals (forsterite, phlogopite, diopside) is char-acterized by lower contents of Ti and Fe compared to the compositions of those minerals in olivinites, but are relatively enriched compared to the same minerals in phoscorites and carbonatites. Gas extracted from phlogopite and apatite shows that hydrogen is an important component in the inclusions. Thermometric data suggest that the formation of the main minerals in the deposit took place at a high temperature, in the range 800 – 900 °C, whereas hydrostatic pressure in the system barely exceeded 2000 bars. On the basis of its shape, structure, features of mineral growth and crystallization sequence, the Main phlogopite lode may be regarded as a peculiar alkali-ultrabasic pegmatite...|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} in “Fault parameters and method” section, the rupture delay time for each subfault {{can be determined}} from the time at which the accumulated slip exceeds a threshold, which {{is regarded as the}} time required to pass the rupture front. Lee et al. (2006) used a threshold of 0.1  m for the 1999 Chichi, Taiwan, earthquake (Mw 7.6). A higher accumulated slip of 0.5  m was employed as the threshold in this study by considering the poorer temporal resolution of the triangular basis functions with duration of 10  s and relatively large inversion uncertainty for this mega-thrust event. The rupture velocity was estimated as the ratio of the shortest distance between the hypocenter and each subfault to the rupture delay time at the corresponding subfault. Figure  5 b <b>shows</b> <b>a</b> heterogeneous rupture velocity distribution ranging from a minimum of 1.3  km/s to a maximum of 3.5  km/s on the fault plane. The rupture velocity within the vicinity of the hypocenter <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>pattern,</b> gradually increasing from 1.0 to 2.0  km/s with increasing distance from the hypocenter. The rupture at the shallowest part of the fault significantly accelerated with a velocity larger than 3.0  km/s, which is consistent with that obtained by Lee et al. (2011). The rupture velocity of {{the southern part of the}} fault 120  km from the hypocenter was significantly lower than that in other regions, ranging from 1.0 to 2.0  km/s. This indicates that the rupture front first arrived at the shallow part of the fault where large slip occurred and then spread to the surrounding area.|$|R
40|$|Haemophilus influenzae is {{considered}} a nonmotile organism that expresses neither flagella nor type IV pili, although H. influenzae strain Rd possesses a cryptic pilus locus. We demonstrate here that the homologous gene cluster pilABCD in an otitis media isolate of nontypeable H. influenzae strain 86 - 028 NP encodes a surface appendage that is highly similar, structurally and functionally, to the well-characterized subgroup of bacterial pili known as type IV pili. This gene cluster includes a gene (pilA) that likely encodes the major subunit of the heretofore uncharacterized H. influenzae-expressed type IV pilus, a gene with homology to a type IV prepilin peptidase (pilD) {{as well as two}} additional uncharacterized genes (pilB and pilC). A second gene cluster (comABCDEF) was also identified by homology to other pil or type II secretion system genes. When grown in chemically defined medium at an alkaline pH, strain 86 - 028 NP produces approximately 7 -nm-diameter structures that are near polar in location. Importantly, these organisms exhibit twitching motility. A mutation in the pilA gene abolishes both expression of the pilus structure and the twitching phenotype, whereas a mutant lacking ComE, a Pseudomonas PilQ homologue, produced large appendages that appeared to be membrane bound and terminated in a slightly bulbous tip. These latter structures often <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>pattern</b> of areas of constriction and expansion. The recognition that H. influenzae possesses a mechanism for twitching motility will likely profoundly influence our understanding of H. influenzae-induced diseases of the respiratory tract and their sequelae...|$|R
