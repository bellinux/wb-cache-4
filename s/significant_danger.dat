5|$|Hurricanes are an ever-present threat {{during the}} summer and fall season, which puts Galveston in Coastal Windstorm Area. Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula are {{generally}} at the greatest risk among the communities near the Galveston Bay. However, though the island and peninsula provide some shielding, the bay shoreline still faces <b>significant</b> <b>danger</b> from storm surge.|$|E
5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in <b>significant</b> <b>danger.</b> Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in <b>significant</b> <b>danger</b> to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E

25|$|Uranium mining is {{the process}} of {{extraction}} of uranium ore from the ground. The worldwide production of uranium in 2009 amounted to 50,572 tonnes. Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia are the top three producers and together account for 63% of world uranium production. A prominent use of uranium from mining is as fuel for nuclear power plants. The mining and milling of uranium present <b>significant</b> <b>dangers</b> to the environment.|$|R
5|$|The {{water that}} {{flows through the}} Roman Baths is {{considered}} unsafe for bathing, partly due to its having passed through the still-functioning original lead pipes, and up until World War II, it was advertised {{on the basis of}} the radioactivity it contained. However, the more <b>significant</b> <b>danger</b> is now considered to be infectious diseases. In October 1978, a young girl swimming with the Bath Dolphins, a local swimming club, in the restored Roman Bath contracted meningitis and died, leading to the closure of the bath for several years. Tests showed that Naegleria fowleri, an extremely dangerous disease-causing amoeba, was in the water. The newly constructed Thermae Bath Spa nearby, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, and the refurbished Cross Bath allow modern-day bathers to experience the waters via a series of more recently drilled boreholes.|$|E
25|$|The {{buffer zone}} is {{currently}} inhabited and is policed by Syrian authorities. There are several {{towns and villages}} within and bordering the zone, including the ruins of Quneitra. Land mines continue to pose a <b>significant</b> <b>danger</b> to the UNDOF and the civilian population. The fact that the explosives have begun to deteriorate worsens the threat.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the MTA {{announced}} a three-year, $257.5 million renovation {{project of the}} elevated Culver Viaduct, and that for twenty-seven months, this station would be fully or partially closed for a $32 million renovation. The renovation was necessitated because the viaduct was falling apart, with leaks and broken concrete riddling the viaduct. The station and the portions of the viaduct near the station had to be encased in a mesh wrapping {{because there was a}} <b>significant</b> <b>danger</b> of concrete falling from the viaduct.|$|E

Such information improves {{our understanding of the}} fundamental processes that are involved in generating solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These super-energetic solar eruptive events are the most extreme drivers of space weather and present <b>significant</b> <b>dangers</b> in space and on Earth.|$|R
50|$|The drug {{combination}} hydrocodone/ibuprofen (INNs, trade name Vicoprofen) is an analgesic medication used in short-term therapy to relieve severe pain. Hydrocodone {{is used in}} form of the bitartrate. This combination avoids some of the liver toxicity which may occur with hydrocodone/paracetamol combinations such as Vicodin, but still presents <b>significant</b> <b>dangers</b> in hydrocodone overdose, namely respiratory depression. Vicoprofen is supplied in a fixed dose combination tablet which contains Hydrocodone Bitartrate, USP 7.5 mg with Ibuprofen, USP 200 mg.|$|R
500|$|Scorpion stings {{are thought}} to be a <b>significant</b> <b>danger</b> in less-developed countries, for example they cause about 1,000 deaths per year in Mexico but only one every few years in the USA. Most of these {{incidents}} are caused by accidental human [...] "invasions" [...] of scorpion's nests. However, medical uses of scorpion venom are being investigated for treatment of brain cancers and bone diseases.|$|E
500|$|Washington {{had given}} {{charge of the}} {{crossing}} logistics to his chief of artillery, the portly Henry Knox. [...] In addition to the crossing {{of large numbers of}} troops (most of whom could not swim), he had to safely transport horses and eighteen pieces of artillery over the river. [...] Knox wrote that the crossing was accomplished [...] "with almost infinite difficulty", and that its most <b>significant</b> <b>danger</b> was [...] "floating ice in the river". [...] One observer noted that the whole operation might well have failed [...] "but for the stentorian lungs of Colonel Knox". Ice had formed in the river due to the Little Ice Age.|$|E
500|$|For centuries, the Doom Bar was {{regarded}} as a <b>significant</b> <b>danger</b> to ships—to be approached with caution to avoid running aground. When sails were the main source of power, ships coming round Stepper Point would lose the wind, causing loss of steerage, leaving them to drift away from the channel. Sometimes, gusts of wind known colloquially as [...] "flaws" [...] blew over Stepper Point and pushed vessels towards the sandbank. Dropping anchor would not help, as it could not gain a firm hold on the sand. Richard Hellyer, the Sub-Commissioner of Pilotage at Padstow, gave evidence in 1859 that the Doom Bar {{was regarded}} as so dangerous that in a storm, vessels would risk being wrecked on the coast rather than negotiate the channel to Padstow harbour.|$|E
5000|$|Plastic {{shopping}} bags which escape the garbage collection process {{can end up}} in streams, which then lead them {{to end up in}} the open ocean. An estimated 300 million plastic bags end up in the ocean due to escaping the garbage. The way in which the bags float in open water can resemble a jellyfish, posing <b>significant</b> <b>dangers</b> to marine mammals and Leatherback sea turtles, when they are eaten by mistake and enter the animals' digestive tracts.|$|R

500|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, signals passed at danger (SPADs) were {{increasingly}} {{perceived as a}} <b>significant</b> <b>danger</b> to the public. Only the Great Western Railway truly accepted the challenge posed. Prior even to 1910, it commenced installing Automatic Train Control (ATC), a system where each distant signal {{was accompanied by a}} ramp between the tracks with which a shoe on the locomotive would make contact as it passed over it. When the signal denoted [...] "clear", an electric current would pass through the ramp which was detected by the shoe, thereby sounding a bell in the cab. With the signal at danger, the electric current would be cut off and when the shoe detected this it would activate a warning horn. In later forms, the brakes would be applied should the driver fail to acknowledge the warning.|$|E
500|$|When {{precipitable water}} values near , brief but often torrential {{thunderstorms}} and the hurricane force winds and hail can occur, especially over mountainous terrain. [...] This activity is occasionally {{enhanced by the}} passage of retrograding (westward-moving) upper cyclones moving under the subtropical ridge and the entrainment of the remnants of tropical storms. [...] Tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific contribute to the moisture within the monsoon system, and bring up to 20percent of the average annual rainfall to southern California. [...] Flash flooding is a serious danger during the monsoon season. Dry washes can become raging rivers in an instant, even when no storms are visible as a storm can cause a flash flood tens of miles away. [...] Lightning strikes are also a <b>significant</b> <b>danger.</b> Because it is dangerous {{to be caught in}} the open when these storms suddenly appear, many golf courses in Arizona have thunderstorm warning systems.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} April 1835, {{military}} commanders in Texas began requesting reinforcements, fearing the citizens would revolt. [...] Mexico was ill-prepared {{for a large}} civil war, but continued unrest in Texas posed a <b>significant</b> <b>danger</b> {{to the power of}} Santa Anna and of Mexico. [...] If the people of Coahuila also took up arms, [...] Mexico faced losing a large portion of its territory. [...] Without the northeastern province to act as a buffer, it was likely that United States influence would spread, and the Mexican territories of Nuevo Mexico and Alta California would be at risk of future American encroachment. [...] Santa Anna had no wish to tangle with the United States, and he knew that the unrest needed to be subdued before the United States could be convinced to become involved. In early September, Santa Anna ordered his brother-in-law, General Martín Perfecto de Cos, to lead 500 soldiers to Texas to quell any potential rebellion. Cos and his men landed at the port of Copano on September 20. [...] Austin called on all municipalities to raise militias to defend themselves.|$|E
50|$|Fire play {{is usually}} {{considered}} {{a form of}} edge play - frequently exciting, but with <b>significant</b> <b>dangers.</b> Unlike other forms of edge play (extreme rough body play, blood play, interrogations, abductions, etc.), fire play scenes tend to look kinder and gentler; although it can be dramatic, the sensations inflicted in most fire play scenes aren't actually painful (much like hot wax play or sensation play). Fire play also rarely leaves marks on the skin - though some people deliberately burn the skin slightly to leave it red and irritated.|$|R

500|$|The French Republic, {{established}} in 1792 {{at the height}} of the French Revolution, was by 1797 governed by a bicameral legislative assembly, with a five-member Directory acting as the national executive. [...] The Directory was undergoing both internal power struggles and struggles with the Council of Five Hundred, the lower chamber of the legislature. [...] Ministerial changes took place in the first half of 1797, including the selection in July of Charles Maurice de Talleyrand as foreign minister. [...] Talleyrand, who had recently spent a few years in the United States, was openly concerned about the establishment of closer ties between the U. S. and Britain. [...] The Directory, generally not well-disposed to American interests, became notably more hostile to them in September 1797, when an internal coup propelled several anti-Americans into power. [...] These leaders, and Talleyrand, viewed President Adams as hostile to their interests, but did not think that there was <b>significant</b> <b>danger</b> of war. [...] In part based on advice imparted to French diplomats by Thomas Jefferson, Talleyrand decided to adopt a measured, slow pace to the negotiations.|$|E
