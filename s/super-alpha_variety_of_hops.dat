5000|$|Although hop {{cultivation}} in {{the area}} of Nowy Tomyśl had started {{at the end of the}} 17th century and continued through the 18th century, hop production {{in the area}} did not enjoy a high level of success. In the late 1830s, German economist Joseph Jacob Flatau (Józef Jakub Flatau) developed a new <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> in the area that was a hybrid of Bavarian and Bohemian-Czech <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>hops.</b> [...] This new <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> was very successful and demand was high; by the 1880s, annual production <b>of</b> the nowotomyski <b>hop</b> was as much as 50,000 to 60,000 cwt, and it was being exported to Bohemia, Szczecin, Gdańsk, Scandinavia, France, England, and Switzerland. [...] The production of this type <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> had a profound economic impact on what had once been one of the poorest areas in the region. Hop production declined starting in the 1890s and continued until the conclusion of World War I. Production fluctuated between the wars, and during the occupation of Poland by Germany in World War II, 98% <b>of</b> the <b>hops</b> production area in the region was destroyed.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{quantities}} of alpha and beta acids range among <b>hops,</b> the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> {{should be considered}} when targeting a specific amount of bitterness in the beer. To maximize bitterness, hops with large alpha acid concentrations should be used. Such varieties include Chinook, Galena, Horizon, Tomahawk, and Warrior hops, and these contain alpha acid concentrations up to 16% by mass. Since the bitterness is not influenced by beta acids, beta acids are not considered when selecting the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>hop.</b> Also, {{the amount of time}} that the hops are boiled impacts the bitterness of the beer. Since heat is needed to isomerize alpha acids, applying heat for longer amounts of time increases the conversion to the isomerized form.|$|R

5000|$|The {{alpha acid}} [...] "rating" [...] on hops {{indicates}} {{the amount of}} alpha acid {{as a percentage of}} total weight <b>of</b> the <b>hop.</b> Hops with a higher alpha acid content will contribute more bitterness than a lower alpha acid hop when using the same amount <b>of</b> <b>hops.</b> High alpha acid <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> are more efficient for producing highly bitter beers.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> used in brewing today. Historically, hops varieties were identified by geography (such as Hallertau, Spalt, and Tettnang from Germany), by the farmer who is recognized as first cultivating them (such as Goldings or Fuggles from England), or by their growing habit (e. g., Oregon Cluster).|$|R
40|$|Market <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> are {{classified}} to several groups {{according to their}} use in the brewing industry – aroma, bitter (dual-purpose), high-alpha ones. Saaz and other genetically related varieties form a separate group among the aromatic hops. The group called fine aroma hops has a low content of α-bitter acids (3 – 4 % w/w), its content of β-bitter acids is {{in the range of}} 4 – 7 % w/w and cohumulone ratio in the interval of 23 – 26 % rel. The composition <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> oils is characterised by the content of β-farnesene in the range of 15 – 20 % rel. and trans-α-bergamotene at the amount of ca. 1 % rel. Most market <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> are <b>of</b> hybrid origin. It holds true about the Czech varieties Sládek, Bor, Premiant and Agnus.

5000|$|Coigneau is a Belgian <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> {{which was}} massively {{cultivated}} in the Flemish Aalst-Asse area near Brussels {{in the nineteenth}} and {{first half of the}} twentieth century.
