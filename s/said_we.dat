5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they <b>said</b> <b>we</b> were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E
5|$|What Arafat {{says about}} me doesn't bother me. Not only he, {{but also a}} whole list of Arab and world {{politicians}} claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they <b>said</b> <b>we</b> were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E
25|$|They <b>said,</b> <b>we</b> {{corrupted}} each other, {{and that}} they thought when we were parted, we would have bowed to them. But they found we were more stronger afterwards than we were before; the Lord our God did fit us for every condition.|$|E

25|$|Mukherjee was sworn-in by the Chief Justice of India on 25 July 2012, {{becoming}} the first Bengali to hold the post of President of India. After being administered the oath of office, he <b>said</b> <b>we</b> are amidist of fourth world war of terror and what minutes of peace can achieve cannot be achieved in many years of war.|$|E
25|$|Internode criticised the 'insane' {{number of}} POIs and after its pricing {{announcement}} warned {{it might have}} to charge more in regional areas because of the increase costs. In response, Shadow Minister for Communications, Malcolm Turnbull said the 'government can't deliver on a crucial promise' of 'national uniform pricing'; however, Minister for Communications, Stephen Conroy <b>said</b> <b>we</b> 'guaranteed uniform wholesale pricing' not retail pricing.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Senators Brown and U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan {{introduced}} legislation to ensure veterans, students {{serving in the}} armed forces, and their qualifying dependents can attain priority enrollment at four-year colleges or universities {{so that they can}} finish their degrees before their federal GI benefits expire. Brown <b>said</b> <b>we</b> must invest in and train our men and women when they return to their communities.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah; {{but tell}} me the truth. Remember what <b>we</b> <b>said</b> as <b>we</b> parted,--about being friends. One tells one's friend the real truth. But I suppose you do not {{remember}} what we said?" ...|$|R

25|$|The {{team was}} the subject of a famous quote from Liverpool FC manager Bill Shankly, who, while telling a joke at the expense of local rivals Everton, declared, In my time at Anfield we always <b>said</b> <b>we</b> had the two best teams on Merseyside, Liverpool and Liverpool Reserves. Another version of the quote has Shankly saying, There's only two teams in Liverpool: Liverpool and Liverpool Reserves.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{think there}} is any {{evidence}} that there have been any renditions carried out in the country of Syria. There is no evidence of that. And I think we have to take what the secretary Condoleezza Rice says at face value. It is something very important, it is done very carefully and she has <b>said</b> <b>we</b> do not authorise, condone torture in any way, shape or form.|$|E
25|$|However, later Pakistani {{officials}} {{have claimed that}} the strike was actually conducted by the U.S. {{and that they have}} also requested the U.S. not to violate their sovereignty again. “We thought it would be less damaging if we <b>said</b> <b>we</b> did it rather than the US,” said a key aide to President Pervez Musharraf. Local people claimed the victims included boys as young as 12 but Pakistani officials insisted they had been shown satellite images of people training and had checked the identity cards of all those killed, and that all were adults.|$|E
5000|$|A {{couple of}} months ago, those fascist motherfuckers at the Fox News Network {{attempted}} to pin this band into a corner by suggesting that <b>we</b> <b>said</b> {{that the president should}} be assassinated. Nah, what <b>we</b> <b>said</b> was that he should be brought to trial as a war criminal and hung and shot. THAT'S what <b>we</b> <b>said.</b> And <b>we</b> don't back away from the position because the real assassinator sic is Bush, and Cheney and the whole administration for the lives they have destroyed here and in Iraq. They're the ones. And what they refused to air which was far more provocative in my mind and in the minds of my bandmates is this: that this system has become so brutal and vicious and cruel that it needs to start wars and profit from the destruction around the world in order to survive as a world power. THAT's what <b>we</b> <b>said.</b> And <b>we</b> refuse not to stand up, we refuse to back down from that position...|$|R

The cover was also right. I think it's become like a benevolent noose hanging behind us. Throughout our entire career, people have <b>said</b> <b>we</b> would never top the Dark Side record and tour. But The Wall earned more in dollar terms." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoglan {{worked as}} a roadie for the band after their {{lighting}} guy {{did not show up}} one night, and performed Lombardo's soundchecks. Slayer and Hoglan would play Dark Angel songs during soundchecks, which is how Hoglan eventually joined Dark Angel. Hoglan approached Dark Angel guitarist Jim Durkin: [...] "He came up to me one day and started giving me his criticisms of the band. He <b>said</b> <b>we</b> needed to be more evil. And then he goes, 'By the way, I'm a better drummer than the guy you have in Dark Angel right now.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Before {{all this}} came about {{we had our}} own method of dealing with law-breakers and in {{settling}} disputes between members. That all changed when Crow Dog killed Spotted Tail. Of course, our method of dealing with that was Crow Dog should go take care of Spotted Tail's family, and if he didn't do that we'd banish him from the tribe. But that was considered too barbaric, and thought perhaps we should hang him like civilized people do, so they passed the Major Crimes Act that <b>said</b> <b>we</b> don't {{know how to handle}} murderers {{and they were going to}} show us." ...|$|E

500|$|Basically we {{were having}} a laugh at a lot of the {{different}} articles that were appearing at that time in different magazines and papers, and they were talking about 'Pop Kylie, Dance Kylie, Sex Kylie' and, you know, with every different release of a single they'd say 'What Kylie is it now?' and it was just becoming a joke. So he, Pedro, cunningly picked up on that and <b>said</b> <b>we</b> should make a video with all the different Kylies, which I was more then [...] happy about, because it was stating the obvious and having a laugh at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Josh Weinstein has {{expressed}} regret about killing off Grimes after only one episode, describing him as [...] "such an amazing character." [...] In {{an interview with}} The Believer, producer George Meyer said, [...] "Grimes's cardinal sin was that he shined a light on Springfield. He pointed out everything that was wrongheaded and idiotic about that world. And {{the people who do}} that tend to become martyrs. He said things that needed to be said, but once they were <b>said,</b> <b>we</b> needed to destroy that person. I'll admit, we took a certain sadistic glee in his downfall. He was such a righteous person, and that somehow made his demise more satisfying." ...|$|E
500|$|Joshua Shaw {{designed}} costumes for {{characters in}} the season. Petrie stated that more layers {{were added to the}} series' atmosphere to keep the season dark but provide more clarity to the viewer, an issue that occurred in the first season. Petrie also talked about the costumes for characters such as Elektra, noting that they had to not only look at the comics and [...] "what looks cool", but also [...] "what would you really fight in? What would protect you?...will people be wearing kick ass costumes in this show? At some point, everybody does. We promise. But, that <b>said,</b> <b>we</b> want to make them feel as organic and grounded as possible.|$|E

[...] "It will crown my life" [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>We</b> will always remember the bright gleam in his eyes as they peered beyond the anxiety of today, looked afar to the future glory of his beloved Sydney where in his dreams he saw his mighty bridge spanning what he called [...] "God's noblest waterway".|$|E
500|$|The result at Cannes was a surprise; {{after the}} longest judging {{period in the}} festival's history, the Grand Prix went to neither of the two event favourites. Instead, the jury awarded the prize to [...] "Lamp", a U.S. {{advertisement}} directed by Spike Jonze for the IKEA chain of furniture stores. Voted second was a British ad, [...] "Ear Tennis" [...] for the Xbox video game console. Chief among speculated reasons for the outcome was the plagiarism debate surrounding [...] "Cog". Ben Walker told Adweek [...] "A couple {{of people on the}} jury told me the reason it didn't win is 'cause they didn't want to be seen to be awarding something which people in some corners had <b>said</b> <b>we</b> copied." ...|$|E
500|$|Angus Young later recalled, [...] "I {{remember}} the first time I had ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we <b>said</b> <b>we</b> should see if we can find him." ...|$|E
