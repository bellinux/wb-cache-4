A closed loop circuit was designed using an RMS/DC converter chip, with complete electrical isolation between the low voltage control circuits and the power circuits. The major advantages of this technique are: fast response to RMS voltage fluctuation; waveform fidelity; light weight; and reduced size compared to that of a servo-driven AC voltage regulator such as the PS 10 Smart Power Station, which was used in this project as a benchmark for the AC voltage regulator using the power semiconductor array.

40|$|Modern digital {{circuits}} consist of logic gates {{implemented in the}} {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) technology. The time taken for a logic gate output to change after one or more inputs have changed is called the delay of the gate.

We propose a new gate design that has different delays along various input to output paths within the gate.

40|$|A single-chip CMOS-based (complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductorbased) transmit/receive (T/R) module {{is being}} {{developed}} for L-band radar systems. Previous T/R module implementations required multiple chips employing different technologies (GaAs, Si, and others) combined with off-chip transmission lines and discrete components including circulators. The new design eliminates the bulky circulator, significantly reducing the size and mass of the T/R module. Compared to multi-chip designs, the single-chip CMOS can be implemented with lower cost. These innovations enable cost-effective realization of advanced phased array and synthetic aperture radar systems that require integration of thousands of T/R modules. The circulator is a ferromagnetic device that directs {{the flow of the}} RF (radio frequency) power during transmission and reception. During transmission, the circulator delivers the transmitted power from the amplifier to the antenna, while preventing it from damaging the sensitive receiver circuitry. During reception, the circulator directs the energy from the antenna to the low-noise amplifier (LNA) while isolating the output of the power amplifier (PA). In principle, a circulator could be replaced by <b>series</b> <b>transistors</b> acting as electronic switches. However, in practice, the integration of conventional <b>series</b> <b>transistors</b> into a T/R chip introduces significant losses and noise. The prototype single-chip T/R module contains integrated transistor switches, but not connected in series; instead, they are connected in a shunt configuration with resonant circuits (see figure). The shunt/resonant circuit topology not only reduces the losses associated with conventional semiconductor switches but also provides beneficial transformation of impedances for the PA and the LNA. It provides full singlepole/ double-throw switching for the antenna, isolating the LNA from the transmitted signal and isolating the PA from the received signal. During reception, the voltage on control line RX/TX (raised bar) is high, causing the field-effect transistor (FET) switch S 1 to be closed, forming a parallel resonant tank circuit L 1 ||C 1. This circuit presents high impedance {{to the left of the}} antenna, so that the received signal is coupled to the LNA. At the same time, FET switches S 2 and S 3 are open, so that C 2 is removed from the circuit (except for a small parasitic capacitance). The combination of L 2 and C 3 forms a matching network that transforms the antenna impedance of 50 ohms to a higher value from the perspective of the LNA input terminal. This transformation of impedance improves LNA noise figure by increasing the received voltage delivered to the input transistor. This allows lower transconductance and therefore a smaller transistor, which makes it possible to design the CMOS LNA for low power consumption. During transmission, the voltage on control line RX/TX (raised bar) is low, causing switch S 1 to be open. In this configuration, the combination of L 1 and C 1 transforms the antenna impedance to a lower value from the perspective of the PA. This low impedance is helpful in producing a relatively high output power compatible with the low CMOS operating potential. At the same time, switches S 2 and S 3 are closed, forming the parallel resonant tank circuit L 2 ||C 2. This circuit presents high impedance to the right of the antenna, directing the PA output signal to the antenna and away from the LNA. During this time, S 3 presents a short circuit across the LNA input terminals to guarantee that the voltage seen by the LNA is small enough to prevent damage...|$|R
