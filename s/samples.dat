40|$|Abstract—This paper {{develops}} the fundamental capacity limits of a <b>sampled</b> analog channel under a sub-Nyquist <b>sampling</b> rate constraint. In particular, we derive {{the capacity of}} <b>sampled</b> analog channels over a general class of time-preserving <b>sampling</b> methods including irregular nonuniform <b>sampling.</b> Our {{results indicate that the}} optimal <b>sampling</b> structures extract out the set of frequencies that exhibits the highest SNR among all spectral sets of support size equal to the <b>sampling</b> rate. The capacity under sub-Nyquist <b>sampling</b> can be attained through filter-bank <b>sampling,</b> or through a single branch of modulation and filtering followed by uniform <b>sampling.</b> The capacity under sub-Nyquist <b>sampling</b> is a monotone function of the <b>sampling</b> rate. These results indicate that the optimal <b>sampling</b> schemes suppress aliasing, and that employing irregular nonuniform <b>sampling</b> does not provide capacity gain over uniform <b>sampling</b> sets with appropriate preprocessing for a large class of channels.
