5000|$|The American Society of Animal Science {{published}} an article in 2014 after reviewing health issues arising from the rBST debate. The article indicated “there are no new human health {{issues related to the}} use of rbST by the dairy industry. Use of rbST has no effect on the micro- and macrocomposition of milk. Also, no evidence exists that rbST use has increased human exposure to antibiotic residues in milk. Concerns that IGF-I present in milk could have biological effects on humans have been allayed by studies showing that oral consumption of IGF-I by humans has little or no biological activity. Additionally, concentrations of IGF-I in digestive tract fluids of humans far exceed any IGF-I consumed when drinking milk. Furthermore, chronic supplementation of cows with rbST does not increase concentrations of milk IGF-I outside the range typically observed for effects of farm, parity, or <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>lactation.</b> Use of rbST has not affected expression of retroviruses in cattle or posed an increased risk to human health from retroviruses in cattle. Furthermore, risk for development of type 1 or type 2 diabetes has not increased in children or adults consuming milk and dairy products from rbST-supplemented cows. Overall, milk and dairy products provide essential nutrients and related benefits in health maintenance and the prevention of chronic diseases.” This information has since been proved false by a study in 2015 by CNN ...|$|E

Milk samples from twenty-four clinically healthy dairy goats were collected on two consecutive days in early, mid and late lactation. At milking, each goat's udder half was given a CMT score before udder half milk samples were collected. The milk samples were then analyzed for SCC, LDH, NAGase and AP, and investigated for bacterial growth. Variation in udder health indicators between udder half within goat, samples between sampling days and samples between <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>lactation</b> were investigated using multivariable mixed-effect linear regression and multivariable ordinal logistic regression models. Of the 24 goats, 18 were considered IMI negative at all samplings, 3 goats had inconclusive results for one udder half in late lactation and 3 (12. 5 %) had IMI positive udder halves in one or more <b>lactation</b> periods. Period <b>of</b> <b>lactation</b> was significantly associated with all udder health indicators with an increase in all indicators at late lactation compared to mid and early lactation. For NAGase and AP, period <b>of</b> <b>lactation</b> was significant as an interaction term with sampling day. NAGase was significantly higher on day 2 compared to day 1 in mid lactation and significantly lower on day 2 than day 1 in late lactation. AP was significantly higher on day 2 compared to day 1 in early lactation and significantly lower on day 2 than day 1 in late lactation. Moreover, for CMT there was a significant association with udder half with a higher general (over period and day) probability of higher CMT scores in the right udder half compared to the left. This study shows that SCC, LDH, NAGase and AP were all affected by period <b>of</b> <b>lactation</b> but also to some extent by sampling day and udder half. This must be considered when interpreting udder health indicators sampled at different <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>lactation...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} milk composition and metabolic profile of Holstein cows at different calving orders in the beginning, middle, and end <b>of</b> <b>lactation.</b> One hundred ten Holstein cows were {{housed in a}} free stall system receiving the same diet and were grouped according to calving order (first, second, third, and fourth calving) and days in milk (DIM) : early (1 - 90 DIM), middle (91 - 180 DIM), and end <b>of</b> <b>lactation</b> (over 181 DIM) for comparing milk yield, milk composition, and blood metabolic profile between the calving orders within the same lactation period. These parameters were also evaluated between <b>lactation</b> periods <b>of</b> the cows in different calving orders. The calving order, in any lactation stage, had no influence on milk yield per day and blood biochemical profile of Holstein cows receiving the same diet. However, calving order in all <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>lactation</b> influenced milk composition. The first, second, third, and fourth calving order {{had no effect on}} the blood biochemical profile of Holstein cows, in any lactation stage. On the other hand, the different <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>lactation</b> influenced milk yield and milk composition of Holstein cows...|$|R

Two approaches were investigated. Firstly, two-trait models between fertility traits and BCS at different <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>lactation</b> were used. Secondly, random regression models were used to estimate correlation between BCS as a longitudinal trait and fertility traits. This report presents some preliminary results of this research.

40|$|Milk {{composition}} and quality {{are affected by}} several factors of which <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>lactation</b> and mammary gland health status represent the main ones. These two factors become more effective in small dairy ruminants, for which <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>lactation</b> is synchronized as result of the seasonal breeding cycle. As a consequence in dairy sheep and goats milk quality and cheese making properties tend to decline. Most of these effects on milk quality are also associated {{with an increase in}} the somatic cell count (SCC), which is in turn related with the gradual involution of mammary gland with the lactation progress (Fantuz et al., 2001; Baldi et al., 2002). However, high SCC in milk could be related to intramammary infections (IMI), sub-clinical and chronic mastitis in both sheep and goats...|$|E

ISSN 1652 - 6880, ISBN 978 - 91 - 85913 - 21 - 3 By using foster cows to raise calves in dairy production the calves {{are given the}} possibility to perform more of their natural behaviours, such as suckling, playing and having social contact. In this thesis the acceptance of calves by foster cows of different breeds and <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>lactation,</b> the development <b>of</b> an attachment between foster cows and calves and the possibility to reduce stress at weaning and separation was investigated. In paper I cows of the breeds Swedish Red (SR) and Swedish Holstein (SH) from early to late lactation were tested {{with regard to their}} ability to accept four alien calves. There were no differences between the breeds or the different <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>lactation.</b> SR cows were more social towards their calves and SR calves suckled and tried to suckle more than the SH calves. In paper II foster cows having four foster calves each were observed for 24 hours at three different occasions. All social interactions between the foster cow and individual calves...|$|R
40|$|Transcription factors {{belonging}} to the CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family have been implicated in the activation of gene expression in the mammary gland during lactation. We have therefore investigated the detailed expression profile of the C/EBP family during <b>lactation</b> and involution <b>of</b> the mouse mammary gland. The expression of C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta mRNA was low during lactation, increased dramatically {{at the beginning of}} involution and remained constant thereafter. In contrast, C/EBPalpha mRNA expression was relatively high during the early <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>lactation,</b> declined to low levels during the late <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>lactation</b> and at the start of involution, and increased again during involution. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays showed a close correlation between the expression of the C/EBP genes and the functional C/EBP DNA-binding activity and, additionally, demonstrated the participation of heterodimers, formed from among the three proteins, in DNA-protein interactions. The DNA-binding activity of the activator protein 1 (AP 1) family of transcription factors was also induced during involution. These results therefore point to potentially important regulatory roles for both the C/EBP and the AP 1 family during <b>lactation</b> and involution <b>of</b> the mammary gland...|$|R
