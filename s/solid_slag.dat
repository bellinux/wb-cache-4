These are also known as Gilchrist-Thomas converters, after their inventors, Percy Gilchrist and Sidney Gilchrist Thomas.

In this study, the effects of design/operation parameters and slag properties on the slag behaviors were assessed in a commercial coal gasifier using numerical modeling. The parameters influenced the slag behaviors through mechanisms interrelated to the heat transfer, temperature, velocity, and viscosity of the slag layers. The velocity profile of the liquid slag was less sensitive to the variations in the parameters. Therefore, {{the change in the}} liquid slag thickness was typically smaller than that of the <b>solid</b> <b>slag.</b> The gas temperature was the most influential factor, because of its dominant effect on the radiative heat transfer to the slag layer. The <b>solid</b> <b>slag</b> thickness exponentially increased with higher gas temperatures. The influence of the ash deposition rate was diminished by the high-velocity region developed near the liquid slag surface. The slag viscosity significantly influenced the <b>solid</b> <b>slag</b> thickness through the corresponding changes in the critical temperature and the temperature gradient (heat flux).

40|$|Many {{properties}} of solid residues from thermal waste treatment {{are directly related}} to process temperatures, as well as the residence times at high temperatures and the path of the waste material through the incineration zone. Applying temperatures of about 1000 C, which is usually the case for conventional methods of waste incineration (e. g. grate incineration processes), leads to solid residues, which are rather complex mixtures with a high number of coexisting phases. Their resulting properties, especially with respect to the leachability are difficult to assess. Newly developed high temperature waste incineration (HTWI) processes are operated above the liquidus temperature of the resulting silicate slags. At temperatures between 1200 C and 2000 C the presence of a liquid phase ensures the production of homogenious glassy slags or glass ceramics, whose properties can easily be quantified. It is therefore possible to optimize the quality of the slags for their application as recycling material. The {{properties of}} liquid and <b>solid</b> <b>slags</b> are related to their chemical composition. Therefore, the quality of HTWI slags is controlled by the composition of the treated waste, which can vary significantly over a short period of time. For given process parameters (e. g. temperature) there are limits for the waste composition which can be treated in the HTWI methods. For this reason, it was studied how the chemical composition of HTWI-slags influences important chemical, physical, and process related properties, such as liquidus temperature, viscosity, the crystallisation behaviour and the hydrolytic behaviour. For the investigation samples of granulated HTWI-slags were taken from the Siemens-Schwel-Brenn pilot plant in Ulm-Wiblingen. Model glasses were prepared, to extend the investigated composition field. The analysis of the composition shows, that 95 wt-% of the slags consist of the oxides Na_ 2 O-K_ 2 O-CaO-MgO-Al_ 2 O_ 3 -Fe_ 2 O_ 3 -SiO_ 2. Compared to the average composition of an agricultural soil, the content of heavy metals is elevated. By selectively varying oxide components, the influence of the chemical composition on the viscosity, the transformation temperature and the liquidus temperature was analysed. (orig.)

40|$|Mold slag {{friction}} and fracture may cause heat transfer variations in continuous casting, {{which leads to}} steel shell temperature and stress variations, resulting in surface cracks. Analytical transient models of liquid slag flow and <b>solid</b> <b>slag</b> stress have been coupled with a finite-difference model of heat transfer in the mold, gap and steel shell to predict transient shear stress, friction, slip and fracture of the slag layers. The models are validated by comparing with numerical models and plant measurements of mold friction. Using reported slag fracture strength and TTT diagrams, the models are applied to study the effect of casting speed and mold powder viscosity properties on slag layer behavior between the oscillating mold wall and the solidifying steel shell.

40|$|Large {{volumes of}} slag are {{produced}} by metallurgical processes, such as blast furnaces for steel production, and represent a significant waste stream that with suitable processing {{can be used in}} other industrial processes. Water granulation is currently used to process much of this slag but it uses large quantities of water and does not recover any of the heat. CSIRO is developing a dry slag granulation (DSG) process (Xie and Jahanshahi, 2008) based on a spinning disc that produces glassy slag granules and recovers some of the heat contained in the slag. The DSG process uses a spinning disc to break up a stream of molten slag into droplets that are then cooled by air and contact with the vessel walls. CFD modelling using ANSYS/CFX has been undertaken to develop an understanding of the slag film behaviour on the spinning disc (Pan et al. 2010) and the droplet formation process (Pan et al. 2011). A number of experiments have also been performed to understand the way that droplets interact with the vessel's walls so that information on droplet rebound and heat transfer can be determined and subsequently implemented into a CFD model of the process. Key parameters to stable operation of the disc are control of slag flow across the disc, limiting disc temperature and formation of a <b>solid</b> frozen <b>slag</b> {{on the surface of the}} disc. To understand disc operation a CFD model of disc that accounts for formation of a <b>solid</b> frozen <b>slag</b> layer at the disc surface and spreading and formation of a liquid slag film on the disc was developed.

The model is a transient VOF based simulation and results showing the typical breakup behaviour are shown in Figure 5.

In this paper, the forming process of iron nuggets has been investigated. Based on those results, the forming mechanisms and influencing factors of iron nugget at low temperature are discussed experimentally using an electric resistance furnace simulating a rotary hearth furnace process. Results show that the reduction of iron ore, carburization of reduced iron, and the composition and quantity of slag are very important for producing iron nuggets at lower temperature. Reduction reaction of carbon-containing pellets is mainly at 1273 K and 1473 K (1000 A degrees C and 1200 A degrees C). When the temperature is above 1473 K (1200 A degrees C), the metallization rate of carbon-containing pellets exceeds 93 pct, and the reduction reaction is substantially complete. Direct carburization is the main method for carburization of reduced iron. This reaction occurs above 1273 K (1000 A degrees C), with carburization degree increasing greatly at 1473 K and 1573 K (1200 A degrees C and 1300 A degrees C) after particular holding times. Besides, to achieve the "slag (solid state) and iron (molten state) separation," the melting point of the slag phase should be increased. <b>Slag</b> (<b>solid</b> state) and iron (molten state) separation can be achieved below 1573 K (1300 A degrees C), and when the holding time is 20 minutes, C/O is 0. 7, basicity is less than 0. 5 and a Na 2 CO 3 level of 3 pct, the recovery rate of iron can reach 90 pct, with a proportion of iron nuggets more than 3. 15 mm of nearly 90 pct.

Bands of deep transverse depressions extending about {{the perimeter of}} the strand in the first meter of cast product were identified as a potential cause of breakouts.

Extended delays in achieving steady state heat transfer conditions were observed on grades employing low basicity operating powders, and are ascribed to the retention of high basicity slag in the mold.

For example, the fact that the movement of one phase with respect to the others influenced the apparent wetting regime is very interesting for the interpretation of experimentally obtained results. Moreover, the two different types of experiments confirmed that a chemical reaction might lay at the origin of the attachment, but that it requires nucleation sites in the form of metal droplets before it takes place. However, the first phase field model assumed nonreactive solid particles. Thus, a model concerning the growth of the solid phase in a realistic quaternary oxide system was also considered. Future work needs to consider the interaction of reacting metal droplets with reacting solid particles in a realistic liquid slag...|$|R
