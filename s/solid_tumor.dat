5|$|The {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms}} of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or <b>solid</b> <b>tumor</b> of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the successes of}} chimeric antigen receptor-modified T- (CART-) cell-based therapy for B-cell malignancies, and early phase clinical trials have been launched in recent years. The few published clinical studies of CART cells in <b>solid</b> <b>tumors</b> have addressed safety and feasibility, but the clinical outcome data are limited. Although antitumor effects were confirmed in vitro and in animal models, CART-cell-based therapy still faces several challenges when directed towards <b>solid</b> <b>tumors,</b> {{and it has been}} difficult to achieve the desired outcomes in clinical practice. Many studies have struggled to improve the clinical responses to and benefits of CART-cell treatment of <b>solid</b> <b>tumors.</b> In this review, the status quo of CART cells and their clinical applications for <b>solid</b> <b>tumors</b> will be summarized first. Importantly, we will suggest improvements that could increase the therapeutic effectiveness of CART cells for <b>solid</b> <b>tumors</b> and their future clinical applications. These interventions will make treatment with CART cells an effective and routine therapy for <b>solid</b> <b>tumors...</b>|$|R

25|$|The first {{conclusive}} evidence for CSCs came in 1997. Bonnet and Dick isolated a subpopulation of leukemia cells that expressed surface marker CD34, but not CD38. The authors {{established that the}} CD34+/CD38− subpopulation is capable of initiating tumors in NOD/SCID mice that were histologically similar to the donor. The first evidence of a <b>solid</b> <b>tumor</b> cancer stem-like cell followed in 2002 {{with the discovery of}} a clonogenic, sphere-forming cell isolated and characterized from human brain gliomas. Human cortical glial tumors contain neural stem-like cells expressing astroglial and neuronal markers in vitro.|$|E
25|$|Radiation therapy {{may be used}} {{to treat}} almost every type of <b>solid</b> <b>tumor,</b> {{including}} cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, uterus, or soft tissue sarcomas. Radiation is also used to treat leukemia and lymphoma. Radiation dose to each site depends on a number of factors, including the radio sensitivity of each cancer type and whether there are tissues and organs nearby that may be damaged by radiation. Thus, as with every form of treatment, radiation therapy is not without its side effects.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{have been}} documented in <b>solid</b> <b>tumors</b> and malignant hematological disorders.

25|$|The boron atom in bortezomib binds the {{catalytic}} {{site of the}} 26S proteasome with high affinity and specificity. In normal cells, the proteasome regulates protein expression and function by degradation of ubiquitylated proteins, and also cleanses the cell of abnormal or misfolded proteins. Clinical and preclinical data support a role in maintaining the immortal phenotype of myeloma cells, and cell-culture and xenograft data support a similar function in <b>solid</b> <b>tumor</b> cancers. While multiple mechanisms {{are likely to be}} involved, proteasome inhibition may prevent degradation of pro-apoptotic factors, thereby triggering programmed cell death in neoplastic cells. Recently, it was found that bortezomib caused a rapid and dramatic change in the levels of intracellular peptides that are produced by the proteasome. Some intracellular peptides {{have been shown to be}} biologically active, and so the effect of bortezomib on the levels of intracellular peptides may contribute to the biological and/or side effects of the drug.|$|E
25|$|Causes of {{disturbed}} {{blood flow}} include stagnation of blood flow {{past the point}} of injury, or venous stasis which may occur in heart failure, or after long periods of sedentary behaviour, such as sitting on a long airplane flight. Also, atrial fibrillation, causes stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA), or left atrial appendage (LAA), and can lead to a thromboembolism. Cancers or malignancies such as leukemia may cause increased risk of thrombosis by possible activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances (paraneoplastic syndrome), by external compression on a blood vessel when a <b>solid</b> <b>tumor</b> is present, or (more rarely) extension into the vasculature (for example, renal cell cancers extending into the renal veins). Also, treatments for cancer (radiation, chemotherapy) often cause additional hypercoagulability. There are scores that correlate different aspects of patient data (comorbidities, vital signs, and others) to risk of thrombosis, such as the POMPE-C, which stratifies risk of mortality due to pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer, who typically have higher rates of thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|CT {{scanning}} {{is preferred}} {{to assess the}} extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity, though magnetic resonance imaging can also be used. CT scanning can also be useful for finding omental caking or differentiating fluid from <b>solid</b> <b>tumor</b> in the abdomen, especially in low malignant potential tumors. However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a chest x-ray is used to detect metastases in the chest or pleural effusion. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a barium enema, which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. Positron emission tomography, bone scans, and paracentesis are of limited use; in fact, paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results. However, paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present. A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform mammography or an endometrial biopsy (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. Vaginal ultrasonography is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations. However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.|$|E
50|$|Also <b>solid</b> <b>tumors</b> give {{increased}} {{values of}} thymidine kinase activity in serum. The increases for <b>solid</b> <b>tumors</b> {{are not as}} large as they are for hematologic malignancies. The first methods for determination of thymidine kinase activity in serum had a limited sensitivity. In {{the case of the}} methods employing radioactivity one reason was that the quantity of radioactivity allowed by law in normal radioimmunoassay laboratories has strict limitations. The experimental method first developed by Gronowitz et al. used quantities of radioisotope much above those used in commercial radioassays and therefore the sensitivity was sufficient to detect increases also from <b>solid</b> <b>tumors.</b> With commercial radioimmunoassays this was difficult, and the results were not very convincing. Later non-radioactive techniques give higher sensitivity allowing the lower increases from <b>solid</b> <b>tumors</b> to be measured accurately.|$|R

2500|$|In 1903 it was {{suggested}} {{for the first time}} that transduction by viruses might cause cancer. In 1908 Bang and Ellerman showed that a filterable virus could transmit chicken leukemia, data largely ignored till the 1930s when leukemia became regarded as cancerous. In 1911 Peyton Rous reported the transmission of chicken sarcoma, a <b>solid</b> <b>tumor,</b> with a virus, and thus Rous became [...] "father of tumor virology". The virus was later called Rous sarcoma virus 1 and understood to be a retrovirus. Several other cancer-causing retroviruses have since been described.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of {{testicular}} cancer {{is one of}} the success stories of modern medicine, with sustained response to treatment in more than 90% of cases, regardless of stage. In 2011 overall cure rates of more than 95% were reported, and 80% for metastatic disease—the best response by any <b>solid</b> <b>tumor,</b> with improved survival being attributed primarily to effective chemotherapy. [...] By 2013 more than 96 per cent of the 2,300 men diagnosed each year in the U.K. were deemed cured, a rise by almost a third since the 1970s, the improvement attributed substantially to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. In the United States, when the disease is treated while it is still localized, more than 99% of people survive 5 years.|$|E
2500|$|Tumors induce {{blood vessel}} growth (angiogenesis) by {{secreting}} various growth factors (e.g. [...] VEGF). Growth {{factors such as}} bFGF and VEGF can induce capillary growth into the tumor, which some researchers suspect supply required nutrients, allowing for tumor expansion. Unlike normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are dilated with an irregular shape. [...] In 2007, {{it was discovered that}} cancerous cells stop producing the anti-VEGF enzyme PKG. [...] In normal cells (but not in cancerous ones), PKG apparently limits beta-catenin, which solicits angiogenesis. Other clinicians believe angiogenesis really serves as a waste pathway, taking away the biological end products secreted by rapidly dividing cancer cells. In either case, angiogenesis is a necessary and required step for transition from a small harmless cluster of cells, often said to be {{about the size of the}} metal ball at the end of a ball-point pen, to a large tumor. Angiogenesis is also required for the spread of a tumor, or metastasis. Single cancer cells can break away from an established <b>solid</b> <b>tumor,</b> enter the blood vessel, and be carried to a distant site, where they can implant and begin the growth of a secondary tumor. Evidence now suggests the blood vessel in a given <b>solid</b> <b>tumor</b> may, in fact, be mosaic vessels, composed of endothelial cells and tumor cells. This mosaicity allows for substantial shedding of tumor cells into the vasculature, possibly contributing to the appearance of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of patients with malignancies. The subsequent growth of such metastases will also require a supply of nutrients and oxygen and a waste disposal pathway.|$|E

40|$|Antibody-based therapy of <b>solid</b> <b>tumors</b> has {{met with}} limited success, chiefly because <b>solid</b> <b>tumors</b> are {{relatively}} impermeable to macromolecules. This problem could be circumvented by attacking the readily accessible endothelial cells of the tumor vascular bed. We have developed a model to test this "vascular targeting" approach in which cytokine gene transfection of the tumor cells causes them to induce an experimental marker selectively on tumor vascular endothelium. An anti-tumor endothelial cell immunotoxin caused complete occlusion of the tumor vasculature and dramatic regressions of large <b>solid</b> <b>tumors.</b> By contrast, a conventional anti-tumor cell immunotoxin of equivalent in vitro potency produced only minor, transient antitumor effects but, when combined, the two immunotoxins induced permanent complete remissions in {{over half of the}} animals.
