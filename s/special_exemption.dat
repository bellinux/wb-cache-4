25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Federations {{occasionally}} requested permission to allow slightly underage athletes to compete as seniors. One such example {{is that of}} Canadian gymnast Karen Kelsall, who legally competed in the 1976 Olympics {{at the age of}} 13. At the time, gymnasts had to turn 14 by the start of the Games to be eligible. Kelsall, with her December 1962 birthday, was five months shy of the requirement but was turning 14 within the Olympic year, and was granted a <b>special</b> <b>exemption</b> by the FIG to compete. Such exemptions were not automatic, however: American gymnast Tracee Talavera, who was named to the United States team for the 1979 World Championships, was deemed ineligible to compete due to her age of 12½ years.|$|E

The <b>special</b> <b>exemption</b> permits an immediate family member of an elected official who was a lobbyist for {{the executive branch of}} state government for one year prior to January 9, 2012, to be able to lobby the legislature.

25|$|The Roman Rite has no {{celebration of}} Mass between the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday evening and the Easter Vigil unless a <b>special</b> <b>exemption</b> is granted for rare solemn or grave {{occasions}} by the Vatican or the local bishop. The only sacraments celebrated {{during this time}} are Baptism (for those in danger of death), Penance, and Anointing of the Sick. While there is no celebration of the Eucharist, it is distributed to the faithful only in the Service of the Passion of the Lord, but can also be taken at any hour to the sick {{who are unable to}} attend this service. During this period crosses, candlesticks, and altar cloths are removed from the altar which remains completely bare, though these things are gradually added to the altar as part of the ceremony. It is also customary to empty the holy water fonts in preparation of the blessing of the water at the Easter Vigil. Traditionally, no bells are rung on Good Friday or Holy Saturday until the Easter Vigil.|$|E

They were a family who ran up and down with the greatest alacrity. [...] "Oh, papa, my basket is out on the seat"--for there had been a seat in the two-foot garden behind the house. Papa would go down in two jumps and come up with three skips, and there was the basket, only because his girl liked him to do something for her. But for him Ayala would run about as though she were a tricksy Ariel. Had the important matrimonial news been conveyed to Ariel, with a true girl's spirit she would have felt that during the present period Augusta was entitled to <b>special</b> <b>exemption</b> from all ordering. Had she herself been engaged she would have run more and quicker than ever,--would have been excited thereto by the peculiar vitality of her new prospects; but to even Augusta she would be subservient, because of her appreciation of bridal importance.
