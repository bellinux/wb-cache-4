However, clinical outcome is poorly predicted by such vestibular reflex assessments. We hypothesised that symptomatic recovery would depend upon higher order visuo-vestibular compensatory mechanisms. Thirty-one patients were studied in the acute and recovery phases of vestibular neuritis (median 2 days and 10 weeks, respectively). Patients underwent examination of vestibulo-ocular and vestibular-perceptual responses, at threshold and <b>supra-threshold</b> levels. <b>Supra-threshold</b> stimuli (90 °/s velocity step rotations) allowed quantification of vestibulo-ocular and vestibulo-perceptual time constants. Additional measures of visual dependency (rod-and-disc task), dizziness symptom load (Vertigo Symptom Scale and Dizziness Handicap Inventory) and psychological factors (including - autonomic arousal, anxiety, depression, fear of bodily sensations) were obtained. Vestibulo-perceptual and vestibulo-ocular thresholds were raised and asymmetric acutely and remained slightly elevated and asymmetric at recovery. Acutely, <b>supra-threshold</b> vestibulo-ocular time constants were shortened and asymmetric. In contrast, perceptual responses were reduced but notably symmetrical. At recovery, vestibulo-ocular <b>supra-threshold</b> responses remained abnormal but perceptual <b>supra-threshold</b> responses normalised. Visual dependency was significantly elevated above normals in both acute and recovery stages. Vertigo symptom recovery was significantly predicted by acute levels of visual dependency (p= 0. 002), autonomic anxiety (p= 0. 004). A number of measures were associated with vertigo symptoms at recovery, in addition to visual dependency (p= 0. 012) and autonomic anxiety (p< 0. 001), including - anxiety and depression (p< 0. 003), fear of body sensations (p= 0. 033), vestibular perceptual thresholds (p= 0. 017) and caloric canal paresis (p= 0. 001). Factor Analysis revealed a strong association between clinical outcome, visual dependency and psychological factors, all loading on a single component accounting for 59. 15 % of the variance. The bilateral suppression of <b>supra-threshold</b> vestibular perception observed acutely represents a hitherto unrecognised central adaptive ‘anti-vertiginous’ mechanism.

Converging evidence from {{human and animal}} studies points to one potential source of such difficulties: differences in the fidelity with which <b>supra-threshold</b> sound is encoded in the early portions of the auditory pathway. Measures of auditory subcortical steady-state responses (SSSRs) in humans and animals {{support the idea that}} the temporal precision of the early auditory representation can be poor even when hearing thresholds are normal. In humans with normal hearing thresholds (NHTs), paradigms that require listeners {{to make use of the}} detailed spectro-temporal structure of <b>supra-threshold</b> sound, such as selective attention and discrimination of frequency modulation (FM), reveal individual differences that correlate with subcortical temporal coding precision.

Furthermore, recent studies suggest that noise-induced neuropathy may be selective for higher-threshold, lower-spontaneous-rate nerve fibers.

Above that level, perceptibility of LOD control manipulations should be minimized, and detail contrast is a better predictor of perceptibility than detail size. Below that level, perceptibility must be maximized, and LOD should be improved as eccentricity rises or contrast drops. This directly contradicts prevailing threshold-based LOD control schemes, and strongly suggests a reexamination of LOD control for foveal display...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityTo extract {{content and}} meaning {{from a single}} source of sound in a quiet background, the {{auditory}} system can use a small subset of a very redundant set of spectral and temporal features. In stark contrast, communication in a complex, crowded scene places enormous demands on the auditory system. Spectrotemporal overlap between sounds reduces modulations in the signals at the ears and causes masking, with problems exacerbated by reverberation. Consistent with this idea, many patients seeking audiological treatment seek help precisely because they notice difficulties in environments requiring auditory selective attention. In the laboratory, even listeners with normal hearing thresholds exhibit vast differences {{in the ability to}} selectively attend to a target. Understanding the mechanisms causing these <b>supra-threshold</b> differences, the focus of this thesis, may enable research that leads to advances in treating communication disorders that affect an estimated one in five Americans. Converging evidence from human and animal studies points to one potential source of these individual differences: differences in the fidelity with which <b>supra-threshold</b> sound is encoded in the early portions of the auditory pathway. Electrophysiological measures of sound encoding by the auditory brainstem in humans and animals support the idea that the temporal precision of the early auditory neural representation can be poor even when hearing thresholds are normal. Concomitantly, animal studies show that noise exposure and early aging can cause a loss (cochlear neuropathy) of {{a large percentage of the}} afferent population of auditory nerve fibers innervating the cochlear hair cells without any significant change in measured audiograms. Using behavioral, otoacoustic and electrophysiological measures in conjunction with computational models of sound processing by the auditory periphery and brainstem, a detailed examination of temporal coding of <b>supra-threshold</b> sound is carried out, focusing on characterizing and understanding individual differences in listeners with normal hearing thresholds and normal cochlear mechanical function. Results support the hypothesis that cochlear neuropathy may reduce encoding precision of <b>supra-threshold</b> sound, and that this manifests as deficits both behaviorally and in subcortical electrophysiological measures in humans. Based on these results, electrophysiological measures are developed that may yield sensitive, fast, objective measures of <b>supra-threshold</b> coding deficits that arise as a result of cochlear neuropathy...|$|E

40|$|Cochlear {{hearing loss}} leads to deficits in many perceptual aspects, {{including}} threshold elevation (loss of sensitivity), reduction of auditory dynamic range (loudness recruitment) and problems with resolving sounds (loss of <b>supra-threshold</b> hearing). An ongoing debate is whether {{assessment of the}} individual <b>supra-threshold</b> hearing provides information {{which is likely to}} have an important influence on clinical decisions on signal processing strategies. The aim of this thesis was to investigate different methods of assessing the <b>supra-threshold</b> hearing and on this basis motivate configurations in a wide dynamic range compression hearing aid. A method to assess the <b>supra-threshold</b> hearing has previously been developed; Psychoacoustical Modulation Transfer Function (PMTF). This method measures masked short-tone thresholds at the peak and in the valley in a 100 % intensity modulated octave band of noise. The effects of duration and level were also investigated for a simultaneous masking task, analogous to the condition of the threshold at the peak. The masked thresholds and temporal integration for both normal-hearing and hearingimpaired listeners vary as a function of level. This supports the view that the task is highly influenced by peripheral compression. By measuring PMTF {{as a function of the}} perceived loudness of the modulated noise a comparison was possible at equal loudness categories between a group of listeners with presumed good <b>supra-threshold</b> hearing and normal-hearing listeners. Listeners with hearing loss showed lower than normal peak-to-valley threshold difference at loudness ratings below their comfortable loudness level. An individual fitting rationale was defined and evaluated in a field trial using an experimental hearing aid configured as a slow-acting compressor. With regard to speech recognition in noise and sound quality ratings and self-assessment, the result does not support the use of a fitting rationale based on the residual nonlinearity in the inner ear instead of a threshold-based gain prescription. In a series of four experiments, the effects of presentation level, compression characteristics and time constant on the benefit from compression compared to linear were studied using a real-time simulated three-channel compressor. Speech recognition was measured with sentences in fluctuating speechshaped noise. Results showed that only one-third of the hearing-impaired listeners showed benefit from fast-acting compression across all presentation levels. An inverse relationship was found between benefit from fast-acting compression and the severity of the <b>supra-threshold</b> hearing loss. The choice of compression speed affected speech recognition in a fluctuating noise for both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing listeners. The normal-hearing listeners showed the largest benefit from fastacting compression and the effect of compression speed for this group was predicted from acoustical factors. In three subsequent experiments hearing impairment was simulated in normal-hearing listeners to explore the mechanisms behind the lack of benefit for most listeners. Evidence was found that moderate fast-acting compression could be beneficial in fluctuating noise when the speech was not limited by hearing threshold, was presented at negative signal-tonoise ratios or contained only minimal spectral cues. In conclusion, the data indicates that fast-acting compression should be used with caution. Compressors of intermediate and slow speed are more appropriate because it will preserve the temporal contrast...|$|E

Dendritic spines with excitable channels can be present in large densities on the dendrites of many cells. The recently proposed Spike-Diffuse-Spike (SDS) model that is described by a system of point hot-spots (with an integrate-and-fire process) embedded throughout a passive tree has been shown to provide a reasonable caricature of a dendritic tree with <b>supra-threshold</b> dynamics. Interestingly, real dendrites equipped with voltage-gated ion channels can exhibit not only <b>supra-threshold</b> responses, but also sub-threshold dynamics. This sub-threshold resonant-like oscillatory behaviour has already been shown to be adequately described by a quasi-active membrane. In this paper we introduce a mathematical model of a branched dendritic tree based upon a generalisation of the SDS model where the active spines are assumed to be distributed along a quasi-active dendritic structure. We demonstrate how solitary and periodic travelling wave solutions can be constructed for both continuous and discrete spine distributions. In both cases the speed of such waves is calculated as a function of system parameters. We also illustrate that the model can be naturally generalised to an arbitrary branched dendritic geometry whilst remaining computationally simple. The spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal activity are shown to be significantly influenced by the properties of the quasi-active membrane. Active (sub- and <b>supra-threshold)</b> properties of dendrites are known to vary considerably among cell types and animal species, and this theoretical framework can be used in studying the combined role of complex dendritic morphologies and active conductances in rich neuronal dynamics...|$|E

Since the effect of VN on reflex and perceptual function may differ at threshold and <b>supra-threshold</b> acceleration levels, we used two stimulus intensities, acceleration steps of 0. 5 °/s 2 and velocity steps of 90 °/s (acceleration 180 °/s 2). We hypothesised that the vestibular lesion or the compensatory processes could dissociate VO and VP function, particularly if the acute vertiginous sensation interferes with the perceptual tasks. Both in acute and recovery phases, VO and VP thresholds increased, particularly during ipsilesional rotations. In signal detection theory this indicates that signals from the healthy and affected side are still fused, but result in asymmetric thresholds due to a lesion-induced bias. The normal pattern whereby VP thresholds are higher than VO thresholds was preserved, indicating that any ‘perceptual noise’ added by the vertigo does not disrupt the cognitive decision-making processes inherent to the perceptual task. Overall, the parallel findings in VO and VP thresholds imply little or no additional cortical processing and suggest that vestibular thresholds essentially reflect the sensitivity of the fused peripheral receptors. In contrast, a significant VO-VP dissociation for <b>supra-threshold</b> stimuli was found. Acutely, time constants and duration of the VO and VP responses were reduced – asymmetrically for VO, as expected, but surprisingly symmetrical for perception. At recovery, VP responses normalised but VO responses remained shortened and asymmetric. Thus, unlike threshold data, <b>supra-threshold</b> responses show considerable VO-VP dissociation indicative of additional, higher-order processing of vestibular signals. We provide evidence of perceptual processes (ultimately cortical) participating in vestibular compensation, suppressing asymmetry acutely in unilateral vestibular lesions...|$|E

MLDS allows us to quantify <b>supra-threshold</b> perceptual differences between pairs of images and to examine how perceived image quality, estimated through MLDS, changes as the compression rate is increased. We show how the data collected by MLDS allows us to recalibrate MS-SSIM to improve its performance...|$|E
