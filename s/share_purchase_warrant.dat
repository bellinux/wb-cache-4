40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between insider trading and positive abnormal return.

An event study is a statistical method which calculates the impact of an event on another variable under a specific time period, and in this paper, the impact of CEO <b>share</b> <b>purchases</b> on the stock price during 11 days. Furthermore, the result from this study is insufficient and cannot be used to generalize the concrete conclusions. It {{has been shown that}} the probability of positive abnormal return varies depending on what period of time is analyzed. A positive abnormal return did not occur when analyzing the whole period (11 days). However, the results were somewhat significant when we analyzed and compared specific periods with each other. Thus, we find it hard to justify whether CEO <b>share</b> <b>purchases</b> within the own company generates a positive abnormal return...|$|R
