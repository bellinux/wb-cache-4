And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk.

5|$|In the 1890s {{some people}} – {{including}} the young Calogero Vizzini – {{decided to do}} <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the absence of peace and security in the countryside. The state police {{at the time was}} as much a danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable social capital. It later transformed into a protection racket, victimizing villagers and landowners alike through violence, intimidation and omertà.|$|E

5|$|The Seal of Dartmouth College is the {{official}} insignia of Dartmouth College, an Ivy League university located in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Anglo-American law generally requires a corporate body to seek official government sanction, usually {{in the form of}} a charter, in order to operate. Such chartered bodies normally authenticate their official acts by marking them with a distinctive seal. The seal's design is usually complicated to avoid counterfeiting, but it can also express <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the institution's history or mission. Dartmouth College is one such chartered body, and it obtained its official seal in 1773.|$|E

Kurland had heard good things about them, and after a failed attempt to see them play at South By Southwest finally hooked up with them when touring with his then client, the band Crumb.|$|E
5|$|The native Britons had {{converted}} to Christianity under Roman rule. The Anglo-Saxon invasions separated the British church from European Christianity for centuries, so {{the church in}} Rome had no presence or authority in Britain, and in fact, Rome knew so little about the British church that it was unaware of any schism in customs. However, Æthelberht would have known <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the Roman church from his Frankish wife, Bertha, who had brought a bishop, Liudhard, with her across the Channel, and for whom Æthelberht built a chapel, St Martin's.|$|E

5|$|After {{beginning}} his acting career with a play, Stiller wrote several mockumentaries, and was offered his own show entitled The Ben Stiller Show, which he produced and hosted for its 13-episode run.

Throughout his career he has written, starred in, directed, or produced more than 50 films, including The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Zoolander, The Cable Guy, There's <b>Something</b> <b>About</b> Mary, the Meet the Parents trilogy, , Tropic Thunder, the Madagascar series, and the Night at the Museum trilogy.

When Emma mentions her name, Mr. Gold pauses as if he knew <b>something</b> <b>about</b> her. Emma's decision to stay in Storybrooke causes the hands of the town clock, previously frozen at 8:15, to begin moving again, indicating that the Dark Curse is beginning to weaken.|$|E

He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself or anyone else. Eighteen months before the shooting, he moved back to Valmeyer from Montana. Once home, {{he was known to}} compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the Mississippi River floods of 1993. There was so much downed timber on his family's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees. Two days prior to the Capitol shooting, at his grandmother's insistence to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> nearby cats which were becoming a nuisance, Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single-barreled shotgun, leaving several in a bucket and burying the rest.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Stiller {{put aside}} his {{directing}} ambitions {{to star in}} a surprise hit with a long-lasting cult following, the Farrelly Brothers' There's <b>Something</b> <b>About</b> Mary, alongside Cameron Diaz, which accelerated Stiller's acting career. That year, he also starred in several dramas, including Zero Effect, Your Friends & Neighbors, and Permanent Midnight. Stiller was invited {{to take part in}} hosting the Music Video awards, for which he developed a parody of the Backstreet Boys and performed a sketch with his father, commenting on his current career. In 1999, Stiller starred in three films, including Mystery Men, where he played a superhero wannabe called Mr. Furious. He returned to directing with a new television series for Fox titled Heat Vision and Jack, starring Jack Black; however, the show was not picked up by Fox after its pilot episode and the series was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is {{a symbol}} of {{shedding}} the social self and its constraints to then embrace the freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to embrace her animal self and learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having not learned something new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E

5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as {{if they are going to}} do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her return}} from Rome, Violante Beatrice and the Electress Anna Maria Luisa {{decided to do}} <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Gian Gastone's public image and the Ruspanti, his entourage. In order to {{distract}} him from the Ruspanti, Violante Beatrice threw banquets, to which she invited the foremost members of Tuscan society. The Grand Duke's behaviour, vomiting, belching and cracking rude jokes, literally sent the guests scrambling to leave. The Electress was more fortunate for her part. She succeeded in making Gian Gastone appear on Saint John the Baptist's day, 1729. However, during the ceremony, the Grand Duke became so intoxicated {{that he had to}} be dragged back to his palace, the Pitti, on a litter.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> his daughter-in-law's behaviour; he {{sent the}} Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a {{solution}} to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E
