40|$|A microstructure-based {{model is}} {{presented}} to predict the fatigue life of polycrystalline metallic alloys which present a bilinear Coffin-Manson relationship. The model is based in {{the determination of the}} maximum value of a fatigue indicator parameter obtained from the plastic energy dissipated by cycle in the microstructure. The fatigue indicator parameter was obtained by means of the computational homogenization of a representative volume element of the microstructure using a crystal-plasticity finite element model. The microstructure-based model was applied to predict the low cyclic fatigue behavior of IN 718 at 400 ^∘C which exhibits a bilinear Coffin-Manson relationship under the assumption that this behavior is triggered by a transition from highly localized plasticity at low cyclic <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes</b> to more homogeneous deformation at high cyclic <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> The model predictions were in very good agreement with the experimental results {{for a wide range of}} cyclic <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes</b> and two <b>strain</b> ratios (R_ϵ = 0 and - 1) and corroborated the initial hypothesis.

40|$|The {{increase}} in target performance of engines {{and hence the}} loading of their structural materials has dictated {{the need for more}} information about the behaviour of cast aluminium alloys under severe conditions up to 400 °C. This study was therefore conducted in order to determine how different cooling rates, different pre-treatments and different alloying elements can improve the performance of cast aluminium (Al) alloys under thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) loading compared to a reference alloy and condition, AlSi 6 Cu 4 -T 6. An existing TMF test rig was modified to allow an investigation of temperature gradients corresponding to those prevailing in real cylinder heads. The measured data were implemented in a Chaboche damage model and in an FEM tool in order to simulate low cycle fatigue (LCF) and TMF behaviour. These models provide a possibility to simulate LCF and TMF behaviour taking into account microstructural changes. On metallographic examination, a dependence of crack initiation on secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) and on porosity was observed. Here, a smaller SDAS and a HIP modified microstructure led to a longer lifetime. Furthermore, clusters of brittle Si particles, decohesion or intermetallic phases were also found to initiate cracks. Stage I crack behaviour was seen at low <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> where the crack propagates along the interface between the Al matrix and the intermetallic phases. Stage II behaviour was observed for higher <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes</b> with crack propagation taking place along intermetallic phase boundaries such as Al 2 Cu, α-phase and β-phase or through pores. An increasing proportion of matrix cracks was observed for low <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> Investigation of the decohesion behaviour revealed decohesion under high <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes</b> and in areas with a high particle fracture volume attributable to high notch stresses.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of single}} crystal nickel base superalloy SC 16 {{has been studied}} under hold time LCF loading with various hold periods from 60 to 1800 s in compression region at 1223 K. The strain rate was 10 3 s 1 and the <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes</b> were 0. 4 and 1. 0. The alloy showed asymmetrical cyclic stress response behaviour. In the first few load cycles the alloy showed a cyclic hardening in tensile region and a cyclic softening in compression region. Both the stress amplitudes stabilised, however, after several load cycles. Based on the analysis of relaxation behaviour of the alloy during hold time the stress response behaviour observed in this study could be understood qualitatively. The introduc tion of hold periods at maximum compressive strain leads to a morphological change of amp; 61543; precipitates rafting in the alloy from initially cuboidal to a rod like geometry with its rod axis parallel to load direction.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{similarities}} and dissimilarities between daily in vivo strain histories of different bones, other than the generally accepted view that most bones need daily loading to maintain their mass. Similarities in daily strain histories might uncover a common basic mechanical stimulus for homeostatic bone maintenance, whereas dissimilarities might explain why bones respond differently to changes in their environment. We compared the daily strain histories of two different bones from the rabbit: the tibiofibula and the mandible. Bone strain was recorded wirelessly in freely moving animals up to 57 h. Habitual <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> rates, and frequencies were compared. The exponential decrease in occurrence of greater <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes</b> was similar in long and mandibular bone. Also similar was the exponentially decreasing incidence of higher strain rates. Mandibular-bone strains distinguished themselves from long-bone strains, however, through the presence of a plateau in the occurrence of compressive <b>strains</b> with <b>amplitudes</b> between 200 and 450 microstrain (mu epsilon) and in the occurrence of compressive-strain rates between 5000 and 10, 000 mu epsilon/s. The frequency spectrum of the mandibular-bone strain history contained peaks at 4. 4 Hz and 8. 9 Hz, which were absent in the long-bone strain spectrum. We hypothesise that the exponentially decreasing incidence of larger <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes</b> and rates might outline the minimum amount of mechanical stimuli needed for bone maintenance. Furthermore, the strong presence of rhythmicity in mandibular strains might provide an important clue in confirming or improving the anabolic character of cyclic-loading regimes employed in clinical settings.

Low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests of the metastable cast steel alloy at different <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes</b> showed that three different kinds of cyclic softening/hardening behaviour can be distinguished caused by different microstructures. In-situ push-pull tests in the SEM at two different applied total <b>strain</b> <b>amplitudes</b> were carried out showing {{the evolution of the}} microstructure in dependence on the number of cycles. The phase transformation of the metastable austenite to the α′-martensite and changes in the microstructure (deformation bands, dislocation arrangements) were investigated applying different SEM techniques as electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and electron channelling contrast imaging (ECCI). It is shown that the formation of deformation bands starts just {{from the beginning of the}} cyclic deformation and almost as multiple slip. ECC images show that these bands consist of very fine, elongated lamellas with increasing density and length at increasing number of cycles. Many of these fine lamellas grow together and form the deformation bands. The lamellas can be correlated with stacking faults.

40|$|Building fuel {{efficient}} automobiles is increasingly important {{due to the}} rising cost of energy. One way to improve fuel efficiency is to reduce the overall automobile weight. Weight reductions using steel components are desirable because of easy integration into existing manufacturing systems. Designing components with Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) has allowed for material reductions, while maintaining strength requirements. Two Advanced High Strength steel microstructures investigated in this research utilize different strengthening mechanisms to obtain a desired tensile strength grade of 590 MPa. One steel, HR 590, utilizes precipitation strengthening to refine the grain size and harden the steel. The other steel, HR 590 DP, utilizes a dual phase microstructure consisting of hardened martensite constituents in a ferrite matrix. The steels are processed to have the same tensile strength grade, but exhibit different fatigue behavior. The central objective of this research is to characterize and compare the fatigue behavior of these two steels. The results show the dual phase steel work hardens at a low fatigue life.
