50|$|The 1L6 {{was to be}} a <b>specialty</b> <b>tube,</b> {{produced}} in small quantities by very few manufacturers, mostly Sylvania for use by just a few manufacturers of shortwave portables, such as Zenith - in their Trans-Oceanics - and its short-lived rivals, such as the Hallicrafters TW-1000 and the RCA Strat-O-World and very few others. In fact, Zenith, Crosley {{and more than a few}} others used it in many radios. 1L6 based multi-band radios were made by Crosley, Airline (Montgomery Ward house-brand), Silvertone (Sears house brand), Hallicrafters, FADA, and several others. When the US military commissioned two versions of the Trans-Oceanics, they stockpiled 1L6s in the uncounted thousands, some of which still show up at surplus sales.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, Reliance also {{acquired}} Foucar, Ray & Simon, a <b>specialty</b> <b>tube</b> distributor in Hayward, California, with {{a branch}} in Portland, Oregon. The Hayward center was eventually merged into the Reliance center in Santa Clara. The Portland operation foundered and then closed in 1984. Gimbel told Metal Service News the acquisition {{had been a}} mistake. [...] "Foucar was probably the second oldest service center in California, with a good reputation. They'd done well over the years, but I guess they'd gotten rigor mortis. We thought that we could change all that. We tried and tried to change it, and it didn't work. So we had to admit defeat and close up the place." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{test tubes}} in which blood is {{collected}} may contain {{one or more}} of several additives. In general, tests requiring whole blood call for blood samples collected in test tubes containing some form of the anticoagulant EDTA. EDTA chelates calcium to prevent clotting. EDTA is preferred for hematology tests because it does minimum damage to cell morphology. Sodium Citrate is the anticoagulant used in specimens collected for coagulation tests. The majority of chemistry and immunology tests are performed on serum, which is produced by clotting and then separating the blood specimen via centrifuge. These specimens are collected in either a non-additive tube or one containing a clotting activator. This clotting activator can interfere with some assays, and so a plain tube is recommended in these cases, but will delay testing. Tubes containing lithium heparin or sodium heparin are also commonly used for a variety of chemistry tests, as they do not require clotting and can be centrifuged immediately after collection. A combination of sodium flouride and potassium oxalate is used for glucose tests, as these additives both prevent clotting and stop glycolosis, so that blood glucose levels are preserved after collection. another <b>specialty</b> <b>tube</b> is an opaque amber colored tube used to collect blood for light sensitive analytes, such as bilirubin.|$|E

50|$|Most endotracheal tubes {{today are}} {{constructed}} of polyvinyl chloride, but <b>specialty</b> <b>tubes</b> constructed of silicone rubber, latex rubber, or stainless steel are also widely available. Most tubes have an inflatable cuff {{to seal the}} trachea and bronchial tree against air leakage and aspiration of gastric contents, blood, secretions, and other fluids. Uncuffed tubes are also available, though their use is limited mostly to pediatric patients (in small children, the cricoid cartilage, the narrowest portion of the pediatric airway, often provides an adequate seal for mechanical ventilation).|$|R

50|$|Tube flies {{are tied}} on short {{sections}} of brass, copper, aluminum or plastic tubing instead of hooks. Metal tubes {{are used to}} add weight to the fly and are usually lined with smaller diameter plastic tubes to protect the tippet. All manner of commercially available tubes and tube fly components are available to the fly tier, many of a <b>specialty</b> nature. <b>Tube</b> fly patterns are tied {{in the same manner}} and with the same type of materials used to tie traditional artificial flies. However instead of a hook being clamped in a vise, tube flies are tied using purpose built tube fly vises or adapters. The small diameter tubing is threaded on a tapered needle until secure allowing the addition of materials without the tube slipping or spinning. The ends of plastic tubes are flared with a heat source either before or after the addition of materials to prevent thread from coming off the end of the tube. Plastic or metal cones are sometimes added {{at the head of the}} fly to add weight and or create sonic disturbances in the water.|$|R
5000|$|A pentode is an {{electronic}} device having five active electrodes. The term most commonly applies to a three-grid amplifying vacuum tube (thermionic valve), which {{was invented by}} Gilles Holst and Bernhard D.H. Tellegen in 1926. [...] The pentode consists of an evacuated glass envelope containing five electrodes in this order: a cathode heated by a filament, a control grid, a screen grid, a suppressor grid, and a plate (anode). The pentode (called a [...] "triple-grid amplifier" [...] in some early literature) was developed from the tetrode tube {{by the addition of}} a third grid, the suppressor grid. This served to prevent secondary emission electrons emitted by the plate from reaching the screen grid, which caused instability and parasitic oscillations in the tetrode. The pentode is closely related to the beam tetrode. Pentodes were widely used in industrial and consumer electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s, when they were replaced by transistors. Their main use now is in high power industrial applications such as radio transmitters. The obsolete consumer tubes are still used in a few legacy and <b>specialty</b> vacuum <b>tube</b> audio devices.|$|R
50|$|The beam tetrode {{was invented}} in Britain by two EMI engineers, Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda, {{as an attempt to}} {{circumvent}} the power pentode, whose patent was owned by Philips. It was patented in 1933.Although the beam-plates (when present) could be counted as a fifth electrode (as in a pentode), this type of tube is nevertheless classified as a tetrode, perhaps to underline the difference in principle from that employed in true pentodes, which rely upon the effect of a suppressor grid. Beam tetrodes were widely used as audio power amplifying tubes in consumer and industrial electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s when they were replaced by transistors. Their main use now is in high power industrial applications such as radio transmitters. Low power consumer beam tetrodes are still used in a few legacy and <b>specialty</b> vacuum <b>tube</b> audio power amplifier devices such as tube guitar amplifiers; the KT66 and KT88 are popular examples in audio equipment, while QY4-400 is an example having 400W anode dissipation, capable of applications in radio transmitters up to 100 MHz. The 4CX250B, mentioned above can be operated at full 250W anode dissipation up to 500 MHz. Many other types abound.|$|R
