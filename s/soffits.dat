5|$|In 1936 {{the bridge}} was {{designated}} an ancient monument. The city council bought several of the shops and made plans {{for the restoration of}} the original façade, which was completed in time for the Festival of Britain in 1951. Further work was carried out in the 1960s to repair the underside <b>soffits</b> of all three arches. More restoration of the southern street facade was needed in 1975. The status of the bridge as an ancient monument was replaced in 1955 with its designation as a Grade I listed building.|$|E

25|$|Craftsmen and {{designers}} utilize copper’s inherent benefits to build aesthetically pleasing and long-lasting building systems. From cathedrals to castles and from homes to offices, copper {{is used in}} many products: low-sloped and pitched roofs, <b>soffits,</b> fascias, flashings, gutters, downspouts, building expansion joints, domes, spires, and vaults. Copper {{is also used to}} clad walls and other surfaces in the exterior and interior environment.|$|E

The flat section (underside) would be {{referred}} to as a <b>soffit.</b> In this example the <b>soffit</b> is fixed to the slope of the rafters. The fascias form the outer edge and have a groove in them to receive the <b>soffit</b> lining sheets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Soffit</b> {{exposure}} profile (from wall to fascia) on a building's {{exterior can}} vary from a few centimetres (2-3 inches) to 3 feet or more, depending on construction. It can be non-ventilated or ventilated for cooling non livable attic space. A grill that covers the venting opening {{on the bottom of}} the <b>soffit</b> is called a <b>soffit</b> vent. A <b>soffit</b> joist is also a related piece.|$|R

25|$|Copper {{cladding}} is used {{in building}} exteriors and indoor environments. On building exteriors, copper cladding sheets, shingles, and pre-fabricated panels shield buildings from the elements, acting as first line of defenses against wind, dust, and water. The cladding is lightweight, durable, and corrosion resistant, which is particularly important for large buildings. Common interior applications include lobby walls, <b>soffits,</b> column facings, and interior walls of elevator cabs.|$|E
25|$|Chemically induced patina. Architects {{sometimes}} {{request a}} particular patina color at installation. Factory-applied chemically induced pre-patination systems {{can produce a}} wide range of colored finishes similar to natural patination. Pre-patinated copper is particularly useful in repairs when there is need to provide close color matches to old copper roofs. Pre-patination is also considered in some modern building materials, such as vertical cladding, <b>soffits,</b> and gutters where patination is desired but would not ordinarily occur.|$|E
25|$|It is, {{however, the}} large extent (6,500m2) of the {{impressive}} glass mosaics covering the interior which make this church so splendid. With {{the exception of}} a high dado, made of marble slabs with bands of mosaic between them, the whole interior surface of the walls, including <b>soffits</b> and jambs of all the arches, is covered with minute mosaic-pictures in bright colors on a gold ground. The mosaic pictures are arranged in tiers, divided by horizontal and vertical bands. In parts of the choir there are five of these tiers of subjects or single figures one above another.|$|E

50|$|The {{underside}} of the eaves may be filled with a horizontal <b>soffit</b> fixed {{at right angles to}} the wall, the <b>soffit</b> may be decorative but it also has the function of sealing the gap between the rafters from vermin and weather.|$|R
5000|$|Specifically, used to {{describe}} the horizontal [...] "fascia board" [...] which caps the end of rafters outside a building, which can be used to hold the rain gutter. The finished surface below the fascia and rafters is called the <b>soffit</b> or eave. A <b>soffit</b> is also often installed between the ceiling and the top of wall cabinets in a kitchen, set at a 90 degree angle to the horizontal <b>soffit</b> which projects out from the wall.|$|R
25|$|As {{the walls}} {{carrying}} these vaults were also built in concrete with occasional bond courses of brick, the whole structure was homogeneous. One {{of the important}} ingredients of the mortar was a volcanic deposit found near Rome, known as pozzolana, which, when the concrete had set, not only made the concrete as solid as the rock itself, but {{to a certain extent}} neutralized the thrust of the vaults, which formed shells equivalent to that of a metal lid; the Romans, however, do not seem to have recognized the value of this pozzolana mixture, for they otherwise provided amply for the counteracting of any thrust which might exist by the erection of cross walls and buttresses. In the tepidaria of the Thermae and in the basilica of Constantine, in order to bring the thrust well within the walls, the main barrel vault of the hall was brought forward on each side and rested on detached columns, which constituted the principal architectural decoration. In cases where the cross vaults intersecting were not of the same span as those of the main vault, the arches were either stilted so that their <b>soffits</b> might be of the same height, or they formed smaller intersections in {{the lower part of the}} vault; in both of these cases, however, the intersections or groins were twisted, for which it was very difficult to form a centering, and, moreover, they were of disagreeable effect: though every attempt was made to mask this in the decoration of the vault by panels and reliefs modelled in stucco.|$|E
2500|$|Architect John Williams of Process Creative Studios of Cleveland {{oversaw the}} {{renovation}} of the rotunda and the Swetland Building's first floor into Heinen's. A number of items were salvaged from the bank rotunda and retained or repurposed during the conversion to a grocery store. [...] In the basement, the four vaults were repurposed into a nightclub, and the iron gate which closed off the vault areas used as the main entrance to the bar. The former main vault became the Bourbon Room, which was decorated with disused safe deposit box covers and keys as well as gears from vault doors. On the second floor, the intricate bronze railing was retained, and the cast terrazzo cloakroom counter was repurposed {{for use by the}} wine shop. The marble teller's counters on the first floor were repurposed as circular tables for the café and wine shop. The marble tiles on the second floor, which at some point had been covered with carpeting, were rediscovered and reused as well. Other architectural elements were restored to close to their original beauty. The bronze brackets and coffers on the first floor had been covered, and <b>soffits</b> added to the second floor ceiling in 1972 to accommodate new HVAC ducts. The <b>soffits</b> lowered the ceiling a full , obscuring the windows. The brackets and coffers were uncovered and restored, and the <b>soffits</b> and ductwork removed. The marble cladding on the rotunda columns and the original first floor flooring were also retained. Also retained was the bronze Cleveland Trust Company seal embedded in the floor of the ground level.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] Heinen's Fine Foods {{grocery store}} {{occupied}} the building's {{first and second}} floors. On the first floor are service counters and cold storage units for serving fish, meat, poultry, and prepared food. Although standard rectilinear food service units were used, they were embedded in curvilinear counters to help them {{blend in with the}} rotunda's architecture. The counters are made of Caesarstone (a man-made material which mimics granite) and trimmed with walnut and stainless steel. Modern high-pressure HVAC systems are concealed from view behind walls or in <b>soffits.</b> The center of the rotunda serves as a dining area, and is occupied by small tables with chairs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} his {{activity}} in Rome, Domenichino {{decided to leave the}} city in 1631 to take up the most prestigious, and very lucrative, commission in Naples, the decoration of the Cappella del Tesoro di San Gennaro of the Naples Cathedral. [...] His Scenes from the Life of San Gennaro occupied him {{for the rest of his}} life. He painted four large lunettes, four pendentives, and twelve scenes in the <b>soffits</b> of the arches, all in fresco, plus three large altarpieces in oil on copper. [...] He died, perhaps by poison at the hands of the jealous Cabal of Naples, before completing the fourth altarpiece or the cupola, which was subsequently frescoed by Lanfranco.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hip roof}} is clad in asphalt {{shingles}} while the wooden <b>soffits</b> have been covered with aluminum, {{another of the}} alterations through the years. The original structure featured doors and windows that have since been bricked over and altered. From east to west on the original south elevation was a [...] by [...] doorway, four windows, a doorway, another door, and two windows. The north and west facades had two windows and the south elevation another large doorway. In 1978 Pierce Construction of Lena was hired to completely or partially brick over all doors and windows on the building. A new windowed, wooden door was installed in a new opening on the east facade of the Electric Plant.|$|E
30|$|Gas {{temperatures}} {{were reduced}} between 12 and 13 minutes due to explosive spalling of the <b>soffit</b> {{of the floor}} slab. The spalling of the slab’s <b>soffit</b> was extensive and reduced {{the severity of the}} fire throughout the test and exposed the bottom reinforcing bars. Spalling was explosive and likely exacerbated by high in-plane compressive stresses in the slab caused by restraint to thermal expansion.|$|R
40|$|To prevent {{insulation}} from {{blocking the}} <b>soffit</b> vents {{and to provide}} attic ventilation channels between the <b>soffit</b> vents and the attic, insulation baffles are used. Rectangular channels spaced and sized to fit, connecting a number of flat panels make up the construction of ventilation baffles. The channels are generally secured to {{the tops of the}} rafters in a building construction before placing the sheathing over the rafters...|$|R
50|$|In popular use, <b>soffit</b> {{most often}} {{refers to the}} {{material}} forming a ceiling {{from the top of}} an exterior house wall to {{the outer edge of the}} roof, i.e., bridging the gap between a home's siding and the roofline, otherwise known as the eaves. When so constructed, the <b>soffit</b> material is typically screwed or nailed to rafters known as lookout rafters or lookouts for short.|$|R
2500|$|For {{the larger}} of the two bridges in the city, Green's Bridge, Smith {{designed}} almost a true copy of [...] Bridge of Tiberius (...) in Rimini, as described by Andrea Palladio's (1508–1580) in I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura (1570) (The Four Books of Architecture). Built with rubble limestone, Smith's design incorporated five elliptical arches with cut-limestone Gibbs surrounds and dressed squared limestone <b>soffits.</b> With three central arches and two smaller arches it is decorated with pedimented aedicules and doric columns. It has tooled limestone ashlar triangular cut-waters. [...] Renovated with two random rubble limestone parapets with coping were added in 1835. As well as the five arches there is also a pair of elliptical arches over culvert (one blocked-up with concrete block infill).|$|E
2500|$|These {{conditions}} were alleviated by accommodating personnel in Nissen huts and Iris huts installed in chambers dug out {{to match their}} dimensions ( [...] and [...] spans respectively). The problem of rockfalls was alleviated to some extent by using arched <b>soffits</b> in all tunnels of over [...] in span. Some of the chambers were of a truly huge size; the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers' vehicle maintenance workshop was housed in a giant chamber spanning [...] with a height of [...] and a length of [...] More conventional chambers generally had a span of [...] to [...] and a length of [...] to , with a small section of tunnel called the [...] "back drive" [...] left open at the rear to connect each chamber to the next and facilitate the circulation of air. Without this, tunnels that were pure cul-de-sacs became unbearably damp. They were built in groups called [...] "systems" [...] which would each accommodate particular functions such as laundry, stores, accommodation and so on.|$|E
60|$|It will {{be noticed}} that 2, 5, 6, and 8 are {{sculptured}} on the <b>soffits</b> {{as well as}} the faces; 9 is the common profile of arches decorated only with colored marble, the facestone being colored, the soffit white. The effect of such a moulding is seen in the small windows at the right hand of Fig. XXVI. Vol. II.|$|E

5000|$|Once the {{structure}} has hardened, the formwork can be removed. The surface is smooth in correspondence of the <b>soffit.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is highly horizontal; the canopy's inclusion as a <b>soffit</b> across the facade {{and the banks}} of windows help emphasize this design.|$|R
60|$|The {{custom of}} decorating the arch soffit with {{panelling}} is a Roman {{application of the}} Greek roof ornament, which, whatever its intrinsic merit (compare Chap. XXIX. § IV.), may rationally be applied to waggon vaults, as of St. Peter's, and to arch <b>soffits</b> under which one walks. But the Renaissance architects had not wit enough to reflect that people usually do not walk through windows.|$|E
60|$|The Court of Justice: {{the walls}} are hung with stamped grey velvet: above the hangings the wall is red, and gilt symbolical figures bear up the roof, which is made of red beams with grey <b>soffits</b> and moulding: a canopy of white satin flowered with gold is set for the Duchess: below it a long bench with red cloth for the Judges: below that a table for the clerks of the court. Two {{soldiers}} stand {{on each side of}} the canopy, and two soldiers guard the door; the citizens have some of them collected in the Court; others are coming in greeting one another; two tipstaffs in violet keep order with long white wands.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXXIV. All hope {{is taken}} away by our first glance; for it falls {{on a range of}} shafts whose bases are {{concealed}} by wooden panelling, and which sustain arches decorated in the most approved style of Renaissance upholstery, with stucco roses in squares under the <b>soffits,</b> and egg and arrow mouldings on the architraves, gilded, on a ground of spotty black and green, with a small pink-faced and black-eyed cherub on every keystone; the rest of the church being for the most part concealed either by dirty hangings, or dirtier whitewash, or dim pictures on warped and wasting canvas; all vulgar, vain, and foul. Yet let us not turn back, for {{in the shadow of the}} apse our more careful glance shows us a Greek Madonna, pictured on a field of gold; and we feel giddy at the first step we make on the pavement, for it, also, is of Greek mosaic waved like the sea, and dyed like a dove's neck.|$|E
