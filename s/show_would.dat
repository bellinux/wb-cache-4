5|$|During the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, NBC Universal's {{decision}} {{to release the}} Season 2 DVD with only the 15 produced episodes and comments by NBC chief Ben Silverman led to speculation that the <b>show</b> <b>would</b> be canceled.|$|E
5|$|The show {{returned}} in September 2012. However, RTÉ announced in October 2012 that the <b>show</b> <b>would</b> be revamped in early 2013. In November 2012, media reports {{indicated that this}} revamp would involve The Frontline being axed and replaced with Prime Time: Debate, and that the new <b>show</b> <b>would</b> be similar to The Frontline but under the Prime Time branding.

5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the <b>show</b> <b>would</b> revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new <b>show</b> <b>would</b> also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E

The staff planned on switching it to a format that would emphasize comedy more than the game and feature a host other than Philbin, but in the end, the primetime show was canceled, with its final episode airing on June 27, 2002.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{numerous}} stand-alone sketches and songs, the show also had many recurring items.
