5|$|There are {{a number}} of common threads found in criticisms of the flag of {{convenience}} system. One is that these flag states have insufficient regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced. Another is that, in many cases, the flag state cannot identify a <b>shipowner,</b> much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions. As a result of this lack of flag state control, flags of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment for conducting criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.|$|E
5|$|A {{golf course}} was {{constructed}} alongside the castle in 1900, and the estate was later sold to Sir Arthur Sutherland, a wealthy <b>shipowner,</b> in 1919. Sutherland opened an additional {{course at the}} castle in 1922, designed by the Scottish golfer, James Braid. The costs of maintaining the property became {{too much for him}} and, after undertaking eight years of clearance work in the 1920s, he placed the castle into the guardianship of the state in 1930, with the Commissioners of Works taking control of the property. Archaeological investigations were carried out as part of the clearance work by H. Honeyman in 1929, exposing more of the main gatehouse, and further work was carried out under Robert Bosanquet in the 1930s. Aerial photography was carried out by Walter de Aitchison for the Ordnance Survey.|$|E
5|$|In 1675, {{after the}} victory at Fehrbellin and the Brandenburg-Prussian advance in Swedish Pomerania during the Scanian War, Frederick William decided to {{establish}} a navy. He engaged Dutch merchant and <b>shipowner</b> Benjamin Raule as his advisor, who after a first personal meeting with Frederick William in 1675 settled in Brandenburg in 1676 and became the major figure of Brandenburg-Prussia's emerging naval and colonial enterprise. The Brandenburg-Prussian navy was established from ten ships which Frederick William leased from Raule, and achieved first successes {{in the war against}} Sweden supporting the siege of Stralsund and Stettin and the invasion of Rügen. In Pillau (now Baltiysk) on the East Prussian coast, Raule established shipyards and enlarged the port facilities.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the junta}} fell in 1974, the {{successive}} democratic government generally maintained the deregulation of Greek-based shipping, and many <b>shipowners</b> have maintained commercial operations there since. [...] Today, however, {{as a result}} of traffic congestion plaguing the Athens area, and the fact that most <b>shipowners</b> reside in the lavish northern suburbs of Athens, many <b>shipowners</b> have opted once again to move their bases away from Piraeus to Northern Athens.|$|R
5|$|In 1839 Samuel Cunard, a Prince Edward Island <b>shipowner,</b> {{was awarded}} the first British transatlantic {{steamship}} mail contract, {{and the next year}} formed the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company together with Robert Napier, the famous Scottish steamship engine designer and builder, to operate the line's four pioneer paddle steamers on the Liverpool–Halifax–Boston route. For most of the next 30 years, Cunard held the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic voyage. However, in the 1870s Cunard fell behind its rivals, the White Star Line and the Inman Line. To meet this competition, in 1879 the firm was reorganised as the Cunard Steamship Company, Ltd, to raise capital.|$|E
5|$|A new route was {{launched}} by Bømlo Mayor Malvin Meling, who proposed a pontoon bridge which would cross Stokksundet. He {{was inspired by}} the plans to build what would become the Nordhordland Bridge north of Bergen. In 1973, the municipal councils of Bømlo, Stord and Fitjar decided to launch a planning process, which concluded that a pontoon bridge between Sørstokken and Foldrøyholmen would be optimal. The report also considered bridges across the Fitjar Archipelago and a crossing via Spissøy and Føyno. There were protests from Wichmann Motorfabrikk who were concerned about their operations if the sound was closed for shipping traffic. Similar protests also came from the shipping industry, who wished to continue using Stokksundet; the protests were not remedied by the plans including a suspension bridge across Foldrøysundet. To illustrate their point, one <b>shipowner</b> let two of his ships cross in the middle of Foldrøysundet. The shipping industry received support from Norwegian Coastal Administration and the plans were abandoned in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Although popular legends {{claim that}} Sable Island horses swam ashore from the island's many shipwrecks, or were {{introduced}} by 16th-century Portuguese explorers, {{this is not}} supported by historical or genetic evidence. In reality, the horses were deliberately introduced to the island during the 18th century. The first recorded horses were brought by a Boston clergyman, the Reverend Andrew Le Mercier, in 1737 but most were stolen by passing mariners. The present-day horses are thought by most historians and scientists to have descended mostly from horses seized by the British from the Acadians during the Expulsion of the Acadians. The Acadian horses were descendents of several shipments of French horses, including members of the Breton, Andalusian and Norman breeds, later crossed with horses from New England, including Spanish Barbs. The Boston merchant and <b>shipowner</b> Thomas Hancock purchased some Acadian horses and transported them to Sable Island in 1760, where they grazed the island as pasture. Although {{often referred to as}} ponies due to their small size, they have a horse phenotype and an ancestry composed solely of horses.|$|E

40|$|As the European Commission muscled in the {{national}} configuration and domestic actors engaged with the EU institutions, {{the purpose of this}} dissertation is to explore the impact of Europeanisation on the state corporatist arrangement encompassing the Greek state and the <b>shipowners.</b> The central argument is that although there is evidence of the reshaping of the relations between the state and Greek <b>shipowners,</b> the direction of change varies across industry segments and is contingent on four conditions. Firstly, it is contingent {{on the nature of the}} Greek state and its ability to exercise 'integrated leadership'. Secondly, the domestic actors recognise and act upon the incongruence between EU initiatives and existing domestic or international policies. Thirdly, the <b>shipowners</b> possess the capacity to exit the domestic configuration through capital mobility. Fourthly, alongside the <b>shipowners,</b> the presence of influential formal or factual veto points in the domestic institutional arrangement. The argument made is sustained through the analysis of the impact of Europeanisation on the relations between the Greek state and <b>shipowners</b> in two case studies. The first case study is devoted to ocean-going shipping and the growing EU competence in maritime safety regulation, concentrating on the accelerated phasing- out of single-hull tankers and the constitution of criminal sanctions for ship-source pollution. The Greek ocean-going <b>shipowners</b> in consultation with the incumbent Greek governments mobilized at every possible level to halt or amend the EU initiatives. As a result, there is evidence of the reinforcement of state corporatism which is contingent on the unitary nature of the Greek state, the absence of integrated leadership, the incompatibility between EU and international policies, the capital mobility and ensuing structural power of ocean-going <b>shipowners</b> and the weakness of the other formal or factual veto points in the domestic political process. The second case study concentrates on the coastal shipping sector and EU measures to abolish the cabotage trades across the member states. The coastal <b>shipowners,</b> the incumbent Greek governments and the island communities engaged politically with the EU institutions in advancing their interests. In this instance, there is evidence of the loosening of the state corporatist arrangement between the Greek state and the coastal <b>shipowners.</b> In spite of the unitary nature of the state, the lack of 'integrated leadership' and the incongmence between the EU and domestic policies, the coastal <b>shipowners</b> were more embedded at {{the national}} level and contended with an influential factual veto point in the form of the island communities...|$|R
5|$|In 1924, the Director of the National Museum of Wales, William Evans Hoyle, {{resigned}} amid ill health. Wheeler {{applied to}} take on the role of his replacement, providing supportive testimonials from Charles Reed Peers, Robert Bosanquet, and H. J. Fleure. Although he had no prior museum experience, he was successful in his application and was appointed Director. He then employed a close friend, Cyril Fox, {{to take on}} the vacated position of Keeper of Archaeology. Wheeler's proposed reforms included extending the institution's reach and influence throughout Wales by building affiliations with regional museums, and focusing on fundraising to finance the completion of the new museum premises. He obtained a £21,367 donation from the wealthy <b>shipowner</b> William Reardon Smith and appointed Smith to be the museum's treasurer, and also travelled to Whitehall, London, where he successfully urged the British Treasury to provide further funding for the museum. As a result, construction on the museum's new building was able to continue, and it was officially opened by King George V in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The airline {{was founded}} by <b>shipowner</b> Ludvig G. Braathen and {{initially}} flew to destinations in Asia. The original fleet consisted of Douglas aircraft; these were first used for long-haul flights, but were gradually shifted for use in medium- and short-haul charter services. The airline started domestic services in 1954, with all its scheduled routes flown domestically until 1987. However, it continued to fly charter services from both Norway and Sweden, mostly to the Mediterranean. For Norwegian routes, Braathens first used a fleet of Herons, which were replaced with the Fokker F27 from 1958. The airline became the launch customer of the Fokker F28 in 1969 and also took delivery of Boeing 737-200 aircraft. The jet aircraft were at first used for charter, but later also for domestic services. All later deliveries would consist of Boeing aircraft, and after 1977 Braathens operated only jets. Between 1986 and 1989 the airline operated only the 737-200. By 1994, {{they had all been}} replaced with 737-400 and -500. Braathens entered the Swedish internal market in 1997 by purchasing Transwede and Malmö Aviation. This gave the airline a wider range of aircraft, including the 737-700, Fokker 100 and BAe 146. The losses suffered under a price war with Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Color Air in 1998 and 1999 caused the airline to be taken over by the SAS Group in 2001. Braathens and SAS Norway merged to form SAS Braathens in 2004.|$|E
