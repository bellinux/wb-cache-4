50|$|The {{magnetosphere}} guides cosmic ray {{and solar}} energetic particles to polar latitudes, while high energy charged particles enter the mesosphere, stratosphere and troposphere. These energetic particles {{at the top}} of the atmosphere shatter atmospheric atoms and molecules, creating harmful lower energy particles that penetrate deep into the atmosphere and create measurable radiation. All aircraft flying above 8 km (26,200 feet) altitude are exposed to these particles. The dose exposure is greater in polar regions than at mid-latitude and equatorial regions. Many commercial aircraft fly over the polar region. When a <b>space</b> <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> causes radiation exposure to exceed the safe level set by aviation authorities, the aircraft's flight path is diverted.|$|E
50|$|The {{exposure}} {{of a human}} body to ionizing radiation has the same harmful effects whether {{the source of the}} radiation is a medical X-ray machine, a nuclear power plant or radiation in space. The degree of the harmful effect depends on the length of exposure and the radiation's energy density. The ever-present radiation belts extend down to the altitude of manned spacecraft such as the International Space Station (ISS) and the Space Shuttle, but the amount of exposure is within the acceptable lifetime exposure limit under normal conditions. During a major <b>space</b> <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> that includes an SEP burst, the flux can increase by orders of magnitude. Areas within ISS provide shielding that can keep the total dose within safe limits. For the Space Shuttle, such an event would have required immediate mission termination.|$|E
50|$|The {{ionosphere}} bends {{radio waves}} {{in the same manner}} that water in a swimming pool bends visible light. When the medium through which such waves travel is disturbed, the light image or radio information is distorted and can become unrecognizable. The degree of distortion (scintillation) of a radio wave by the ionosphere depends on the signal frequency. Radio signals in the VHF band (30 to 300 MHz) can be distorted beyond recognition by a disturbed ionosphere. Radio signals in the UHF band (300 MHz to 3 GHz) transit a disturbed ionosphere, but a receiver {{may not be able to}} keep locked to the carrier frequency. GPS uses signals at 1575.42 MHz (L1) and 1227.6 MHz (L2) that can be distorted by a disturbed ionosphere. Space weather events that corrupt GPS signals can significantly impact society. For example, the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) operated by the US Federal Aviation Administration is used as a navigation tool for North American commercial aviation. It is disabled by every major <b>space</b> <b>weather</b> <b>event.</b> Outages can range from minutes to days. Major space weather events can push the disturbed polar ionosphere 10° to 30° of latitude toward the equator and can cause large ionospheric gradients (changes in density over distance of hundreds of km) at mid and low latitude. Both of these factors can distort GPS signals.|$|E

Five days prior to the earthquake, strong negative deviation (as high as 70 %) in the foF 2 values is observed.

40|$|Temporal {{and spatial}} {{gradients}} in the ionosphere can cause major threats on communication and navigation satellite systems, because {{the propagation of}} transionospheric radio signals {{is influenced by the}} ionospheric electron content. <b>Space</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> are often the source of strong ionospheric disturbances. Forecasting ionospheric perturbations related to <b>space</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> is therefore a crucial task being of special interest for GNSS users. The climatology of ionospheric storms seen in the Total Electron Content (TEC) over Europe as a response of the ionosphere towards Earth oriented <b>space</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> is well known. It depends on season, elapsed time from event arrival, location and local time. However, the deviation of a single storm to the mean behavior can be large. A good correlation between strength of the ionospheric storm, i. e. the maximum deviation of the TEC to 27 day median, to solar wind or geomagnetic activity indices is hard to define. Hence forecasting TEC for disturbed conditions is a challenging task. However, the storm climatology and comprehensive correlation studies allow forecasting of the most probable TEC perturbation amplitude for the European region. GNSS users are in need of information about arriving threads due to <b>space</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> as early as possible. Therefore, an Early Warning message for GNSS users has been developed at the DLR within the FP 7 -Project AFFECTS.

In this paper extreme value theory (EVT) is used to investigate the probability of extreme solar flares. Previous work has assumed that the distribution of solar flares follows a power law. However such an approach can lead to a poor estimation of the return times of such events due to uncertainties in the tails of the probability distribution function. Using EVT and GOES X-ray flux data it is shown that the expected 150 -year return level is approximately an X 60 flare whilst a Carrington-like flare is a one in a 100 -year event.

30|$|Electric {{fields are}} {{generated}} in the ground during large space weather events primarily due to the induction effects of a changing magnetic field within a conductive medium (i.e. the subsurface). During geomagnetic variations, geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) can flow in certain types of grounded systems such as long pipelines and electrical distribution systems. These currents are usually harmless but high-voltage power systems can be vulnerable to GIC flow if they offer a low-resistance path for the currents compared to the ground itself (Boteler et al. 2013; Pirjola 2005; Viljanen and Pirjola 1994). The social and economic impacts of an extreme <b>space</b> <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> could potentially be very large if were to cause damage to power transmission networks (c.f.

The use of networked microcontrollers and GPS timing is applicable to other small instruments for field or local deployment, and an onboard data logging capability has also been demonstrated. We illustrate the value of the placement of low-cost magnetometers to increase coverage in an area through the study of a Pc 5 pulsation event which took place on September 4, 2010. By combining results with those from auroral zone magnetometers supporting the THEMIS project, we find that the phase velocity of these morning sector pulsations was northward on the ground. The event took place under very quiet solar wind conditions, and credible mapping associates it with the inner magnetosphere. Another aspect beyond increasing areal coverage is increasing density of coverage, which becomes feasible with instruments of very low cost.

When we compared the CME properties between the two SSN peaks, we find that more energetic CMEs occurred during the 2012 peak. In particular, we find that CMEs accompanying IP type II bursts had an average speed of 1543 km/s during the 2012 peak compared to 1201 km/s during the 2014 peak. This result is consistent with the reduction in the average speed of the general population of CMEs during the second peak. All SEP events were associated with the interplanetary type II bursts, which are better than halo CMEs as indicators of <b>space</b> <b>weather.</b> The comparison between the two peaks also revealed the discordant behavior between the CME rate and SSN was more pronounced during the second peak. None of the 14 disk-center halo CMEs was associated with a major storm in 2014.

In particular, we find that CMEs accompanying IP type II bursts had an average speed of 1543 km/s during the 2012 peak compared to 1201 km/s during the 2014 peak. This result is consistent with the reduction in the average speed of the general population of CMEs during the second peak. All SEP events were associated with the interplanetary type II bursts, which are better than halo CMEs as indicators of <b>space</b> <b>weather.</b> The comparison between the two peaks also revealed that the discordant behavior between the CME rate and SSN was more pronounced during the second peak. None of the 14 disk-center halo CMEs was associated with a major storm in 2014. The lone major storm in 2014 was due to the intensification of the (southward) magnetic field in the associated magnetic cloud by a shock that caught up and propagated into the magnetic cloud.

40|$|This paper proposes two novel {{solar sail}} {{concepts}} for <b>space</b> <b>weather</b> forecasting: heliocentric Earth-following orbits and Sun-Earth line confined solar sail manifolds. The first exploits a solar sail acceleration to rotate {{the argument of}} perihelion such that aphelion, where extended observations can take place, is always located along the Sun-Earth line. The second concept exploits a solar sail acceleration to keep the unstable, sunward manifolds of a solar sail Halo orbit around a sub-L 1 point close to the Sun-Earth line. By travelling upstream of <b>space</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events,</b> these manifolds then allow early warnings for such events. The orbital dynamics involved with both concepts will be investigated and the observation conditions {{in terms of the}} time spent within a predefined surveillance zone are evaluated. All analyses are carried out for current sail technology (i. e. Sunjammer sail performance) to make the proposed concepts feasible in the near-term. The heliocentric Earth-following orbits show a reasonable increase in useful observation time over inertially fixed, Keplerian orbits, while the manifold concept enables {{a significant increase in the}} warning time for <b>space</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> compared to existing satellites at the classical L 1 point...|$|R
