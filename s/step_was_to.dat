5|$|The next <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> take an oral {{examination}} and to diagnose a patient. After {{less than two}} weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, {{at the age of}} 28. During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, Peter Artedi. Before their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, the survivor would finish the other's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam, and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; the next logical <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> build a telescope that could look at {{all parts of the}} sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
50|$|Lippincott Mercer {{has come}} up with four {{principles}} of experience design. The beginning <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> identify key customer data and feedback. The next <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> figure out your target audience and figure out what will have the greatest impact on consumers. The third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> turn the findings into project priorities. The final <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> apply the strategy and monitor the purchases.|$|R
50|$|Three <b>steps</b> <b>are</b> taken <b>to</b> <b>be</b> water positive: The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> measure 100% of {{the water}} {{consumption}} throughout the value chain, the second <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reduce to a minimum the water usage needed and the third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> compensate more water than the process has used.|$|R
40|$|The {{enterprise}} is the mainbody {{of the construction}} of harmonious society. The pivot to construct the harmonious society <b>is</b> <b>to</b> increase the moral investment. The moral investment should be operational and it can be done in three steps. The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> form the moral view. The second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make the decision on morality. The last <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> grip the moral carrier...|$|R
5|$|Marshall and Nichols began {{assembling}} the resources they would need. The first <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> obtain {{a high priority}} rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although {{there was also a}} special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose. Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Rubinstein's first <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{found the}} Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. Its {{objectives}} were {{to educate people}} in music, cultivate their musical tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives. The first priority of the RMS acted was to expose to the public the music of native composers. In addition to {{a considerable amount of}} Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.|$|E
5|$|The next <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> broach {{the matter}} with the Canadians. The Lord President, Sir John Anderson, as the {{minister}} responsible for Tube Alloys, wrote to the British High Commissioner to Canada, Malcolm MacDonald, who {{had been involved in}} Tube Alloys negotiations with Canada regarding Eldorado's uranium mine at Port Radium and its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario. On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal. The following day he took them to see C. D. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supply.|$|E
50|$|To achieve those objectives, {{the first}} <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} {{credibility with the}} media as an information source. The next <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> control {{the flow of information}} to the media so that the right message gets out. The third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> develop a message that supports the clientâ€™s position and get that message out to the media and the public (Fitzpatrick, 1996, Haggerty, 2003, Reber, Gower, & Robinson, 2006).|$|R
30|$|This {{optimization}} {{problem can be}} solved by a two-step method: the first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> determine the directions of the two precoding matrices, and the second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> allocate the power in each direction.|$|R
30|$|The {{proof is}} divided into two steps. The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> show the {{persistence}} in mean of the previous m species. The second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> show the extinction of the following n-m species.|$|R
5|$|When {{it became}} clear to Tiberius that support for Sejanus was not as strong as the emperor had feared, his next <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> choose Naevius Sutorius Macro, {{previously}} prefect of the vigiles (Roman police and fire department), to replace Sejanus and effect his downfall. On October 18, AD 31, Sejanus was summoned to a Senate meeting by a letter from Tiberius, ostensibly to bestow the tribunician powers upon him. At dawn, he entered the Senate; but while the letter was being read, Macro assumed control of the Praetorian Guard and members of the vigiles led by Graecinius Laco surrounded the building. The senators at first congratulated Sejanus but when the letter, which first digressed into completely unrelated matters, suddenly denounced him and ordered his arrest, he was immediately surrounded and escorted to prison.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the war in August 1945, the Manhattan Project's {{priority}} {{shifted from}} speed to economy and efficiency. By early 1946, with K-27 in operation, the K-25 plant was producing 3.6kg per day, enriched to 30 percent. The next <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> increase the enrichment further to 60 percent. This was achieved on 20 July 1946. This presented a problem, because Y-12 was not equipped to handle feed that was so highly enriched, but the Los Alamos Laboratory required 95 percent. For a time, product was mixed with feed to reduce the enrichment to 30 percent. Taking the concentration up to 95 percent raised a number of safety concerns, as there was the risk of a criticality accident.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 {{passage of}} the Moore {{amendment}} expanded the state's Nicholson local option law to apply to all liquor license applicants within a local township or city ward. The next <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> seek countywide prohibition. The IASL appealed to the general public, holding large rallies in Indianapolis and elsewhere, to support a county option law that would provide a more restrictive ban on alcohol. In September 1908 Indiana governor J. Frank Hanly, a Methodist, Republican, and teetotaler, called for a special legislative session to establish a county option that would allow county voters to prohibit alcohol sales throughout their county. The state legislature passed the bill with only a narrow margin. By November 1909 seventy of Indiana's ninety-two counties were dry. In 1911 a Democratic legislative majority replaced the county option with the Proctor law, a less-geographically restrictive local option, {{and the number of}} dry counties was reduced to twenty-six. Despite the setback prohibition advocates continued to lobby legislators for support. In December 1917 several temperance organizations formed the Indiana Dry Federation to fight the politically powerful liquor interests, with the IASL joining the group a short time later. The Federation and the League vigorously campaigned for statewide prohibition, which the Indiana General Assembly adopted in February 1917. Subsequent legal challenges delayed implementation of statewide prohibition until 1918, when a court ruled in June that Indiana's prohibition law was constitutionally valid.|$|E
30|$|Aim of this keynote <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{develop a}} {{framework}} {{how to approach}} the design of pension policies as rationally as possible. The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> realize and accommodate endogenous adjustments. The second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> align {{the root causes of}} demographic change with corresponding reform steps which include but are not confined by pension reform. The third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> separate the issues as best as possible to strengthen the political feasibility of reform.|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{creation}} measuring instruments and program for controlling model hydropower plant intended for laboratory use. The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> improve the mechanical performance of the original model of hydroelectric power. The second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> select a revive measuring instruments for electric values of the plant. The third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> create a program for displaying electrical parameters and control the plant. The final <b>step</b> <b>was</b> re-measuring the operating characteristics of the generator model hydropower plant...|$|R

25|$|Munroe {{figured that}} the best way to make pencils was by {{starting}} with a quarter inch slab of cedar wood. He then would cut the slots for his special formula graphite paste and fill them. He would let the paste air dry. The next <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> glue an eighth inch veneer of wood over the slots. The final <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick.|$|E
25|$|Kitab al-Shamil is a {{book that}} went unpublished, but it gives insight into his view of {{medicine}} and human relations. His surgical technique had three stages. Step one was to give the patient information on how {{it was to be}} performed and the knowledge it was based on. The second <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> perform the surgery itself. The final <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have a post-surgery appointment and a routine of checkups. There is also a description of a surgeon's responsibility when working with nurses, patients, or other surgeons.|$|E
25|$|Another {{institutional}} shift {{occurred in}} 1993 when a World Bank water sector review suggested {{to bring in}} a private company to run the water and sanitation system of Amman, a move that was endorsed by the government. An important motivation for this <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> increase cost recovery.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first step}} in the PARE spin {{recovery}} sequence <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reduce power to idle. The second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> neutralize the ailerons (and retract the flaps, if deployed). The third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> apply and hold full rudder in the opposite direction of the spin rotation. The fourth <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> displace the elevator control toward its neutral position (forward movement when recovering from an upright spin; aft movement when recovering from an inverted spin).|$|R
30|$|We will {{divide the}} proof into two steps. The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> show the {{permanence}} of the top m species of system (1.2). The second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> show the extinction for the bottom n-m species of system (1.2).|$|R
40|$|There is an {{argument}} by M. Dummett about the relative priority of language as a social phenomenon. The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> explain how the speaker and the hearer {{have to know the}} same language, ceteris paribus. The second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> show how the speakerâ€™s idiosyncratic beliefs depend on his knowledge of common language; the last <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> appeal to Quineâ€™s principle of translation between languages {{in order to have a}} language at all...|$|R
25|$|Daimler's and Maybach's next <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{install the}} engine {{in a test}} bed to prove the {{viability}} of their engine in a vehicle.

25|$|The first <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> secure {{retirement}} benefits for custodians throughout the state. In 1928, {{just a year}} after CSEA formed, the union helped push through SB 551, which allowed school districts to establish {{retirement benefits}} for all school employees, not just teachers. More importantly, it became the first law on the books recognizing school employees other than teachers and administrators.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Dix {{helped raise}} funds for the {{national}} monument to deceased soldiers at Fortress Monroe. Following the war, she resumed her crusade to improve the care of prisoners, the disabled, and the mentally ill.

30|$|The feature {{detection}} method in SIFT involves two steps [8]. The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> calculate the Difference of Gaussian {{of the image}} and find local extremes in scale space. This <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> detect all possible keypoints that bear blob-like patterns. The second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> calculate the Hessian matrix at each keypoint location from step one and reject those keypoints if their Hessian matrices have two significantly different eigenvalues. Essentially this operation excludes the keypoints detected on edges.|$|R
30|$|The {{proof is}} rather technical, {{so we will}} divide it into two steps. The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> show the {{exponential}} extinction of species i when Ïƒ_i^ 2 > 2 b_i. The second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> show the extinction {{in the case of}} Ïƒ_i^ 2 = 2 b_i.|$|R
