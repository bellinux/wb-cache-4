25|$|The hall retains {{more of its}} {{original}} neoclassical decorative features than many other rooms in the house; the walls' plasterwork panels and ceiling are all original, as are the <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany</b> doors (these had been removed during the 1920s, but were {{returned to the house}} in 1954). Only the white marble fireplace is not original to the house, but salvaged from the now demolished Panton Hall. The furniture in the room, against the walls in 18th-century fashion, is in the style of William Kent.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the finest}} {{room in the}} vessels was the first class dining saloon, over 10 feet (3.05 m) high and {{measuring}} 98 feet (30 m) long by 63 feet (19.2 m) wide. Over {{the central part of}} this room was a well that rose through three decks to a skylight. It was done in a style described as [...] "modified Italian style", with a coffered ceiling in white and gold, supported by ionic pillars. The panelled walls were done in <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany,</b> inlaid with ivory and richly carved with pilasters and decorations.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{hardwoods}} {{currently used}} for exterior shutters, specifically <b>Spanish</b> cedar, Honduran <b>mahogany</b> and teak, {{are resistant to}} rot and decay, and far more durable than a softer wood like untreated pine. Because of the tannin in these woods they are also not prone to problems from insects. Pressure treatment with wood preservative makes pine, cedar {{and other types of}} wood suitable for exterior shutters. Non-functional exterior shutters can be constructed from wood, vinyl, fiberglass or other synthetic materials. Non-functional shutters can be simply screwed or bolted directly to the building, with spacers or other hardware to prevent water accumulating against the wall. Fiberglass, a material widely used for boat hulls, is not prone to rotting or twisting, is dimensionally stable and has low expansion and contraction. It is a reinforced plastic, unlike vinyl or PVC, so fiberglass shutters do not have a tendency to warp or sag. Its strength is comparable to aluminum; however, it does not suffer from corrosion and electrolysis.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Come, come, Tom," [...] {{said the}} old gentleman, [...] "that's {{not the way to}} address solid <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany.</b> Damme, you couldn't treat me with less respect if I was veneered." [...] When the old gentleman said this, he looked so fierce that Tom began to grow frightened.|$|E
60|$|Then the mouldy gigs and chaise-carts reappear; {{and with}} them come spring-vans and waggons, and an army of porters with knots. All day long, the men with carpet caps are {{screwing}} at screw-drivers and bed-winches, or staggering by the dozen together on the staircase under heavy burdens, or upheaving perfect rocks of <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany,</b> best rose-wood, or plate-glass, into the gigs and chaise-carts, vans and waggons. All sorts of vehicles of burden are in attendance, from a tilted waggon to a wheelbarrow. Poor Paul's little bedstead is carried off in a donkey-tandem. For nearly a whole week, the Capital Modern Household Furniture, & c., is in course of removal.|$|E
60|$|Then {{there is}} a {{palisade}} of tables made in the best drawing-room; and on the capital, french-polished, extending, telescopic range of <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany</b> dining-tables with turned legs, the pulpit of the Auctioneer is erected; and the herds of shabby vampires, Jew and Christian, the strangers fluffy and snuffy, and the stout men with the napless hats, congregate about it and sit upon everything within reach, mantel-pieces included, and begin to bid. Hot, humming, and dusty are the rooms all day; and--high above the heat, hum, and dust--the head and shoulders, voice and hammer, of the Auctioneer, are ever at work. The men in the carpet caps get flustered and vicious with tumbling the Lots about, and still the Lots are going, going, gone; still coming on. Sometimes there is joking and a general roar. This lasts all day and three days following. The Capital Modern Household Furniture, &c., is on sale.|$|E
6000|$|... "On Thursday night, the 3rd inst. [February, 1820], {{the body}} being wrapped in an {{exterior}} fold of white satin, {{was placed in}} the inside coffin, which was composed of mahogany, pillowed and ornamented in the customary manner with white satin.... This was enclosed in a leaden coffin, again enclosed in another mahogany coffin, and the whole finally placed in the state coffin of <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany,</b> covered with the richest Genoa velvet of royal purple, a few shades deeper in tint than Garter blue. The lid was divided into three compartments by double rows of silver-gilt nails, and in the compartment at the head, over a rich star of the Order of the Garter was placed the Royal Arms of England, beautifully executed in dead Gold.... In the lower compartment at the feet was the British Lion Rampant, regardant, supporting a shield with the letters G. R. surrounded with the garter and motto of the same order in dead gold.... The handles were of silver, richly gilt of a massive modern pattern, and the most exquisite workmanship."--Ibid., p. 126.] ...|$|E
60|$|As this fair matron {{sat beside}} the fire, she glanced {{occasionally}} {{with all the}} pride of ownership, about the room; which was a large apartment, such as one may see in country places, with a low roof and a sunken flooring, all downhill from the door, and a descent of two steps on the inside so exquisitely unexpected, that strangers, despite the most elaborate cautioning, usually dived in head first, as into a plunging-bath. It was none of your frivolous and preposterously bright bedrooms, where nobody can close an eye {{with any kind of}} propriety or decent regard to the association of ideas; but it was a good, dull, leaden, drowsy place, where every article of furniture reminded you that you came there to sleep, and that you were expected to go to sleep. There was no wakeful reflection of the fire there, as in your modern chambers, which upon the darkest nights have a watchful consciousness of French polish; the old <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany</b> winked at it now and then, as a dozing cat or dog might, nothing more. The very size and shape, and hopeless immovability of the bedstead, and wardrobe, and in a minor degree of even the chairs and tables, provoked sleep; they were plainly apoplectic and disposed to snore. There were no staring portraits to remonstrate with you for being lazy; no round-eyed birds upon the curtains, disgustingly wide awake, and insufferably prying. The thick neutral hangings, and the dark blinds, and the heavy heap of bed-clothes, were all designed to hold in sleep, and act as nonconductors to the day and getting up. Even the old stuffed fox upon the top of the wardrobe was devoid of any spark of vigilance, for his glass eye had fallen out, and he slumbered as he stood.|$|E

50|$|The interior, {{as well as}} {{containing}} memorials to the Brydges {{family and}} Percy Bysshe Shelley's brother, John, includes a two deck pulpit and box pews reputedly made from <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany</b> taken {{from one of the}} Armada fleet.|$|E
50|$|From {{the pencil}} cedar panel walls, 35-foot {{mahogany}} ceilings and doors, Astor adorned {{the room with}} <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany</b> paneling, carving, such as the Four Musketeers and decorations. Accoutrements of the room included marble floors, Persian rugs, chandeliers, and portraits of himself and his ancestors. Located by his desk in the library was a spinning wheel of New England.|$|E
50|$|The {{corridor}} {{also leads}} into the Council Chamber. This {{is where the}} Council meets formally, featuring <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany</b> panelling. There are seats {{for each of the}} 79 councillors, situated in a Hemicycle, all facing the Lord Provost (the Scottish equivalent of the lord mayor found in London and other cities), his Depute, and the chief executive, who are seated behind the mace. A public gallery looks down on the proceedings, and a small press gallery is located at the side.|$|E

50|$|The Great Hall {{extends the}} whole {{length of the}} {{building}} on the river front. The walls are panelled in pencil cedar and surmounted by a frieze in which fifty-four portraits of the heads of characters famous in history and fiction, have been modelled, carved in low relief and then gilded. These 54 portraits are by the sculptor Nathaniel Hitch. The Hall is 35 feet high to the ridge and open to a hammer-beam type roof, a notable example of modern Gothic timber work made from carved <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany.</b>|$|E
50|$|The organ {{was built}} in 1792 by George Pike England to replace the one by Richard Bridge, which he took in part exchange. The new organ had three manuals, toe pedals and a <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany</b> case. This, {{together}} with much of England's pipe work, still survives. The rococo detail is noteworthy, especially the carved drapery over the pipes. The organ was rebuilt by Noel Mander of Mander Organs in 1978, returning to the original style after some drastic alterations made in 1928. It now has 2 manuals and pedals and 22 speaking stops.|$|E

50|$|All Souls is {{well known}} for its musical {{tradition}} and part of this includes the Hunter organ installed in the west gallery in a <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany</b> case designed by Nash. The case was enlarged and extended in 1913. In 1940, anticipating war damage to the church, the instrument was dismantled and stored, then remodelled and rebuilt in 1951 with a new rotatable electric manual and pedal console situated in the chancel by the firm of Henry Willis (IV). The organ was again rebuilt, by Harrison & Harrison, during the building project of 1975-1976, when a four-manual console was added, plus a positive division and a pronounced fanfare-trumpet en-chamade.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander Taylor (May 17, 1853 [...] - [...] February 12, 1916) was a Canadian entrepreneur, {{inventor}} and politician. He {{is credited}} as {{being one of}} the founders of the city of Edmonton. Taylor was born in on May 17, 1853 in Ottawa, Ontario, and came to Edmonton in 1877. Shortly after his arrival in Edmonton, Taylor established the first telegraph, telephone, and electricity systems. Edmonton asked the Bell Telephone Company to provide services in 1883, but were just offered [...] "a few telephones" [...] and no telephone exchange at a great cost, Taylor, who, at the time was working for the Dominion Telegraph and Signal Service proposed running a telephone line from his office to St. Albert, which was 14 km away. He then purchased two telephones made of <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany,</b> and asked store owner Henry William McKenney of St. Albert to keep the device in St. Albert. On January 3, 1885 the two tested the line, the first on Northern Alberta. In 1891, Taylor co-founded Edmonton's first electric company, the Edmonton Electric Light Company. Taylor also co-founded Edmonton's first newspaper, the Edmonton Bulletin with Frank Oliver in 1880. Taylor also served on the Edmonton Public School Board from 1899 to 1909, and was the chairman of the board in 1907.|$|E
5000|$|The main public room, {{the grand}} saloon {{was in the}} {{forepart}} {{of the ship and}} described at the time as [...] "capable of dining the whole of the 340 cabin passengers." [...] "The ceiling decorations were almost exclusively confined to white and gold. The panels were of polished satinwood, the pilasters of walnut, with gilt capitals. The saloon measured 65 by 54 feet, and was 9 feet high in the lowest part. A central cupola of handsome design, 25 feet long and 15 feet wide, rose to a height of 20 feet, and gave abundant light and ventilation." [...] "The staterooms are large and well lighted and ventilated. Every facility for comfort is provided in the cabin. The ladies' drawing room is furnished in a costly manner, and is on the promenade deck. The latter extends nearly {{the entire length of the}} vessel. The wood work of the ladies' drawing room, the Captain's cabin, and the principal entrance to the saloons came from the State of Oregon. On the upper deck near the entrance of the grand saloon is the smoking room, which is paneled in <b>Spanish</b> <b>mahogany</b> and has a mosaic floor." [...] The Oregon was also the first ship to have installed dynamos [...] and incandescent electric lamps, supplied by the Edison Company, which were used in lighting the vessel. In 1884 the dynamos became badly damaged and were repaired by an engineer from the Edison Machine Works, Nikola Tesla, who had just transferred from Edison's European company. Tesla stayed up all night getting the dynamos back in order and received a compliment from Edison the next morning.|$|E
