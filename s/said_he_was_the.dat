25|$|Wilson {{was a man}} {{of great}} charm. Contemporaries {{described}} him as a “delightful whirlwind” and wrote that “there was something spectacular and theatrical about him”. Politicians enjoyed his levity, e.g referring to Haig as “Sir Haig” – Kiggell <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only general who could talk to the “Frocks” on level terms – as did the French, who called him “General Dooble-Vay”. Some senior British officers genuinely believed that his sympathy for the French amounted almost to treason.|$|E

Military jurist Frederick Bernays Wiener has observed that Ruckman's approval and execution of the death sentences were “entirely legal” and “in complete conformity” with the 1916 Articles of War.|$|E
25|$|As Ferdinand lay dying, his new wife, Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies had him {{set aside}} the Salic Law, which would make his brother Don Carlos {{heir to the throne}} instead of any female. Ferdinand was thus succeeded by his infant {{daughter}} Isabella II. Carlos revolted and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> legitimate king. Needing support, Maria Christina (as Regent for her daughter Isabella) turned to the liberals. She issued a decree of amnesty on 23 October 1833. Liberals who had been in exile returned and dominated Spanish politics for decades, and the Carlist Wars resulted.|$|E

25|$|Weekes had {{a classic}} batting style, possessed {{a variety of}} shots {{on both sides of}} the wicket, and is {{considered}} one of the hardest hitters in cricket history. Described by The Times as lightly bow-legged, with a wonderful eye, wrists the envy of any batsman, and feet always the right place to play a shot, Richie Benaud stated that many Australians who saw Weekes in action <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> closest batsman in style to the pre-World War II Donald Bradman. He was also compared to Bradman in his ability to keep the scoreboard moving and at using his feet to come down the pitch to slower bowlers. Additionally, Weekes was an excellent fielder, initially in the covers before moving into the slips, and produced a training manual entitled Aspects of Fielding.|$|E
25|$|The Calgary Flames {{acquired}} Warrener, {{along with}} Steve Reinprecht {{in exchange for}} Chris Drury and Steve Bégin on July 3, 2003. He appeared in 77 games in 2003–04, scoring three goals and 17 points, and appeared in his 500th NHL game on November 22, 2003, against the Chicago Blackhawks. He added an assist in 24 playoff games as the Flames reached the 2004 Stanley Cup Final. Warrener {{was considered one of}} the team's best defenders; head coach Darryl Sutter <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Flames' most underrated players and was influential in helping the team reach the playoffs {{for the first time in}} eight seasons. It was the third time he reached the final in his first season with a team, but he again fell short of winning the championship as the Flames were defeated for the Cup in seven games by the Tampa Bay Lightning.|$|E
25|$|David Ervine was the {{youngest}} of five children born to Walter and Elizabeth Ervine, and raised in a Protestant working-class area of east Belfast between the Albertbridge and Newtownards roads. His household was not loyalist at all, his father Walter described himself as a socialist, had no time for Ian Paisley and didn't attend church. When Ervine joined the Orange Order aged 18, he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first member of his family to ever be a member. His membership however didn't last long. Like many in his situation, he grew up closely identifying with his community and absorbed the Ulster Unionism ideals and opinions that go along with this identity. He left Orangefield High School at 14, and at the age of 19 Ervine joined the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), believing this to {{be the only way to}} ensure the defence of the Protestant community after the events of Bloody Friday. A neighbour of Ervine's who was a member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) William Irvine, had died in one of the bomb blasts on Bloody Friday.|$|E

25|$|Doug Wright {{was seen}} as England's trump card {{when he arrived in}} Australia, but he was either the unluckiest or the most over-rated spinner to tour Australia. Don Bradman <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best leg-spinner to tour Australia since Sydney Barnes 35 years before, and Keith Miller thought he was the best leg-spinner he knew after Bill O'Reilly. After Tich Freeman retired Wright became Kent's main spinner, taking 2,056 wickets (23.98) and a record seven first class hat-tricks. His long rollicking run up and brisk pace gave away many no-balls and too often he served up full tosses and long hops, but he turned the ball {{fiercely}} and his googly had even the best batsmen groping. His ability to run through a side made him the terror of the County circuit, but he rarely achieved this in Tests. In the Fifth Test at Sydney his 7/105 dismissed Australia for 253 and in 1947 his 10/175 in the Second Test gave England a 10 wicket victory over South Africa. His great asset was that he always looked as if he was about to take a wicket, but in Australia in 1946–47 and again in 1950–51 he proved too expensive and like Bedser was overbowled. Their second leg-spinner was Peter Smith, who was preferred to Eric Hollies because of his batting, but he injured a finger on the journey to Australia and had an appendix removed once there. Even so, he was effective in tour matches - his 9/121 against NSW is the best bowling return by an Englishman in Australia - but was understandably below par in his only Test. James Langridge was a veteran Slow Left Arm bowler who started his trade in 1924, and had taken 92 wickets (22.11) in 1946, but he was 41 years old on his first tour of Australia and just when he appeared to be finding his form he strained a muscle and could not play. Jack Ikin was a part-time leg-spinner whose bowling was thought to be of all round status early in his career (helped by the very poor wickets at Old Trafford), but Hammond used him rarely and he proved to be expensive in the Tests.|$|E
500|$|Not heavily {{recruited}} by major colleges, Pollard decided to attend Loyola University, {{now known as}} Loyola Marymount, where high school coach William H. Sargent would be coaching. His 1947 recruiting class {{was known as the}} [...] "Golden Boys", and the Los Angeles Times <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most glamorous of them. Injuries plagued his redshirt freshman campaign, and he dropped out of Loyola on February 18, 1949. This decision surprised Loyola officials; Pollard said he simply needed rest.|$|E

500|$|During {{this period}} Chatwin {{travelled}} extensively {{for his job}} and also for adventure. Travel offered him a relief from the British class system, which he found stifling. An admirer of Robert Byron and his book, The Road to Oxiana, he travelled twice to Afghanistan. He also used these trips to visit markets and shops where he would buy antiques which he would resell at a profit in order to supplement his income from Sotheby's. He became friends with artists and art collectors and dealers. One friend, Howard Hodgkin, painted Chatwin in The Japanese Screen (1962). Chatwin <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> [...] "acid green smear on the left." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholars have puzzled {{over the}} Green Knight's {{symbolism}} since {{the discovery of}} the poem. He could be a version of the Green Man, a mythological being connected with nature in medieval art, a Christian symbol, or the Devil himself. British medieval scholar C. S. Lewis said the character was [...] "as vivid and concrete as any image in literature" [...] and J. R. R. Tolkien <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> [...] "most difficult character" [...] to interpret in Sir Gawain. His major role in Arthurian literature is that of a judge and tester of knights, thus he is at once terrifying, friendly, and mysterious. He appears in only two other poems: The Greene Knight and King Arthur and King Cornwall. Scholars have attempted to connect him to other mythical characters, such as Jack in the green of English tradition and to Al-Khidr, but no definitive connection has yet been established.|$|E
500|$|Humphreys {{played the}} first match and scored twice. He then {{played in the}} second match against FC Utrecht and scored again. Johan Cruyff was the guest of honour for that match and he praised Humphreys and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> next Marco van Basten. It was during this pre season tour that he was taken under the wing and {{guidance}} of Wednesday legend Chris Waddle. After scoring 4 goals in his first 5 Premier League appearances, lifting Wednesday {{to the top of}} the league, David Pleat decided to release his mentor Waddle. Humphreys did not score another league goal all season (only notching a hat-trick in a League Cup match against Grimsby Town in a 7–1 win). Humphreys pre-season form earned him a full league debut in Wednesday's opening match against Aston Villa. In this match Humphreys scored a goal that was recorded at 95.9mph, one of the hardest-hit goals in the history of football. Humphreys also scored in the following match against Leeds United. Two matches later, Humphreys scored a much talked about goal when he went on a 50-yard run and scored a spectacular chipped goal against Leicester City [...] Humphreys was seen as the driving force behind Sheffield Wednesday's shock early lead at the top of The Premiership.|$|E
