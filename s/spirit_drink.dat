40|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} {{in the production of}} <b>spirit</b> <b>drinks</b> and using them in the human diet, especially in the Southeast European and Mediterranean regions. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether and which spirits can serve, and to what extent, as a source of biologically active compounds in the human diet. Polyphenolic compounds are biologically active compounds of fruits, vegetables and derived beverages, which have been implicated in their antioxidant activity. Therefore, the total polyphenol content (TPC) and antioxidative properties of 46 <b>spirit</b> <b>drinks</b> and liqueurs produced in Croatia were examined. The total polyphenol content and antioxidant activity were estimated using spectrophotometric methods (Folin-Ciocalteu, DPPH and FRAP), while certain phenols were detected by the HPLC. It was established that <b>spirit</b> <b>drinks</b> aged in wooden casks, such as wine or plum brandy, contain polyphenols ranging from 40 - 90 mg GAE/L (gallic acid equivalents), whereas walnut or sour cherry liquors contain much more polyphenols ranging from 680 - 3360 mg GAE/L. The antioxidant activity of analyzed <b>spirit</b> <b>drinks</b> was in correlation with TPC.

40|$|Two basic {{categories}} of the <b>spirit</b> <b>drink</b> Tequila can be distinguished according to Mexican law. For the high quality category "Tequila 100 % de Agave" only pure agave juice is allowed to be fermented and distilled. Otherwise, the product is a "Mixto-Tequila", which is manufactured by adding up to 49 % of sugar to the Agave wort. The sensory analysis using ranking methods showed significant differences between Tequila samples of both categories. The premium products with 100 % of Agave were preferred by the test panel. Especially matured products (reposado and añejo Tequilas) had a harmonically mellow aroma and were comparable to premium fruit spirits or whiskies. The worldwide trend leading to a preference of "Tequila 100 % de Agave" should be no longer ignored by the German market dominated so far by Mixto-products...|$|E
40|$|Cheap licit and artisanal illicit {{spirit drinks}} have been {{associated}} with numerous outbreaks of alcohol poisoning especially with methanol. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of cheap spirit drinks in Kibera slums in Nairobi County, Kenya. The samples consisted of cheap licit spirits (n = 11) and the artisanal <b>spirit</b> <b>drink,</b> ‘chang’aa’, (n = 28). The parameters of alcoholic strength and volatile composition were used as indicators of quality and were determined using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) respectively. The ranges for alcoholic strength were 42. 8 – 85. 8 % vol and 28. 3 – 56. 7 % vol for chang’aa and licit spirit drinks respectively, while the pH ranges were 3. 3 – 4. 2 and 4. 4 – 4. 8 for chang’aa and licit spirit drinks respectively. The majority of volatiles were found in artisanal spirits and they included higher alcohols, ethyl esters and carbonyl compounds. The alcoholic strength of all the artisanal spirits (100 %) and 91 % of the licit spirits was above the 40 % vol of standard spirits such as vodka. The high ethanol content of the alcohol products was the only element of public health significance in this study...|$|E
40|$|Love {{makes the}} world go round? Not at all. Whisky makes it go round twice as fast!" Compton Mackenzie wrote in the book - " Whisky Galore". Being famously called the "water of life", Scotch whisky has been the world's leading <b>spirit</b> <b>drink</b> and outsells every other noble spirit in world markets. Compared with the success in Europe, South Korea and Japan, Scotch whisky in China market {{is still very much}} in its infancy. But the world's largest market clearly {{provides}} huge potential, especially in the past two years. Data show, more Scotch whisky was exported to China {{in the first half of}} 2004 than the whole of 2003, with export value growing by over 170 %. The current situation in China spirits market is that Chivas Regal and Johnnie Walker take the major share, meanwhile, many other brands of Scotch sell in China with small volume. Furthermore, other whiskies, brandy, beer, and Chinese grain spirits compete aggressively with Scotch. Under such a background, the objective of this research is set to explore the marketing expansive strategies of Scotch whisky in China market from a challenger's perspective. According to the characteristics of this research, qualitative research method is chosen as well as the three main research tools: literature review, interviews, and analysis of selected cases. In the literature search, four original propositions about the marketing expansive strategies are formed. Based on the ideas, the author designed the semi-structured interviews with four senior managers working for alcoholic drinks industry. Combined with information from the external scanning and competitor analysis, we discuss data from interviews in-depth about China spirits market to examine the original ideas. Furthermore, some critical success factors are drawn from the case study of Chivas Regal. All this information can be used together to support the basic idea of this dissertation: marketing expansive strategy including growth strategy and marketing mix decisions is crucial for a product to succeed in the international marketplace. Notwithstanding the limitations, this research offers an extensive analysis on alcoholic spirits in China market. We formulate some business recommendations by applying the key findings of this research. These ideas are useful and helpful for those whisky firms that have the ambition to quickly expand its business in China market. Although this dissertation focuses on the analysis of alcoholic spirits, the main findings can be used in relevant industries such as fast moving consumer goods...|$|E
