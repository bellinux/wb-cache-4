In his will Henry's father <b>settled</b> 400 <b>marks</b> worth of land on the couple, but the main part of their income came from Margaret's estates. It appears from household accounts and personal letters that the marriage was happy. The couple lived for a while at Bourne Castle in Lincolnshire.|$|R
6000|$|Warrington {{was made}} judge, {{with a small}} salary, all of which he gave to the clergyman, the Rev. Mr. White. This was done {{because he had no}} need of the money himself, and there was no other {{provision}} for the parson than free contributions. John Woolston, who had read law, was named Attorney-General, or colony's Attorney, as the office was more modestly styled; to which duties he added those of surveyor-general. Charles received his salary, which was two hundred and fifty dollars, being in need of it. The question of salary, as respects the governor, was also <b>settled.</b> <b>Mark</b> had no occasion for the money, owning all the vessels, with most of the cargo of the Rancocus, as well as having brought out with him no less a sum than five thousand dollars, principally in change--halves, quarters, shillings and six-pences. Then a question might well arise, whether he did not own most of the stock; a large part of it was his beyond all dispute, though some doubts might exist as to the remainder. On this subject the governor came to a most wise decision. He was fully aware that nothing was more demoralizing to a people than to suffer them to get loose notions on the subject of property. Property of all kinds, he early determined, should be most rigidly respected, and a decision that he made shortly after his return from America, while acting in his capacity of chief magistrate, and before the new court went into regular operation, was of a character to show how he regarded this matter. The case was as follows:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Prebendal stalls, Fanny, don't {{generally}} go begging long among parish clergymen. How could I reconcile it to {{the duty}} I owe to my children to refuse such an increase to my income?" [...] And so it was settled that he should at once drive to Silverbridge and send off a message by telegraph, {{and that he should}} himself proceed to London on the following day. [...] "But you must see Lady Lufton first, of course," [...] said Fanny, as soon as all this was <b>settled.</b> <b>Mark</b> would have avoided this if he could have decently done so, but he felt that it would be impolitic, as well as indecent. And why should he be afraid to tell Lady Lufton that he hoped to receive this piece of promotion from the present Government? There was nothing disgraceful in a clergyman becoming a prebendary of Barchester. Lady Lufton herself had always been very civil to the prebendaries, and especially to little Dr. Burslem, the meagre little man who had just now paid the debt of nature. She had always been very fond of the chapter, and her original dislike to Bishop Proudie had been chiefly founded on his interference with the cathedral clergy,--on his interference, or on that of his wife or chaplain. Considering these things Mark Robarts tried to make himself believe that Lady Lufton would be delighted at his good fortune. But yet he did not believe it. She at any rate would revolt from the gift of the Greek of Chaldicotes. [...] "Oh, indeed," [...] she said, when the vicar had with some difficulty explained to her all the circumstances of the case. [...] "Well, I congratulate you, Mr. Robarts, on your powerful new patron." ...|$|R

5000|$|In the Neolithic period {{religious}} {{activity in}} the <b>settled</b> communities is <b>marked</b> by the building of ritual burial sites known as dolmens, from which food and personal items such as jewelry, spindle whorls, pottery, tools and animal bones have been excavated at La Hougue Bie (a ritual site used around 3500 BC). [...] These finds indicate that Neolithic settlers possibly believed in an afterlife much like many modern religions, the burial of the dead with their belongings showing similarities to the burial process in the Egyptian religion. However recent excavations at La Hougue Bie by archaeologist Mark Patton, together with consideration of solar alignments, suggest that the Jersey Dolmens functioned more as centres of worship like cathedrals or churches, where burials are incidental to the main function.|$|R

They sat down among the plants in the balcony, as far from the lamps as possible, and talked themselves into intimacy over Micklethwayte. There are two Eden homes in people's lives, one that of later childhood, the other the first of wedded happiness, and St. Ambrose Road had the same halo to both of these; for both had been uprooted from it against their will; the chief difference being that Ursula could cast longing, lingering looks behind, while Annaple held herself resolutely steeled against sentiment, and would only turn it off by something absurd. Nothing was absolutely <b>settled</b> yet; <b>Mark</b> had been presenting himself at offices, and she had been seeing rooms and lodgings.|$|R

5000|$|Garage Pass: Mark Garrow and Steve Richards (substitute) anchor this four-minute NASCAR news program. Garage Pass {{is heard}} on 450 {{stations}} across the USA. The program {{was created by}} Garrow in 1986 under the name [...] "Winston Cup USA" [...] and ran {{on a handful of}} stations for one year. In 1987, Garrow partnered with Capitol Sports Network in Raleigh, North Carolina to network and sell the program. The name was changed to [...] "Winston Cup Today" [...] and grew to approximately 480 stations at its peak. Richards produced the program, served as substitute host and covered the majority of the scheduled NASCAR events. Midway into the 1999 season the show was ended by Capitol Broadcasting when NASCAR demanded rights fees for the use of audio originating from the racetrack. In 2000, Garrow partnered with Performance Racing Network as the show was resurrected and renamed [...] "Garagepass" [...] as the rights fee issue was <b>settled.</b> 2011 <b>marked</b> the 25th year Mark Garrow has produced a daily NASCAR news program. Steve Richards, who began his radio career in 1977, has been covering the sport on a full-time basis for about 15 years, and before that on a part-time basis from 1985. He also covered Duke, NC State and University of North Carolina basketball and football from 1986 until the mid-nineties for WRAL-FM and the North Carolina News Network. Richards produced and anchored the scoreboard shows on the Duke and NC State football networks.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper a simple {{procedure}} to design PID controller with setpoint filter is proposed. Designing a PID controller to meet gain and phase margin specification is a well-known design technique. Several frequency response based tuning methods are available to achieve the requirement but higher value of overshoot is still a problem. Simple frequency response method (FR) is modified by considering the setpoint filter to minimize the peak overshoot. Even if the FR Method PID parameter calculation is simpler, it gives high peak overshoot. The set point filter coefficient {{is based on the}} zeroes of the controller. The performance of the closed loop system is analyzed by using the criterion IAE, ISE, peak overshoot and <b>settling</b> time. Bench <b>mark</b> system has been considered for analyzing the performance of the tuned parameter. The performance of proposed method is compared with simple frequency response method and Ziegler-Nichols method. The proposed procedure is valid for PI,PD and PID controller design. The method is applicable to any linear model structure with dead time process...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the futures}} {{contract}} specifies a trade {{taking place in}} the future, the purpose of the futures exchange is to act as intermediary and mitigate the risk of default by either party in the intervening period. For this reason, the futures exchange requires both parties to put up an initial amount of cash (performance bond), the margin. Margins, sometimes set {{as a percentage of the}} value of the futures contract, need to be proportionally maintained at all times during the life of the contract to underpin this mitigation because the price of the contract will vary in keeping with supply and demand and will change daily and thus one party or the other will theoretically be making or losing money. To mitigate risk and the possibility of default by either party, the product is marked to market on a daily basis whereby the difference between the prior agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is settled on a daily basis. This is sometimes known as the variation margin where the futures exchange will draw money out of the losing party's margin account and put it into the other party's thus ensuring that the correct daily loss or profit is reflected in the respective account. If the margin account goes below a certain value set by the Exchange, then a margin call is made and the account owner must replenish the margin account. This process is known as [...] "marking to market". Thus on the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the specified price on the contract but the spot value (i.e., the original value agreed upon, since any gain or loss has already been previously <b>settled</b> by <b>marking</b> to market). Upon marketing the strike price is often reached and creates lots of income for the [...] "caller".|$|R

He {{had not been able to}} confess these deeds, because others, who had now spoken, were concerned in them; but now it was a relief to be able to tell all to his Emma! The end of it was, that Emma herself was almost ready to press forward the marriage, so as to give him the means of clearing himself from the debts, which, as he insinuated, were the true cause of Colonel Martindale's accusations. He forgave him, however, though if all was known of his dealings with Arthur Martindale--!
