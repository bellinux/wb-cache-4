A model <b>screw</b> <b>plate</b> instrument was designed and developed and various plate geometries and plate advancement mechanisms were studied {{with a view to}} assessing soil disturbance during installation. <b>Screw</b> <b>plate</b> loading tests were conducted by means of a plate 50 mm in diameter 3 mm thick and 5 mm pitch. All the tests were conducted in a calibration chamber under stress controlled conditions on normally and overconsolidated saturated Leighton Buzzard sand along Ko and isotropic stress paths. Stress path triaxial tests were performed on normally and overconsolidated sand specimens. The stress-strain responses observed from such tests were compared with the pressure-settlement curves obtained from <b>screw</b> <b>plate</b> tests. The CRISP Finite Element Program was utilised to model the embedded plate and the chamber. Stress distributions and induced settlements beneath the plate were studied.

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the accuracy of}} lag screw placement between extracapsular femoral fractures fixed with sliding hip <b>screw</b> <b>plate</b> systems and those fixed with cephalocondylic nails. It involved 75 retrospective radiographs of fractures fixed with either a cephalocondylic nail (32) or a sliding hip <b>screw</b> <b>plate</b> system (43). Postoperative anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the hip were scanned using a digital X-ray scanner and measured using computer software. Measurements were conducted by two independent observers, and the radiographs were calibrated to correct for magnification. Accuracy of lag screw placement was determined by “tip apex distance,” described by Baumgaertner et al., and by the ratio method described by Parker. The mean tip apex distance was 24. 0  mm in sliding hip <b>screw</b> <b>plate</b> systems and 21. 1  mm in cephalocondylic nails. This {{was found to be}} statistically significant. Lag screw placement through cephalocondylic nails is more accurate and therefore has less chance of cut-out compared with sliding hip <b>screw</b> <b>plate</b> systems. There was no statistically significant difference using Parker’s ratio method because this method quantifies the direction of the screw rather than the depth of penetration...|$|E

Objectives: To study the efficacy of apical derotation of pedicular <b>screw</b> <b>plate</b> system in idiopathic scoliosis correction and evaluate the feasibility of the technique. Summary of Background Data: In the surgical treatment of idiopathic scoliosis, the standard technique of fixation currently utilized the linkage of the pedicle screws via rods. Alternatively the technique of apical correction of the deformity by sagittally contoured plates found to be a convenient and effective mean of deformity correction and rigid fixation. Material and Method: Twenty-five patients who were diagnosed as idiopathic scoliosis and underwent poste-rior spinal fusion and fixation with pedicle screws and plates were prospectively analysed. The parameters were compared between preoperative and postoperative by paired t-test. These parameters included Cobb angles, body height, shoulder height difference, coronal trunk balance, hump difference and vertebral rota-tion. Results: There was statistically significant difference between the pre-op and post-op parameters studied. Conclusion: The instrument can effectively correct the scoliosis of moderately severed deformity in 3 dimen-sions especially regarding the vertebral derotation and restoration of thoracic kyphosis...|$|E

40|$|SummaryIntramedullary nailing of {{proximal}} and distal quarter tibia fractures {{is known}} to be a challenging procedure due to the metaphyseal enlargement, the reduced contact between implant and cortex and fracture comminution. Therefore, some authors suggest preferring the use of plate internal fixation in the management of these challenging fractures. The purpose of this manuscript is to present and describe our technique of minimally invasive locking plate osteosynthesis in the treatment of extra-articular proximal and distal tibia fractures. Osteosynthesis was performed by means of a locking <b>screw</b> <b>plate</b> system which construct characteristics usually allow immediate weight-bearing and early functional mobilization. This minimally invasive surgical procedure advantageously combines the principles of closed fixation with construct stability...|$|E

Forty-nine patients with 50 fractures underwent surgical treatment; 66 % were type C fractures. The mean follow-up was 26 months. According to the scores of Gartland and Werley and Green and O'Brien, 92 % and 68 % respectively had an excellent or good outcome; 46 % were radiologically identical to the uninjured side and in 42 % the reduction remained unchanged after 2 years.

30|$|Information {{regarding}} gender, age, year of injury, {{mechanism of}} injury, injury severity score (ISS), fracture side, state of skin/soft tissue injury [6], site of fracture along the tibial shaft and method of fixation were abstracted {{from the data}} base. For {{the purpose of this}} study, mechanism of injury was subdivided into twisting, fall, direct blow, crushing injury, vehicle accident, bicycle accident, motorcycle accident, and pedestrian vs motor vehicle accident. The site of fracture was classified as being in the proximal, middle or distal third of the tibial diaphysis. When the fracture crossed 2 zones, it was entered as such. Extensive fractures were those that crossed all 3 zones. Methods of surgical fixation were classified into intramedullary (IM) nailing (dynamic locking nail, static locking nail, unlocked nail) and non-IM nailing (<b>screw,</b> <b>plate,</b> external fixator) methods. The choice of fixation was based on the pattern of fracture, the soft tissue involvement, and the general condition of the patient before and after the injury as well as surgeon’s preference. The mean lengths of hospital stays of patients with and without ACS were also compared.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE:This {{study is}} aimed to {{determine}} whether the Traumax dynamic hip screw reduces perioperative blood loss and transfusion rate compared to the Gamma nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS:A series of 331 patients were followed prospectively in a cohort study between February 2008 and October 2011 after a pertrochanteric fracture. Two types of fixation were used, 163 patients were treated with a Gamma nail and 168 patients with a minimally invasive <b>screw</b> <b>plate</b> Traumax. Perioperative blood loss, evaluated by the Mercuriali formula based on pre- and postoperative haemoglobin and transfusion rates were compared in order to assess risk factors. RESULTS:Increased perioperative blood loss was significantly linked with patient-related parameters (age, anticoagulant and platelet aggregation inhibitor treatment). Type of osteosynthesis and type of fracture were also risk factors for blood loss and transfusion. The Traumax group had significantly lower blood loss (347 ml vs. 577 ml) and transfusion rate (33. 9 % vs. 63. 8 %) than the Gamma group. Involvement of the greater trochanter increased the risk of blood loss only in the Gamma group. Functional results and bone healing were comparable at six months follow-up. CONCLUSION:Screw plate Traumax significantly reduces perioperative bleeding after pertrochanteric fractures. It avoids fracture gaps that tend to maintain bleeding. Given the morbidity and complications related to acute anaemia and blood transfusion, the surgical management of these elderly patients is aided by this choice of fixation...|$|E

Methods: Twenty two patients underwent multilevel anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Fifteen patients underwent two level fusion and 7 patients underwent three level fusion; for a total 51 levels. Seventeen patients with cervical radiculopathy and three with radiculomyelopathy. Cervical lordosis and cervical fusion status was assessed on X- ray; and 20 patients also underwent computerized tomography (CT) to assess the results of surgery. Results: All the patients were followed clinically and radiologically with a mean of 24 months postoperatively (range 18 - 26 months). Radiculopathy improved after surgery in all the patients where's myelopathy resolved in three patients. The fusion rate was 96. 1 % in two level fusion and 93. 3 % in three level fusion In two patients fusion was incomplete but reoperation was not required at the end of follow up period. No cage migration or cage failure occurred. Conclusion: ACDF using carbon fibre cage packed with DBM is a safe and efficient method for treatment of multilevel cervical disc disease and spondylosis.

40|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} of bone is a congenital skeletal disorder {{characterized by}} proliferation of spindle cells inside an intramedullary collagenous stroma and by formation of metaplastic bone. An aneurysmal bone cyst is a lesion of unknown etiology. Macroscopically it appears like a blood-filled cavity that expands the affected bone. Histologically, fibrous septa are bordered by macrophages, giant cells, inflammatory cells, {{and areas of}} bone production. Hemorrhagic areas can rise into fibrous dysplasia. The lesion appears as an aggressive and destructive process {{that is difficult to}} diagnose properly. A 29 -year-old woman presented with a 2 -year history of left inguinal and lumbar pain. She reported increased pain after physical activity. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left femur (without intravenous gadolinium) showed a mass extending 14 cm along the femoral metaphysis. This lesion involved cortical bone that was broken in the posteromedial site. Computed tomography confirmed the osteostructural lytic alteration that "blows up" the proximal femur metaphysis. A trochar biopsy allowed the diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst on fibrous dysplasia, excluding malignancy. The lesion was treated with curettage and local adjuvants and filled with bone grafts. Internal fixation with a sliding <b>screw</b> <b>plate</b> was also performed. Radiographs at 1 year postoperatively showed good consolidation of the grafts and absence of local recurrence.

It is a big bone, and the {{difficulty}} of the reconstruction of tibia is importance to repair it. The fibular bone is a good provider for repairing the tibia defects. Generally, the repair was planned be a free vascularized flap. The most important disadvantage is the low calibration. In early age in particular, the original thickness of the tibia is reached after the surgery with a good follow-up process and rehabilitation. In this case; a 22 -year-old female patient had a multi-part post-traumatic fracture of the left tibia and was administered to our plastic surgery inpatient clinic.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Failure of {{a dynamic}} hip screw (DHS) {{fixation}} leads to decreased mobility {{of the patient}} and frequently to a decrease in general health. The most common mode of failure of a DHS is {{cut out of the}} lag screw from the femoral head. The second most common mode of failure is lift-off of the plate from the femur. The aim of this laboratory-based experimental study was to determine whether a DHS secured to an osteoporotic femur with a locking <b>screw</b> <b>plate</b> would provide a stronger construct than the standard DHS plate. METHOD: The standard DHS design was compared to a DHS with fixed angle locking screws holding the DHS plate to the femur. Standard dynamic compression plates (DCP) and locking compression plates (LCP) were attached to synthetic, osteoporotic bone. A load was applied to replicate the forces occurring following the fixation of unstable, intertrochanteric hip fractures. A bracket on the proximal end of the plate replicated the lag screw in the femoral head. The constructs were cyclically loaded by a screw-driven material-testing machine and the number of cycles before failure occurred was determined. RESULTS: The mean number of cycles to failure for the locking plate construct was 2. 6 times greater than for the standard screw construct (285 versus 108 cycles, respectively p= 0. 016). CONCLUSION: A dynamic hip screw with fixed angle locking screws would reduce the risk of DHS failure. A locking screw DHS would be particularly useful in patients with osteoporotic bone, and in patients with less stable fracture configurations...|$|E
40|$|Osteogenesis is {{the process}} of bone tissue forming, i. e. bone or callus regeneration. This process is {{influenced}} by many factors, and the degree of bone fragments’ stability and vascularization in the fracture area are the basic local factors which determine the nature of reparative process. Regenerative process of all bone structures increases with increasing of blood supply. The distal lower leg has its specific biomechanical features, and {{plays an important role in}} the transfer of body weight to foot. The distal part of tibia has a small diameter, which as a consequence has reduced diameter in medullar cave. Through this anatomic feature, the medullar network in the lower tibia part is also reduced. As for anatomic aspect, vascularization in the lower end of tibia is poor. It primarily depends on periosteal vascularization, because medullar vascularization is reduced. Fasciae, tendons and skin cover the lower part of the leg, and there is no muscle mass. These tissues have poor vascular network and that is why the extraosseous blood circulation in tibia is poor, and does not participate in the osteogenesis process. For these reasons, distal lower leg represents a predelection site for delayed osteogenesis and pseudoarthrosys development. Osteosynthesis causes secondary damage to bone and soft tissue circulation. The <b>screw</b> <b>plate</b> damages the periosteal circulation – in the lower part of tibia it is the main source of vascularization, and for this reason, this method of osteosynthesis should not be applied. The external fixator has a sparing role regarding vascularization, and that is the reason why this method is recommended for fracture stabilization at the level of distal lower leg...|$|E
