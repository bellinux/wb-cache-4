40|$|There are two {{objectives}} in this research. The first {{objective is to}} produce the high quality of medium density <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> from waste biomass material, oil palm frond mixed with waste LDPE composites {{at the same time}} reducing the percentages of urea formaldehyde resin. The second objective is to characterize the physical and mechanical properties of <b>fibre</b> <b>board.</b> This research is very important to environment, {{it is one of the}} solution in order to reduce the emmission of toxic formaldehyde from MDF. Different composition are use in order to produce the high <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> in terms of strength and swelling effect. In industry, urea formaldehyde is use as a binder in <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> manufacturing. In this research, the waste LDPE composite is selected as a possible partial replacement for binder in order to reduce the emission of toxic formaldehyde. Based on this research, the high quality <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> <b>can</b> be produced which achieved the industrial requirement but strictly limited in its application...|$|R
50|$|A {{pulp mill}} is a {{manufacturing}} facility that converts wood chips or other plant fibre source into a thick <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> which <b>can</b> be shipped {{to a paper}} mill for further processing. Pulp can be manufactured using mechanical, semi-chemical or fully chemical methods (kraft and sulfite processes). The finished product may be either bleached or non-bleached, depending on the customer requirements.|$|R
50|$|Cement {{boards are}} mainly cement bonded {{particle}} <b>boards</b> and cement <b>fibre.</b> Cement bonded particle boards have treated wood flakes as reinforcement, whereas in cement <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> have cellulose <b>fibre,</b> {{which is a}} plant extract as reinforcement. Cement acts as binder in both the cases. The fire resistance properties of cement bonded blue particle <b>boards</b> and cement <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> are the same. In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded particle boards have higher capacity than cement <b>fibre</b> <b>boards.</b> Cement particle <b>boards</b> <b>can</b> be manufactured from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These boards are made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> are more used in decorative applications and can be manufactured from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness. <b>Fibre</b> <b>boards</b> are made in very thin layers, making it extremely difficult to manufacture high thickness boards. Many manufacturers use additives like mica, aluminium stearate and cenospheres {{in order to achieve}} certain board qualities. Typical cement fiber board is made of approximately 40-60% of cement, 20-30% of fillers, 8-10% of cellulose, 10-15% of mica. Other additives like above mentioned aluminium stearate and PVA are normally used in quantities less than 1%. Cenospheres are used only in low density boards with quantities between 10-15%. The actual recipe depends on available raw materials and other local factors.|$|R

50|$|In 1881 when Mousam Manufacturing Company {{purchased}} Leatheroid {{and moved}} its manufacturing equipment into nearby mill buildings adjacent {{to its own}} leatherboard mill in Kennebunk, Maine, it organized it as a separate company, the Leatheroid Manufacturing Company. Emery Andrews, S.B. Rogers, Stephen Moore, and Homer Rogers were board members and controlling stock holders in the Leatheroid Manufacturing Company {{as they were in}} Mousam Manufacturing Company. In 1891 the Mousam Manufacturing Company and the Leatheroid Manufacturing Company along with Harwood Manufacturing Company of Leominster, Massachusetts, the Towne Manufacturing Company of Boston, Massachusetts, and the Clegg and Fisher Mill at Lawrence, Massachusetts, were merged into a new company known as the Consolidated <b>Fibre</b> <b>Board</b> and Leatheroid Company. This consolidation was known as the National <b>Fibre</b> <b>Board</b> Company with Emery Andrews as president and the board of directors consisting of Charles H. Allen, Homer Rogers, J. A. Harwood, Stephen Moore, and W.C. Gogswell. In 1918 the National <b>Fibre</b> <b>Board</b> Company changed its name to Rogers Fibre Company. The officers of Rogers Fibre Company in 1920 were Elliott Rogers, Pres., Kennebunk, Me.; Louis Rogers, V-P; E. W. Freeman, Clerk, Portland, Me.; L. B.Rogers, Treas. & Gen. Mgr.; E. O. Hallberg, Asst. Treas. Boston, Mass. In 1930 the Leatheroid business of Rogers Fibre Company and its equipment were sold to the Delaware Hard Fibre Company. All usable equipment was removed from the Leatheroid operations in the Island and Dirigo buildings at Kennebunk, thus bringing an end to Leatheroid production in Kennebunk, Maine.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{technology}} {{based on}} processing of wet preserved hemp has been examined at the Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering Potsdam-Bornim (ATB) {{for many years}} now. At the usual harvest date in September, weather conditions are often detrimental to harvest of quality hemp straw in Europe. The harvest of hemp {{by means of a}} chopper followed by anaerobic storage is favourable for the farmer, because that typical weather risk can be avoided. Additional steps are the same as for ensiling. A pilot plant with a processing capacity of 300 kg per hour (dm) fibre material has been built up at the ATB and is tested at present. The whole plant material can be processed to final products such as insulation materials or <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> without any loss.

40|$|The ceramisation of wood <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> is an {{efficient}} route to produce high strength, wear resistant and corrosion resistant construction elements with low density for applications up to elevated temperatures. Carbonisation and siliconizing {{are the basic}} processes of the ceramic conversion at high temperatures. Materials and technological details are discussed. The templates based on natural fibres enable a large variety of ceramic structures. The chances of using technical wood <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> are demonstrated. The properties of wood-based silicon carbide ceramics are comparable with commercial available SiSiC. Decisive technological and economic advantages are a low-cost shaping process and an effective net shape machining of carbon pre-forms. The efforts are obvious reducible for finishing ceramic components. The processing route offers new outlooks concerning large dimensioned and complex shaped ceramic components especially for unique copies and small series. The manu facturing of prototypes is demonstrated with focus on optical applications. Anticipated application fields are highlighted...|$|R

The original section was built in 1900, and is a two-story, brick building; a third story was added in 1924. Around 1928, a three-story extension was constructed {{at the rear of}} the front wing. In 1954, a large barrel-roofed, metal bowstring truss wing was added. It was constructed for the production of building supplies and roofing paper, and then used for corrugated container manufacturing. The building is used as a warehouse.|$|R
50|$|As longboard design progressed, lighter {{balsa wood}} and glass <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> with {{directional}} fins (or skegs) allowed greater freedom of movement, whilst allowing better riders to adopt more exaggerated stances. Arms {{raised in the}} air, hands clasped behind head, signify control and balance and this became a hallmark move. Combined with the difficult 'Hang Five' and Hang Ten moves, when a rider positions at the front (or nose) of a board, a soul arch becomes a significantly more difficult trick, requiring a considerable level of skill and balance.|$|R
