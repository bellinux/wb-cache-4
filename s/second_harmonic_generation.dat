High intensities are required to induce non-linear optical processes such as two-photon fluorescence or <b>second</b> <b>harmonic</b> <b>generation.</b> In scanning multiphoton microscopes the high intensities are achieved by tightly focusing the light, and the image is obtained by stage- or beam-scanning the sample. In wide-field multiphoton microscopy the high intensities are best achieved using an optically amplified pulsed laser source to attain a large field of view (~100µm). The image in this case is obtained as a single frame with a CCD without the need of scanning, making the technique particularly useful to visualize dynamic processes simultaneously across the object of interest. With wide-field multiphoton microscopy the frame rate can be increased up to a 1000-fold compared to multiphoton scanning microscopy.|$|E

50|$|Surface <b>second</b> <b>harmonic</b> <b>generation</b> is {{a method}} for probing {{interfaces}} in atomic and molecular systems. In <b>second</b> <b>harmonic</b> <b>generation</b> (SHG), the light frequency is doubled, essentially converting two photons of the original beam of energy E into a single photon of energy 2E as it interacts with noncentrosymmetric media. Surface <b>second</b> <b>harmonic</b> <b>generation</b> is a special case of SHG where the second beam is generated because of a break of symmetry caused by an interface. Since centrosymmetric symmetry in centrosymmetric media is only disrupted in the first (occasionally second and third) atomic or molecular layer of a system, properties of the second harmonic signal then give us information about the surface atomic or molecular layers only. Surface SHG is possible even for materials which do not exhibit SHG in the bulk.|$|E
