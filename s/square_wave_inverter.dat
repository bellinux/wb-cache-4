The first stage is the power factor correction (PFC) stage, and the second is a single full-bridge (FB) inverter with LC filter. The latter stage performs function of a resonant circuit for lamp ignition and a current controlled low frequency <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter</b> for normal operation. Ignition is achieved at the resonant frequency of the LC filter when the FB converter is working as a resonant inverter. After ignition the converter operates as a LFSW inverter by controlling the FB to act alternately as a Buck converter supplying positive or negative current. While ignition occurs at the LC filter resonance (fo= 25 kHz), the Buck converter switching frequency (fsw= 200 kHz) is selected significantly higher to attenuate high frequency harmonics and avoid exciting acoustic resonance. Lamp stability is achieved by controlling the inductor current of the LC filter, and power mode control is achieved adjusting average current supplied by the PFC stage.

The word ‘inverter’ in the context of power-electronics denotes a class of power conversion (or power conditioning) circuits that operates from a DC voltage source or a DC current source and converts it into AC voltage or current. The ‘inverter’ does reverse of what AC-to-DC ‘converter’ does. Even though input to an inverter circuit is a DC source, it is common to have this DC derived from an AC source such as utility AC supply. Thus, for example, the primary source of input power may be utility AC voltage supply that is ‘converted’ to DC by an AC to DC converter and then ‘inverted’ back to AC using an inverter. Here, the final AC output may be of a different frequency and magnitude than the input AC of the utility supply. Power-electronics inverters vary in their types and applications. They are used in uninterruptable power supplies (UPSs), high voltage DC transmission, solar modules and induction heating. However, principle remains the same no matter what size the power inverter happens to be.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} thesis is to generate AC signal of varying amplitude and frequency from a constant DC source. The device {{which is used}} to obtain this kind of action is known as inverter. At present, the inverter is classified into three ways i. e. <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter,</b> modified sine wave inverter or quasi sine wave inverter and pure sine wave inverter. The first two classifications of inverter have seldom used and have very limited applications. Nowadays, the pure sine wave inverter is more demanding because of the requirement of high efficiency and reliability. On the contrary, it is more complex to implement. The main focus of this thesis is the implementation of space vector-pulse-width-modulation (SVPWM) {{which is one of the}} algorithm of different pulse-width-modulation techniques. It is applicable for three phase voltage-source- inverter for controlling induction and synchronous machine. In this technique, the reference vector of varying amplitude and direction continually revolve around the hexagon with a fixed sampling frequency generating a gate pulses for the 12 power switches used in neutral-point-converter. The space-vector-pulse-width-modulation is advantageous over carrier based pulse-width-modulation. The properties which are used to analyze the performance of different pulse width modulation methods are total harmonic distortion (THD) and the amplitude of fundamental component. Better utilization of DC bus voltage makes the space-vector-pulse-width-modulation better than the carrier based pulse-width-modulation.

To get the clear picture of voltage measurement at each output stage, the derivation of line-to-line voltages and line-to- neutral voltages are also taken into account along with the calculation of duty cycle of switches...|$|E
40|$|In {{terms of}} cost and {{maintenance}} the polyphase induction motor has advantages compared with its direct current counterpart, but {{the control of}} the output torque and speed is more involved. The advent of high power thyristors has allowed a new appraisal of the induction motor for variable speed drives (e. g. winches, cranes, and traction), and some of the well established, but inefficient methods (in terms of cost, control, and power consumption) have been given a new look. This thesis compares some of these methods of control, namely variable frequency, stator voltage, and rotor control and suggests a combination of stator voltage and rotor control to increase the versatility of the machine and to extend the torque/speed envelope of operation without the complexity of a fall inverter system. It is shown that the harmonics produced by a <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter</b> output can be reduced by increasing the number of pulses per half cycle output if the individual pulses have a given relationship. The influence of this harmonic reduction in the output of the inverter fed induction motor is investigated. An equivalent circuit is developed to represent the induction motor when fed with voltage waveforms of high harmonic content. This equivalent circuit is solved using a finite difference technique and is shown to give first order results with a variety of voltage waveforms. First order performance predictions are shown to be possible of an induction motor system, stator fed from a three phase alternating current supply via "back-to-back" pairs of thyristors using a simple chart method. The chart in this method gives a "derated" value of current available from the production of output torque, based on the uncontrolled theoretical performance of the motor and the given firing angle of the thyristors and the power factor of the motor at the given speed. The prediction of the performance of an induction motor with a thyristor direct current chopper in the rotor circuits in both the motoring and braking regions is achieved using the concept of an effective rotor resistance. The procedure for the calculation of this resistance from given parameters of known values is given, and the theoretical performance compared with that of an experimental system...|$|E

50|$|Although 'sharpness' {{is often}} judged on grid {{patterns}} of alternate {{black and white}} lines, it should strictly be measured using a sine-wave variation from black to white (a blurred version of the usual pattern). Where a <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> pattern is used (simple black and white lines) {{not only is there}} more risk of aliasing, but account must be taken {{of the fact that the}} fundamental component of a <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> is higher than the amplitude of the <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> itself (the harmonic components reduce the peak amplitude). A <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> test chart will therefore show optimistic results (better resolution of high spatial frequencies than is actually achieved).
