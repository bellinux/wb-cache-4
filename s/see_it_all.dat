500|$|Warner Bros. spent $100million {{marketing}} the film. Although Inception {{was not part}} of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of [...] "Christopher Nolan as a brand". Kroll declared that [...] "We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day." [...] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, [...] "You have this movie which {{is going to have a}} pretty big built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret. Chris [...] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> beforehand so everything that you do to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans." ...|$|E

[...] Sturgis was cremated and his ashes were buried in Compton Cemetery, near his country house in Surrey. [...] Henry James wrote to Sturgis's widow of her husband's [...] "beautiful, noble, {{stainless}} memory, without the shadow upon him, or {{the shadow of a}} shadow, of a single grossness or meanness or ugliness – the world's dust on the nature of thousands of men. Everything that was high and charming in him comes out as one holds on to him, and when I think of my friendship of so many years with him I <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> as fairness and felicity." ...|$|E

Frank Miller is doing Batman {{at the beginning of his}} career and I am doing Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond All Star Batman. But it could be the same character as far as I am concerned. That’s where they may have ended up." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his songwriting {{contributions}} {{were rejected}} from the band's previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time, Dickinson felt that his role within the band had diminished, as he [...] "just became the singer," [...] but felt renewed enthusiasm when Harris explained the concept to him; [...] "I thought, 'What a great idea! Brilliant!' And of course I was really chuffed, too, because he'd actually rung {{me to talk}} about it and ask me if I had any songs that might fit that sort of theme. I was like, 'Well, no, but give me a minute and I'll see what I can do.'" [...] Speaking about the record in later years, however, Dickinson remarked that [...] "we almost did [...] ", explaining that, [...] "it was only half a concept album. There was no attempt to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the way through, like we really should have done. Seventh Son... has no story. It's about good and evil, heaven and hell, but isn't every Iron Maiden record?" ...|$|E
