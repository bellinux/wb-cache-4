Firedrake adopts the domain-specific language for the finite element method of the FEniCS project, but with a pure Python runtime-only implementation centred on the composition of several existing and new abstractions for particular aspects of scientific computing. The result is a more complete separation of concerns which eases the incorporation of separate contributions from computer scientists, numerical analysts and application specialists. These contributions may add functionality, or improve performance. Firedrake benefits from automatically applying new optimisations. This includes factorising mixed function spaces, transforming and vectorising inner loops, and intrinsically <b>supporting</b> <b>block</b> matrix operations.

40|$|For greedy block sparse {{recovery}} {{where the}} sparsity level is unknown, we derive a stopping condition {{to stop the}} iteration process. Focused on the block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) algorithm, we model the energy of residual signals at each iteration from a probabilistic perspective. At the iteration when the last <b>supporting</b> <b>block</b> is detected, the resulting energy of residual signals is supposed to suffer an obvious decrease. Based on this, we stop the iteration process when the energy of residual signals is below a given threshold. Compared with other approaches, our derived condition works well for the BOMP recovery. What is more, we promote our approach to the interference cancellation based BOMP (ICBOMP) recovery in paper [1]. Simulation results show that our derived condition can save many unnecessary iterations {{and at the same}} time guarantees a favorable recovery accuracy, both for the BOMP and ICBOMP recoveries.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of the FWs, many of whom work in the construction industry, such actions serve to emphasize the marginality of their presence in Singapore.

Unlike skilled migrants, unskilled migrants do not have a long term place in Singapore’s economy. Their temporary work permits can be terminated during periods of economic downturn. Their living conditions are typically the most basic, living in overcrowded, squalid and unsafe premises that violate safety codes and land use laws, and that are located on the edge of Singapore’s built up area, often on industrial land, poorly served by public transportation. Even when facilities are of a good standard, the FWs are treated like inmates, with restrictions placed on the nature of their activities in and around dormitories.|$|E

30|$|The SIMON and SPECK {{families}} of block ciphers were proposed publicly by the NASA in 2013 [56]. The motivation {{of the design}} is the security requirement of sufficient flexibility in the new area of Internet of Things because all the tiny devices in heterogeneous networks will require adequate cryptography, and the most existing block ciphers with fixed block size are lack of flexibility on different application platforms. Both SIMON and SPECK have multiple instantiations, <b>supporting</b> <b>block</b> sizes of 32, 48, 64, 96, and 128 bits, and with up to three key sizes {{to go along with}} each block size. The author claimed that SPECK has the highest throughput in software compared with any block ciphers in the literature and SIMON have the best performance in hardware performance. Thus, to our purpose, we only focus on the features of the SPECK. In the design aspect, the SPECK round functions are based on the Feistel structures and S-boxes are not used so that a good balanced between linear diffusion and nonlinear confusion can be achieved.|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{applications}} such as databases with nonuniform field lengths, we introduce {{the concept of an}} elastic block cipher, a new approach to variable length block ciphers which incorporates fixed sized cipher components into a new network structure. Our scheme allows us to dynamically “stretch ” the supported block size of a block cipher up to a length double the original block size, while increasing the computational workload proportionally to the block size. We show that traditional attacks against an elastic block cipher are impractical if the original cipher is secure. In this paper we focus on differential and linear attacks. Specifically, we employ an elastic version of Rijndael <b>supporting</b> <b>block</b> sizes of 128 to 256 bits as an example, and show it is resistant to both differential and linear attacks. In particular, employing a different method than what is employed in Rijndael design, we show that the probability of any differential characteristic for the elastic version of Rijndael is ≤ 2 −(blocksize). We further prove that both linear and nonlinear attacks are computationally infeasible for any elastic block cipher if the original cipher is not subject to such an attack and involves a block size for which an exhaustive plaintext search is computationally infeasible (as is the case for Rijndael) ...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Medial open wedge tibial {{osteotomy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely accepted method of treatment for varus knee deformity in younger patient population. Its success depends on the quality of fixation and preservation of the outer cortex of the tibia. The aim of the study was to evaluate stress distribution in five numerically designed plate configurations which can be used in open wedge tibial osteotomy. Methods. The paper describes the 3 D numerical model of the tibia with 10 ° varus deformity correction obtained by an optical scanner ATOS. The simulation anticipated axial compressive loads of 700 N, 1 400 N and 2 100 N. We used a modification of the standard T-plate in all of the five tested models. Modalities were tested with and without a metal block, and with and without a stable angle fixation plates and screws. Software PAK was used in the analysis of stress distribution. Results. With exception for the standard T-plate configuration without the <b>supporting</b> <b>block,</b> the loads up to 1400 N did not result in critical stresses on the outer cortex of the tibia in the remaining four models. There is an objective risk of possible failure of the outer cortex and loss of correction at a load of 2100 N in all configurations. The plate model with the angle stable fixation and the supporting metal block showed the most optimal distribution of stresses on the plate-bone composite compared to other models. Conclusion. The standard T-plate configuration without supporting metal block is not sufficient to stabilize the open wedge osteotomy of the tibia. Numerical models of the angle stable T-plate and the supporting metal block achieved a favorable distribution of stresses on the bone and implant which require further biomechanical testing...|$|E
