40|$|The premotor cortex of macaque monkeys is {{currently}} subdivided into {{at least six}} different <b>subareas</b> {{on the basis of}} structural, hodological and physiological criteria. To determine the degree of divergence/convergence of thalamocortical projections to mesial [supplementary motor area (SMA) -proper and pre-SMA] and lateral (PMd-c, PMd-r, PMv-c and PMv-r) premotor (PM) <b>subareas,</b> quantitative analyses were performed on the distribution of retrograde labelling after multiple tracer injections in the same animal. The results demonstrate that all PM and SMA <b>subareas</b> receive common inputs from several thalamic nuclei, but the relative contribution of these nuclei to thalamocortical projections differs. The largest difference occurs between <b>subareas</b> of SMA, with much greater contribution from the mediodorsal (MD) and area X, and a smaller contribution from the ventral lateral anterior (VLa) and ventral part of the ventral lateral posterior (VLpv) to pre-SMA than to SMA-proper. In PM, differences between <b>subareas</b> are less pronounced; in particular, all receive a significant contribution from MD, the ventral anterior (VApc) and area X. However, there are clear gradients, such as increasing projections from MD to rostral, from VLa and VLpv to caudal, and from dorsal VLp (VLpd) to dorsal premotor <b>subareas.</b> Intralaminar nuclei provide widespread projections to all premotor <b>subareas.</b> The degree of overlap between thalamocortical projections varies among different PM and SMA <b>subareas</b> and different sectors of the thalamus. These variations, which correspond to different origin and topography of thalamocortical projections, are discussed in relation to functional organizations at thalamic and cortical levels...|$|R
40|$|Larval {{mosquito}} {{communities in}} rice fields were examined monthly for 2 years at 3 study areas (15 <b>subareas)</b> near Chiangmai, Thailand. the {{temporal and spatial}} variations of community structure were analyzed based on the similarity of species composition among mosquito communities. <b>Subareas</b> were grouped depending on the similarity of the species composition. A large cluster which was composed of several small groups of <b>subareas</b> supporting mosquito communities of a similar species composition was observed in the rainy season. In the <b>subareas</b> of the large cluster, 2 Japanese encephalitis (JE) vector mosquitoes, Culex vishnui THEOBALD and C. tritaeniorhynchus GILES, occupied more than 60 % of the mosquito communities, {{and a large number}} of JE vectors appeared from the rice fields. In the dry season, the large cluster of <b>subareas</b> disappeared and the species composition of the mosquito community varied greatly among the <b>subareas.</b> The successional change of mosquito colonization and an asynchronous cultivation of rice plants were suggested as important ecological factors related to the development of rice field mosquito communities...|$|R

2500|$|Mesoamerica can {{be divided}} into smaller {{linguistic}} subareas wherein linguistic diffusion has been especially intense, or where certain families have extended to become predominant. One such <b>subarea</b> would be the Maya area covering the Yucatán Peninsula, all of Guatemala and Belize, and parts of the states of Chiapas and Tabasco, where Mayan languages have been highly predominant. In Chiapas and on the Guatemalan Pacific coast, speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages were initially dominant, but with the spread of Mayan languages they were pushed out on the fringes of the areas, or into isolated pockets, and the same was the case for speakers of Xinca and Lenca which were probably also spoken in the area in the preclassic period. Another linguistic area is Oaxaca, which is dominated by speakers of Oto-Manguean languages; here Mixe–Zoque speakers were also gradually displaced by speakers of Zapotecan languages, as well as by speakers of Huave and Tequistlatecan languages. Oaxaca is the most linguistically diverse area of Mesoamerica and its [...] contain at least 100 mutually unintelligible linguistic variants. The <b>subarea</b> commonly called Central Mexico, covering valleys and mountainous areas surrounding the Valley of Mexico, originally contained mostly northern Oto-Manguean (Oto-Pamean) languages; however, beginning in the late classic these languages were gradually displaced by Nahuatl, which is now the predominant indigenous language of the area. The Western area was inhabited mostly by speakers of Purépecha and some Uto-Aztecan languages such as Huichol and Nahuatl. The Northern Rim area has been inhabited by semi-nomadic speakers of Uto-Aztecan languages (the Tepiman and Cora-Huichol groups) as well as Pamean (Oto-Mangue), and other languages that are now extinct. The Gulf area is traditionally the home of speakers of Totonacan languages in the northern and central area and Mixe–Zoque in the southern area. However, the northern gulf area became home to the speakers of Huastec in the preclassic period, and the southern area fell under Nahuan dominance in the post-classic period. The Central American area was originally inhabited by speakers of Misumalpan, Jicaquean and Chibchan languages which became subject to dominance and linguistic influence by Maya speaking groups in the classic period. Guerrero does not really constitute its own linguistic area; however, it has been influenced from the Oaxacan, Western or central Mexican area at different times of its history.|$|E
