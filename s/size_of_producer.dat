25|$|Pyramid {{structure}} {{can vary}} across ecosystems and across time. In some instances biomass pyramids can be inverted. This pattern is often identified in aquatic and coral reef ecosystems. The pattern of biomass inversion {{is attributed to}} different <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>producers.</b> Aquatic communities are often dominated by producers that are smaller than the consumers that have high growth rates. Aquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of secondary growth as exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, {{they are able to}} reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years. Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted. Energy pyramids, however, will always have an upright pyramid shape if all sources of food energy are included and this is dictated by the second law of thermodynamics.|$|R

40|$|Prey-dependent models, {{with the}} {{predation}} rate (per predator) {{a function of}} prey numbers alone, predict {{the existence of a}} trophic cascade. In a trophic cascade, the addition of a top predator to a two-level food chain to make a three-level food chain will lead to increases in the population <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the primary <b>producers,</b> and the addition of nutrients to three-level chains will lead to increases in the population numbers at only the first and third trophic levels. In contrast, ratio-dependent models, with the predation rate (per predator) dependent on the ratio of predator numbers to prey, predict that additions of top predators will not increase the population <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> the primary <b>producers,</b> and that the addition of nutrients to a three-level food chain will lead to increases in population numbers at all trophic levels. Surprisingly, recent meta-analyses show that freshwater pelagic food web patterns match neither prey-dependent models (in pelagic webs, 'prey' are phytoplankton, and 'predators' are zooplankton), nor ratio-dependent models. In this paper we use a modification of the prey-dependent model, incorporating strong interference within the zooplankton trophic level, that does yield patterns matching those found in nature. This zooplankton interference model corresponds to a more reticulate food web than in the linear, prey-dependent model, which lacks zooplankton interference. We thus reconcile data with a new model, and make the testable prediction that the strength of trophic cascades will depend on the degree of heterogeneity in the zooplankton level of the food chain...|$|R

The use of cylindrical wave propagation in animal calls appears to be extremely rare, but is an effective way to lengthen the acoustic system; it causes the number of resonances per kilohertz to increase.

The employment in these industries is modeled as being determined simultaneously, i. e. the location <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> services {{is a function}} of the location of manufacturing and vice versa. The rationale for the simultaneous approach comes from an assumption of a supplier-customer relation between the two categories of industries. Manufacturing firms benefit from short-distance supply <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> services. The service suppliers benefit from accessibility to customers among the manufacturing firms. Accessibility based on time distances is incorporated into the analysis to allow for inter-regional effects. Controlling for the availability of a skilled workforce and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the private sector for producer services and the average wage-level and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the private sector for manufacturing, the empirical results suggest that the location manufacturing employment can be explained by its accessibility to producer services.

However, it is still controversial if size reduction is caused by temperature or salinity on their own, or if other factors interfere as well. We used natural benthic diatom communities to explore how "body size" (cells and colonies) and motility change along temperature (2 - 26 °C) and salinity (0. 5 - 7. 8) gradients in the brackish Baltic Sea. Fourth-corner analysis confirmed that small cell and colony sizes were associated with high temperature in summer. Average community cell volume decreased linearly with 2. 2 % per °C. However, cells were larger with artificial warming when nutrient concentrations were high in the cold season. Average community cell volume increased by 5. 2 % per °C of artificial warming from 0 to 8. 5 °C and simultaneously there was a selection for motility, which probably helped to optimize growth rates by trade-offs between nutrient supply and irradiation. Along the Baltic Sea salinity gradient cell size decreased with decreasing salinity, apparently mediated by nutrient stoichiometry. Altogether, our results suggest that climate change in this century may polarize seasonality by creating two new niches, with elevated temperature at high nutrient concentrations in the cold season (increasing cell size) and elevated temperature at low nutrient concentrations in the warm season (decreasing cell size). Higher temperature in summer and lower salinity by increased land-runoff are expected to decrease the average cell <b>size</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>producers,</b> {{which is likely to}} affect the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels...|$|R

Data from 91 farrow-to- finish operations enrolled in the Kansas Farm Management Associations in 1992 were used to empirically estimate economies <b>of</b> <b>size.</b> Results indicate that average total cost and operation size are significantly correlated, and that average total cost declines as operations become larger. Results also indicate a substantial variability in costs <b>of</b> production between <b>producers.</b> In fact, costs <b>of</b> production between <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> a given <b>size</b> vary more than costs of production between operations <b>of</b> different <b>sizes...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{develops}} a sequential game-theoretic model <b>of</b> heterogeneous <b>producers</b> {{to examine the}} market and welfare effects of cooperative involvement in process innovation activity in the agricultural sector. The analysis examines an open-membership, input-supplying cooperative (co-op) that maximizes member welfare and finances its innovation activity through retained earnings. Analytical {{results show that the}} presence of the co-op can increase the arrival rate of innovations while reducing the price of agricultural inputs. Cooperative involvement in innovation activity can thus be welfare enhancing and socially desirable with its effectiveness being determined by the degree <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> heterogeneity and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> innovation costs.

40|$|This paper generalizes the {{original}} random matching model of money by Kiyotaki and Wright (1989) (KW) in two aspects: first, {{the economy is}} characterized by an arbitrary distribution of agents who specialize in producing a particular consumption good; and second, these agents have preferences such {{that they want to}} consume any good with some probability. The results depend crucially on the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the fraction <b>of</b> <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> each good and the probability with which different agents want to consume each good. KW and other related models are shown to be parameterizations of this more general one. 4 1...|$|R
