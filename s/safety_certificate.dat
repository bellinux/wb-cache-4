5|$|The club {{succeeded in}} a further legal {{challenge}} bought by small firms in January 2005 as the High Court upheld {{a decision by}} then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to grant a compulsory purchase order {{in support of the}} scheme. The stadium later became issue in the local elections in May 2006. The Metropolitan Police restricted supporters' coaches to being parked in the nearby Sobel Sports Centre rather than in the underground stadium car park, and restricted access to 14 streets on match days. These police restrictions were conditions of the stadiums' health and <b>safety</b> <b>certificate</b> which the stadium requires to operate and open. The road closures were passed at a council meeting in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|The station {{earned the}} world class OHSAS 18001 health and <b>safety</b> <b>certificate</b> in 2003, ahead of Alcan's global targets. All of the station's staff were {{required}} {{to take place in}} safety audits to improve working practice at the station. The certificate was presented to the station's manager by Wansbeck MP Denis Murphy on 15 March 2003. The station's attention to health and safety was further recognised on 6 June 2007 when they were honoured by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) with a RoSPA Occupational Health and Safety Award at the Hilton Birmingham Metropole Hotel. Workers at the station had been audited by RoSPA for 10 years before receiving the award.|$|E

5|$|On 7 March 2005 Greater Manchester police {{announced}} that they would stop policing Wigan Athletic matches at the stadium from 2 April. This move would almost certainly {{have resulted in the}} stadium's <b>safety</b> <b>certificate</b> being revoked, effectively forcing the team to play behind closed doors. The move was part of an ongoing dispute between the police force and Dave Whelan surrounding GB£300,000 in unpaid policing costs. The police's decision would not have affected Wigan Warriors, whose games are stewarded instead of policed. The situation was temporarily resolved on 8 March with both sides reaching an agreement that would allow Athletic to play at the ground {{until the end of the}} season. Four months later, Wigan Athletic, facing the prospect of playing their home games in the Premier League in an empty stadium, grudgingly paid the money they owed to the police. The club successfully appealed against the payments in court and won damages from the police.|$|E

25|$|In October 2004 {{construction}} work commenced {{for the building}} of a second stand {{to the north of the}} pitch. The stand has a capacity of 2,000. After completion, the £1.58m facility would bring the stadium's capacity to over the Scottish Premier League's 6,000 seating criteria meaning Falkirk would be allowed automatic promotion from the First Division. The stand received its <b>safety</b> <b>certificate</b> in late March 2005, shortly before the SPL's deadline for a stadium which met the seating criteria. By May of the same year the north stand was fully completed.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{inspection}} in April 2016, on 10 May, UK-based Air Safety Support International (ASSI), a subsidiary {{company of the}} Civil Aviation Authority responsible for aviation safety in Overseas Territories, issued an Aerodrome Certificate to St Helena Airport. This <b>safety</b> <b>certificate</b> indicated that airport infrastructure, aviation security measures and {{air traffic control service}} complied with international aviation safety and security standards. ASSI did not allow the airport to go into commercial operation, however, due to concerns over operational readiness of monitoring and clearing issues that include wind shear and turbulence.|$|E

25|$|The North West Corner, or North West terrace {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} still referred to as, despite now being all seated is the only major section of the stadium to remain uncovered (the other area is the Kop Corner). The original North West Terrace was built between 1919 and 1920 to adjoin both the North Stand and West Stand, but was demolished in early 1965 and replaced in mid 1966, {{in time for the}} 1966 World Cup. The terrace was not in use for two years, and seats were installed in 1991 along with the Leppings Lane terrace. The stand failed to gain a <b>safety</b> <b>certificate</b> for the 2007–08 season. In recent years it had only been used as overspill for away fans when both the upper and lower tiers of the West Stand have been filled, however in the 2011–12 season, with Wednesday needing to better or match the result of their neighbours to gain promotion {{on the final day of}} the season, the Corner was opened to visiting Wycombe Wanderers fans, with the West Stand used by home supporters. Whilst not being used for seating, the Corner has recently been used as extra advertising space, with advertising boards on the back wall, and more recently a large 'My Sheffield Jobs' seat covering appearing alongside their sponsorship of the North Stand. It is sponsored by Handley Brown. This corner is to be roofed, under the Hillsborough stadium Upgrade plans, yet no work has yet been done, due to owners of the nearby terraces complaining. This corner is commonly nicknamed the 'Crows Nest' by Wednesdayites.The corner is still unable to gain a <b>safety</b> <b>certificate</b> and remains unused by fans. Television company Sky use the corner for their temporary studios and technical area for televised games.|$|E
25|$|Several safety tests {{had been}} rushed {{in order to}} have the line {{technically}} open by the end of 2016. At the time of the line's opening, there were 17,260 issues along the line that needed to be fixed, and critical systems such as fire alarms still needed to be tested. By May 2017, the number of discrepancies had dropped to 7,264, but it was around this time that the fire alarm systems at each station were deactivated, requiring fire safety chiefs to be posted at each station. , some of these tests had yet to be completed even though the line had been opened for eight months. The Federal Transit Administration only allowed the line to operate under a temporary <b>safety</b> <b>certificate,</b> with the permanent one expected for November of that year.|$|E
500|$|On 17 April, the ORR {{took steps}} to revoke WCRC's <b>Safety</b> <b>Certificate.</b> A process of {{representation}} was started, with parties having until 15 May to comment. The ORR's opinion was that WCRC's Safety Management System [...] "is not able to ensure that services are being operated, designed or maintained safely". On 21 May 2015, the ORR issued WCRC an improvement notice under the Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{it has become more}} and more evident that {{openness}} and adaptivity are key characteristics of next generation distributed systems. The reason for that is not least the advent of computing trends like Ubiquitous Computing, Ambient Intelligence, and Cyber Physical Systems, where systems are usually open for dynamic integration and able to react adaptively to changing situations. Despite being open and adaptive it is a common requirement for such systems to be safe. However, traditional safety assurance techniques, both state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art, are not sufficient in this context. We recently developed some initial solution concepts based on conditional <b>safety</b> <b>certificates</b> and corresponding runtime analyses. In this paper we show how to operationalize these concepts. To this end we present in detail how to specify conditional <b>safety</b> <b>certificates,</b> how to transform them into suitable runtime models, and how these models finally support dynamic safety evaluations...|$|R

2500|$|Hillsborough hosted five FA Cup semi-finals in the 1980s. A crush {{occurred}} at the Leppings Lane end of the ground during the 1981 semi-final between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers after hundreds more spectators were permitted to enter the terrace than could safely be accommodated, resulting in 38 injuries, including broken arms, legs and ribs. Police believed {{there had been a}} real chance of fatalities had swift action not been taken, and recommended the club reduce its capacity. In a post-match briefing to discuss the incident, Sheffield Wednesday chairman Bert McGee remarked: [...] "Bollocks—no one would have been killed". The incident nonetheless prompted Sheffield Wednesday to alter the layout at the Leppings Lane end, dividing the terrace into three separate pens to restrict sideways movement. This 1981 change and other later changes to the stadium invalidated the stadium's <b>safety</b> <b>certificate.</b> The <b>safety</b> <b>certificate</b> was never renewed and the stated capacity of the stadium was never changed. The terrace was divided into five pens when the club was promoted to the First Division in 1984, and a crush barrier near the access tunnel was removed in 1986 to improve the flow of fans entering and exiting the central enclosure.|$|E
