50|$|Building <b>surveyors</b> work in most {{real estate}} markets {{including}} residential, commercial, retail, industrial, leisure, education and health. Consequently, {{there are a}} wide variety of opportunities for chartered building <b>surveyors</b> to work in both the commercial, private, and public sectors. Many chartered building <b>surveyors</b> work for property consultancies, public sector organisations, real estate owning clients and contractors as well as in a number of specialist niche areas such as insurance, rights to light, party wall matters etc. As well as strong technical skills, building <b>surveyors</b> need to have strong people skills and the highest levels of integrity. Clients, whether a large corporation or an individual member of the public, need to have the utmost confidence in the impartial advice given by chartered building <b>surveyors.</b> Chartered building <b>surveyors</b> are clearly differentiated from the rest of their market by their enhanced technical knowledge and professional standards.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the perception of propensity to trust and organizational commitment of quantity <b>surveyors</b> and examine if propensity to trust among working partners enhances organizational commitment of quantity <b>surveyors.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Organizational commitment and propensity to trust is linked through the framework of social exchange. Quantitative approach with questionnaire survey is employed to investigate whether propensity to trust would enhance organizational commitment. Questionnaires are sent to the quantity <b>surveyors</b> who are professional members of the Hong Kong Institute of <b>Surveyors</b> and are working in the Hong Kong construction industry. In total, 71 valid responses are obtained for data analysis. Findings – Contrary to prediction, propensity to trust does not show significant relationship with both affective and continuance commitment. The two propensity to trust scales show different results on the relationship with normative commitment (NC). When working relationship is taken into consideration, quantity <b>surveyor’s</b> propensity to trust the partner who has the worst working relationship has significant and positive impact on the <b>surveyor’s</b> NC level; whilst quantity <b>surveyor’s</b> propensity to trust the partner who has the best working relationship does not has significant positive impact on the <b>surveyor’s</b> NC level. Practical implications – To improve propensity to trust among quantity <b>surveyors,</b> consultant companies should provide professional-related training programme to quantity <b>surveyors</b> as to explore their potential. The provision of training programs would also help quantity <b>surveyors</b> feel that they are supported by the organization, which would improve their commitment to the organization. Originality/value – This is the first study to apply the social exchange theory to study organizational commitment within the quantity surveying profession and construction industry, which provides a new point for understanding the concept amongst the profession and industry...|$|R

40|$|Historically, <b>surveyors</b> {{have been}} {{interested}} in completing tasks for clients, and have not been unduly concerned about standards. In recent years, however, the spread of standardisation has reached the area of operation of many <b>surveyors.</b> There are two possible approaches that <b>surveyors</b> can take to this development – to attempt to ignore it (in this direction lies the probability of marginalisation); or to embrace standards, working with the standardisation process to produce workable, timely documents which meet the needs of <b>surveyors,</b> their customers and the wider community. This paper provides some background on the spread of standardisation, and describes how FIG (the International Federation of <b>Surveyors)</b> has adopted the second approach. Initial results and continuing challenges are presented. ...|$|R
