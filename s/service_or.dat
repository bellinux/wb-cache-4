5|$|The University of Virginia has a {{large number}} of social fraternities. This list {{includes}} active all-male fraternities and coeducational fraternities that identify themselves primarily as social organizations, as opposed to professional, <b>service,</b> <b>or</b> honor organizations. Several of these fraternities were founded much earlier in the university's history, but went inactive and were reestablished later on. In these cases, the establishment date reflects the date that the fraternity's original charter was granted.|$|E

5|$|According to Thompson, the Navy {{immediately}} began efforts {{to cover up}} the cause of the explosion. Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into trying to prove that one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had intentionally caused the explosion. After learning that Hartwig had named another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy on himself, Milligan enlisted the help of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative <b>Service</b> <b>or</b> NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.|$|E
5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or <b>service</b> <b>or</b> for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E

5|$|From 1947 through 1956, each BBWAA voter used {{discretion}} {{as to who}} {{qualified as}} a rookie. In 1957, the term was first defined as someone with fewer than 75 at bats or 45 innings pitched in any previous Major League season. This guideline was later amended to 90 at bats, 45 innings pitched, or 45 days on a Major League roster before September 1 of the previous year. The current standard of 130 at bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster of a Major League club (excluding time in military <b>service</b> <b>or</b> on the disabled list) before September 1 was adopted in 1971.|$|E

5|$|Governor Morton and Lew Wallace, Indiana's {{adjutant}} general, established Camp Morton at {{the state}} fairgrounds in Indianapolis as the initial gathering place and training camp for the state's Union volunteers. (Camp Morton was converted to a prisoner-of-war camp in 1862.) By April 27, Indiana's first six regiments were fully organized as the First Brigade, Indiana Volunteers, {{under the command of}} Brigadier General Thomas A. Morris. Members of companies not selected for these first regiments were given the option of volunteering for three years of <b>service</b> <b>or</b> returning home until they were needed; some companies formed into regiments in the state militia and were called into federal service within a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, the now-abolished Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) {{enforced}} {{the first}} HOS rules. Drivers {{were limited to}} 12hours of work within a 15-hour period. Work was defined as loading, unloading, driving, handling freight, preparing reports, preparing vehicles for <b>service,</b> <b>or</b> performing any other duty pertaining to the transportation of passengers or property. The ICC intended the 3-hour difference between 15hours on-duty and 12hours {{of work to be}} used for meals and rest breaks. The weekly maximum was limited to 60hours over 7days (non-daily drivers), or 70hours over 8days (daily drivers). These rules allowed for 12hours of work within a 15-hour period, 9hours of rest, with 3hours for breaks within a 24-hour day.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other <b>service</b> <b>or</b> construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E
