Introduction: Only {{twenty-five years}} ago, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the proper <b>heating</b> and ventilating <b>of</b> buildings, and little was really known about this extremely important scientific subject. But today the knowledge of it and its importance in regard to the great mass of people is becoming more fully realized, and rapid strides are being taken in the practical application of the principles <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> and ventilating. The demand for artificial heat depends on the climate of the country in which, and the character of the people to which, the heat is to be supplied. The proper temperature for a room in this country is 70 F. though a play-room, where active exercise is taken, may be heated only to 50 F. In England, on account of the extreme humidity of the atmosphere, {{it is not necessary to}} have such a high temperature. Artificial heat is necessary in our latitude during the greater part <b>of</b> the year. <b>Heat</b> is a sensible quality of objects. It may be measured by means of scientific instruments, but we can tell about it only as we compare a body with other bodies, i. e., a body is hotter or colder in comparison with another body. There is a certain law, well known to chemists, called the "law of diffusion of gasses", which states that if two gases are in contact, they will mix and inter-mix, until the resultant is a perfectly mixed or diffused combination of the gases. Another well-known law is that heated air expands. When heated air and cold are brought in contact with each other, since the hated air is expanded, it takes a greater bulk <b>of</b> the <b>heated</b> air to be the same quantity of cold, and so is also of a different quality than the unheated, by the law of diffusion of gases just stated, they will tend to mix, seeking equilibrium. These two facts are of extreme importance in the <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> and ventilating buildings...|$|R

The text presents thermodynamics {{in and of}} itself, as an elegant and powerful set of ideas and methods. These methods open the way to understanding a very wide range of phenomena in physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. Starting out from an introduction of concepts at first year undergraduate level, the roles of temperature, internal energy, and entropy are explained via the laws of thermodynamics. The text employs a combination of examples, exercises, and careful discussion, {{with a view to}} conveying the feel of the subject as well as avoiding common misunderstandings. The Feynman–Smuluchowski ratchet, Szilard’s engine, and Maxwell’s daemon are used to elucidate entropy and the second law. Free energy and thermodynamic potentials are discussed at length, with applications to solids as well as fluids and flow processes. Thermal radiation is discussed, and the main ideas significant to global warming are explained. Stability, negative temperature, and negative heat capacity are also explained, with an example application to black holes and Hawking radiation. All the thermodynamics required for {{an undergraduate}} course in the physical sciences is covered, and a few areas are continued to introductory graduate level.

40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{advantage of}} steel as an engineering material is its versatility. One {{will understand that}} through heat treatment {{one or another of}} the characteristics of steel may be enhanced and-it is generally true that much versatility of steel arises from the- __ fact that its properties can be controlled and changed at will by heat treatment. Thus, if steel is to be formed into some intricate shape it can be made very soft and ductile by heat treatment. If, on the other hand, it is to resist wear, it can be heat treated to a very hard wear-resisting condition. This important faculty which steel possesses of being amendable to control of its properties by heat treatment arises largely from the fact that these properties in turn, reflect primarily the constitution of the steel, that is the nature, distribution, and amounts of its metallographic constituents, as distinct from its chemical composition. It is these factors which are controlled and changed by heat treatment, and it thus becomes apparent that steel's versatility reflects largely the very wide range of constitutional changes which can be brought about by heat treatment. The <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> treatment, then deals with the factors and mechanisms involved in the control of the constitution of steel by heating and cooling and the relationships between the constitution and properties of steel. Many, although by no means all, of the constitutional changes can be followed by microstructural studies. ~ The Constituents of Steel The two constituents of steel, the amount and distribution of which primarily control the properties, are iron (ferrit) and iron carbide (cementite). Most plain carbon steels will also contain manganese, silicon, phosphorus) sulpher, oxygen and traces of nitrogen, hydrogen and other chemical elements such as alumiunum and copper. These elements may modify to a certain extent the major effects of the constituition in respect to ferrite and cementite but the cementite is always the predominating influence. Ferrite- pure iron without impurities whatsoever has so far defied manufacture and its properties are there for unknown.
