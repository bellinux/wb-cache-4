40|$|Objectives: A {{variety of}} smoked and <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> with varying {{nicotine}} content are accessible in India. Nicotine quantity in <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> has direct bearing on tobacco dependence. Our {{objective was to}} estimate nicotine content in various types of smoked and smokeless products. Disclosure for essential health warning was also checked. Materials and Methods: Liquid-liquid extraction was used for nicotine extraction and high-performance thin layer chromatography technique was applied for quantification of nicotine in seventy-one smoked and <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products.</b> Results: Significant variation in nicotine content was observed across <b>products.</b> In smoked <b>tobacco,</b> nicotine content varied from 1. 01 to 13. 0 mg/rod, while in <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> it ranged from 0. 8 mg/g to 50. 0 mg/g. Moisture content varied from 9 % to 21 %. Conclusion: This work lists a range of smoked and <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> available in this region.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sales of <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> have {{increased}} in the USA. More than one in eight males in the 12 th grade are current users of <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco.</b> Surveillance data examining nicotine levels of <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> subsequent to 2006 have not {{been reported in the}} literature. METHODS: Data on nicotine levels and design features (eg, pH, moisture content, leaf cut and flavour) of <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> sold in Massachusetts were obtained from manufacturers between 2003 and 2012. Design features, levels and temporal trends in unionised (free) nicotine and nicotine content of <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> were analysed overall and by manufacturer and product type. RESULTS: The annual total number of moist snuff products increased from 99 in 2003 to 127 in 2012. The annual total number of reported snus products increased from 4 in 2003 to the highest level of 62 in 2011, before decreasing to 26 in 2012. Overall, mean unionised (free) nicotine remained relatively stable (beta= 0. 018 (95 % CI - 0. 014 to 0. 050) mg/g dry weight/year) from 2003 to 2012. However, both levels and temporal trends of mean free nicotine varied significantly among manufacturers (p CONCLUSIONS: The number of <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> increased in the Massachusetts market. Further, mean unionised (free) nicotine levels in <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> of several manufacturers continued to rise despite decreasing levels from other manufacturers. The current success in tobacco control is very likely undermined without government surveillance, regulation and widespread public disclosure of nicotine levels in these products...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversitySmokeless tobacco {{products}} have existed for centuries and vary significantly across geographical regions. The constituents found in each <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>product</b> depends on many factors, including social customs, manufacturing regulations, {{and the availability}} of local raw ingredients. Unfortunately, {{tobacco products}} have been linked to cancer over the past several decades, particularly of the oral cavity. In this study, the carcinogenic profiles, relative risks of oral cancer, and usage trends for three unique smokeless tobacco regions (United States, Sweden, and India) will be evaluated {{in order to determine the}} relative safety for each product. In this paper, the chemical analysis of various products from United States, as well as Swedish snus and Indian gutkha were reviewed, to establish constituent profiles. The main carcinogens evaluated were the tobacco-specific n-nitrosamines; gutkha displayed the highest values of these ingredients, with snus displaying the lowest. Studies examining the relative risks for oral cancers associated with each of the three region’s smokeless tobacco products were assessed. Indian gutkha expressed the highest relative risk for developing oral cancers, and Swedish snus expressed the lowest (a very slight increased risk at that). To establish usage habits for each region-specific <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>product,</b> various epidemiological studies were analyzed and showed that gutkha was the most prevalently used product in its respective region, with Swedish snus only slightly trailing in use. Smokeless tobacco products were used the least in the United States. These studies concluded that the gutkha habits in India were the most damaging to the public health of the nation with regards to smokeless tobacco use, particularly due to the high prevalence of use and high relative risk of oral cancers. In a purely chemical sense, Swedish snus was less harmful than the counterparts often sold in the United States. Yet, with snus use significantly higher than smokeless tobacco use in the United States, it is thought that Sweden snus habits are more detrimental than those seen in the United States. However, smokeless tobacco is ultimately an unsafe practice in all three regions evaluated, and more should be done to remove carcinogens from the products and promote self-restraint for current users...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Afzal is {{a common}} <b>smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>product</b> (STP) {{available}} illegally in Oman. This study aimed to assess pH and moisture levels and determine cancer-enhancing factors in a randomly selected sample of Afzal. Methods: This study was carried out at the Sultan Qaboos University in Muscat, Oman, between April and December 2013. A package of Afzal was purchased from a single provider and divided into samples. The pH and moisture content of the samples were measured according to the protocols of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
