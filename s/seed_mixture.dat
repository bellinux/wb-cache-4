These four varieties as well as the first set, were tested in seven combinations, with the following percentages of one barley and one wheat variety : 100 : 0, 90 : 10, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, 10 : 90, and 0 : 100. Grain yield of mixtures was higher than that of the mid-component value in most cases and was higher than that of the best component in a few cases. Only a few of the observed differences were statistically significant. All mixtures had significantly lower test weight than that of the best component. Ninety percent of the mixtures were significantly lower in test weight than the mid-component value. Tillering of both wheat varieties consistently decreased as the percentage of wheat in the <b>seeded</b> <b>mixture</b> decreased.

Ecological restoration through exploitation of site-specific <b>seed</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{has the potential to}} counteract losses of ecosystem functionality in disturbed sites. Two alpine plant species, Phleum alpinum and Leontodon autumnalis, were assessed for their geographical genetic structure and genetic diversity throughout Norway’s mainland with the aim to delineate phytogeographical zones, which should function as a precursor for their inclusion in site-specific <b>seed</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Samples were taken from single populations at 20 locations, covering all regions in the whole country. Fifteen individuals from both species at each location were investigated with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. This resulted in three distinct phytogeographical zones in P. alpinum, while L. autumnalis lacked obvious genetic structure and hence classified as one phytogeographical zone. Optimal source locations for commercial seed production were identified with Nei’s gene diversity and frequency down weighted gene diversity. When <b>seed</b> <b>mixtures</b> would only contain these two alpine species, the optimal source locations would be Ofoten in northern Norway, Trollheimen in central Norway and Hardangervidda øst in southern Norway.

However, in some countries large areas have been preserved and the demand for meadow recreation by sowing <b>seed</b> <b>mixtures</b> is increasing. In the White Carpathians Protected Landscape Area (Czech Republic) the use of commercial <b>seed</b> <b>mixtures</b> is undesirable and the use of regional mixtures has been investigated. The costs for seeding large areas are high and lower cost techniques are needed. In 1999 a field experiment was set up to investigate the establishment of hay meadow vegetation comparing sowing a regional mixture all over a plot with sowing narrow 2. 5 In strips of regional <b>seed</b> <b>mixtures</b> into a matrix of a commercial grass mixture or into natural regeneration. The results after five seasons showed good establishment of the sown species in the meadow treatment. Spread of sown species from the sown strips into the surrounding matrix occurred but the cover of species was lower in the commercial grass matrix compared with the natural regeneration matrix. Colonisation of some plots by unsown desirable grassland species from adjacent grassland habitats also occurred, but more species colonised the natural regeneration matrix than the commercial grasses or the sown meadow matrix itself. Overall, the results indicate that, in appropriate situations, sown strips can provide a lower cost but slower and longer-term alternative to field scale sowing of regional <b>seed</b> <b>mixtures</b> for recreation of hay meadow vegetation.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} were undertaken {{to investigate the}} influence of <b>seed</b> <b>mixture</b> on {{the establishment of a}} target grassland community on a site with high available phosphorus. In the first experiment autumn- and spring-sown commercial seed mixtures were compared with seed harvested from a nature reserve with respect to their ability to produce an inundation grassland community similar to that described by the British National Vegetation Classification (NVC) as Agrostis stolonifera–Alopecurus geniculatus grassland (MG 13). In the second experiment the composition and sowing rate of a commercial <b>seed</b> <b>mixture</b> were altered to investigate whether these factors were significant in the establishment of a sward similar to MG 13. Similarly, in the third experiment the composition of a commercial <b>seed</b> <b>mixture</b> designed to achieve an alternative community, Cynosurus cristatus–Caltha palustris grassland (NVC code MG 8), was sown. The vegetation resulting from each of these treatments was monitored with permanent quadrats for a 3 -year period, and the hydrological regime of each quadrat location was modeled and quantified. The results showed that <b>seed</b> <b>mixture,</b> timing of sowing, and seeding rate had an initial effect on the vegetation that established. However, by the third year of monitoring {{there were no significant differences}} between these treatments, and hydrological regime had become the most important factor in determining the distribution of species. The vegetation was less diverse than predicted from germination tests and decreased in diversity over the monitoring period. It is suggested that this may be a result of the hydrological regime being unsuitable for several of the sown species or due to the extremely high available phosphorus concentration in the soil.

40|$|Abstract Grasslands used to {{be vital}} {{landscape}} elements throughout Europe. Nowadays, the area of grasslands is dramatically reduced, especially in industrial countries. Grassland restoration is widely applied to increase the naturalness of the landscape and preserve biodiversity. We reviewed {{the most frequently used}} restoration techniques (spontaneous succession, sowing <b>seed</b> <b>mixtures,</b> transfer of plant material, topsoil removal and transfer) and techniques used to improve species richness (planting, grazing and mowing) to recover natural-like grasslands from ex-arable lands.

We conclude that the success of each technique depends on the site conditions, history, availability of propagules and/or donor sites, and on the budget and time available for restoration. Spontaneous succession can be an option for restoration when no rapid result is expected, and is likely to lead to the target in areas with high availability of propagules.

For predatory beetles, overall density was greatest where tussock grasses were included within the seed mixtures, while the densities of phytophagous beetles were greatest where forbs were present.

Materials and Methods: 40 male albino rats were divided into four groups: control group, hypercholesterolemic rats, fed the balanced diet supplemented with cholesterol at a dose level of 2 g/ 100 g diet; the other two groups of animals fed the same previous hypercholesterolemic diet supplemented with either flax/pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>mixture</b> or pumpkin/purslane <b>seed</b> <b>mixture</b> at ratio of (5 / 1) (ω- 3 and ω- 6). Results The present study showed that 2 % cholesterol administration caused a significant increase in total cholesterol, total lipids, and triacylglycerol in both serum and liver.

Refuges of host plants {{that do not}} make Bt toxins can promote survival of susceptible insects and delay evolution of resistance, particularly if resistance is inherited as a recessive trait.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} methods of reconstruction and different seed mixtures on {{the restoration of}} botanically valuable, semi-natural, species- rich grasslands on enlarged river dikes (embankments) was studied. If during the reconstruction a strip of the species-rich vegetation is kept unaffected it functions {{as a source of}} propagules. From this intact zone species disperse {{to other parts of the}} dike and the redevelopment of the vegetation is stimulated. When it is not possible to save part of the original vegetation, the upper soil layer can be put aside as complete sods or as topsoil and can be replaced as the new topsoil after the reconstruction. In this way the redevelopment of species-rich grasslands is promoted by the reestablishment of previously occurring species out of the propagules present in the replaced top soil. The application of the original subsoil or the use of imported clay as the new toplayer prevent a quick restoration of botanically valuable, semi-natural, species-rich grasslands.
