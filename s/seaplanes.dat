5|$|Elba {{operated}} the observation balloon through 1913. The following year, she was modified {{to serve as}} a depot ship for three <b>seaplanes,</b> and she entered service in this new role on 4 June 1914. During this period she operated Nieuport IV <b>seaplanes.</b> She was the first dedicated seaplane tender of the Italian navy, though <b>seaplanes</b> had already been operated aboard several battleships and cruisers. Elba was nevertheless too small and too old for her intended role, and she was retired in 1916. She remained in the Italian inventory until 4 January 1920, when she was sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|She {{could carry}} five floatplanes and {{two to four}} regular, wheeled aircraft. The latter would {{have to return to}} land after launch, but the <b>seaplanes</b> would take off and land in the water {{alongside}} the carrier, lifted on and off the ship by the cranes. Her original complement of aircraft consisted of a Short Folder, two Wight Pushers, three Sopwith Type 807 <b>seaplanes</b> and two to four Sopwith Tabloid wheeled aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Yugoslav Navy {{operated}} {{a series of}} seaplane bases on the Dalmatian Coast before World War II and decided that it needed a ship to transport <b>seaplanes</b> between them and to rescue downed aircraft after operations as had been common during World War I.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Bahrain Airport was developed. Imperial Airways flew there, {{including}} the Handley Page HP42 aircraft. Later {{in the same}} decade the Bahrain Maritime Airport was established, for flying-boats and <b>seaplanes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Supporting the Japanese {{landings}} were <b>seaplanes</b> from Kamikawa Maru, temporarily {{based at}} Thousand Ships Bay at Santa Isabel Island. About 400 Japanese naval troops—mainly from the 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force—disembarked from the transport ship on barges and immediately began construction of facilities on Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. Aircraft from Shōhō covered the landings until early afternoon, when Gotō's force turned toward Bougainville to refuel in preparation {{to support the}} landings at Port Moresby. Once the Japanese troops were ashore, six <b>seaplanes</b> landed in Tulagi harbor {{as part of the}} establishment of the planned seaplane base there.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Navy had {{conducted}} {{trials in}} 1913 with a modified cruiser, , {{to evaluate the}} ability of <b>seaplanes</b> {{to work with the}} fleet. They were successful enough that the Admiralty allocated £81,000 in the 1914–1915 Naval Programme to purchase a merchant ship for a more thorough modification than had been possible with Hermes to better accommodate <b>seaplanes.</b> A tramp steamer was purchased in 1914 that had just begun construction at the Blyth Shipbuilding Company so it could be easily modified to suit its new role.|$|E
5|$|When the Balkan Wars {{broke out}} in October 1912, these {{airplanes}} performed a number of reconnaissance and bombing missions; the most notable was a sortie against the Ottoman fleet anchorage in the Dardanelles, where First Lieutenant Michael Moutoussis and Ensign Aristeidis Moraitinis spotted the Ottoman fleet and dropped four bombs. This mission {{is regarded as the}} first naval-air operation in military history and was widely commented upon in the press, both Greek and international. Meanwhile, the Hellenic Navy, in the process of setting up its air arm, bought a fleet of Sopwith Gunbus <b>seaplanes</b> (also known as Greek <b>Seaplanes).</b>|$|E
5|$|More {{comparable}} to the R engine was the Fiat AS.6 engine developed for the 1931 contest; effectively a coupled, double AS.5 that suffered from technical problems. With the assistance of Rod Banks, the AS.6 powered the Macchi M.C.72 to a new speed record for piston-powered <b>seaplanes</b> in 1934 of 440.6mph (709.2km/h), a record that still stands as of 2009.|$|E

Røst Airport opened on 1 June 1986, initially with Widerøe operating de Havilland Canada Twin Otters. From 2000 to 2001 the service was operated by Guard Air, and from 2003 to 2008 by Kato Air; otherwise Widerøe has flown the route.|$|E
5|$|The ship left Imbros on 1 November for Mytilene, {{from where}} her {{aircraft}} flew aerial reconnaissance missions over Smyrna, before she continued onwards to Salonika, where she arrived on 8 November. While based there, her aircraft supported British troops fighting the Bulgarians, spotted for British ships conducting shore bombardments, and conducted anti-submarine patrols. At this time, Ark Royal operated five Short 166s {{and a couple}} of Sopwith <b>seaplanes.</b> On 27 March 1917, the ship was transferred to Mudros to serve as a depot ship for all the <b>seaplanes</b> assigned to No. 2 Wing RNAS, which controlled all RNAS aircraft in the area. By the end of 1917, she operated a mixture of Short Type 184 and Sopwith Baby aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to the United States, Winslow resumed peacetime duty with the Atlantic Fleet. During May, she served {{as one of the}} rescue pickets {{stationed}} along the route across the Atlantic flown by three Navy NC-type <b>seaplanes</b> in the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic. After that, the destroyer returned to normal operations along the east coast and annual winter maneuvers in Cuban waters until placed in reduced commission at Philadelphia on 10 December 1919.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States in January 1919, O'Brien returned to European waters in May to serve {{as one of the}} picket ships for the NC-type <b>seaplanes</b> in the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic. O'Brien was decommissioned at Philadelphia in June 1922. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in March 1935 sold for scrapping in April.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Armistice on 11 November, which ended all fighting, O'Brien transported mail and {{passengers}} between Brest, France, and Plymouth, England. She returned to New York on 8 January 1919, but returned to European waters in May when she served as one of the rescue pickets stationed along the route across the Atlantic flown by three Navy NC-type <b>seaplanes</b> in the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{aircraft}} made almost 100 raids, {{most of them}} small, against northern Australia during 1942 and 1943.

The town of Broome, Western Australia experienced a devastating attack by IJN fighter planes on 3 March 1942, in which at least 88 people were killed.

5|$|New Jersey was {{directly}} {{engaged in the}} conquest of Okinawa from 14 March until 16 April. As the carriers prepared for the invasion with strikes there and on Honshū, New Jersey fought off air raids, used her <b>seaplanes</b> to rescue downed pilots, defended the carriers from suicide planes, shooting down at least three and assisting {{in the destruction of}} others. On 24 March 1945 she again carried out the role of heavy bombardment, preparing the invasion beaches for the assault a week later.|$|E
5|$|Next, she put in {{for repairs}} at Norfolk, Virginia until 8 March, {{when she left}} for fleet {{exercises}} near Cuba. Following this, Harding left for New York, arriving there on 14 April. On 1 May, she departed {{as part of a}} group of destroyers acting as a guide for a flight of Navy Curtiss NC <b>seaplanes</b> across the Atlantic Ocean. Harding provided searchlight illumination by night during the first part of the flight; NC-1 and NC-3 made forced landings near the Azores and Harding rendered assistance to NC-1 before it sank. NC-4, the remaining seaplane, arrived at Ponta Delgada 20 May and as she took off for the last leg of her journey, Harding got underway to provide radio compass signals at sea. After the <b>seaplanes</b> landed at Plymouth, England, to complete the flight on 31 May 1919, Harding visited Brest, France and the Azores before returning to Newport 18 June. For several months, Harding was based out of Newport and Norfolk on training exercises.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March 1967, {{parliament}} {{decided to}} build four short take-off and landing airports along the Helgeland coast between Trondheim and Bodø. Braathens placed an order for a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and planned to start the company Braathens STOL. It applied to operate the route without subsidies, but the concession was rejected and granted with subsidies to Widerøe, which had been operating the routes using <b>seaplanes.</b>|$|E
