However, the bandwidth efficiency of this method is low. We propose a finite duration method in this paper and build up mathematical models to describe user behaviors like channel surfing to evaluate the performance of channel <b>switch</b> <b>delay.</b> We find through analysis and simulation that our method is well balanced in performance and cost.

We found that SSDs adopt significantly different ways of exploiting channel-level and way-level parallelism to maximize write throughput, which governs the peak current consumption. The X 25 M(Intel) emphasizes the performance aspect of SSDs and linearly increases the channel parallelism as the IO size increases. The MXP(Samsung) puts more emphasis on energy consumption aspect of SSD and controls the degree of parallelism to reduce the peak current consumption. Cluster size of the X 25 M and the MXP correspond to one and eight pages, respectively. The current consumed when writing a page to NAND flash varies significantly depending on the NAND model(17 mA- 35 mA). ...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this project is to perform general research into queuing network models of performance of high end computing systems. A related objective is to investigate and predict how {{an increase in the}} number of nodes of a supercomputer will decrease the running time of a user's software package, which is often referred to as the strong scaling problem. We investigate the large, MPI-based Linux cluster MCR at LLNL, running the well-known NAS Parallel Benchmark (NPB) applications. Data is collected directly from NPB and also from the low-overhead LLNL profiling tool mpiP. For a run, we break the wall clock execution time of the benchmark into four components: <b>switch</b> <b>delay,</b> MPI contention time, MPI service time, and non-MPI computation time. <b>Switch</b> <b>delay</b> is estimated from message statistics. MPI service time and non-MPI computation time are calculated directly from measurement data. MPI contention is estimated by means of a queuing network model (QNM), based in part on MPI service time. This model of execution time validates reasonably well against the measured execution time, usually within 10 %. Since the number of nodes used to run the application is a major input to the model, we can use the model to predict application execution times for various numbers of nodes. We also investigate how the four components of execution time scale individually as the number of nodes increases. <b>Switch</b> <b>delay</b> and MPI service time scale regularly. MPI contention is estimated by the QNM submodel and also has a fairly regular pattern. However, non-MPI compute time has a somewhat irregular pattern, possibly due to caching effects in the memory hierarchy. In contrast to some other performance modeling methods, this method is relatively fast to set up, fast to calculate, simple for data collection, and yet accurate enough to be quite useful...|$|E

For both cases, the interrupted SUs cannot resume their data communications until the PU or previously interrupted SUs have completed their transmission, thus resulting in waiting delay. If the interrupted SUs choose to switch to another subchannel, additional <b>switch</b> <b>delay</b> may occur due to spectrum handoff procedure.|$|E

Then, the available time duration of the spectrum band is included to evaluate the link stability.

40|$|ICT systems, {{especially}} data centers, {{consume a}} significant amount of energy in our daily life. With the rapidly increasing number and size of data centers, energy management is becoming essential. Thus, it is beneficial if the used energy in data centers can be utilized more efficiently. In this thesis, we analyze the energy-aware performance of queueing systems from the traffic point of view. The focus will be on using queueing theory to model and analyze a single processor in data centers. In data centers, the energy consumed by a processor depends on the processing speed. With higher speed, more energy is consumed, while with lower speed, the performance will be decreased. Thus, we consider the trade-off between the performance and energy consumption of processors. Based on this, we introduce a speed scaling method, which adjusts the processing speed of processors according to the traffic load of the queueing system. We mainly analyze and compare three optimized speed scaling methods, which are static, gated and linear speed scaling. In the gated and linear schemes, there is a <b>switching</b> <b>delay</b> when the processor is switched from the idle state to the busy state. The results demonstrate that the <b>switching</b> <b>delay</b> has a great impact on the optimized trade-off. In our scenario, without <b>switching</b> <b>delay,</b> gated and linear schemes have the same performance, and they are better than the static scheme. With <b>switching</b> <b>delay,</b> however, the linear scheme is always better than the gated scheme. With a long <b>switching</b> <b>delay,</b> even the static scheme can be better.
