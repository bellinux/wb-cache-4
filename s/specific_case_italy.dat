This paper analyses a number of general transport and mode-specific issues that can provide indications for setting up regulatory bodies and orienting their strategies.

40|$|Negotiating Memories of Protest in Western Europe {{explores the}} {{transmission}} of memories of European protest movements in the late 1960 s and 1970 s. Focusing on the <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> of <b>Italy,</b> the book examines {{the ways in which}} different memory agents negotiate memories of violence against left-wing activists, perpetrated by representatives of the state. It does so through a discussion of commemorative rituals, memory sites and other forms of 'memory work' performed by various social groups within the local setting of Bologna, where a left-wing student and protester was shot dead by police in 1977. By drawing on this fascinating case study, Andrea Hajek lays bare the dynamic relation between official and unofficial memories of conflict and explores the challenges of historical research into social movements...|$|R
40|$|Foreign {{language}} didactics {{is a field}} which, {{notwithstanding the}} many centuries of application and development, is still very methodologically problematic. Statistics clearly show that, in certain countries, the educational system provides foreign language instruction that is not apt and does not deliver effective linguistic competence; a few methods, however, {{have been developed to}} contravene this problem. In the <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> of <b>Italy,</b> a country which is renowned for its general monolingualism, Associazione Culturale Linguistica Educational (ACLE) has developed an innovative language teaching method (Rational, Emotional, Affective Learning) to attempt to fill the lacunae of the Italian school system, especially in regards to the teaching of English as a foreign language. This paper seeks to briefly outline the REAL method and its applications, describe its affinity to didactic and cognitive theories, and speculate on its potential effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Lifelines are {{essential}} infrastructures for human {{activities and the}} economic developm ent of a region. Lifelines vulnerability reduction is an actual question, particularly with reference to NaTech events, like earthquakes. In this regard, worldwide past seismic experiences revealed heavy damages to NG distribution networks. It is therefore essential to perform seismic risk assessment of NG buried pipelines systems with the aim to identify potential criticalities and avoid significant consequences. For such reasons, this work illustrates the proposal of a probabilistic framework for seismic risk assessment of NG lifelines. The proposed procedure is subsequently applied to a <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> study in <b>Italy</b> to highlight its feasibility...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} emergence {{and the development}} of an immigration and asylum control policy in Italy over the last twenty-five years. The theoretical and methodological background of the research is a discourse-analytical approach to public policy. My analysis is therefore focused on official political discourse about immigration control and my main data are parliamentary debates concerning the most important Italian immigration acts passed from the early 80 s to the present. The general aim of the thesis is to challenge the taken for granted nature of contemporary immigration policies by showing in the <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> of <b>Italy</b> how the meaning of the immigration control problem was constructed differently across time and across the political spectrum by the political elite. I also show that by defining the problem space Italian political elite discourse has conditioned the possible policy on the issue, rather than merely legitimising it ex post. In each Chapter ofmy thesis I deal with a different stage ofthe history ofItalian immigration control policy and I highlight the emergence, consolidation and transformation across political parties and political coalitions of different arguments, narratives and stories in relation {{to the nature of the}} immigration problem and the rationale for itS regulation. I then examine the policy devices that: were consistently advocated. My research also aims at understanding under what conditions and for what reasons the Italian elite discourse on migration control has been articulated in a certain form and why it has been changed or maintained. I show that the conditions of possibility of a certain political discourse about migration, and consequently of a certain immigration policy, are subject to change and are influenced by the interaction of multiple factors. Among them a crucial role is played by contingent party political struggle; mutual discursive positioning; pre-existing discursive structure on the migration policy issue; political ideologies; representations of national identity; transformations in the structure of political institutions and the impact of Europe and the ED policy on internal narratives about national identity.
