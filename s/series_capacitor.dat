25|$|High-pass filters {{have many}} applications. They {{are used as}} part of an audio {{crossover}} to direct high frequencies to a tweeter while attenuating bass signals which could interfere with, or damage, the speaker. When such a filter is built into a loudspeaker cabinet it is normally a passive filter that also includes a low-pass filter for the woofer and so often employs both a capacitor and inductor (although very simple high-pass filters for tweeters can consist of a <b>series</b> <b>capacitor</b> and nothing else).|$|E
500|$|The circuit shown {{consists}} of two stages of amplifier in common emitter topology. [...] The bias resistors all serve their usual functions. [...] The input of the first stage is coupled in the conventional way with a <b>series</b> <b>capacitor</b> to avoid affecting the bias. [...] However, the collector load {{consists of}} a transformer which serves as the inter-stage coupling instead of capacitors. [...] The windings of the transformer have inductance. [...] Capacitors placed across the transformer windings form resonant circuits which provide the tuning of the amplifier.|$|E
500|$|Harrison used Campbell's {{image filter}} theory, {{which was the}} most {{advanced}} filter theory available at the time. In this theory, filter design is viewed essentially as an impedance matching problem. More advanced filter theory was {{brought to bear on}} this problem by Norton in 1929 at Bell Labs. Norton followed the same general approach though he later described to Darlington the filter he designed as being [...] "maximally flat". Norton's mechanical design predates the paper by Butterworth who is usually credited as the first to describe the electronic maximally flat filter. The equations Norton gives for his filter correspond to a singly terminated Butterworth filter, that is, one driven by an ideal voltage source with no impedance, whereas the form more usually given in texts is for the doubly terminated filter with resistors at both ends, making it hard to recognise the design for what it is. Another unusual feature of Norton's filter design arises from the <b>series</b> <b>capacitor,</b> which represents the stiffness of the diaphragm. This is the only <b>series</b> <b>capacitor</b> in Norton's representation, and without it, the filter could be analysed as a low-pass prototype. Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the filter to the input at the expense of introducing a transformer into the equivalent circuit (Norton's figure 4). Norton has used here the [...] "turning round the L" [...] impedance transform to achieve this.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a developed algorithm for optimal placement of thyristor controlled <b>series</b> <b>capacitors</b> (TCSC’s) for enhancing the power system static security and minimizing the system overall power loss. Placing TCSC’s at selected branches requires {{analysis of the}} system behavior under all possible contingencies. A selective procedure to determine the locations and settings of the thyristor controlled <b>series</b> <b>capacitors</b> is presented. The locations are determined by evaluating contingency sensitivity index (CSI) for a given power system branch for a given number of contingencies. This criterion is then used to develop branches prioritizing index in order to rank the system branches possible for placement of the thyristor controlled <b>series</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Optimal settings of TCSC’s {{are determined by the}} optimization technique of simulated annealing (SA), where settings are chosen to minimize the overall power system losses. The goal of the developed methodology is to enhance power system static security by alleviating/eliminating overloads on the transmission lines and maintaining the voltages at all load buses within their specified limits through the optimal placement and setting of TCSC’s under single and double line outage network contingencies. The proposed algorithm is examined using different IEEE standard test systems to shown its superiority in enhancing the system static security and minimizing the system losses...|$|R

S. power grid against the effects of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) resulting from geomagnetic storms and the late time E 3 portion of high altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP), which {{is also known as}} MHD EMP. The basic concepts of operational modifications, blocking DC <b>series</b> <b>capacitors</b> in the lines and series resistors in the transformer neutral ground connection of wye windings and autotransformers, are introduced in Section 1, and explored in more detail in Section 2. Section 3 examines the existing systems that have introduced <b>series</b> <b>capacitors</b> in a substantial fraction of the system, specifically the Hydro Quebec system from the mid 1990 s and the WECC region in the western U. S. It is seen that <b>series</b> <b>capacitors</b> on some lines reduces the GIC currents and production of reactive power, but not by a great amount. Section 4 briefly performs a generic evaluation of the effect of neutral blocking resistors as a function of line length.

50|$|Line-commutated {{converters}} {{have some}} limitations {{in their use}} for HVDC systems. This results from requiring the AC circuit {{to turn off the}} thyristor current and the need {{for a short period of}} 'reverse' voltage to effect the turn-off (turn-off time). An attempt to address these limitations is the Capacitor-Commutated Converter (CCC) which has been used in a small number of HVDC systems. The CCC differs from a conventional HVDC system in that it has <b>series</b> <b>capacitors</b> inserted into the AC line connections, either on the primary or secondary side of the converter transformer. The <b>series</b> <b>capacitors</b> partially offset the commutating inductance of the converter and help to reduce fault currents. This also allows a smaller extinction angle to be used with a converter/inverter, reducing the need for reactive power support.However, CCC has remained only a niche application because of the advent of voltage-source converters (VSC) which completely eliminate the need for an extinction (turn-off) time.|$|R
