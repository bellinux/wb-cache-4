25|$|In Australia {{malnutrition}} or risk {{of malnutrition}} occurs in 80 percent {{of elderly people}} presented to hospitals for admission. Malnutrition and weight loss can contribute to <b>sarcopenia</b> with loss of lean body mass and muscle function. Abdominal obesity or weight loss coupled with <b>sarcopenia</b> lead to immobility, skeletal disorders, insulin resistance, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders. A paper from the Journal of the American Dietetic Association noted that routine nutrition screenings represent one way to detect and therefore decrease the prevalence of malnutrition in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|The {{increased}} risk of falling associated with aging leads to fractures of the wrist, spine, and hip. The risk of falling, in turn, is increased by impaired eyesight due to any cause (e.g. glaucoma, macular degeneration), balance disorder, movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease), dementia, and <b>sarcopenia</b> (age-related loss of skeletal muscle). Collapse (transient loss of postural tone with or without loss of consciousness) leads to a significant risk of falls; causes of syncope are manifold, but may include cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beat), vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension (abnormal drop in blood pressure on standing up), and seizures. Removal of obstacles and loose carpets in the living environment may substantially reduce falls. Those with previous falls, {{as well as those}} with gait or balance disorders, are most at risk.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms include poor growth, loss {{of muscle}} coordination, muscle weakness, visual problems, hearing problems, {{learning}} disabilities, heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease, gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory disorders, neurological problems, autonomic dysfunction and dementia. Acquired {{conditions in which}} mitochondrial dysfunction has been involved are: diabetes, Huntington's disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, aging and senescence, anxiety disorders, cardiovascular disease, <b>sarcopenia,</b> chronic fatigue syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Due to the lessened {{physical}} activity and increased longevity of industrialized populations, <b>sarcopenia</b> is emerging as a major health concern. <b>Sarcopenia</b> may progress {{to the extent that}} an older person may lose his or her ability to live independently. Furthermore, <b>sarcopenia</b> is an important independent predictor of disability in population-based studies, linked to poor balance, gait speed, falls, and fractures. <b>Sarcopenia</b> {{can be thought of as}} a muscular analog of osteoporosis, which is loss of bone, also caused by inactivity and counteracted by exercise. The combination of osteoporosis and <b>sarcopenia</b> results in the significant frailty often seen in the elderly population.|$|E
50|$|The European Working Group on <b>Sarcopenia</b> in Older People (EWGSOP) {{developed}} a clinical definition and consensus diagnostic criteria for age-related <b>sarcopenia,</b> using {{the presence of}} low muscle mass and either low muscular strength or low physical performance.

50|$|Exercise {{remains the}} {{intervention}} of choice for <b>sarcopenia</b> but translation of findings into clinical practice is challenging.

5000|$|<b>Sarcopenia</b> is the {{degenerative}} loss of {{skeletal muscle}} mass (0.5-1% loss per {{year after the}} age of 50), quality, and strength associated with aging. <b>Sarcopenia</b> is a component of the frailty syndrome. It is often a component of cachexia. It can also exist independently of cachexia; whereas cachexia includes malaise and is secondary to an underlying pathosis (such as cancer), <b>sarcopenia</b> may occur in healthy people and does not necessarily include malaise. The term is from Greek σάρξ sarx, [...] "flesh" [...] and πενία penia, [...] "poverty".|$|E

50|$|Sarcopenic {{obesity is}} a medical {{condition}} which {{is defined as the}} presence of both <b>sarcopenia</b> and obesity. <b>Sarcopenia</b> refers to the presence of low muscle mass and either low muscular strength or low physical performance.

5000|$|Simple {{circumference}} measurement {{does not}} provide enough data {{to determine whether or}} not an individual is suffering from severe <b>sarcopenia.</b> <b>Sarcopenia</b> is also marked by a decrease in the circumference of distinct types of muscle fibers.

During <b>sarcopenia,</b> there is a decrease in [...] "type 2" [...] fiber circumference (Type II), with little to no decrease in [...] "type I" [...] fiber circumference (Type I), and deinervated type 2 fibers are often converted to type 1 fibers by reinnervation by slow type 1 fiber motor nerves.|$|E

5000|$|During aging, {{there is}} a gradual {{decrease}} {{in the ability to}} maintain skeletal muscle function and mass, known as <b>sarcopenia.</b> The exact cause of <b>sarcopenia</b> is unknown, but it may be due to a combination of the gradual failure in the [...] "satellite cells" [...] that help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers, and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of critical secreted growth factors that are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival. <b>Sarcopenia</b> is a normal aspect of aging, and is not actually a disease state yet can be linked to many injuries in the elderly population as well as decreasing quality of life.|$|E

50|$|The Journal of Cachexia, <b>Sarcopenia</b> and Muscle is a {{quarterly}} peer-reviewed medical journal that covers research relevant {{to changes in}} body composition, especially cachexia and <b>sarcopenia,</b> as consequences of chronic illnesses or of the aging process, respectively. It was established in 2010 and was originally published by Springer Science+Business Media. As of January 2015, the journal is published by Wiley-Blackwell {{in association with the}} Society on <b>Sarcopenia,</b> Cachexia and Wasting Disorders. The founding editors-in-chief are Stefan D. Anker (Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin) and Stephan von Haehling (University of Göttingen). As of November 2016, the journal has two daughter journals entitled JCSM - Clinical Reports and JCSM - Rapid Communications, dedicated to clinical and basic science, respectively.|$|E

50|$|Testosterone {{or other}} {{anabolic}} steroids {{have also been}} investigated for treatment of <b>sarcopenia,</b> and seem to have some positive effects on muscle strength and mass, but cause several side effects and raise concerns of prostate cancer in men and virilization in women.

Other approved medications under investigation as possible treatments for <b>sarcopenia</b> include ghrelin, vitamin D, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and eicosapentaenoic acid.|$|E
50|$|Many {{opportunities}} {{remain for}} further refinement of reference populations by ethnic groups, and to further correlate the degrees of severity of <b>sarcopenia</b> to overt declines in functional performance (preferably using verified functional tests), {{as well as}} incidence of hospitalization admissions, morbidity, and mortality.

5000|$|<b>Sarcopenia</b> (from the Greek meaning [...] "poverty of flesh") {{refers to}} loss of muscle mass and low muscle {{function}} (strength or performance) that occurs {{as a result}} of old age. It is characterized first by a decrease in muscle mass, which causes weakness and frailty. However, this loss of muscle mass may be caused by different cellular mechanisms than those that cause muscle atrophy. For example, during <b>sarcopenia,</b> there is a replacement of muscle fibres with fat and an increase in fibrosis.|$|E

50|$|Cachexia {{is a major}} issue, {{especially}} in the elderly. Cachexia can occur in most major diseases including infections, cancer, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,and stroke. Skeletal muscle provides a fundamental basis for human function, enabling locomotion and respiration. Muscle wasting is related to a poor {{quality of life and}} increased morbidity / mortality.Two common but distinct conditions characterized by a loss of skeletal muscle mass are <b>sarcopenia</b> and cachexia. <b>Sarcopenia</b> and cachexia represent the major causes of muscle-wasting disorders.It has been known for millennia that muscle and fat wasting leads to poor outcomes including deaths in chronic disease states. It is usually accompanied by physical inactivity, decreased mobility, slow gait, and poor physical endurance which are also common features of the frailty syndrome.Cachexia and <b>sarcopenia</b> are both characterized by an important muscle dysfunction that leads to increased morbidity and mortality. The cost of muscle wasting is high.|$|E
