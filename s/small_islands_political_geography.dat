The concept of feminist geopolitics is employed and recast, both as a bridging concept between feminist and <b>political</b> <b>geography</b> and as an analytical approach that has political valence {{in the context of the}} war in Iraq.

It offers an account that narrates what I see as influential pathways and intersections, theoretical debates, and methodological developments {{that have shaped}} contemporary urban <b>political</b> <b>geographies</b> in this vein since the 1970 s, including: the ‘new urban politics’, intersections with postmodernism, and postcolonialism; urban neoliberalism and the contingency of urban politics; and, most recently, poststructural political economy {{and the notion of}} assemblage. This leads me to trace the implications of the shift in understanding from urban <b>political</b> <b>geography</b> to geographies of urban politics, and the growing emphasis on practice, contingency, relationality, and assemblage that accompany this shift. I conclude with reflections on new directions, new productive questions and tensions, and on the knowledge politics of how we do and might do contemporary urban <b>political</b> <b>geographies...</b>|$|R
