40|$|Previous {{research}} has found cultural differences {{in the frequency of}} support <b>seeking.</b> Asians and Asian Americans report <b>seeking</b> support from their close others to deal with their stress less often compared to European Americans. Similarly, other research on professional help <b>seeking</b> has shown that Asians and Asian Americans are less likely than European Americans to <b>seek</b> professional psychological help. Previous studies link this difference to multitude of factors, such as cultural stigma and reliance on informal social networks. The present research examined another explanation for cultural differences in professional help <b>seeking.</b> We predicted that the observed cultural difference in professional help <b>seeking</b> is an extension of culture-specific interpersonal relationship patterns. In the present research, undergraduate students in Japan and the United States completed the Inventory of Attitudes toward <b>Seeking</b> Mental Health Services (IASMHS), which measures professional help <b>seeking</b> propensity, psychological openness to acknowledging psychological problems, and indifference to the stigma of <b>seeking</b> professional help. The results showed that Japanese reported greater reluctance to <b>seek</b> professional help compared to Americans. Moreover, the relationship between culture and professional help <b>seeking</b> attitudes was partially mediated by use of social support <b>seeking</b> among close others. The implications of cultural differences in professional help <b>seeking</b> and the relationship between support <b>seeking</b> and professional help <b>seeking</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of academic help <b>seeking</b> studies worldwide have predominantly used the quantitative paradigm {{and have been}} undertaken in the secondary and primary sector. This project addresses a perceived gap in the research as it was conducted in a tertiary institution‟s learning centre in Aotearoa, New Zealand using Constructivist Grounded Theory {{in order to gain}} a deeper understanding of tertiary students‟ academic help <b>seeking.</b> Help <b>seeking</b> theory was reconceptualised in order to provide a more descriptive model of the process, than had previously occurred because of the quantitative nature of the {{majority of}} the previous help <b>seeking</b> studies. Eight participants from a tertiary institute‟s learning centre were interviewed about their motivation to <b>seek</b> academic help; were videoed during a learning support session; and then interviewed regarding this session. Grounded theory was used to analyse the data from both interviews and the videoed learning support session. Four aspects were indentified that motivated participants to <b>seek</b> academic help: the recognition of the need for help; views of help seeking; participants‟ views of themselves as help seekers; and confidence. Two previously theorised types of help <b>seeking,</b> executive and instrumental help <b>seeking,</b> were confirmed in the videoed learning support sessions. Two new types were also identified, executive/instrumental and instrumental/executive help <b>seeking,</b> which were combinations of previously identified help <b>seeking</b> types. Help <b>seeking</b> approach was also discerned as different from help <b>seeking</b> type. Help <b>seeking</b> approach was theorised as a state that seemed to be a background against which the four help <b>seeking</b> types occurred. Behavioural precipitators of academic help <b>seeking</b> were identified as either tutor or student initiated and were further categorised as prompts, pressures, permissions and provocations. A tentative overall model of tertiary help <b>seeking</b> was developed. iv The findings of this study indicate that external pressures or permissions precipitated executive or instrumental help <b>seeking,</b> whereas external prompts precipitated executive/instrumental or instrumental/executive help <b>seeking</b> and provocation precipitators led to executive/instrumental, instrumental/executive or instrumental help <b>seeking.</b> Recommendations for practitioners include being aware of the four different help <b>seeking</b> types used by tertiary students, and that tutor actions can precipitate any of the four help <b>seeking</b> types dependent on the help <b>seeking</b> approach displayed by students. Recommendations also highlight that tutors need to be aware that student confidence is an important element in <b>seeking</b> help, and that students may not always see help <b>seeking</b> as positive.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses {{data from}} the National Survey of Fertility Barriers (NSFB), a nationally representative sample, to assess factors associated with face-to-face and internet help <b>seeking</b> (study 1) and perceived social support (study 2). In study one, I examine whether the General Help <b>Seeking</b> Model, a theory {{that has been used}} to explain in-person help <b>seeking,</b> generalizes to internet help <b>seeking.</b> I assess four types of help seeking: (1) no help <b>seeking,</b> (2) only internet help <b>seeking,</b> (3) only medical help <b>seeking,</b> and (4) both online and medical help <b>seeking.</b> Results suggest that online help <b>seeking</b> is differentiated from in person help <b>seeking</b> by attitudes towards medical science, infertility stigma, age, income, and educational attainment. In study two I explore whether the type of help <b>seeking</b> that individuals engage in and the types of activities that people do online are associated with perceived social support. Perceived social support does not differ by type of help <b>seeking,</b> nor are the types of online activities associated with perceptions of social support. Finally, I provide descriptive information on patterns of infertility help <b>seeking</b> on the internet – information that is important as the use of the internet for health related activities continues to grow. I show that use of the internet varies by several individual and social characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} three help-seeking behaviors: willingness to <b>seek</b> help, type of disorder, and {{stigma attached to}} <b>seeking</b> help. One hundred and thirteen college students {{participated in the study}} by responding to a seven-question survey. Perceived stigma or shame for <b>seeking</b> help for sexual abuse or domestic violence did not affect college student’s willingness to <b>seek</b> help. When responding to questions regarding the importance of <b>seeking</b> help from someone they trust or from a trained therapist; the results indicated that college students prefer to <b>seek</b> help from someone they trust rather than from a trained therapist. This study looked at willingness to <b>seek</b> help for depression, sexual abuse and domestic violence. There were no gender differences; participants <b>seek</b> help for domestic violence and depression equally. There is a negative relationship between <b>seeking</b> help for sexual abuse and depression, indicating willingness to <b>seek</b> help for depression decreased as willingness to <b>seek</b> help for sexual abuse increased. This study showed that there is no stigma or shame attached to <b>seeking</b> help for sexual abuse or domestic violence among the college students that participated.

40|$|Literature {{suggests}} that lawyers report experiencing psychological distress {{in excess of}} the general population. Epidemiological research has identified an under utilization of mental health services by those in need of mental health treatment. This study investigated the attitudes and beliefs lawyers have about <b>seeking</b> professional mental health services to ascertain the determinants related to their intention to <b>seek</b> treatment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify factors that influence lawyers 2 ̆ 7 intention to <b>seek</b> psychological services. The Attitudes and Belief about <b>Seeking</b> Professional Mental Health Treatment Questionnaire was sent to l, 429 lawyers in Wisconsin. Four hundred eleven surveys were returned with 405 analyzed in this study. The determinants of intention to <b>seek</b> mental health treatment were isolated using the Theory of Reasoned Action and Theory of Planned Behavior. Multiple regression analyses indicated that attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control predicted lawyers 2 ̆ 7 intention to <b>seek</b> treatment. Attitude toward <b>seeking</b> mental health services was found to contribute more to the prediction of intention than subjective norm or perceived behavioral control. Lawyers who reported an intention to <b>seek</b> psychological treatment were contrasted with lawyers who reported an intention not to <b>seek</b> treatment. Lawyers who intended to <b>seek</b> treatment were more likely to have a favorable attitude toward <b>seeking</b> psychological treatment, believe they would want to comply with important referents that would want them to <b>seek</b> treatment, and have confidence they could <b>seek</b> treatment. Lawyers who intended to <b>seek</b> treatment were more likely to accept negative consequences that may result from <b>seeking</b> services. Lawyers who intended to <b>seek</b> treatment also found it easier to admit they had a problem, decide that treatment may help, decide to <b>seek</b> treatment, and make an appointment, than those who did not intend to <b>seek</b> treatment. Lawyers with prior treatment experience were found to be more likely to intend to <b>seek</b> treatment than those who did not have prior treatment experience. This study isolated factors that influence lawyers 2 ̆ 7 intention to <b>seek</b> treatment that can be used to design interventions that increase the number of lawyers who <b>seek</b> professional mental health services...|$|R

40|$|Individuals with {{depression}} {{can engage in}} aversive interpersonal behaviours, such as excessive reassurance <b>seeking</b> and negative feedback <b>seeking,</b> which can themselves be associated with problematic social relationships. Excessive reassurance <b>seeking</b> is characterized by repeatedly <b>seeking</b> information about one's worth or lovability, whereas negative feedback <b>seeking</b> is characterized by repeatedly <b>seeking</b> negative information about oneself that confirms one's negative self-views. There have been few studies to date that look at both of these seemingly irreconcilable behaviours and their relation to depression, and research has yet to fully support an integrative model that links the two {{with depression}}. This study further examined the associations between excessive reassurance <b>seeking,</b> negative feedback <b>seeking,</b> and depression within a clinical sample of 31 participants. Evidence was found for an association between excessive reassurance <b>seeking</b> and depressive symptoms, but no such association was found for negative feedback <b>seeking</b> and depressive symptoms. Perceived rejection fully mediated the association between excessive reassurance <b>seeking</b> and depression, {{but there was no}} evidence to suggest that self-esteem acted as a moderator of the associations between excessive reassurance <b>seeking,</b> negative feedback <b>seeking,</b> perceived rejection, and depressive symptoms. Implications for an integrated model are discussed, as are directions for future research. By understanding more about the associations between these behaviours and clinical depression, interventions can be developed that are aimed at reducing such problematic behaviours.
