5|$|While {{driving through}} {{a rural area}} in Georgia, Peter and his group are pulled over by the local sheriff, and Peter makes every effort to talk as annoyingly and rudely to him as possible. But the Sheriff is more {{offended}} by Cleveland's attempt to calmingly explain themselves, punching out one of their headlights and then planting a bag of marijuana in their trunk. The group are then sent to a county work camp where {{they are forced to}} perform various tasks, including ditch digging and rock crushing. As their stay in the jail supposedly comes to an end, the warden then approaches them and tells them that their stay has been extended an additional thirty days. Learning from another prisoner that they might be locked up forever, the group decides {{to break out of the}} prison when the prison guards's eyes are diverted. Successful in their attempt, they soon come across a house where they discover a set of handcuff and <b>shackle</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the middle}} of the 19th century, [...] "Scandinavian" [...] style locks, or [...] "Polhem locks", invented by the eponymous Swedish {{inventor}} Christopher Polhem, became a more secure alternative to the prevailing smokehouse and screw locks. These locks had a cast iron body that was loaded with a stack of rotating disks. Each disk had a central cutout to allow the key to pass through them and two notches cut out {{on the edge of the}} disc. When locked, the discs passed through cut-outs on the <b>shackle.</b> The <b>key</b> rotated each disk until the notches, placed along the edge of each tumbler in different places, lined up with the shackle, allowing the shackle to slide out of the body. The McWilliams company received a patent for these locks in 1871. The [...] "Scandinavian" [...] design was so successful that JHW Climax & Co. of Newark, New Jersey continued to make these padlocks until the 1950s. Today, other countries are still manufacturing this style of padlock.|$|R
40|$|The Irish dramatist George Bernard Shaw {{has been}} ranked {{by many as}} the {{greatest}} English playwright since Shakespeare and he is also the fine successor and the loyal disciple of Henrik Ibsen. The Devil’s Disciple, published in 1897, is one of Shaw’s three "Plays For Puritans" and his only full-length play with a purely American atmosphere which stabilized his career as a successful dramatist in English stage. The Devil’s Disciple shows the sense of resentment and fear that were felt during the American Revolution towards Britain’s imperialism. This study intends to search into the world of American colonists and manifests their sense of fear, meanwhile, focuses on the protagonist, Richard, who with the stability on his false identity jeopardizes his life in search of freedom for his nation in order to free them from the <b>shackles</b> of Britain. <b>Key</b> words: Nation; Self-sacrifice; Deliverance; The devil’s disciple; Britain; Imperialism...|$|R
50|$|A rigging knife is a {{specially}} designed knife used to cut heavy rope. It may have a serrated edge for sawing through line, or a heavy blade suitable for hitting with a mallet to drive the knife through. Folding tools, often in combination with a marlinspike and <b>shackle</b> <b>key,</b> are convenient and portable. Rigger Brion Toss recommends fixed blade rigging knives for easy access in time sensitive situations and when working aloft.|$|E
50|$|The pin is {{threaded}} and one {{leg of the}} shackle is tapped. The pin may be captive, which means it is mated to the shackle, usually with a wire. The threads may gall if overtightened or have been corroding in salty air, so a liberal coating of lanolin or a heavy grease {{is not out of}} place on any and all threads. A <b>shackle</b> <b>key</b> or metal marlinspike are useful tools for loosening a tight nut.|$|E
50|$|Elizabeth awakens {{in a room}} of a nightmarish, {{abandoned}} complex, {{chained to}} a wall with a GoPro stapled to her forehead. A computer is in the room, forcing her to chat with the abducted Damien, who informs her {{that there are many}} other attackers. She is also shown a recorded video of Max being strangled with plastic wrap by the killers. Damien is then beaten and taken away to presumably be killed off-screen. Afterwards, another hooded man enters the room with Elizabeth, preparing to kill her, but she overpowers him and strangles him with her chain. Unlocking her <b>shackles</b> with his <b>keys,</b> she attempts to escape the dark complex, armed with a discarded hammer. She is chased by a number of killers, one of whom is a young man who she attacks, demanding to know where Damien is; he tells her that he is not there. She manages to escape to aboveground, bludgeoning other attackers before hijacking one of their cars, but crashes when blindsided by another member's car; she is removed from the wreck by the killers and dragged back to the complex.|$|R
