40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure for prediction of the cyclic plasticity effects {{on both the}} structural fatigue life to crack initiation {{and the rate of}} crack growth is presented. The crack initiation criterion is based on the Coffin-Manson formulae extended for multiaxial stress state and for inclusion of the mean stress effect. This criterion is also applied for the accumulated damage ahead of the existing crack tip which is assumed {{to be related to the}} crack growth rate. Three cyclic plasticity models, based on the concept of combination of several yield surfaces, are employed for computing the crack growth rate of a crack plane <b>stress</b> <b>panel</b> under several cyclic loading conditions...|$|E

40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{residential}} mobility decision-making {{focus on the}} housing and neighbourhood satisfaction and pre-move thoughts of individuals. This implicitly assumes that individual evaluations represent the wider household unit. However, if partners in a couple do not share evaluations of dwelling or neighbourhood quality or do not agree on whether moving is (un) desirable, ignoring these disagreements will lead to an inaccurate assessment {{of the strength of}} the links between moving desires and actual moves. Although overlooked in studies of residential mobility, partner disagreement {{plays an important role in}} the literature on family migration. This study is, therefore, one of the first to investigate disagreements in moving desires between partners and the subsequent consequences of such disagreements for moving behaviour. Drawing on British Household Panel Survey data and concepts from family migration studies, we find that disagreement about the desirability of moving is most likely where partners do not share perceptions of housing <b>stress.</b> <b>Panel</b> logistic regression models show that the moving desires of both partners interact to affect the moving behaviour of couples.

40|$|Abstract In {{aquaculture}} management it {{is important}} to establish objective criteria to assess health and welfare of the fish. Here we show that European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) confronted with husbandry-associated stress (tank cleaning, i. e. scrubbing, and water temperature variation) during early life stages show poorer survival and disease resistance as juveniles. We evaluated several parameters for stress (plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate, hydromineral status), growth performance, the immune response (plasma IgM levels) and the effects of a nodavirus challenge. Principal component analysis allowed the establishment of a <b>stress</b> <b>panel</b> including plasma cortisol, osmolality, IgM levels and weight. Sea bass juveniles reared during early life in high and constant temperature perform best in terms of stress-related parameters assessed by principle component analysis. Variable water temperature triggers dramatic changes in plasma cortisol, osmolality, IgM levels, body weight and susceptibility to nodavirus that suggest a strong and prolonged activation of the HPI axis. Scrubbing induces some disturbances typical for mild short-term, acute stress, viz. increased plasma osmolality and decreased IgM levels, but does not affect plasma cortisol, growth or susceptibility to nodavirus of sea bass. Our data fit well with the concept of allostasis. We discuss the relevance of our work for sea bass aquaculture...|$|E
40|$|Animal welfare can be {{assessed}} by measurements of relevant stress markers. The adrenal cortex response does occur in diverse difficult situations and is useful in welfare assessment, in particular the production of cortisol acts in providing extra energy for forthcoming activity. Furthermore, {{a high level of}} ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species), due to an increased production of oxidant species and/or a decreased efficacy of antioxidant system, can lead to oxidative stress, an emerging health risk factor involved in the aging and in a lot of diseases. The reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) are used as an index to determine the level of oxidative stress (oxidant capacity) by measuring the amount of organic hydroperoxide (ROOH) converted into radicals that oxidize N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine [1, 2]. The present study was performed on wild boars (Sus scrofa) bred in the wild of two areas (C 1 and D 1) of a 820 hectares wood belonging to Campania Region, included in the “Cilento e Vallo di Diano” National Park. The wood is made up of Quercus cerris and Castano sativa, mixed mesoxerofil conifer. Blood samples, from the jugular vein, were collected from 15 and 18 wild boars of the C 1 and D 1 areas respectively, during the routine sanitary control. On the serum, cortisol and ROMs (DIACRON, Grosseto, Italy) were evaluated. The results are shown in Table 1. Cortisol was higher in D 1 than in C 1 area, but there was not any significative difference; ROMs in D 1 were significantly higher than C 1 area, with P< 0. 05. Brambilla et al. [3] reported oxidative <b>stress</b> <b>panel</b> in swine and wild boar as welfare parameter.

Surprisingly, while financial stress that results in either cash flow problems or financial hardship is related to poorer mental health, once we account for individual-specific fixed effects, the associations become statistically insignificant. More importantly though, there is strong evidence that women in financially stressed households experience a large deterioration in mental health if their partners lose their jobs involuntarily. This effect is particularly large if the family was experiencing financial hardship (0.29 SD) but is also evident if the family experienced cash flow problems (0.17 SD).|$|R

50|$|Although foam-core panels gained {{attention}} in the 1970s, {{the idea of using}} <b>stress</b> skinned <b>panels</b> for construction began in the 1930s. Research and testing of the technology was done primarily by Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) in Madison, Wisconsin as part of a U.S. Forest Service attempt to conserve forest resources. In 1937, a small stressed-skin house was constructed and garnered enough attention to bring in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to dedicate the house. In a testament to the durability of such panel structures, it has endured the severe Wisconsin climate and was used by University of Wisconsin-Madison as a day care center up until 1998 when it was removed {{to make way for a}} new Pharmacy School building.

40|$|Panel flutter is {{the self}} excited {{oscillations}} of a plate in supersonic flow.

For a more thorough understanding of panel flutter behavior, the geometric nonlinearity effects due to large deflections {{must be considered in}} the formulation. The Galerkin's method was used in the investigation of limit cycle oscillations of panels in supersonic flow in the spatial domain, and the panel deflections.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of general European rules {{for the design of}} aluminium structures, specific rules for the design of aluminum <b>stressed</b> skin <b>panels</b> are available. These design rules have been used for the optimization of two extrusion products: one for explosions and wind load governing and one for explosions and floor load governing. The optimized extrusions fulfill Class 3 section properties, leading to weight reductions up to 25 % of regularly-used shear panel sections. When the design is based on Class 4 section properties, even more weight reduction may be reached. The typical failure mode of the optimized <b>stressed</b> skin <b>panels</b> depends on the applied height of the hat stiffeners. For sections using relatively high hat stiffeners, failure is introduced by yielding of the heat-affected zone.

For sections using relatively low hat stiffeners, failure is introduced by global buckling. For this type of cross-section, Eurocode 9 gives rather conservative results...|$|R

40|$|A {{room and}} pillar coal {{operation}} in central Pennsylvania was experiencing roof cutters and long running roof falls caused by high horizontal stresses. The roof conditions created hazards for the miners, and caused several production panels to be abandoned prematurely. The mine requested assistance from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in applying the "advance and relieve" mining to reduce the affects of the horizontal <b>stress</b> during <b>panel</b> development. The "advance and relieve" plan that was developed called for removing a pillar {{on one side of}} the panel as it was being advanced, thus creating a cave. The caving then relieved a portion of the horizontal <b>stress</b> across the <b>panel.</b> Because the horizontal stress direction is key to the success of this method, stress mapping as well as mining experience was used to establish the direction of the horizontal stress. Subsequent field measurements provided an estimate of the <b>stress</b> magnitude. Three <b>panels</b> were mined using this technique, and good roof conditions were achieved in all these panels. Instrumentation was used to monitor the stress changes in the roof created by the cave. Stress relief of over 1, 000 psi was measured 120 ft from the cave and to depths of 20 ft into the roof. The lateral extent of the stress relief zone across the panels appears to be about 400 to 500 ft.
