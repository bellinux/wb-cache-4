Although seizing Viipuri offered major advantages, the lack of combat skills of his army and potential for a major counterattack by the enemy in the area or in the <b>south-west</b> made it too risky.|$|E

5|$|The slate {{deposits}} of Wales belong to three geological series: Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian. The Cambrian deposits run <b>south-west</b> from Conwy to near Criccieth; these deposits were quarried in the Penrhyn and Dinorwig quarries {{and in the}} Nantlle Valley. There are smaller outcrops elsewhere, for example on Anglesey. The Ordovician deposits run <b>south-west</b> from Betws-y-Coed to Porthmadog; these were the deposits mined at Blaenau Ffestiniog. There is another band of Ordovician slate further south, running from Llangynnog to Aberdyfi, quarried mainly in the Corris area, with a few outcrops in <b>south-west</b> Wales, notably Pembrokeshire. The Silurian deposits are mainly further east in the Dee valley and around Machynlleth.|$|E
5|$|The <b>south–west</b> Monsoon from June to September {{accounts}} {{for most of}} the rainfall in the region. The Arabian Sea branch of the <b>south-west</b> monsoon hits the Western Ghats along the coastal state of Kerala and moves northwards along the Konkan coast with precipitation on coastal areas, west of the Western Ghats. The lofty Western Ghats prevent the winds from reaching the Deccan Plateau - hence the leeward region (the region that deprived of winds) receives very little rainfall. The Bay of Bengal branch of <b>south-west</b> monsoon heads toward north east India, picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The Coramandel coast does not receive much rainfall from the <b>south-west</b> monsoon due to the shape of the land. Tamil Nadu and southeast Andhra Pradesh receive rains from the north–east Monsoon. The north-east monsoon take place from November to early March when the surface high-pressure system is strongest. The North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones occur throughout the year in Bay of Bengal and Arabian sea bringing devastating winds and heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|At the 22nd {{hurricane}} {{committee in}} 2000 {{it was decided}} that tropical cyclones that moved from the Atlantic to the Eastern Pacific basin and vice versa would no longer be renamed. Ahead of the 2000–01 season it was decided to start using male names, as well as female names for tropical cyclones developing in the <b>South-West</b> Indian Ocean. RSMC La Reunion subsequently proposed to the fifteenth session of the RA I Tropical Cyclone Committee for the <b>South-West</b> Indian Ocean during September 2001, that the basin adopt a single circular list of names. Along with the RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee, RSMC La Reunion also proposed to the session that a tropical cyclone have only one name during its lifetime. However, both of these proposals were rejected in favour of continuing an annual list of names and to rename systems when they moved across 90°E into the <b>South-West</b> Indian Ocean. During the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season the naming of subtropical cyclones restarted, with names assigned to systems from the main list of names drawn up for that year.|$|E
