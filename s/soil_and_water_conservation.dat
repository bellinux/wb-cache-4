40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to investigate the changes of runoff and sediment load and their potential influencing factors in the Huangfuchuan catchment. The Mann-Kendall test and accumulative anomaly methods were, respectively, applied to examine the changing trends and abrupt changes. Both annual runoff and sediment load demonstrated significant reduction (p< 0. 05) with decreasing rates of − 3. 2 × 106 [*]m 3 /a and − 1. 09 [*]Mt/a, respectively. The abrupt changes were detected in 1979 and 1996 for the runoff and sediment load. All the runoff and sediment indices (runoff, sediment load, runoff coefficient, and sediment concentration) exhibited remarkable reduction (p< 0. 01). The climate variability contributed 24. 4 % and 25. 1 % during 1980 – 1996 and 1997 – 2010 to annual runoff decrease, respectively, and human activities accounted for the remaining 75. 6 % and 74. 9 %. In contrast, changes in precipitation accounted for 43. 5 % and 20. 2 % of sediment load reduction during 1980 – 1996 and 1997 – 2010, whereas the human activities contributed 56. 5 % and 79. 8 %, respectively.

40|$|Variation of streamflow and {{sediment}} load in the Yellow River basin has received considerable attention {{due to its}} drastic reduction {{during the past several}} decades. This paper presents a detailed investigation on the changes of streamflow {{and sediment}} load from 1952 to 2011 using monthly observations at four gauging stations along the Yellow River. The results show significant decreasing trends for both streamflow and sediment load at all four gauging stations over the past 60 years. The wavelet transform demonstrated discontinuous periodicities from 1969 to 1973 and after 1986 due to the construction of large reservoirs and implementation of numerous <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>conservations</b> practices. The sediment rating curves with the power-law function was applied to investigate the relationship between discharge and sediment load. The results indicate distinct variations of the relationship between streamflow and sediment and implied significant hydro-morphological changes within different periods. The reducing sediment supply from the source region and the increased erosive power of the river are detected at Lanzhou station, while the decrease of the transport capacity at Toudaoguai is caused by severe siltation. Significant changes in the relationship between streamflow and sediment load are found at Huayuankou and Gaocun stations, which are largely induced by evident sediment income and trapping effects of large reservoirs. It is estimated that numerous reservoirs have strongly altered the regime and magnitude of streamflow and trapped large amount of sediment, leading to severe siltation and evident reduction of their total volumes.
