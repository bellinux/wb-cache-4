5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory <b>sequence</b> (<b>and</b> bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E

5|$|HD 28185 {{is similar}} to our Sun in terms of mass, radius, and luminosity. The star is on the main <b>sequence</b> <b>and</b> is {{generating}} energy by fusing hydrogen in its core.

The star rotates slower than the Sun, with a period of around 30 days, compared to 25.4 days for the Sun.|$|E

5|$|In biology, Holliday {{junctions}} {{are a key}} intermediate in {{many types}} of genetic recombination, {{as well as in}} double-strand break repair. These junctions usually have a symmetrical <b>sequence</b> <b>and</b> are thus mobile, meaning that the four individual arms may slide through the junction in a specific pattern that largely preserves base pairing. Additionally, four-arm junctions similar to Holliday junctions appear in some functional RNA molecules.|$|E
5|$|MAR used {{separate}} transmitter and receivers, {{a necessity}} {{at the time}} due {{to the size of}} the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each transmitter antenna was fed by its own power amplifier using travelling wave tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in <b>sequence</b> <b>and</b> the receivers had three channels, one tuned to each part of the pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send each part of the signal to different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.|$|E

5|$|Since all PID bytes include four 0bits, {{they leave}} the bus in the full-bandwidth Kstate, {{which is the same}} as the low-bandwidth Jstate. It is {{followed}} by a brief pause, during which hubs enable their low-bandwidth outputs, already idling in the Jstate. Then a low-bandwidth packet follows, beginning with a sync <b>sequence</b> <b>and</b> PID byte, and ending with a brief period of SE0. Full-bandwidth devices other than hubs can simply ignore the PRE packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.|$|E
40|$|In {{forming a}} {{complete}} schedule for jobs (such as instructions on a processor capable of multiple instruction issue), two independent operations occur: sequencing {{of the jobs}} and scheduling those prioritized jobs. This paper discusses {{the importance of the}} distinction between <b>sequencing</b> <b>and</b> scheduling, and gives a number of examples based on instruction scheduling to clarify the differences. It then discusses the application of Genetic Algorithms to different types of <b>sequencing</b> <b>and</b> scheduling problems. 1 Introduction In much of the current literature the terms <b>sequencing</b> <b>and</b> scheduling are used interchangeably; indeed Coffman [Cof 76] explicitly endorses this fact. The reason for the duplicity of the terms is probably {{due to the fact that}} the two operations are usually either intimately tied together or irrelevant to each other. Indeed, for many scheduling tasks <b>sequencing</b> is required <b>and</b> implicit. Four different combinations of <b>sequencing</b> <b>and</b> scheduling, and the need for explicit deli [...] ...|$|R
