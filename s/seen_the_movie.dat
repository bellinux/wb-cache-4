500|$|The film's retitling by AIP {{caused a}} minor fracas in Hong Kong. A group of British sailors had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> {{at the base}} cinema under its {{original}} title and one week later unwittingly saw the movie again in a local cinema, playing under the American release title. They immediately demanded their money back and, when the manager refused, they tipped over litter bins, threw popcorn at the screen, and [...] "almost tore the theatre apart." [...] The manager {{changed his mind and}} paid the sailors back for the price of the tickets, and sent a bill to AIP for the damages.|$|E
500|$|Designer Milton Knight {{recalled}} that [...] "audiences actually wanted a wilder, raunchier Cool World. The premiere audience I saw it with certainly did." [...] The critical {{reaction to the}} film was generally negative. Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "The DJ who was hosting the radio station's free preview of Cool World leaped onto the stage and promised the audience: 'If you liked Roger Rabbit, you'll love Cool World!' He was wrong, but you can't blame him—he hadn't <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie.</b> I have, and I will now promise {{you that if you}} liked Roger Rabbit, quit while you're ahead."

[...] Tito Puente praised the film prior to its {{theatrical}} release, stating, [...] "I've <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> twice, and I loved it the second time.

[...] "I had just <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> and I was like, 'Hey, there you go.'" [...] he said. While Flanders serves as the segment's antagonist, the role would originally go to Grampa, who would chase Homer inside a roller disco. While Grampa does not appear in the segment, the Springfield Roller Disco is seen during the Simpsons escape from Flanders. Despite serving as writer for the segment, Cary left the series after finishing the first draft in order to work on the animated Austin Powers series, which never came to fruition. In his absence, the writing staff rewrote {{the last quarter of the}} segment and added the revelation that Flanders is a werewolf. In order to dispose of Ned Flanders' corpse, Homer throws his body into Flanders' house. After he is finished, he says [...] "That's the end of that chapter", a phrase that Cary often uses in his everyday life. [...] "That's just something that comes up a lot in my life is when no matter if it's a good or a bad thing, just move on" [...] he said.|$|E

[...] If you have <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> but not read the novel, you should note that Doctor Sleep follows the latter which is, in my opinion, the True History of the Torrance Family." ...|$|E

He changed his name to Afrika Bambaataa Aasim, adopting the name of the Zulu chief Bhambatha, who led an armed rebellion against unfair economic practices in early 20th century South Africa.

5000|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the film Peele was worried about its chances of success, telling the Los Angeles Time [...] "I thought, ‘What if white people don’t want to come <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> because they’re afraid of being villain-ized with black people in the crowd? What if black people don’t want to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> because they don’t want to sit next to a white person while a black person is being victimized on-screen?’" [...] however Peele noted that much of his fear was due to [...] " [...] the {{darkness}} of my imagination" ...|$|R

2500|$|A five-year {{investigation}} by Benjamin Radford, documented in his 2011 book Tracking the Chupacabra, {{concluded that the}} description given by the original eyewitness in Puerto Rico, Madelyne Tolentino, {{was based on the}} creature Sil in the science-fiction horror film Species. The alien creature Sil is nearly identical to Tolentino’s chupacabra eyewitness account and she had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> before her report: [...] "It was a creature that looked like the chupacabra, with spines on its back and all... The resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive," [...] Tolentino reported. Radford revealed that Tolentino [...] "believed that the creatures and events she saw in Species were happening in reality in Puerto Rico at the time," [...] and therefore concludes that [...] "the most important chupacabra description cannot be trusted." [...] This, Radford believes, seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal.|$|E
2500|$|Wes Anderson {{originally}} {{intended for the}} film's soundtrack to be entirely made up of songs by The Kinks, feeling the music suited Max's loud and angry nature, and because Max was initially envisioned to be a British exchange student. However, while Anderson listened to a compilation of other British Invasion songs on the set, the soundtrack gradually evolved until only one song by the Kinks remained in the film ("Nothin' in the World Can Stop Me Worryin' 'Bout That Girl"). According to Anderson, [...] "Max always wears a blazer and the British Invasion sounds like music made by guys in blazers, but still rock 'n' roll". In his review for Entertainment Weekly, Rob Brunner gave the soundtrack record an [...] "A-" [...] rating and wrote, [...] "this collection won't make much sense if you haven't <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie.</b> But for anyone who left the theater singing along to the Faces' [...] "Ooh La La", it's an essential soundtrack".|$|E

[...] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> and [...] "liked it".
