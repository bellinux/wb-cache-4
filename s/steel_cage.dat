5|$|Edge and Batista also {{continued}} their rivalry over the World Heavyweight Championship after Batista defeated Mark Henry, Kane and Finlay in a Fatal Four-Way match {{to become the}} number one Contender to the title. On the June 1 episode of SmackDown!, Batista verbally and physically confronted Edge on the SmackDown! debut of Edge's Cutting Edge talk show. At One Night Stand, Edge and Batista faced {{each other in a}} <b>Steel</b> <b>cage</b> match for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge retained his title after escaping the <b>steel</b> <b>cage</b> first.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ric Flair defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Triple H inside a <b>Steel</b> <b>Cage,</b> which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent Flair head-first into the <b>steel</b> <b>cage,</b> bloodying Flair's from the head. In one point, Triple H {{retrieved}} a steel chain, {{wrapped it around}} his fist and attempted a diving fist drop from the top turnbuckle. However, Flair countered, raising his foot to Triple H's face and performed a series of knife edged chops. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock, a signature move of Flair's, resulting in Flair sending him towards the <b>steel</b> <b>cage.</b> After that, Flair bit Triple H's head, bloodying him from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either {{in a corner of}} the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match ended when Flair reversed a Pedigree with a back body drop and hit Triple H with a steel chair thrice, allowing Flair to escape through the <b>steel</b> <b>cage</b> door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental title.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a {{standard}} wrestling match, in which Kurt Angle defeated WWE Champion John Cena, after Cena used the Championship belt on Angle, {{leading to a}} disqualification. In WWE, a championship cannot change hands via countout or disqualification, as a result, Cena retained the title. Two featured bouts on the undercard was another standard match, in which Shawn Michaels defeated Chris Masters. The other primary match was a <b>steel</b> <b>cage</b> match, where the ring is enclosed by a <b>steel</b> <b>cage,</b> in which Matt Hardy defeated Edge.|$|E

5|$|On the May 11 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, The Undertaker defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Batista in a <b>Steel</b> <b>cage</b> match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, {{or against the}} edges of a wrestling ring. Both men escaped the <b>steel</b> <b>cage</b> at the same time, and The Undertaker was {{therefore}} declared still the champion. After the match, Mark Henry returned and attacked The Undertaker.

5|$|The {{predominant}} feud on the SmackDown! brand {{was between}} Edge and Batista, {{with the two}} feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. The feud started on the May 11 episode of SmackDown! when Batista challenged The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Championship in a <b>steel</b> <b>cage</b> match. Both men escaped the <b>steel</b> <b>cage</b> at the same time, thus ending in a draw. After the match, Mark Henry made his return and attacked The Undertaker. Edge then defeated The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Championship after cashing in his Money in the Bank contract, {{which is used to}} receive a title match of the owner's time and place of choosing. On the May 18 episode of SmackDown!, Batista confronted Edge and challenged him to a match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Judgment Day.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical research {{referred to the}} flexural behavior of external R. C. joints strengthened with <b>steel</b> <b>cages</b> constituted by <b>steel</b> angles and battens is presented. The subassemblage (beam, column and joint) was subjected to a constant vertical load acting on the column and to a monotonically increasing lateral force applied {{at the tip of}} the beam. The control specimen is without strengthening system and it was designed with weak column and strong beam and overstrength in the joint region. Strengthening cases here studied refer to <b>steel</b> <b>caging</b> in the column and both in the beam and in the column. Cyclic response in term of load-displacement curves, crack patterns and observation of failure mode types were the main results of the experimental results. Results highlight the effectiveness of the external <b>steel</b> <b>cages</b> as strengthening system, which increases the flexural strength and allows one to move the failure mode from the column to the beam. A simplified analytical model is proposed that can be used for pushover analysis and is able to reproduce the flexural behavior of external beam-column joints under monotonic loading. The model includes shear-to-moment interaction for beams and columns and confinement effects induced by external <b>steel</b> <b>cages.</b> The model is based on the determination of elastic-plastic behavior of the beam and of the columns, the latter being obtained from knowledge of the ultimate moment associated with the design axial force and deduced through a simplified moment-axial force domain. The joint was modeled with a strut and tie model in which concrete crushing and yielding of stirrups are the only limit states considered. Finally, a comparison between experimental load-deflection curves and analytical prediction is made showing good agreement...|$|R

40|$|Low {{carbon steel}} S 15 CK was {{nitrided}} by active screen plasma nitriding (ASPN) using various stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cages</b> {{to investigate the}} effect of the cage on the nitriding properties. Three types of austenitic stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cages,</b> such as pipe, foil, and wire mesh, were used. The sample was treated for 18 ks at 773 K under 630 Pa in 50 % N 2 + 50 % H 2 gases. The nitrided samples were characterized by surface roughness tests, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and microhardness testing. In all samples nitrided by the ASPN process, the ‘edging effect’ was completely eliminated whereas hardness and thickness of the surface layer were comparable with those obtained from the DC plasma nitriding. Moreover, a comparison of the screens used in the ASPN process revealed that the screen hole size had a slight influence on surface properties such as microstructure and hardness. 本文はJ-STAGEにリンクしています[URL]...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Intravenous {{endotoxin}} {{has been}} shown to trigger a delayed pulmonary hypertensive response that varies widely in magnitude and duration among individ-ual broilers. It was proposed that this individual variabil-ity may reflect immunological differences acquired dur-ing previous respiratory challenges that might have sub-sequently altered the endotoxin-initiated biochemical cascade. In Experiment 1, we tested the hypothesis that, when compared with broilers reared in clean stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cages</b> (Cage group), broilers reared on floor litter (Floor group) should experience a greater respiratory challenge and therefore may consistently exhibit a more enhanced pulmonary hypertensive response to intrave-nous endotoxin. Birds in the Cage group were grown in stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cages</b> at a low density (72 birds/ 8 m 2 chamber), and fecal and dander materials were removed daily. Birds in the Floor group were reared on wood-shavings litter at a higher density (110 birds/ 8 m 2 cham-ber). Pulmonary and systemic mean arterial pressures and blood-gas values were evaluated prior to and follow-ing the intravenous administration of 1 mg Salmonell...|$|R
5|$|The second {{main event}} {{resulted}} from events on SmackDown!, WWE's other main television program. In the match, Kurt Angle defended his WWE Championship against Brock Lesnar. The build-up to the match began on July 31, 2003 on {{an episode of}} SmackDown!. During an interview promotion in the ring, Lesnar challenged Angle to a rematch of their bout at Vengeance, WWE's previous pay-per-view event. The WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon, decided that Lesnar would have to earn his rematch by competing in a <b>steel</b> <b>cage</b> match against McMahon himself, and would take place on SmackDown! the following week, with Angle officiating as a special guest referee. The <b>Steel</b> <b>Cage</b> match resulted in neither wrestler winning the match, after McMahon and Lesnar attacked Angle.
