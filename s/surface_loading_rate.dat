The objectives were to prevent the stripping-loss of acetonitrile during aeration and to achieve acetonitrile biodegradation plus nitrogen removal simultaneously in a single biolfilm on the membranes. In the MABR, oxygen and substrates were supplied to the biofilm from opposite sides, in contrast to those from the same side in conventional biofilm bioreactors. Operational factors, including <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> and upflow fluid velocity in the bioreactor, on the effect of acetonitrile biodegradation performance were examined. The profiles of dissolved oxygen concentration and microbial activities and populations in the biofilm were investigated. Experimental results showed that, with the adapted microorganisms, removal of acetonitrile at approximately 98. 6 and 83. 3 %, in terms of total organic carbon and total nitrogen, were achieved at a <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> (in terms of membrane surface) of up to 11. 29 g acetonitrile/m(2). d with an upflow fluid velocity of 12 cm/s and a hydraulic retention time of 30 h.

Methods: This study was results from of pilot study that with the purpose of assessment performance was using of GAC and Anthracite in dual media filter filters in Abadan water treatment plant in removal of TOC, Fe, Mn, No 3 -and NH 4 + in Drinking Water by GAC and Anthracite in dual - media filters in Abadan water treatment plant. All parameters were measured according to sections of Standard Methods APHA et al. The t-test and regression equations were calculated. Results: Samples were collected in summer from the inlet and outlet of each pilot filter and the outlet of the filtration unit. Turbidity, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Fe, Mn, NO 3 - and NH 4 + were measured in each sample for three different low, medium, and high filtration rates. Pilot No. 2 had a maximum efficiency in the removal of the parameters that removal average of turbidity, TOC, Fe, Mn, NO 3 -, NH 4 +, respectively.

Aluminum sulfate (30 mg/L) and chlorine (1 mg/L) were used for the coagulation and disinfection of the effluent, respectively. To monitor the performance of the FBR system, variation of several parameters (biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, total phosphorous, total coliform and fecal coliform) were monitored in the effluent wastewater samples. The results showed that the proposed system could effectively reduce BOD 5 and COD below 1. 95 and 4. 06 mg/L, respectively.

The main difference between the reservoirs was that R 1 was used during fall and winter, while R 2 was operated mostly during winter with low temperatures and a less concentrated influent.

40|$|Two bench-scale hybrid systems, {{employing}} tyre {{beads and}} Kaldnes elements as carriers, respectively, {{were used in}} this research. The aim was to evaluate the dynamic changes of carbonaceous and nitrifying bioactivities in suspended and attached growth under different operating conditions such as SRT, carrier concentrations and <b>loading</b> <b>rates.</b> The distinct advantage of hybrid systems in achieving nitrification at short SRT operation was demonstrated in the comparison with an activated sludge system. With the operating SRT of suspended growth varying from 0. 17 d to 7. 1 d, the two hybrid systems gradually changed from a biofilm-dominant to a suspended-growth-dominant system. At the fixed <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> of 4. 2 kg COD/m 3 -d and 0. 78 kg TKN/m 3 -d, the relative contribution of attached growth towards the overall organic removal was reduced from 50 % at 0. 17 -d SRT to 5 % at 7. 1 -d SRT and its corresponding contribution to nitrification was reduced from 95 % to 15 %. For both growth types, with the increasing SRT, carbonaceous activities decreased due to the limiting substrate while nitrifying activities increased because of the accumulation of nitrifiers. It {{was found that the}} attached growth always showed a higher nitrifying activity but a lower carbonaceous activity as compared to the suspended growth. The long SRT of the biofilm favored the nitrifying growth at the short operating SRT, which enabled the hybrid systems to achieve a remarkable nitrification rate of 0. 45 - 0. 6 kg TKN/m 3 -d at a short SRT of 1 to 2 days. This rate was about 3 to 8 times as high as that of the activated sludge system. In addition, the suspended growth in the hybrid systems also showed a considerable nitrification rate of 0. 2 to 0. 4 kg TKN/m 3 d at short SRT operation because of the continuous input of nitrifiers from the biofilm detachment. Moreover, the suspended growth was found to shoulder 80 to 90 % of total organic loading when the SRT was 1 to 2 d. This greatly relieved the organic burden on attached growth and exempted it from the negative influence of increased organic <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> With this kind of cooperation between suspended and attached growth, the hybrid system was able to achieve a higher nitrification rate at a fixed organic <b>loading</b> <b>rate,</b> as compared to an activated sludge system. As biofilm became dominant at short SRT operation, the hybrid system encountered a severe oxygen deficiency in biofilm at a high organic <b>loading</b> <b>rate,</b> which greatly limited the system nitrification rate. Both the operating DO and the <b>surface</b> organic <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> were found to have profound impacts on the nitrification rate of the biofilm. At the same <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> (4. 2 kg COD/m 3 -d and 0. 78 kg TKN/m 3 -d), the <b>surface</b> organic <b>loading</b> was reduced by varying the carrier concentration from 10 to 30 g/L. This drastically boosted the system nitrification rate from 0. 01 kg TKN/m 3 -d to 0. 40 kg TKN/m 3 -d and also made the biofilm less sensitive to the changes of operating DO concentration and applied volumetric <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> As comparing the two carriers used in this study, it was found that Kaldnes elements were able to maintain a relatively constant attached biomass concentration under the varying <b>surface</b> organic <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> due to its relatively closed structure. This feature would be favorable for treating a seasonally fluctuating loading. However, the closed structure of Kaldnes element also incurred a significant diffusion resistance.

In this study, two membrane-aerated biofilms (MABs) were developed for the thin and thick biofilms under different <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> (SLRs). Supplies of oxygen and substrates in the MAB were from two opposite directions. This counter diffusion of nutrients resulted in a different growth environment, in contrast to conventional biofilms receiving both oxygen and substrates from the same side. The compositions, distributions and physicochemical properties (solubility and bindability) of EPS in the MABs of different thicknesses under different SLRs were studied. The effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration within the MAB on EPS properties and distribution was investigated. Experimental results showed the different biofilm thicknesses produced substantially different profiles of EPS composition and distribution. Soluble proteins were more dominant than soluble polysaccharides in the inner aerobic layer of the biofilms; in contrast, bound proteins were greater than bound polysaccharides in the outer anoxic or anaerobic layer of the biofilms. The biofilm-EPS matrix consisted mainly of bound EPS. Bound EPS exhibited a hump-shaped profile with the highest content occurring in an intermediate region in the thin MAB and relatively more uniformly in the one half of the biofilm close to the membrane side and then declined towards the biofilm-liquid interface in the thick MAB. The profiles of soluble EPS presented a similar declining trend from the membrane towards the outer region in both thin and thick MABs.

A circular and slightly conical 500 L tank was adapted with a clarifier for the two dual-drain designs (Cornell-type and central-type) and settling columns for the two single-drain designs (Guelph-F and Guelph-L). Results showed that: (1) water rotational velocity profile was more homogeneous in tanks with larger bottom drain outlets, and water velocity increased with water inlet flow rate from almost zero up to 14. 5 ± 0. 7 cm s− 1; (2) solids flushing, measured as the percentage of feed pellets retained at both the bottom drain and in the settling devices, was positively correlated with the <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> (L min− 1 flow per m 2) and was more effective at the Guelph-L design fitted with a 150 mm diameter settling column.

It can be concluded that among the systems evaluated, the Guelph-L at an inflow-rate of 12 L min− 1 was most efficient for both solids removal and water velocity profile and thus seemed more suitable for shrimp digestibility studies in high performance conditions.

Then, was calculated the approximate cost to implement these proposal (including all costs of removing sludge, lagoon waterproofing, structural work, mechanical installation and other indirect and additional costs), which resulted in required an investment of $ 78. 400, 00; $ 118. 300, 00 y $ 90. 100, 00 for the proposals 1, 2 and 3, respectively. When evaluating all alternatives from a technical, environmental and economic point of view, the proposal is recommended to upgrade the system by using two ponds in series (the first facultative and the second one a maturation pond) instead of the existing one.

The batch equilibria between dissolved phosphorus (DP) and three engineered AlOx coated media (soil-based, AOCMc; pumice-based, AOCMp; Portland cement concrete-based, AOCMpcc) were investigated. Media isotherms are evaluated with surrogate matrix in de-ionized (DI) water, municipal wet weather flow (rainfall-runoff) and dry weather (wastewater) matrices. Compared to the uncoated media substrates, AOCM provides statistically significantly higher equilibra capacity. Wet and dry weather flow matrices had lower DP adsorption compared to the DI matrix due to competitive effects, in particular SO 42 -. As compared to AOCMc and AOCMp isotherms AOCMpcc exhibited an increasing mass transfer gradient with increasing DP concentration; driven by surface precipitation. A series of granular filter materials were also tested in batch equilibrium experiments using the equivalent surrogate matrix of DI water. Results were modeled using Freundlich isotherm equation. Another unified sorption variable, Ku was calculated {{and served as a}} more appropriate parameter for media evaluation and comparison. At Ce = 0. 03 mg/L, Ku values ranged from 25. 68 to 0. 09 L/g for the media tested in this study, indicating a significant variability of the media capacity. This study also examined the kinetics of DP mass transfer from the aqueous matrix to the media. A 2 nd order potential driving model is utilized for the overall rate process. Comparing synthetic- and actual rainfall-runoff matrices demonstrated that actual runoff produced slower overall rate kinetics for AOCMc and AOCMp primarily due to the presence of competitive ions (SO 42 -) while elevated Ca 2 + at the alkaline surface of AOCMpcc offset the effect of SO 42 -, through surface precipitation. Commercially available media exhibited a large variance of capacities. Column breakthrough experiments of DP from granular media were also conducted. Thomas model was utilized to simulate the breakthrough curves of AOCM. The effect of <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> on breakthrough behavior was investigated and novel mathematical correlations were developed to relate Thomas model parameters (KT and q 0) with surface loading rates.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Sludge {{stage and}} volume were {{monitored}} in two lagoons (OK 1 and OK 2) treating manure from swine breeding farms {{for a period}} of 9 years. Solids management differed between the two lagoons. Sludge was left relatively undisturbed in lagoon OK 1, whereas solids were removed with each irrigation in lagoon OK 2. When left undisturbed, sludge accumulated in a pattern consistent with the complex accumulation model proposed by earlier researchers. Sludge accumulated faster when solids were removed during irrigation compared to the lagoon in which solids were left undisturbed. Accumulation in both disturbed and undisturbed lagoons occurred at a rate less than current ASABE and NRCS standards. Onset of rapid accumulation appears to be related to volumetric organic <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> rather than separation distance between top of the sludge and the liquid <b>surface.</b> Critical organic <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> contained in the current standards appear to be adequate to determine the onset of rapid sludge accumulation...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{diversity}} of conventional technologies available for removal of pollutants from wastewater. Most of these technologies are aerobic alternatives with high construction cost and high energy consumption and require skilled personal for operation and maintenance.   As a consequence, only countries with a high gross national product (GNP) can afford these options. Where these technologies were introduced in developing countries, in most cases these could not be operated sustainably, leading to loss of investments and continued water resource contamination. Extensive investments in wastewater treatment plants world-wide during the last decades have greatly reduced the organic loading of receiving water bodies in high GNP countries. Only recently, many of these plants were appropriated to remove nitrogen and phosphorus. The increasing use of chemical fertilizer may cause high levels of eutrophication in water bodies, which may induce algae blooms resulting in strong fluctuations in oxygen concentration. Oxygen depletion causes fish kill as well as odor problems. The situation in countries with a low GNP is worse than in the developed world. The unequal expansion of water supply coverage compared to the expansion in wastewater and sanitation services leads to increased contamination of surface and ground waters. The general trend is to use conventional WWT systems for big cities, but for medium and small sized cities non-conventional systems are often considered. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop and improve low cost technologies for wastewater treatment that are within the economic and technological capabilities of developing countries. In countries like Colombia it is very common that the regulation controls mainly the removals of organic matter and suspended solids. Other parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, pathogens, micro-contaminants are also crucial {{and need to be}} addressed. This makes a response via conventional technologies very expensive, and for developing regions in fact unachievable. It would be ideal if new technologies can provide besides the removal of organic matter and solids, resource recovery like the generation of biogas (energy production) or high quality biomass (animal fodder). At the moment, no technological packages appear to be readily available. Experience has shown that no single technology can offer an optimum treatment for the different components to be treated in wastewater or to recover them as valuable resources. Therefore an adequate combination of different technologies in an integrated system could convert a wastewater treatment into an attractive sustainable system. For example UASB reactor and duckweed ponds are relatively low cost technologies and their combination offers several advantages. Firstly, anaerobic treatment will reduce considerably the organic matter in the wastewater and convert it into methane, which {{can be used as a}} source of renewable energy. Secondly, the effluents of anaerobic treatment could be post-treated to meet discharge standards in duckweed ponds for nutrient recovery in the form of high quality biomass. At this point three valuable products can be listed: biogas for use as an energy source, biomass that can be used for aquaculture or animal feed and treated effluent that can be re-used in irrigation.   A system that generates such by-products increases the feasibility and sustainability of pollution control programs. Furthermore, the products may help to address the increasing need for food production in the world.   The development of duckweed pond technology has been concentrated on the study of the processes occurring within the ponds, with respect to organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus and pathogen removal and the corresponding mechanisms. Further research is needed in order to have a good control of effluent nitrogen levels. There are still important questions to be answer like how to maximize nitrogen recovery via duckweed production, how to get good effluent levels depending on effluent reuse. If the effluent is going to be used in crop irrigation, to reduce nitrogen effluent concentration to 15 - 20 mg l - 1 will be enough. If the effluent is going to be discharge in surface waters the nitrogen level would have to be reduced as much as possible. Therefore it is important to study how the design and combination of technologies could generate the required nitrogen effluent levels. The present work was focus on the study of the effect of different operational variables, like the effect of anaerobic pre-treatment, the combination of algae and duckweed ponds, the effect of pond depth on nitrogen transformation and removals. The effect of anaerobic pre-treatment on environmental and physicochemical characteristics of duckweed stabilization ponds was studied in Chapter 2. The environmental and physicochemical conditions affect both plant growth and microbiological treatment processes in the system. Two series of continuous-flow pilot plants, composed of seven ponds in series each, were operated side by side.   One system received artificial sewage with anaerobic pre-treatment, while the other system received the same wastewater without anaerobic pretreatment. pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand, total and ammonium nitrogen, nitrites and nitrates, and phosphorus were monitored under steady state conditions. It was found that pH levels were very stable in both systems with and without anaerobic pretreatment. Vertical temperature gradients were present during daytime but not as strong as they may occur in conventional stabilization ponds. Oxygen levels were significantly higher in the duckweed system with anaerobic pretreatment, especially in the top layer. (up to 2 mg O 2 l - 1) than in the system without pretreatment (up to 1. 2 mg O 2 l - 1). Nevertheless, aeration rates were low in both systems. Both systems were efficient in removing organic matter. The system without pretreatment obtained 98 % of BOD 5 removal in pond 4, so 12 days of retention time will be sufficient to reach high organic matter removal. The system with pretreatment obtained also 98 % BOD 5 removal (92 % in UASB reactor). In this case the duckweed ponds will serve as a polishing step for remaining organic matter. Nutrient removals were 37 - 48 % for nitrogen and 45 - 50 % for phosphorus in the lines with and without pretreatment respectively. The main form of nitrogen in anaerobic effluent is ammonium. This is the preferred nitrogen source for duckweed, but at high levels it may become inhibitory to the plant. Renewal fed batch experiments at laboratory scale were performed (Chapter 3) to assess the effect of total ammonia (NH 3 + NH 4 +) nitrogen and pH on the growth rate of the duckweed Spirodela polyrrhiza. The experiments were performed at different total ammonia nitrogen concentrations, different pH ranges and in three different growth media. The inhibition of duckweed growth by ammonium was found to be due to a combined effect of ammonium ions (NH 4 +) and ammonia (NH 3), the relative importance of each one depending on pH. The effect of anaerobic pre-treatment on the performance of a duckweed stabilization pond system was assessed in a pilot plant located in the Ginebra Research Station-Colombia (Chapter 4). The pilot plant consisted of two lines of seven duckweed ponds in series. One line received de-gritted domestic wastewater and the other received effluent of a 250 m 3 Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor, treating the same wastewater. Both lines were operated at a total hydraulic retention time of 21 days. The systems were monitored for temperature, pH, oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, total phosphorus, biomass production, and different forms of nitrogen. No effect of anaerobic pretreatment was observed on pH and temperature in the two systems. Oxygen concentrations were higher in the system with UASB reactor. Although both systems complied with the Colombian regulation for BOD removal (> 85 %) pretreatment with UASB reactor may contribute to the reduction of area requirement for the stabilization ponds. Effluent quality in terms of total suspended solids was excellent, i. e. 9 ± 2 and 4 ± 1 mg l - 1 in the system with and without pre-treatment, respectively. Total nitrogen removals were 63 % and 68 % and phosphorus removals were 24 % and 29 % in the system with and without pre-treatment, respectively. The differences between the two systems were found not to be significant. Duckweed biomass production was in the range of 54 - 90 g m - 2 -d - 1 (fresh weight) in the system with pre-treatment and 36 - 84 g m - 2 -d - 1 in the system without pre-treatment.   Total biomass productions were significantly different at 92 % level of confidence. Protein content was 35. 1 % and 36. 6 % for the system with and without pre-treatment, respectively. Nitrogen removal is nowadays one of the most important effluent treatment objectives because of the serious pollution problems it causes to the environment. How nitrogen is transformed and removed in duckweed ponds was studied and nitrogen balances were established (Chapter 5). The experimental system was the same as in the previous chapter. Ammonia volatilization was found to be not an important removal mechanism in duckweed ponds (less than 1 %). Removal by sedimentation was also low at 2. 1 % and 4. 7 % for the systems with and without anaerobic pre-treatment, respectively. Instead, denitrification was found to be the most important removal mechanism (42 % and 48 %), followed by duckweed biomass up-take (15. 6 % and 15. 1 %). Average nitrogen biomass up-take rates were 199 mg N m - 2 d - 1 and 193 mg N m - 2 d - 1 for the system with and without pre-treatment, respectively. Nitrification rates were in the range of 112 - 1190 mg N m - 2 d - 1 and 58 - 1123 mg N m - 2 d - 1 for the system with and without anaerobic pretreatment respectively. Denitrification rates were in the range of 112 - 937 mg N m - 2 d - 1 and 59 - 1039 mg N m - 2 d - 1 for the system with and without pre-treatment respectively. The configuration of the system, in particular the down and up flow pattern seemed to have an important stimulating effect on denitrification rates, probably by causing alternative exposure of the pond water to aerobic and anoxic conditions. Although the potential of duckweed ponds for removing carbonaceous and suspended material from wastewater has been demonstrated, the system could be further optimized for nitrogen removal. The effect of introducing algae-ponds (aerobic zones) into a series of duckweed stabilization ponds on nitrification and denitrification (Chapter 6) was studied in two consecutive phases. During the first phase, the seven ponds of the pilot plant were fully covered with duckweed (Spirodela polyrrhiza). Before the start of the second phase, the duckweed cover was removed from ponds 1 and 3, with a view to allow algae growth in the 'open' ponds. The feed of the duckweed pond system consisted of the effluent of a real scale UASB reactor, which treated domestic wastewater from Ginebra-Colombia. The system was operated with a continuous flow to produce a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 days per pond and a total HRT of 21 days. Effluent total nitrogen was significantly different in the two phases, with 13. 8 ± 2. 9 mg TN l - 1 (63 % removal) and 3. 7 ± 1. 5 mg TN l - 1 (90 %) for first and second phase, respectively. Denitrification was the most important removal mechanism during both phases, and amounted to 43. 5 % and 76. 2 % of influent nitrogen, in first and second phase, respectively. Ammonia volatilization and sedimentation were insignificant processes for nitrogen removal in both phases. Nitrification played an important role in nitrogen transformations in the duckweed systems and it was favored by the introduction of aerobic zones in ponds 1 and 3. Denitrification also played a key role in nitrogen transformations and removal. Despite the presence of oxygen in the water column, denitrification occurred, probably due to the anaerobic microenvironment of system biofilms. Higher nitrogen removal might be obtained in duckweed pond systems through the introduction of aerobic zones in early stages of the system. Where effluents cannot be reused for crop irrigation, strict nitrogen effluent criteria can be met using hybrid duckweed-algal ponds at considerably shorter hydraulic retention time compared to fully duckweed covered systems. The effect of pond depth on nitrogen removal in duckweed stabilization ponds was studied in Chapter 7. The pilot plant consisted of two lines with seven duckweed ponds in series, with different depths and fed with effluent of a laboratory scale UASB reactor. Three experimental conditions were studied: DSP 1 with pond depth 0. 7 m and HRT= 21 days, DSP 2 with pond depth 0. 4 m and HRT = 12 days, and DSP 3 with pond depth 0. 4 m and HRT = 21 days. The systems were monitored for pH, temperature and oxygen profiles, organic matter removal (BOD 5), nitrogen transformations, biomass production and biomass nitrogen content. Average total nitrogen removal rates were 598 mg N m - 2 d - 1 for DSP 1, 589 mg N m - 2 d - 1 for DSP 2 and 482 mg N m - 2 d - 1 for DSP 3. In spite of the lower nitrogen removal rate in DSP 3, it had higher removal efficiency (44 %, 43 % and 62 % for DSP 1, 2 and 3 respectively) due to the lower <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> in this system. This shows that using the percentage of removal as a parameter for comparison should be done with care and the operational parameters of the compared systems should be taken into account. Denitrification was the most important nitrogen removal mechanism for the three DSPs. Nitrogen removal via biomass production was the second most important removal mechanism for the three experiments. Pond depth does not seem to determine nitrification or denitrification. Nitrification seems to be related to surface organic loading rate, while denitrification was related to BOD availability. The comparison between two pond systems with different depth, but operated at the same hydraulic <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> (DSP 1 and 2) showed similar nitrogen removals in the shallower system as in the deeper system. This suggests that duckweed pond system could be designed with shallow depth without affecting surface loading and nitrogen removal efficiency. Nitrogen removal appeared to be governed by <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> rather than by hydraulic retention time. Most of the research so far has been performed at laboratory or pilot scale. In the process of technology-development it is important to test findings at full scale. In Chapter 8, the performance of a full scale duckweed pond was compared with a full scale algae pond treating effluent of a UASB reactor operated under similar conditions of climate, configuration, wastewater composition and loading rate. The real scale experimental system was composed of two continuous flow channels. One operated as an algae pond and the other as a duckweed pond (Spirodela polyrrhiza and Lemna minor.). The volume of each channel was 225 m 3, an average surface area of 322 m 2, L/W ratio= 13. 1 and depth of 0. 7 m. The wastewater flow was 19. 7 m 3 d - 1, for each system and the theoretical hydraulic retention time was 11. 5 days. The ponds were monitored for the following parameters: Organic matter (BOD 5), total suspended solids (TSS), ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 + -N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrite nitrogen (NO 2 -N), nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 -N), total phosphor o us (TP) and faecal coliform (FC). The duckweed pond developed different environmental conditions in terms of pH, temperature and oxygen, compared to the algae pond. The duckweed pond was more efficient in removing organic matter and the algae pond was more efficient in nitrogen removal. Denitrification accounted for most of the nitrogen removal in the algae and duckweed ponds. The second most important mechanism for nitrogen removal was ammonia volatilization for the algae pond and plant up-take for the duckweed pond. In the design of duckweed pond systems special attention should be paid to the reactor configuration and flow pattern in order to obtain good contact between water column and the duckweed cover and to reduce hydraulic problems. Practical applications. Wastewater treatment can be converted into an attractive, feasible and sustainable alternative by combining anaerobic pretreatment, duckweed ponds, and algae ponds. The integrated system UASB reactor, algae pond and duckweed pond offers the possibility to remove the various unwanted component in wastewater and to recover part of the valuable material present in the wastewater in the form of biomass or biogas The effluents may be suitable for discharge or for irrigation depending on the removal efficiencies of the system. The design and operation of this integrated system may have two different approaches. Firstly, one could optimize nitrogen recovery by duckweed uptake and effluent irrigation. Secondly, one could maximize nitrogen removal in order to protect the receiving water resources.   If the objective of the treatment is recovery of nitrogen then the stimulation of duckweed incorporation and the reduction of effluent nitrogen to a suitable range for irrigation would be the best option. The configuration of an efficient anaerobic pre-treatment followed by a series of ponds completely covered with duckweed would be recommendable. Influent ammonium nitrogen concentration below 50 mg l - 1 and pH below 8 would be desirable to avoid biomass growth inhibition. The comparison between two pond systems with different depths and the same hydraulic <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> showed similar nitrogen removals in the shallower system as in the deeper system. This means that duckweed pond system could be designed with the shallower depth without affecting nitrogen removal efficiency. Shallow ponds are easier to build, to operate and to maintain and in the case of duckweed covered ponds, they can be regarded as a crop production system. If the objective of the treatment is nitrogen removal due to disposal regulations, a strategy to enhance denitrification should be adopted. Higher nitrogen removals may be obtained in duckweed pond systems through the introduction of aerobic zones in early stages of the system, which allows a considerable reduction of the hydraulic retention time. Strict nitrogen effluent criteria can therefore be met at relatively short hydraulic retention times. The configuration of the system, in particular the down and up flow pattern seems to have an important positive effect on denitrification rates. Compartmentalization of the treatment system improves the pond performance. In the design of pond systems special attention should be paid to the reactor configuration and hydraulic flow pattern, good contact water-biomass and to avoidance of short circuiting and dead zones. In the process of technology development the following studies are envisaged and recommended for further research: Future studies should be focused on shallow ponds with the views to enhance nitrogen removal via its recovery in the form of duckweed biomass. Shallow ponds will also reduce construction cost of the treatment systems. Alternative uses of treated effluent and produced biomass should be investigated. In the case of effluent reuse on irrigation, the reduction of nitrogen concentrations in the treatment system to 15 - 25 mg l - 1 will be enough. The use of vegetable biomass as a food complement on the diet of fish and pork is an alternative that has been preliminary explored in the area of research. Further studies are necessary to determine its feasibility. For safe discharge of effluent to open water bodies, effluent nitrogen concentration should be low. In this case nitrogen removal processes may be influence by affecting growth conditions of nitrifiers/dentrifiers like oxygen levels or availability of area for bacterial attachment. It is important to performed studies in order to find the best combination of duckweed and algae ponds for nitrogen removal. The introduction of baffles on the treatment channels will increase the availability of area for biomass growth and will improved the hydraulic characteristics of the treatment systems. The appropriated number and distribution of baffles should be investigated. Recycling of final aerobic effluent to the UASB reactor or to the entrance of the duckweed pond could be an interesting option to stimulat...|$|E

However, all showed no significant changes when the <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> were faster than the corresponding critical <b>loading</b> <b>rates.</b> In conclusion, as the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> increased, changes in the compressive mechanical parameters were different depending on the parameter and the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> range. Compressive mechanical behaviour of bovine cortical bone showed a brittle nature under high strain rates (strain rates > 13 s(- 1)). These findings should be reflected in the biomimetic simulation of biomaterials for bone tissue repair and engineering...|$|R
40|$|Globular {{clusters}} (GCs) {{are known}} to harbor multiple stellar populations. To explain these observations Bastian et al. suggested a scenario in which a second population is formed by the accretion of enriched material onto the low-mass stars in the initial GC population. The {{idea is that the}} low-mass, pre-main sequence stars sweep up gas expelled by the massive stars of the same generation into their protoplanetary disc as they move through the GC core. We perform simulations with 2 different smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes to investigate if a low-mass star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc can accrete the amount of enriched material required in this scenario. We focus on the gas <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> onto the disc and star {{as well as on the}} lifetime of the disc. We find that the gas <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> is a factor of 2 smaller than the geometric rate, because the effective cross section of the disc is smaller than its <b>surface</b> area. The <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> is consistent for both codes, irrespective of resolution. The disc gains mass in the high resolution runs, but loses angular momentum on a time scale of 10 ^ 4 yrs. Two effects determine the loss of (specific) angular momentum in our simulations: 1) continuous ram pressure stripping and 2) accretion of material with no azimuthal angular momentum. Our study and previous work suggest that the former, dominant process is mainly caused by numerical rather than physical effects, while the latter is not. The latter process causes the disc to become more compact, increasing the surface density profile at smaller radii. The disc size is determined in the first place by the ram pressure when the flow first hits the disc. Further evolution is governed by the decrease in the specific angular momentum of the disc. We conclude that the size and lifetime of the disc are probably not sufficient to accrete the amount of mass required in Bastian et al. 's scenario.
