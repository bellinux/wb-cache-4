The work won a Department for Transport Community Rail Marketing Award in 2007. The Severnside CRP also formed a <b>support</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> the station, and improved the provision of timetabling information {{through the use of}} simplified departure timetable posters. In 2008, they helped to renovate and repaint the station building. It was decorated in 2009 by students from Fairfield School, who created a mural of Victorian characters with incongruous details such as mobile phones, sunglasses and funny hats. The work won a Community Rail Award.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Torchwood {{employee}} Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) being {{called in to}} investigate a missing person case by her former colleague Andy Davidson (Tom Price). When bereaved mother Nikki Bevan (Ruth Jones) starts a <b>support</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> missing people, Gwen realises the problem is widespread. She pursues the investigation against the wishes of her boss Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) {{and is able to}} track Nikki's son to an isolation facility. It is revealed that Nikki's son Jonah, like the other missing individuals around Cardiff, was taken by the space-time rift and returned physically and mentally scarred.

5|$|When {{confronted with}} {{inaccuracies}} or inconsistencies, {{those who are}} suspected of perpetrating fabrications may compound the deceit by accusing forum members of imposing greater stresses upon them, exacerbating their conditions, or worsening their depression. Users may employ sockpuppets—separate online identities controlled by the same person—to accuse other forum members of disloyalty and persecution, or support the user who is under suspicion. Feldman's 1998 article in the Western Journal of Medicine notes {{a case in which}} a member of a <b>support</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome created a husband, sister-in-law, and family friend who simultaneously engaged in arguments with and about the original member; when the amount of attention directed toward the original member became inadequate, she claimed the sister-in-law committed suicide in response to the lack of support.|$|E
5|$|Jonah Bevan (Oliver Ferriman) {{is walking}} home across the Cardiff Bay Barrage when a mysterious bright light appears. He vanishes. Seven months later, at the {{instigation}} {{of her former}} police colleague Andy Davidson (Tom Price), Torchwood agent Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) is investigating Jonah's disappearance. After Jonah's mother Nikki (Ruth Jones) starts a <b>support</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> relatives of missing people in the Cardiff area, Gwen realises {{that there are more}} cases resembling Jonah's disappearance. Gwen collates a chart of the missing people and her colleague Toshiko (Naoko Mori) discovers that all the disappearances occurred during negative spikes of activity from the Cardiff space-time rift. The two women postulate the implications of this: that the rift can take people away and discard them elsewhere. Gwen confronts her boss Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) with her research but he informs her that nothing can be done and orders her to stop the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed Narrator is a {{traveling}} automobile recall specialist {{who suffers from}} insomnia. When he is unsuccessful at receiving medical assistance for it, the admonishing doctor suggests he realize his relatively small amount of suffering by visiting a <b>support</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> testicular cancer victims. The group assumes that he, too, is affected like they are, and he spontaneously weeps into the nurturing arms of another man, finding a freedom from the catharsis that relieves his insomnia. He decides to participate in support groups of various kinds, always allowing the groups to assume that he suffers what they do. However, he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him that he is attending these groups dishonestly, and this disturbs his bliss. The two negotiate to avoid their attending the same groups, but, before going their separate ways, Marla gives him her phone number.|$|E
40|$|M. Cur. The role players {{participating}} {{within the}} <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> <b>for</b> {{patients with chronic}} diseases in Primary Health care services are facing a difficult task of managing <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> effectively. They are confronted by managerial challenges involved in the managing of <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> <b>for</b> patients with chronic diseases, such as careful planning, organising, leading and controlling the <b>support</b> <b>groups.</b> This is evidently confirmed by the disintegration of <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> and patients openly and deliberately rebelling and ignoring participation in <b>support</b> <b>groups.</b> The resistance and opposition is also displayed by other staff members within the clinic. The general dissatisfaction and frustration among the primary health care facilitators serves as proof of the poor management of <b>support</b> <b>groups.</b> The need to investigate and address this dilemma is important. It is therefore {{the reason why the}} researcher embarked on this studying order to explore the I experiences of the role players with regard to the management of the <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> <b>for</b> patients with chronic diseases within the clinic context, and then utilise the results ad basis for formulating guidelines for quality management of <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> within Primary Health Care clinics in Soweto. The following research questions are therefore relevant: ~ What are the experiences of the primary health care facilitators with regard to the management of <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> <b>for</b> the patients with chronic diseases with primary health care clinics in Soweto? ~ What are the experiences of the facility managers with regard to the management of <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> <b>for</b> patients with chronic diseases within primary health care clinics in Soweto? ~ What are the experiences of patients with chronic diseases with regard to the management of <b>support</b> <b>groups?</b> ~ What guidelines should be formulated to ensure quality management and sustainability of <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> <b>for</b> patients with chronic diseases within the primary health care clinics in Soweto?
