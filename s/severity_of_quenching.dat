An Inconel 600 probe instrumented with thermocouples was used for this purpose. The thermal history at various locations in the probe {{was used as an}} input to the inverse heat conduction model. The inverse analysis yields spatially dependent heat flux transients. The quench severity was assessed using the Grossmann technique. The wetting kinematics of quenching was studied by cooling curve analysis. The <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>quenching</b> as measured by the Grossmann’s technique was found to be higher for polymer quenchants. However, the heat flux transients estimated by the inverse technique and rewetting times measured form the cooling curve analysis suggested comparable and uniform heat transfer with polymer quenchants compared to water quenchants...|$|E

40|$|The {{thermal shock}} {{behavior}} and resistance of brittle materials are mostly investigated through the determination <b>of</b> a critical <b>quenching</b> temperature difference, ΔTc. This technique, however, needs {{a large number}} of, almost, identical samples and is thus poorly adapted to products being in the stage of research and development. In order to overcome this difficulty, the indentation technique {{has been used in}} this work. The residual contact stresses, created during indentation, permit a stage of stable extension of the indentation cracks under the action of further stressing. The relative increase of radial crack length as a function of Vickers indentation load, c/c 0 vs. P, is taken as a criterion, or indicator, of relative thermal shock resistance, or <b>of</b> the <b>severities</b> <b>of</b> <b>quenching</b> conditions. This is validated, first in quenching materials whose empirical ranking is well established, and second in varying parameters of the Biot number. Finally, are two batches of a functional ceramic compared.

40|$|Ti 6 Al 4 V {{with two}} {{different}} chemical compositions, one {{rich and the}} other lean in alpha-stabilizer oxygen were selected to study the effect <b>of</b> <b>quench</b> <b>severity</b> during solution treatment and their aging response. These two coupons were taken from two differently processed wrought products viz. rolled ring and closed die forging. The coupons were then subjected to solution treatment followed by employing different cooling rates to vary the quench severity and different aging treatments by changing the aging temperature and time. The microstructure and mechanical properties thus obtained are correlated {{with respect to the}} heat treatment conditions. It is noted that there is a significant increase in strength of the alloy retaining the ductility when it is aged in the aging temperature regime of 550 - 650 A degrees C and time of 8 h. Role of higher oxygen content is noted, which is more pronounced with higher <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>quench</b> (by water <b>quenching).</b> Specimens representative <b>of</b> different heat treatment conditions were characterized using optical microscope, electron back-scattered diffraction, and electron microscope. The presence of martensitic (alpha') structure along with uniform distribution of fine primary alpha, secondary alpha precipitates and refined beta-grains, twins in the microstructure helps in improving the strength of the material. Also, during high temperature aging of 700 A degrees C, which incidentally falls in the range of annealing temperature of the alloy, overaging occurs which is similar to effect of annealing and hence retains the ductility as well...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Titanium alloys {{are widely}} used in {{aerospace}} industry {{in the areas of}} pressure vessels, airframe structures, landing gears, aeroengine compressor blades etc. The principal qualities of titanium alloys required for these applications are high specific strength, low density and high specific modulus. Among the families of Ti alloys, high strength titanium alloys come under martensitic α + β and metastable β alloys. Titanium alloy Ti- 5 Al- 5 V- 2 Mo (BT- 23) is an important example of martensitic α + β alloy similar to the work horse Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy which exhibits good combination of strength and ductility in solution treated and aged conditions. But due to quenching from solution treatment temperature, the alloy tends to retain good amount of residual stresses. The <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> residual stress increases with increase in solution treatment temperature as well as <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>quench.</b> An attempt has been made to study the effect of air cooling subsequent to solution treatment to compare the strength of the alloy vis-à-vis that achievable during water quenching. An attempt has also been made to correlate the microstructure evolution, hardness with variation in solution treatment temperature and quench severity in titanium alloy Ti- 5 Al- 2 Mo- 5 V.

The peak cooling rates of Jatropha oil, groundnut oil, melon oil, sheabutter oil, palmkernel oil, and palm oil were {{greater than that of}} mineral oil. The quench severities of Jatropha, sheabutter, and groundnut oil are higher with an H-factor of 5. 93, 6. 00, and 6. 14, respectively. High heat transfer coefficient of 1583, 1180, and 1024 W/m 2 K were obtained for Jatropha oil, groundnut oil, and melon oil; whereas sheabutter oil, palmkernel oil, palm oil, and mineral oil have heat transfer coefficient of 1001, 971, 828, and 589 W/m 2 K, respectively.

40|$|The {{effect of}} cooling rate of cane {{molasses}} as quenching medium for 0. 61 % C {{high carbon steels}} was investigated. Samples of high carbon steel were spheroidized annealed and then machined prior to the hardening process. Molasses solution of viscosity equals to that of engine oil was prepared by adding water. The samples were normalized and then austenitised at 800 oC and soaked for 40 minutes and then quenched in water, engine oil, raw molasses and the prepared molasses solution. Cooling rate curves of all the quenching media used were developed. The highest cooling rate of 60 oC/s was attained by the prepared molasses solution. Hardness of the test samples was evaluated. The test results obtained show that the highest hardness value (525 HVN) {{was obtained from the}} sample quenched in the prepared molasses solution. Microstructures of the various samples were analyzed using OM and SEM. In all the tests samples martensite structure was observed. It was observed that the prepared molasses solution has higher <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>quenching</b> than that of engine oil but lower than that of water.

30|$|During quench {{hardening}} process, the surface heat transfer conditions between the steel part and the quenchant {{are the most}} important factors controlling the microstructural evolution, generation of stresses and distortion [1]. Kobasko showed that very fast and uniform part cooling within the martensitic range actually reduces the probability of part cracking and distortion, while improving the surface hardness and durability of steel parts [123]. The enhanced CHF of the nanofluids during pool boiling revealed that nanofluids may be suitable for cooling at high heat flux applications [124]. According to Kim et al. the use of nanofluids can afford a significant acceleration of quenching by means of premature destabilization of film boiling due to nanoparticle deposition [125]. The quenching of 304 stainless steel probe into different concentration of nanofluids yielded varying peak heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and Grossmann <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>quenching</b> [126]. Jagannath and Prabhu measured the interfacial peak HTC of water was 1280 W/m 2 K and the peak HTC decreased from 1400 to 965 W/m 2 K with increases in Al 2 O 3 nanoparticle concentration from 0.01 to 4 wt% when copper is quenched [103]. Similarly Babu and Kumar observed that the peak heat flux during quenching in CNT nanofluids increases with an increase in the CNT concentration until 0.50 wt.% and starts decreasing with further increase in the CNT concentration [105]. These results suggest that for the same base fluid there is an optimum level of nanoparticle concentration to enhance/decrease the heat transfer characteristics of nanofluids. The enhancement and deterioration of pool boiling heat transfer of nanofluids could be utilized in quenching heat treatment in two ways either to promote or decrease the rate of heat transfer depending upon the section thickness of the part to be heat treated and the desired microstructure. Hence {{there is a need for}} development of nanofluids having (i) high quench severity for enhancement of heat transfer for thick sections with low quench sensitivity and (ii) low cooling severity for thin sections with high quench sensitivity [127].|$|E

The findings were rationalized with an elastic-plastic finite-element model that included temperature-dependent properties.

The brine promotes a more severe and uniform <b>quenching.</b> The <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>quenching</b> was analysed, and the heat transfer characteristics determined. A brine interrupted quenching was developed to produce a martensite case with a bainite core. The effect of various conditions after the interruption of the cooling is addressed. Tempering temperatures of 150, 250, 350, 450 and 550 °C were employed. In addition, a partial decarburisation was promoted in the samples prior to the quenching and tempering, this in order to modify the local martensite start temperature and promote the martensite transformation to take place at a higher temperature, while reducing the amount of retained austenite. To determine the fatigue properties of heat treatments, a rotating bending fatigue tester with constant deflection was developed. Fatigue results showed that the interrupted brine quenching with partial decarburisation has a higher fatigue limit that the case with no decarburisation and also that the case <b>of</b> conventional oil <b>quenching</b> and tempering. Fractography and load data from experiments allowed to model the cracking stages. The model was useful to establish the presence of cracks and their length.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between microstructure, heat treatment and room temperature fracture toughness {{has been determined}} for the low alloy ultra-high strength steels 4130, 4330, 4340, 4140 and 300 -M. Optical metallography, microprobe analysis, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the structure and morphology, while both Charpy V-notch impact tests and plane strain fracture toughness tests {{were used to determine}} the fracture properties. The normal commercial heat treatment resulted in the formation of some bainite in all the alloys. MnS inclusions on prior austenite grain boundaries were found to initiate cracks during loading. By increasing the austenitizing temperature to l 200 C, the fracture toughness could be increased by at least 60 %. For some alloys increasing the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>quench</b> in conjunction with the higher austenitizing temperatures resulted in further increases in the fracture toughness, and the elimination of any observable upper bainite. There was no correlation between the Charpy impact test results and the fracture toughness results.

40|$|Medium {{and high}} carbon steels are usually {{quenched}} in polymer and oil {{in order to avoid}} cracking and distortion; however, recent studies have proved {{that it is possible to}} minimize cracking using water as a coolant of these steels by promoting extremely high cooling rates. By great agitation and velocity of quenchant, the vapor blanket is reduced or prevented during water quench, allowing uniform hardening of the surface. In this study, the cooling <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> a spray <b>quenching</b> system and a high-speed quenching chamber are studied. Cylindrical samples of AISI 304 stainless steel (20 mm in diameter and 100 mm length) were employed to characterize the cooling severity. Thermal data was acquired through K-type thermocouples placed in the sample at three positions, 1 mm below surface, mid-radius and at center of the specimen, connected to a data acquisition system. High thermal gradients were observed in both systems, being the high-speed chamber the severest cooling. The maximum cooling rate obtained at the surface was 470 and 300 °C/s for the high-speed chamber and the spray system, respectively. In addition, 5160 spring steel samples were quenched for short times in both systems; the cooling was interrupted to avoid through transformation and to produce a case-core type microstructure. Different cooling times were used for the interrupted quenching to modify the martensite case thickness. No cracks were observed. Thermal results and microstructures are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In this paper, the {{prediction}} of working stress <b>of</b> <b>quenched</b> and tempered shaft has been done. Prediction was done for two different manufacture processes. In the first manufacture process the shaft was made of steel and in second one the shaft was made of cast steel. The working stress was characterized by yield strength and impact toughness. The method of computer simulation of working stress was applied in workpiece of complex form. Design/methodology/approach: Hardness distribution <b>of</b> <b>quenched</b> and tempered workpiece of complex form was predicted by computer simulation <b>of</b> <b>quenching</b> using a finite volume method. Hardness <b>of</b> <b>quenched</b> and tempered steel can be expressed as function of maximal hardness of actual steel, hardness of steel with 50 % of martensite in microstructure, according to the time and temperature of tempering. The algorithm of estimation of yield strength and impact energy was based on hardness, HV. Starting point in studying of the mechanical properties of steel castings can be {{the fact that the}} mechanical properties of steel castings are derived from the mechanical properties of ordinary steel metal matrix reduced by the influence of the typical as-cast structure, i. e. casting defects on those properties. Hardness and yield strength will be unaffected by most defects. The only effect will be that due to the reduction in area. Coarse as-cast microstructure of cast steel lowers ductility and toughness. Impact energy <b>of</b> <b>quenched</b> and tempered cast steel was predicted based on pouring temperature, temperature of mould during the pouring and fact that steel castings are not subjected to different metallurgical and mechanical processes of microstructure improvement in so far as wrought steels. Findings: It can be concluded that working stress <b>of</b> <b>quenched</b> and tempered shaft can be successfully predicted by proposed method. Practical implications: Estimation of hardness distribution can be based on time, relevant for structure transformation, i. e., time of cooling from 800 to 500 °C (t 8 / 5).
