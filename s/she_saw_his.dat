5|$|Back in London, the Claimant {{employed}} a solicitor, John Holmes, {{who agreed to}} go with him to Paris to meet Lady Tichborne. This meeting took place on 11 January at the Hôtel de Lille. As soon as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> face, Lady Tichborne accepted him. At Holmes's behest she lodged with the British Embassy a signed declaration formally testifying that the Claimant was her son. She was unmoved when Father Châtillon, Roger's childhood tutor, declared the Claimant an impostor, and she allowed Holmes to inform The Times in London that she had recognised Roger. She settled an income of £1,000 a year on him, and accompanied him to England to declare her support before the more sceptical members of the Tichborne family.|$|E
25|$|In their rooms, Raoul expresses disgust {{that their}} host would send circus freaks to receive them ("What a Dreadful Town!..."). He upsets Gustave {{by refusing to}} play with him and storms out to find a bar, leaving Christine to explain his {{behavior}} to their son ("Look With Your Heart"). When Gustave goes to bed, the Phantom enters and reveals to a stunned Christine that {{it was he who}} summoned her to sing at Phantasma. Initially outraged, Christine eventually succumbs to the memory of a clandestine evening the two shared before she was married. As they recall their one night of passion, it is revealed that Christine was prepared to abandon Raoul for the Phantom, but awoke in the morning to find herself alone. The Phantom explains that he fled out of fear that she would reject him again when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> face in the morning light ("Beneath a Moonless Sky"). Both concede that they once thought their love had a chance, but the circumstances of the present day make it impossible ("Once Upon Another Time"). They are startled by a scream from Gustave, who awakens from a nightmare and rushes into the room. Christine introduces the Phantom as an old friend named Mr. Y, and he promises to show the boy around Phantasma the next day ("Mother Please, I'm Scared!").|$|E
500|$|Madonna's lover in {{the video}} is played by Croatian actor Goran Višnjić, who was {{selected}} by the singer after <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> acting in the British film, Welcome to Sarajevo (1997). Calling him [...] "the sexiest male working today", Madonna explained that [...] " [...] was looking for an actor to be in [...] video and his face came right into my head". The video premiered on MTV on September 10, 1998, {{a few minutes before}} the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards show began. It was occasionally played on The Warner Bros.

She {{approaches}} him and removes his mask out of curiosity. He bursts into a fit of rage, covering his face with his hand. He at first says she must stay forever because <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> deformities, revealing that he [...] "dreams of beauty". Pitying him Christine hands him back his mask and the two have a moment of understanding. He then decides to return her to the opera house.|$|E

60|$|More awful than {{anything}} to her was the struggle which she saw in that white strained face half hidden in his clasped hands. What could hesitation mean but guilt? What need was there for it? Her feet seemed turned to stone upon the cold ground, and her heart almost stopped beating. There was a film before her eyes, and yet <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> face still, though dimly, and {{as if it were}} far off. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> hands withdrawn, and <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> ashen lips part slowly.|$|E
