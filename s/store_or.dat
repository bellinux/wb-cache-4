5|$|Firearm tracing {{starts at}} the {{manufacturer}} or importer and typically ends at the first private sale regardless if the private seller later sell to an FFL or uses an FFL for background checks. Analyzing data from a report released in 1997 by the National Institute of Justice, fewer than 2% of convicted criminals bought their firearm {{at a flea market}} or gun show. About 12% purchased their firearm from a retail <b>store</b> <b>or</b> pawnshop, and 80% bought from family, friends, or an illegal source.|$|E

5|$|The {{elimination}} of the paper checks from the clearing process saves the banking and treasury management industries handling, sorting, transporting, storing, safeguarding, and mailing costs. After the financial institution truncates the original paper check and reconverts it to a substitute check, the financial institution can <b>store</b> <b>or</b> archive the paper check, return the paper check to its own customer according to state law, or later destroy the paper check.|$|E
5|$|The {{small village}} of Titchwell shows {{the effect that}} {{wildlife}} visitors can have locally. It adjoins the RSPB's busiest reserve, Titchwell Marsh, and a 2002 survey reported that an estimated 137,700 visitors spent £1.8million {{in the area in}} 1998. The village has two three-star hotels and a shop selling telescopes and binoculars, although it does not have a general <b>store</b> <b>or</b> a public house.|$|E

5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a <b>store</b> <b>or</b> a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} is a fire hazard, {{especially if}} the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide sand {{is probably the most}} effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a heat sink, and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to <b>store</b> <b>or</b> handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Indiana Jones films, Spielberg shot the entire {{film in the}} United States, stating {{he did not want}} to be away from his family. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, in Deming, New Mexico. An extensive chase scene set at the fictional Marshall College was filmed between June 28 and July 7 at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut (where Spielberg's son Theo was studying). To keep in line with the fact the story takes place in the 1950s, several facades were changed, although signs were put up in between shots to tell the public what the <b>store</b> <b>or</b> restaurant actually was.|$|E

5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, <b>store,</b> <b>or</b> use it in significant quantities.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} the Sledge <b>Store,</b> <b>or</b> Phase IV. The {{building}} was erected in 1978/79, and originally housed the science offices, cold room and travel store. It is now used mainly as the travel <b>store</b> <b>or</b> sledge store. The huge amount of mountaineering or camping equipment for use in Antarctica is maintained and stored here. The cold store remains, with four large freezers storing all the base's frozen food. It was named after Sir Vivian Fuchs, BAS Director from 1958 to 1973.|$|E
