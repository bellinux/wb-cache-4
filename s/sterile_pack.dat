40|$|ABSTRACT Objective To compare {{sterility}} and microbial (bacteria and fungi) load in {{the outer}} part of hyperbaric bupivacaine (Neocaína®) in ampoule and bupivacaine in vial, in conventional and <b>sterile</b> <b>pack</b> formulations. Methods The sterile packs {{were divided into two}} groups: G 1 (n= 16) with ampoules and G 2 (n= 16) with vials. Conventional formulations were divided into two groups, being G 3 (n= 16) with ampoules and G 4 (n= 16) with vials. The ampoules and vials were opened and had their content drawn. The empty bottles were then placed in sterile plastic bags and sent for analysis of microbial load (bacteria and fungi) and sterility testing. Data were analyzed using the &# 967; 2 test with Yates correction, and 95 % confidence interval. Results G 1 and G 2 showed no bacterial growth when compared to conventional groups (p< 0. 001). The most common agent in conventional microbiological samples was Staphylococcus aureus. There was no fungal growth in both groups. Conclusion The use of (<b>sterile</b> <b>pack)</b> reduces the microbial load of bottles, and would decrease the chance of exposure to potential contamination of the anesthetic solution...|$|E
40|$|Penicillinase {{plates are}} used for the {{detection}} and enumeration of microorganisms present on surfaces of sanitary importance. The <b>sterile</b> <b>pack</b> plates are particularly useful for monitoring surfaces in clean rooms and other environmentally-controlled areas. The contact-style plates are also recommended for use in air sampling equipment such as the Surface Air System. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION Environmental sampling plates are specially constructed so that an agar medium can be over-filled, producing a meniscus or dome-shaped surface that can be pressed onto a surface for sampling its microbial burden. These plates are used {{in a variety of}} programs to establish and monitor cleaning techniques and schedules. 1 - 5 After touching the surface to be sampled with the medium, the dish is covered and incubated at an appropriate temperature.

40|$|Trypticase ™ Soy Agar is {{a general}} purpose medium which {{supports}} {{the growth of a}} variety of bacteria and fungi. The <b>Sterile</b> <b>Pack</b> plates are useful for microbial load testing of environmentally-controlled areas, clean rooms, pharmaceuticals, and other instances when sterility of the medium is of importance. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION The nutritional composition of the Trypticase Soy Agar base has made it a popular medium for many years. The medium is used for a multitude of purposes, including maintenance of stock cultures, aerobic microbial counts, isolation of microorganisms from a variety of specimen types and as a base for media containing blood. 1 - 3 It is included in the compendia of methods for the examination of water, waterwaste and foods. 4, 5 PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCEDURE The combination of casein and soy peptones in Trypticase Soy Agar renders the medium highly nutritious by supplying organic nitrogen, particularly amino acids and longer-chained peptides. The sodium chloride maintains the osmotic equilibrium. Because the entire double-bagged product is subjected to a sterilizing dose of gamma radiation, the contents inside the outer bag are sterile. 6 This allows the inner bag to be aseptically removed without introducing contaminants. Since the agar medium has been sterilized after packaging, the presence of microbial growth after sampling and incubation can be relied upon to represent true recovery and not pre-existing medium contamination...|$|E

40|$|Predation on sheep by coyotes (Canis latrans) is {{a longstanding}} problem for sheep producers. Current {{research}} suggests that surgical sterilization of coyotes {{could prove to be}} an effective method of reducing their depredation rates on domestic sheep by modifying their predatory behavior. However, for sterilization to be a viable management tool, the territorial and affiliative behaviors of pack members would need to remain in place. We tested whether surgically sterilized coyotes maintained pair bonds and territories {{in the same manner as}} intact coyotes. We also examined if territory fidelity and survival rates differed between sterile and intact coyotes. From June 1997 to April 2000, 10 males and 9 females were sham-operated and radio-collared, while 20 males and 6 females were surgically sterilized and radio-collared. We monitored members of 5 sterile and 4 intact packs during 1998, 6 sterile and 7 intact packs during 1999, and 4 sterile and 6 intact packs through the 2000 breeding season. Behaviorally, <b>sterile</b> <b>packs</b> appeared to be no different than intact packs. A half-weight association index showed that social dyads within <b>sterile</b> coyote <b>packs</b> were located together as frequently as dyads within intact packs. Simultaneous radiolocations of members of <b>sterile</b> <b>packs</b> showed that members of <b>sterile</b> <b>packs</b> were significantly closer to each other than would be expected from random locations. There was no difference in size or degree of overlap between territories of sterile and sham-operated coyote <b>packs.</b> <b>Sterile</b> coyotes had a higher annual survival rate than reproductive animals in 2 of the 3 years, and there was no difference in the level of territory fidelity. We concluded that surgical sterilization did not modify the territorial or affiliative behaviors of free-ranging coyotes, and therefore sterile coyotes could be used as a management tool to exclude other potential sheep-killing coyotes...|$|R

40|$|Predation by coyotes (Canis latrans) on {{domestic}} sheep {{is a problem}} for many livestock producers throughout the United States Intermountain West. We examined whether surgical sterilization of coyote packs would modify their predatory behavior and reduce predation rates {{on domestic}} sheep as compared to coyote packs with pups. From June 1997 to December 1997, we gathered baseline information on coyote pack size and movements. In winter 1998, we surgically sterilized and radio-collared members of 5 coyote packs. We also captured and radio-collared members of 6 packs that remained intact (i. e., reproductive). During summer 1998, only 1 <b>sterile</b> <b>pack</b> killed a lamb, while 3 intact packs killed 11 lambs. When only sheep-killing packs were included, sterile packs killed an average of 0. 35 lambs/week, while intact packs killed 1. 53 lambs/week in 1998. During winter 1999, we monitored 4 sterile and 8 intact packs. In summer 1999, 3 sterile packs killed 3 lambs, while 4 intact packs killed 22 lambs. Considering only sheep-killing packs, sterile packs killed on average 0. 38 lambs/week, while intact packs killed an average of 2. 95 lambs/week in 1999. Coyotes were more likely to kill lambs that were on the edges of coyote territories as compared to core areas. Lambs of less than average weight {{were also more likely to}} be killed by coyotes. The available rodent biomass in each territory was not an influence on the differential kill rates exhibited between sterile and intact packs, nor did the amount of available alternate prey influence annual coyote predation rates on sheep. We conclude that we could use surgical sterilization to modify the predatory behavior of coyotes associated with pup production and provisioning of pups. Sterilization successfully reduced, but did not eliminate, coyote predation on domestic sheep. The amount of losses averted in the first year exceeded the costs associated with surgically sterilizing a coyote pack, which indicates that surgical sterilization could prove beneficial on small-scale livestock operations...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Due to the {{different}} health insurance policies throughout Europe, patients are forced to reuse the catheters when performing clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). We have compared the physical qualities and the antimicrobial effects of 2 methods of reusing catheters: microwaves and storing the catheters in a 70 % alcohol solution. MATERIAL & METHODS: Two types of catheters (PVC catheter with Ergothan® top and prelubrified catheter), normally intended for single use were submitted {{to the effect of}} a microwave oven (750 W Whirlpool M 220 with rotating plate) and preservation in a 70 % alcohol solution. The studies were performed during different time durations. A recipient of water was placed in the oven to spread the microwaves and to absorb the heat and the catheters were placed in a Ziploc® bag. The physical qualities of the catheters were evaluated by using the technique of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The antimicrobial effect of the methods was evaluated after grafting the catheters with pathogenic E. coli, P. aeruginosa or S. aureus strains. RESULTS: Microwaves up to 12 minutes at 750 W caused only minimal changes in the physical qualities. However, there was only an antimicrobial effect of the microwaves on the E. coli and not on P. aeruginosa or S. aureus. If the catheter remained longer than 45 minutes in a 70 % alcohol solution, the physical qualities of the catheter changed considerably (PVC catheter with Ergothan® top much less than the prelubrified catheter). However, there was a total antimicrobial effect after 5 minutes of immersion in the 70 % alcohol solution on E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in both catheters. CONCLUSION: It should be advised to patients on CIC to use a <b>sterile</b> <b>packed</b> and not previously used PVC catheter. However, our studies have shown that immersing the catheter in a 70 % alcohol solution during 5 minutes can effectively desinfect the catheter without jeopardising the physical qualities.

We have compared the physical qualities and the antimicrobial effects of two methods of reusing catheters: microwave heating and storage of the catheters in a 70 % alcohol solution. The studies were performed during different lengths of time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three types of catheters (a standard polyvinylchloride catheter, a special polyvinylchloride catheter with flexible Ergothan tip and a prelubrified catheter), normally intended for single use, were {{submitted to the}} effect of a microwave oven (Multitech 215 High Grade and Whirlpool M 220 750 W and 1000 W with rotating plate) or preservation in a 70 % alcohol solution. To study the effects of microwave heating, a recipient of water was placed in the oven to spread the microwaves and to absorb the heat. The catheters were placed in a resealable plastic bag (Ziploc. To study the effects of preservation in a 70 % alcohol solution, the catheters were immerged in the solution for different lengths of time. Thereafter were the physical qualities of the catheters evaluated by using the technique of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The antimicrobial effect of the method was evaluated after grafting the catheters with pathogenic E. coli, P. aeruginosa or S. aureus strains. RESULTS: Microwave heating up to 12 minutes at 750 W caused only minimal changes in the physical qualities of all the catheters. However, there was only an antimicrobial effect of the microwave heating on E. coli and not on P. aeruginosa or S. aureus. If the catheter remained longer than 45 minutes in a 70 % alcohol solution, the physical qualities of the catheter changed either minimal in the special polyvinylchloride catheter with flexible Ergothan top but changed significantly in the prelubrified catheter). However, already after 5 minutes of immersion in the 70 % alcohol solution there was a complete antimicrobial effect on E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in all catheters.

40|$|Coyote (Canis latrans) {{predation}} {{accounts for}} the majority of neonatal pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) mortality in many areas and may influence local population declines. Current techniques used to manage coyote predation on wildlife species generally focus on lethal control methods. However, these methods may be controversial to the general public. Coyote sterilization is an alternative predation control method which is more acceptable to the public and {{has been shown to be}} effective in reducing sheep predation. We hypothesized that surgical sterilization of coyotes may increase pronghorn fawn survival; in the same way it reduces coyote predation on domestic sheep. Sterilization reduces the energetic need to provision coyote pups, which may decrease the predation rate on fawns by sterile coyotes. We employed tubal ligation and vasectomy of captured coyotes to maintain pair bonds and territoriality. We monitored pronghorn fawns by radio telemetry for one year pre-treatment and coyotes and pronghorn fawns one year post-treatment. We also examined the effects of sterilization on coyote territorial maintenance and survival. Survival of fawns captured in sterile coyote home ranges was higher than survival of fawns captured in intact home ranges (P = 0. 078). We also found that fawn survival was consistently higher in the northern part of the study site (P = 0. 081). A severe winter followed by a wet spring in 2007 did not reduce fawn survival and may have increased fawn survival (P = 0. 364); however, our sample sizes did not allow us to detect significance in this relationship. Our results also supported the hypothesis that sterilization, while keeping hormonal systems intact, did not change coyote territorial behaviors. <b>Sterile</b> coyote <b>packs</b> were the same size as intact packs (P = 0. 554). Sterile and intact coyote packs maintained similar home range sizes in all seasons tested (P ¡Ý 0. 556). We found differences between home range and core area overlap of <b>sterile</b> and intact <b>packs</b> in some seasons, but this trend appeared to exist before the coyotes were treated. Residency rates were similar for sterile and intact coyotes (P = 0. 406). We recommend coyote sterilization as a tool to boost pronghorn fawn survival in areas where fawn survival is a critical factor in pronghorn population persistence. Because these techniques have been tested under few circumstances, we recommend careful monitoring in future coyote sterilization programs...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} current central venous {{dialysis}} catheter (CVDC) nursing care practices in Australia. Method: A survey of dialysis units in Australia. Results: 66 % return rate (48 / 73) Internal jugular {{is the main}} insertion site (75 %) and the majority are tunneled (85 %). Insertion was performed most commonly by radiologists (34 %) followed by intensivists (24 %) with one center reporting insertion by nursing staff. CVDCs were most commonly inserted in radiology (54 %), followed by theatre (33 %). Dressings were attended weekly (55 %) or on dialysis days (45 %). Chlorhexidine was the antiseptic solution of choice (54 %) followed by povidine-iodine (37 %). In 21 % of centres Mupirocin was routinely applied {{in addition to the}} antiseptic solution. Transparent dressings were overwhelmingly favoured however most centres recommended alternatives related to patient need. 21 % of units reported enrolled nurses undertaking dressings. All units reported the use of sterile gloves and <b>sterile</b> dressing <b>packs.</b> 10 % reported different routine care for tunneled and non-tunneled. 40 % of the units collected data on infection rates per catheter days. General opinion (39 %) was identified as the reason to base CVDC protocols while descriptive studies (25 %), RCTs (23 %) and guidelines (18 %) were also reported. Conclusion: There are significant variations in the Australian nursing practice related to the care of CVDCs. Although there is still practice based on general opinion there is evidence that changes in practice in the past 8 years may be associated with knowledge derived from research. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of in situ bioremediation of Cr(VI) in groundwater and aquifer media was investigated using microcosm and mesocosm reactors inoculated with indigenous species of bacteria from dry sludge. Microcosm cores {{were used to}} simulate contaminant movement in the vadose and aquifer zones of the aquifer system. Cr(VI) breakthrough analysis through the experimental cores demonstrated successful Cr(VI) immobilisation in simulated barrier systems. Cr(VI) reduction was continuously monitored and microbial culture dynamics were evaluated using 16 S rRNA genomic fingerprinting. A culture shift was observed in the microcosm cores with the emerging predominance of known Cr(VI) reducers - Enterococci from soil and Lysinibacilli from sludge - after operation for 45 days. The Cr(VI) reduction process in the columns {{was determined to be}} enzyme mediated and non-competitively inhibited by Cr(VI). The microbial cultures under microaerobic conditions depicted a threshold Cr(VI) concentration (Cr) of approximately 100 mg/L which was much higher than the target operation concentration of 40 mg/L at the proposed remediation sites. Using the Computer Program for the Identification and Simulation of Aquatic Systems (Aquasim), it was possible to predict Cr(VI) removal efficiency and the impact of Cr(VI) toxicity on culture dynamics in the barrier. The study demonstrates the potential of applying selected Cr(VI) reducing bacteria in biological permeable reactive barrier systems in preventing the spread of the pollutant into adjacent water supply aquifers. The impact of the presence of natural carbon sources was also evaluated by filtering the feed water through a saw dust bed. Reactors without added carbon source removed up to 70 % Cr(VI), and no removal was observed in sterile controls. In the packed mesocosm reactor, the areas before the reactive barrier had no chromium reduction whereas most of the areas after the barrier achieved near 100 % reduction. The microbial dynamics were monitored by the 16 S rRNA fingerprinting after exposure to Cr(VI). After operating the microcosm reactors under oxygen stressed conditions in the presence of other soil bacteria, a community shift was expected. The soil from inoculated reactors contained a wide range of soil dwelling species of bacteria as well as the newly introduced bacteria from the dried sludge. There was a noted presence of Cr(VI) reducing bacteria, Microbacterium, Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter, Brevibacterium, Rumen bacteria, and several Enterococci in the sludge culture and Arthrobacter spp., Clostridium spp., and Klebsella spp. were amongst the evident among identified species. A non-competitive inhibition model was used for the evaluation of aerobic performances in batch experimental studies, whereas the inhibition threshold term C 0 -Cr/C 0, was introduced for the anaerobic model performance for the reduction of chromium in batch studies. In <b>sterile</b> <b>packed</b> soil columns a model for saturated soil column with dispersion was adopted from AQUASIM 2. 0. This model was used in combination with the chromium reduction rate adopted from the anaerobic batch modelling for most non sterile reactors in the microcosm performance. The study demonstrates the potential of applying selected Cr(VI) reducing bacteria in biological permeable reactive barrier systems in restraining the spread of the pollutant into adjacent water supply aquifers. The outcome of this exercise could be useful in the formulation of biological permeable barriers for protection against the spread of the pollutant from hot spots in the area. This is serves as a significant step towards a pilot study. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Chemical Engineeringunrestricte...|$|R
