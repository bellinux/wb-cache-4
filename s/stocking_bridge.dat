Further from the level crossing {{was a large}} wooden goods shed that had been extended at some time and near to the station throat a platelayers' hut. Near this hut the lines led off to the goods shed, a siding that stopped short of the goods shed and a further siding that extended right past the goods shed to reach Wellhouse Road. Passing under Bridge No 10 (Rainhall Road) the line entered a cutting with a crossover to the main line {{and the start of}} a long headshunt.

5000|$|Iron was so durable that {{it became}} the {{preferred}} metal for tools and equipment until displaced by steel after 1860. [...] Britain had iron ores but lacked a process to produce iron in quantity until in 1760 John Smeaton invented a blast furnace that could smelt iron both quickly and cheaply. His invention used an air-blast produced by a fan run by a waterwheel. In 1783 Henry Cort introduced the puddling, or reverberatory furnace, in which the final product was a pasty solid instead of a liquid. It was rolled into balls, squeezed and rolled to eliminate the impurities, or slag. The result was malleable iron in large quantities. The greatest of the early ironmasters, John Wilkinson (1728-1808) invented new machinery to process the iron. In 1779 the first cast-iron bridge was constructed across the Severn; in 1790 the first iron ship was launched. By 1830 Britain was producing 700,000 tons of iron a year; the amount quadrupled a quarter-century later, with centers in Scotland, South Wales, and Staffordshire. Railway builders were the chief customer. In 1847-48 they bought 3 million tons for rolling <b>stock,</b> <b>bridge</b> building, and station building for 2000 new miles, plus {{the demands of the}} 3000 previously built miles of railway.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} age of national highway <b>bridge</b> <b>stocks</b> demands novel management policies that can maintain or increase safety {{levels in the}} light of reducing and budgets from the government. The French Highways Agency uses its Image Qualite Ouvrages d'Art - Structural Quality Imaging (IQOA) inspection programme to determine the conditions of its bridges. The present paper principally describes the development of a model to predict different trends in bridge condition rating {{in the light of}} different management strategies. Whilst the approach described is intended to be a general method for managing bridges, it will be demonstrated by particular reference to the stock of reinforced concrete bridges managed by the French Highways Agency. The prediction model utilises Markov chains, which were chosen because they allow a non-parametric discrete model to be built, to evaluate the varying condition of the whole <b>bridge</b> <b>stock</b> over time. The development of the model is described in detail, together with how the hypotheses for applying the Markov chains were validated to accurately predict the transition matrices between different IQOA states. The paper then goes on to describe how the model is used to differentiate between different management strategies, and to predict how future costs can be optimised to give the most efficient management actions across the whole <b>bridge</b> <b>stock</b> under different constraints...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} tasks in bridge {{engineering}} is to maintain the existing <b>bridge</b> <b>stock</b> according to current and predicted traffic and safety requirements. Bridges deterioration commonly occurs due {{to a wide variety}} of pathological factors, with origin in, for example: unexpected traffic loads, vehicle impacts, environmental factors, earth movements, chloride attack, carbonation effect, lack of maintenance, de-icing salts, degradation of the drainage systems, pavement quality. Considering this, a statistical analysis of the most common pathologies in bridge structures, their origin and consequences, was carried out. This analysis was performed considering the pathologies for the overall structure, and for each bridge component. A total of 85 reinforced concrete bridges, representative of the <b>bridge</b> <b>stock</b> in Portugal, were analyzed. Additionally, a comparison of the obtained results with a similar study for Germany was developed. The main differences between the results obtained for each country within this study are pointed out...|$|R
40|$|Available {{evidence}} from lake sediment core records and short-term sediment flux sampling programs has suggested increased fine sediment deposition and suspended sediment transfers to Bassenthwaite Lake, Cumbria, U. K over recent decades. This increase in sedimentation {{has been associated}} with a decline in water quality in the lake which is thought to have had serious consequences for the population of the vendace (Coregonu albula), which also declined markedly during the 1990 ร and into the 21 St Century. Recent studies of sediment delivery risk in the catchment have suggested that there are potentially large sediment sources in the lowland river network, especially the River Derwent between Derwent Water and Bassenthwaite Lake. The aim of this research is to describe the characteristics of fluvial suspended sediment transfers to Bassenthwaite Lake through direct monitoring of the River Dement and Newlands Beck (at the head of Bassenthwaite Lake) in order to assess the potential contribution of river bank erosion on the lowland River Derwent to fine sediment delivery. Three suspended sediment monitoring stations at Portinscale and Low Stock Bndge on the River Derwent and at Newlands Beck Bridge are used to assess changes in sediment transport along these important river reaches. The potential contribution of river bank erosion to fluvial sediment delivery was assessed by river bank mapping and surveying of erosion features on the 5. 7 km reach of the River Derwent between Derwent Water and Bassenthwaite Lake, along with a detailed study of morphological change on three river banks near Low <b>Stock</b> <b>Bridge</b> using a terrestrial laser scanner. The main findings of this project suggest that the River Derwent dominates suspended sediment transfers to Bassenthwaite Lake. The fine sediment load transported on the Derwent is over five times greater than that of Newlands Beck and the mean suspended sediment concentration on the lower Derwent is 56 % higher than that on Newlands Beck. Specific catchment sediment yields for the River Derwent and Newlands Beck, based on effective drainage area, are 50. 871 km(^ 2) a(^- 1) and 35. 721 km 2 a(^- 1) respectively. A high proportion of all suspended sediment transfers in the lowland Bassenthwaite Lake catchment were observed to occur in high-magnitude, low-frequency flow events, with approximately two- thirds of total suspended sediment transport occurring in just over 10 % of the time. There is also direct evidence for increased fine sediment supply on the lowland River Derwent, as an estimated 1, 158 ta(^- 1) increase in the overall sediment load was observed on the 3. 7 km reach of the Derwent between Portinscale and Low <b>stock</b> <b>Bridge.</b> Hysteresis analysis and analysis of suspended sediment transfers during high flow events on the Derwent support this hypothesis. Overall, 21. 1 % of all river banks on the River Derwent were assessed as eroded, with 9. 4 % of banks undergoing active river bank erosion. Therefore, it is suggested that river bank erosion is a significant fine sediment source in the lowland Bassenthwaite catchment, and that it is responsible for a large proportion of sediment inputs on the lowland River Derwent (c. 18. 9 %), and ultimately to Bassenthwaite Lake...|$|R

A comprehensive database of existing bridges (17, 000 bridges with different level of knowledge) was implemented. At the core of the study stands a procedure for automatically carrying out state-of-the-art analytical evaluation of fragility curves for two performance levels – damage and collapse – on an individual bridge basis. A webGIS was developed to handle data and results. The main outputs are maps of bridge seismic risk (from the fragilities and the hazard maps) at the national level and real-time scenario damage-probability maps (from the fragilities and the scenario shake maps). In the latter case the webGIS also performs network analysis to identify routes to be followed by rescue teams.

40|$|The {{trend in}} many {{countries}} is to outsource maintenance with competitive tendering. The design of the tender is then a crucial issue. A new type of tendering contract, called "Integrated Bridge Maintenance", was introduced in one experimental area in Sweden. In this case the preventive bridge maintenance is separated from the standard road maintenance contract. The ideas behind these changes are that the new approach can increase efficiency {{through a combination of}} in­creased specialization, economies of scale and through giving the private contractor a greater degree of freedom concerning exactly what to do and exactly when to do it. A pilot project has been running since 2004 for all bridges in Uppsala County with about 400 bridges and since 2007 for all bridges in Örebro County with about 700 bridges.   The experiences and lessons from this pilot project are presented in this thesis together with guidelines on how to procure Integrated Bridge Maintenance in the future. An important feature of the contract was that it contained a combination of specific measures that the contractor should carry out and properties of the bridges that the contractor was responsible to maintain. This created a balance between predictability and flexibility for the contractor. The contractor could make long term planning for the work. The client was satisfied because of increased com­petence and a low price. The latter can partly be explained by the possibility for the specialised bridge crew to receive additional work from other clients. As information about old bridges always is incomplete a partnering structure needs to be built into the contract. Experi­ence has also shown that a conscious policy to maintain long run competition is important. The general conclusion is that the project was seen as successful and as creating more "value for money".   To manage a <b>bridge</b> <b>stock</b> optimally from a life cycle perspective is a very complex task, since the condi­tions for the individual bridge can vary greatly from place to place which the answers from the research questions indicate. Besides following-up and evaluating the Integrated Bridge Maintenance projects a number of research questions have been studied.   Is Integrated Bridge Maintenance a successful method to increase the effectiveness and to increase the standard in bridge maintenance alternatively increasing the service life for the <b>bridge</b> <b>stock</b> at an optimal cost, i. e., will IBM lead to lower LCC? It is difficult to answer this question with exact numbers after so short time, but so far the opinion is that the effectiveness has increased. How can a <b>bridge</b> <b>stock</b> develop over a long time e. g. 15 years? Based on historical data one can calculate, for instance, new construction rate, demolition rate and average age for the <b>bridge</b> <b>stock.</b> This information could together with different future scenarios be a basis for different bridge management strategies for the actual <b>bridge</b> <b>stock.</b> What is the real service life for a bridge? Survival analysis for the different types of bridges in the actual <b>bridge</b> <b>stock</b> will give a good estimate of the different expected service life. Why and at which age are bridges de­molished? Two main reasons were found in this study: deterioration process of the bridge had gone too far and/or load bearing capacity was too low, and road were rerouted. What is the real service life for a bridge edge beam, one of the most often repaired element of Swedish bridges? Survival analysis of edge beams located on different types of roads will give a good estimate of the different expected service life.   How should a long-term contract for bridge maintenance and specially Integrated Bridge Maintenance be procured? The bridge manager should have a good understanding of the answers on the research ques­tions above when the tender documents are to be prepared for the actual <b>bridge</b> <b>stock.</b> Thereafter the area that the contract should cover could be chosen, a good balance between properties and measures, defining the working cycle for properties, a flexible partnering structure in the contract and a suitable length of the contract (x years) inclusive an option (+ y years) and finally good incentives in the contract.   To sum up, the main purpose with the doctoral project has been reached. A model for procurement of bridge maintenance has been developed; see the projects in Uppsala and Örebro. The contractor has deve­loped more effective methods for bridge maintenance. The doctoral project has been a step closer to the end goal of reducing the society’s costs for bridge maintenance in the future. The bridges should be func­tional to the lowest possible cost during its expected service life (LCC). The doctoral project has also con­tributed with new knowledge in the area of bridge maintenance, the actual development of a <b>bridge</b> <b>stock</b> over time, real service life for road bridges in Sweden and survival analysis.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{for the development}} of bridge-specific fragility curves is proposed with a view to improving the reliability of loss assessment in road networks and prioritising retrofit of the <b>bridge</b> <b>stock.</b> The key features of the proposed methodology are the explicit definition of critical limit state thresholds for individual bridge components, with consideration of the effect of varying geometry, material properties, reinforcement and loading patterns on the component capacity; the methodology also includes the quantification of uncertainty in capacity, demand and damage state definition. Advanced analysis methods and tools (nonlinear static analysis and incremental dynamic response history analysis) are used for bridge component capacity and demand estimation, while reduced sampling techniques are used for uncertainty treatment. Whereas uncertainty in both capacity and demand is estimated from nonlinear analysis of detailed inelastic models, in practical application to <b>bridge</b> <b>stocks,</b> the demand is estimated through a standard response spectrum analysis of a simplified elastic model of the bridge. The simplified methodology can be efficiently applied to a large number of bridges (with different characteristics) within a road network, by means of an ad hoc developed software involving the use of a generic (elastic) bridge model, which derives bridge-specific fragility curves...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Management of the {{arterial}} road infrastructure bridges in NSW is {{a component of}} the overall road network infrastructure management undertaken by the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA). The RTA’s bridge inventory has been constructed over more than 100 years and as such there are many emerging issues regarding bridge management. The RTA recognises the importance of managing bridges and their load carrying capacity, to ensure overall network connectivity and level of service to road users. Many older bridges require replacement or significant upgrading to meet current dimensions and loading guidelines. Often these older bridges are of heritage significance. As a committed and competent bridge owner and manager, the RTA continues to proactively manage its <b>bridge</b> <b>stock</b> by: o understanding issues related to the relevant design era, o identifying and responding to changes in condition of bridge elements through a systematic and structured inspection, condition assessment and structural capability assessment regime, o addressing emerging bridge issues, o investing in new technologies, and o implementing innovative solutions in the management of its heritage <b>bridge</b> <b>stock.</b> This paper intends to address the issues relating to the management of these heritage bridges, particularly in balancing the competing factors affecting their future, especially heritage, safety and access...|$|R

The condition of elements within a selected sample of bridges is used as input in the BBN, together with a set of conditional probabilities based on inspection experience, to yield, in probabilistic terms, the overall condition of the bridge group. Sensitivity of various input parameters, as well as underlying assumptions, on group performance is investigated, which can help with the prioritization of assessment and maintenance intervention activities. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R
