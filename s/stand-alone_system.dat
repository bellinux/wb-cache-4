40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} a new methodology for {{the generation of}} hourly wind-speed data, used in the optimization of <b>stand-alone</b> <b>systems.</b> Hourly wind-speed data have been logged for many years at meteorological stations located near large cities and airports. However, in off-grid rural areas, where <b>stand-alone</b> <b>systems</b> – such as Wind-Batteries or Hybrid-Wind-Batteries – can be installed, hourly wind-speed data are not usually known. Monthly average windspeed data {{can be obtained from}} a meteorological atlas, or from certain Internet sites, such as the NASA website. The methodology presented here shows the generation of hourly wind-speed data using only the 12 -monthly average wind-speed data values and the form factor of the Weibull distribution...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Many communities {{around the world have}} no access to an electricity grid. To supply power to these people, <b>stand-alone</b> power <b>systems</b> are often used, the majority of which are based on diesel generators. Rising fuel costs and environmental concerns make the use of renewable energy in <b>stand-alone</b> <b>systems</b> increasingly attractive. The research reported in this thesis was to demonstrate a <b>stand-alone</b> power <b>system</b> based exclusively on renewable energy sources. To achieve this, a DC electrical backbone is used. Power electronic converters are used to interconnect the loads and generators and hydrogen is used as an inter-seasonal energy store. The design and control of the DC based <b>stand-alone</b> power <b>system</b> forms the primary focus of this research. A demonstration system has been implemented at West Beacon Farm in the UK. Substantial data has been collected that confirms the successful operation of the system...|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Japanese {{computer}} maker Nippon Univac Kaisha (NUK) {{set up a}} new Antics {{project with}} Kitching which ran between 1980 and 1982. This was the first machine suitable to run Antics as a dedicated <b>stand-alone</b> <b>system,</b> and included interactive full-colour and broadcast VTR recording. This became the first fully commercial configuration, and over a dozen systems were sold in Japan alone.|$|E
50|$|A new technology, ToolVu, {{has been}} {{developed}} to provide real-time feedback on thermoformer machines7. This <b>stand-alone</b> <b>system</b> connects directly to the thermoformer and utilizes multiple sensors to record production-run data in real time including air pressure, temperature, tool strain gauge and other specifications. The system sends out multiple warnings and alerts whenever pre-set production parameters are compromised during a run. This reduces machine down time, lowers startup time and decreases startup scrap.|$|E
50|$|Most {{systems are}} divided into zones. Factors {{determining}} the extent or size of a zone can include hydraulics, telemetry systems, history, and population density. Sometimes systems are designed for a specific area then are modified to accommodate development. Terrain affects hydraulics and some forms of telemetry. While each zone may operate as a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>system,</b> there is usually some arrangement to interconnect zones in order to manage equipment failures or system failures.|$|E

50|$|When {{the video}} game {{business}} began to implode in 1983, it seemed clear that video game consoles were being supplanted by home computers. Coleco's strategy was to introduce the Coleco Adam home computer, both as a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>system</b> and as an expansion module to the ColecoVision. This effort failed, in part because Adams were often unreliable, {{and in part because}} the computer's release coincided with the home computer industry crashing. Coleco withdrew from electronics early in 1985.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{quantitative}} research {{study was to determine}} the economic feasibility of a <b>stand-alone</b> PV <b>system</b> to electrify a rural area in Kenya. The research conducted involved a comprehensive review of all the relevant literature associated with the study.

The results suggest that electrifying the center using a <b>stand-alone</b> PV <b>system</b> is an economically viable option which is encouraging for the surrounding area.
