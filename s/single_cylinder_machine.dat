60|$|Up {{the steep}} hill behind them came the puffing and groaning {{of a small}} motor-car. They both turned their heads to watch it come into view. It was an {{insignificant}} affair of an almost extinct pattern, a <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>machine</b> with a round tonneau back. The engine was knocking badly as the driver brought it to a standstill {{a few yards away}} from them. Involuntarily Tavernake stiffened as he saw the two men who descended from it, and who were already passing through the gate close to where they were. One was Mr. Dowling, the other the manager of the bank where they kept their account. Mr. Dowling recognized his manager with surprise but much cordiality.|$|E

50|$|The Portuguese round {{was held}} in Jarama, Spain because the Portuguese Federation had {{transferred}} their rights to the Jarama organisers. 1987 {{would be the first}} year that saw clutch starts replace push starts on the grounds of safety.

5000|$|Wooler was a British {{manufacturer}} of motorcycles and automobiles, founded by engineer John Wooler in 1911 based in Alperton, Middlesex. The company became {{known for its}} unconventional designs which included several fore-and-aft twins, a vertical camshaft <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>machine,</b> a transverse-four beam engine, and a transverse flat four. Most machines possessed Wooler's enduring design features of a petrol tank which extended past the steering head.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, the British {{inventor}} James Dyson {{launched the}} CR01 ContraRotator, {{a type of}} washing machine with two cylinders rotating in opposite directions. It was claimed that this design reduced the wash time and produced cleaner washing than a <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>machine.</b> In 2004 there was {{the launch of the}} CR02, which was the first washing machine to gain the British Allergy Foundation Seal of Approval. However, neither of the ContraRotator machines are now in production as they were too expensive to manufacture.|$|E

5000|$|In the British Army, {{motorcycle}} despatch riders {{were first}} {{used in the}} World War I by the Royal Engineers Signal Service. When the War Department called for motorcyclists to volunteer with their machines for despatch work {{at the start of}} August 1914, the response was huge. The London office had 2000 more applicants than places, and a similar response was reported in regional centres around the country. If a rider and machine were approved then £10 was paid immediately, £5 to be paid on discharge (unless due to misconduct), and pay was 35s per week. The motor cycle would be taken over at valuation price, or will be replaced with a new one at the close of operations. Enlistment was for one year or as long as the war might last. The preference was for 500cc <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>machines</b> and the horizontally-opposed twin <b>cylinder.</b> All <b>machines</b> had to have a [...] "change speed gear".

Ernst Degner who had defected from the East German MZ team to Suzuki the previous year, brought with him the secrets of MZ’s two-stroke tuning success which undoubtedly helped him and the Suzuki team to secure the inaugural 50 cc World Championship.|$|R
40|$|It is well {{understood}} that higher steam temperatures enable increased operational efficiencies. For supercritical conditions, the forging {{best suited for}} elevated temperatures is X 12 CrMoWVNb 10 - 1 - 1, or the advanced 10 Cr steel. This {{was developed by the}} European COST 501 programme for operations at 600 °C. The 10 Cr is excellent for its high strength as well as its enhanced creep life and creep strength properties. For <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>machines</b> it was realized that a composite rotor would be needed. In the areas of lower operating temperatures where the blades are larger and have increased diameters, {{there is a need for}} improved mechanical properties over the 10 Cr rotor forging. The optimum forging for these demanding conditions is the 3. 5 NiCrMoV which has superior high cycle fatigue strength and life, increased toughness, and higher yield strength. The challenges, however, are to weld and properly heat-treat a fabricated rotor where the two forgings have large dissimilarities in chemical composition and physical properties. A three-year research project investigated and solved the problems associated with all the phases of welding and heat treatment, including 2 scaled prototypes. Since the completion of the program, the welding procedure has been applied to a number of 10 Cr rotors with service issues in the lower temperature area. The stub ends of the 10 Cr rotors were removed and replaced wit...|$|R
40|$|Seersucker {{is a thin}} {{puckered}} {{woven fabric}} in which some threads bunched together, giving a wrinkled appearance in place. Conventionally seersucker fabric is produced on weaving machines with some special warp tensioning devices. The aim of this work was to develop knitted seersucker fabric on <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> weft knitting <b>machine</b> using plain jersey structure. Core spun cotton yarn and cotton plain yarn of same linear density were fed at regular intervals to the feeders on the machine.

The results indicated that the knitted seersucker fabric has good comfort properties as well as better aesthetic appearance...|$|R

50|$|Alan Shepherd (28 September 1935 - 16 July 2007) was a British Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} road racer. His best seasons were in 1962 and 1963, when he rode a Matchless {{to finish}} in {{second place in the}} 500cc world championship, both times to Mike Hailwood.

The main component of REEV is an electric motor, battery, and generator set that consist of generator and engine. In this study, we compared two models of REEV performance with two different types of the engine by simulation. <b>Single</b> <b>cylinder</b> 499 cc gasoline engine and <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> 667 cc diesel engine are chosen as the object of this research especially relating to the utilization of the fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions when fitted to an electric vehicle. The simulation was conducted by using AVL Cruise software and performed by entering the data, both experiment and simulation data, on all the main components of REEV. This simulation was performed in Japan 08 driving cycle. Based on the simulation, fuel consumption is reduced up to 35. 59 % for REEV with <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> diesel engine 667 cc compared to REEV with <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> gasoline engine 499 cc.
