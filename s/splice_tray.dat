5000|$|Since modern splice {{cassettes}} already {{contain a}} <b>splice</b> <b>tray,</b> a splice holder, couplings and pigtails, {{the installation of}} the cables is facilitated. So-called hybrid splice boxes do not only ensure data transmission via copper cables RJ45 or fiber optics, but they also ensure the power supply. That becomes especially important when a splice box needs to be installed in indoor or outdoor applications that are difficult to access.|$|E

In {{order to}} obtain the desired visible images, the {{infrared}} images and the meteorological data for the inspection, a novel on-line inspection system for transmission lines is designed and proposed in this paper. The system consists of tower terminal units, Ethernet passive optical networks and master stations. Due to the huge monitoring data sampled by the tower terminal units at each tower, Ethernet passive optical networks are used to transmit the monitoring data in real-time. The fibers in the optical fiber composite overhead ground wires are used as the trunk fibers in the communication systems. They extend from the optical line terminal to the passive optical splitters located in the <b>splice</b> <b>trays</b> at each tower. Then the optical drop fibers are used to connect the tower terminal units and the splitters. A single-trunk-fiber network scheme, multiple-trunk-fiber network scheme and cascaded-OLT network scheme are proposed for the communication systems. The effectiveness and practicability of the proposed inspection system were verified by simulation results and the field data...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis is {{foremost}} to provide a simple guide how to build elements of optical metropolitan area network. The basic model consists to sequence of construction, network topology, passive and active parts. The collection contains examples of alternative technology such as Wireless LAN with different frequency. The optical network construction based on optical cable, fibres, <b>splices,</b> <b>trays,</b> adapters, connectors and active parts for example {{a lot of media}} convertor models. After that there are demonstrating type of wavelength division multiplexer used in metropolitan area network – passive planar PCL splitter. One of the passive planar splitter are used to increase optical fibre channel. At the end of the collection a simplified examples of used measurements – optical time domain reflectometry and optical fibre transmission. Contains standard protocols or reflectogram. The conclusion of this thesis summarizes costs of FTTb (Fibre To The Building) model of optical metropolitan area network in Czech republic and future contribution for society...|$|R
