40|$|Spatial {{variations}} in the essential aquifer parameters obtained through regular aquifer tests were evaluated for some aquifers of the Neoproterozoic sedimentary aquifers of the Voltaian Basin. Ordinary least squares regression models have also been developed to relate aquifer transmissivity and specific capacity, and well yield and transmissivity. These analyses suggest that in the northern parts of the Voltaian, aquifer transmissivity exists in a non-linear relationship with specific capacity and yield. This {{is in keeping with}} the findings of previous research {{in the southern part of}} the Voltaian, and deviates from the regular Dupuit-Thiem relationship between the two major aquifer parameters. Lithology specific models have been developed in this study. The exponent of the non-linear models appears to be related to the lithology, and tends to approach unity in the mudstone and siltstone aquifers, whilst manifesting obvious departures from nonlinearity amongst the sandstone aquifers. This study finds that the sandstone aquifers are the most prolific and offer themselves as the best lithologies for drilling successful wells in the area. Linear prediction maps suggest that the most prolific aquifers are located in the northern parts of the study area, where aquifer transmissivity, specific capacity, and well yield values are quite high due to enhanced <b>secondary</b> <b>permeabilities.</b> There has been no obvious relationship between the major aquifer parameters and static water levels, which are quite high in the middle and western sections of the study area.

The aim was to elaborate a kinematic model of the anticline and to assess the dimensional and spatial properties of the fracture network characterizing the Cretaceous sandstone reservoir of the geothermal system of Rosario de La Frontera. Special regard was devoted to explore how tectonics may affect fluid circulation at depth and control fluids' natural upwelling at surface. With this aim we performed a Discrete Fracture Network model in order to evaluate the potential of the reservoir of the studied geothermal system. The results show that the Sierra de La Candelaria regional anticline developed according to a kinematic model of transpressional inversion compatible with the latest Andean regional WNW–ESE shortening, acting on a pre-orogenic N–S normal fault. A push-up geometry developed during positive inversion controlling the development of two minor anticlines: Termas and Balboa, separated by further NNW–SSE oblique-slip fault in the northern sector of the regional anticline. Brittle deformation recorded at the outcrop scale is robustly consistent with the extensional and transpressional events recognized at regional scale. In terms of fluid circulation, the NNW–SSE and NE–SW fault planes, associated to the late stage of the positive inversion, are considered the main structures controlling the migration paths of hot fluids from the reservoir to the surface.

The internal lamination is provided by variations of the depositional facies and it is mainly displayed by alternation of more porous and less porous horizons. Despite the high primary porosity, these deposits present a low permeability, as attested by the presence of fossil gas bubbles. It follows that pores interconnection (<b>secondary</b> <b>permeability)</b> is strongly influence both by primary (depositional) and secondary (structural) factor. The presence of internal lamination deeply influences the fracture trajectories {{characterized by a}} dual attitude with parallel and cross-cutting segments. Travertine deposits represent today a primary task in many, newly discovered, oil reservoirs in the Southern Atalantic. The dimension of single fracture is under the resolution of seismic sections. Analogue field studies are thus well required to properly model the <b>secondary</b> <b>permeability</b> features. In this study we describe the patterns and the ways of fracturation in travertines. Fractures in Acquasanta-Terme travertines are characterized by portions cutting through the lamination (ramp, R) and portion running parallel to the internal lamination (lamination parallel, LaP). The combination of R and LaP results in a stairway geometry of the fractures. A Montecarlo approach was successfully used to provide a suitable model of fractures development. We found a relation between the average lamination dipping and the L/R ratio (computed dividing the cumulative length of LaP over R segments) and a relation between the average lamination dip and the angle formed by the intersection between R and LaP segments.

40|$|AbstractThe {{subsurface}} of Qishn clastic rocks, {{which are}} exposed in the Sharyoof oilfield, has been studied. The petrophysical properties, i. e., porosity and permeability of Qishn clastic reservoir rocks were investigated using well logging coupled with core data. The results {{were used to}} evaluate the reservoir quality and hydrocarbon occurrence potential. The lithology of the Qishn clastic was computed from well logs, which indicate that the lithofacies of the Qishn clastic at Sharyoof oilfield is mainly composed of sandstone and carbonates with a low amount of shale intercalations. Generally, the Qishn clastic reservoir rocks have good reservoir quality with porosity values, averaging ∼ 19. 0 %. These porosity values are mainly intergranular primary and <b>secondary</b> porosity. <b>Permeability</b> is likewise variable with values in the range of 0. 001 – 7270 mD and an average of 413 mD. This is conformed from core porosity and permeability results. However, the relatively high values of effective porosity and permeability are due to lower shale contents in the Qishn clastic rocks. The Qishn clastic reservoir rocks have been differentiated into net-pay and non-pay zones according to the cutoff (i. e., effective porosity ⩾ 10 %, shale volume ⩽ 30 % and water saturation ⩽ 50 %). The Qishn clastic reservoir rocks have high hydrocarbon saturation exceeding 70 %, with relatively high movable oil, indicating that the production is mainly oils. Therefore, the Early Cretaceous Qishn Formation acts as a hydrocarbon reservoir in the Sharyoof oilfield, Masila Basin, eastern Yemen. Reservoir property distributions of the Qishn clastic rocks such as net-pay thickness, porosity, permeability and hydrocarbon potential indicate that the best prospective region for oil accumulation is located in {{the central part of the}} study area. Therefore, the Qishn clastic rocks in the central part of the study area have promising reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon occurrence potential, which should be taken into consideration during future development of the Sharyoof oilfield...|$|R
40|$|The Brule Formation {{consists}} dominantly of non-marine siltstone with subordinate ash {{beds and}} sandstone lenses. As an aquifer, groundwater transport is mainly attributed to highly conductive <b>secondary</b> <b>permeability</b> {{in the form}} of fractures and partings. ^ In the Brule Formation, horizontal and sub-horizontal fractures developed with a simple pattern. Most are parallel to lithologic boundaries and have a zonal appearance. Vertical and sub-vertical fractures developed into more complex patterns and are either non-systematic or systematic. The systematic vertical and sub-vertical fractures include: (1) fractures of NW-SE and NE-SW trend occurring throughout the southern panhandle of Nebraska; (2) fractures of NNW-SSE and ENE-WSW trend occurring in the area north of the Lodgepole Creek valley, particularly along the North Platte River valley; (3) fractures of WNW-ESE and NNE-SSW trend occurring primarily along the Lodgepole Creek and the Sidney Draw valleys. ^ Stress field analysis indicates three stress fields, each with different characteristics, were developed after the deposition and lithification of the Brule Formation. These fields are believed to be associated with episodic Cenozoic uplift movements in western Nebraska. A common characteristic of all three is that they have a nearly vertical main stress axis with two nearly horizontal main stress axes of different orientation. The horizontal main stress axes of the stress fields appear to have rotated counter-clockwise from NNW-SSE to WNW-ESE. These fields produced three groups of high-angle shearing and extension fractures respectively, with dominant orientations of NNW-SSE, NW-SE and WNW-ESE. ^ Primary permeability in the Brule siltstones accounts only for less than thirty-five percent of the bulk permeability. <b>Secondary</b> <b>permeability</b> is mainly, if not entirely, attributed to fractures and/or fracture networks. Specific storage (Ss) values of this study are consistent between 1. 60 × 10 - 3 to 2. 70 × 10 - 3 m- 1. Values of specific yield (Sy) are between 0. 011 and 0. 044. ^ The dissolution of soluble materials, such as carbonate, is a very significant process involved in groundwater flow in Brule rocks. It was observed in outcrop that carbonate material was being dissolved from the rock matrix and moved into and along the fractures. Subsequent dissolution of soluble materials from these fracture planes produced large inter-connected channels for groundwater flow. ...|$|E
40|$|Shale gas {{formation}} exhibits {{some unusual}} reservoir characteristics: nano-darcy matrix permeability, presence of natural fractures and gas storage on the matrix surface {{that makes it}} unique in many ways. It?s difficult to design an optimum fracture treatment for such formation and even more difficult is to describe production behavior using a reservoir model. So far homogeneous, two wing fracture, and natural fracture models {{have been used for}} this purpose without much success. Micro seismic mapping technique is used to measure the fracture propagation in real time. This measurement in naturally fractured shale formation suggests a growth of fracture network instead of a traditional two wing fractures. There is an industry wise consensus that fracture network {{plays an important role in}} determining the well productivity of such formations. A well with high density of fracture networks supposed to have better productivity. Shale formations have also exhibited production pattern which is very different from conventional or tight gas reservoir. Initial flow period is marked by steep decline in production while the late time production exhibits a slow decline. One of the arguments put for this behavior is linear flow from a bi-wing fractured well at early time and contribution of adsorbed gas in production at late time. However, bi-wing fracture geometry is not supported by the micro-seismic observation. A realistic model should include both the fracture network and adsorbed gas property. In this research we have proposed a new Power Law Permability model to simulate fluid flow from hydraulically fractured Shale formation. This model was first described by Valko & Fnu (2002) and used for analyzing acid treatment jobs. The key idea of this model is to use a power law permeability function that varies with the radial distance from well bore. Scaling exponent of this power law function has been named power law index. The permeability function has also been termed as <b>secondary</b> <b>permeability.</b> This work introduces the method of Laplace solution to solve the problem of transient and pseudo steady-state flow in a fracture network. Development and validation of this method and its extension to predict the pressure (and production) behaviour of fracture network were made using a novel technic. Pressure solution was then combined with material balance through productivity index to make production forecast. Reservoir rock volume affected by the fracture stimulation treatment that contributes in the production is called effective stimulated volume. This represents the extent of fracture network in this case. Barnett shale formation is a naturally fractured shale reservoir in Fort Worth basin. Several production wells from this formation was analysed using Power Law Model and it was found that wells productivity are highly dependent on stimulated volume. Apparently the wells flow under pseudo steady state for most part of their producing life and the effect of boundary on production is evident in as soon as one months of production. Due to short period of transient flow production from Barnett formations is expected to be largely independent of the relative distribution of permeability and highly dependent on the stimulated area and induced <b>secondary</b> <b>permeability.</b> However, an indirect relationship between permeability distribution and production rate is observed. A well with low power law index shows a better (more even) <b>secondary</b> <b>permeability</b> distribution in spatial direction, larger stimulated volume and better production. A comparative analysis between the new model and traditional fracture model was made. It was found that both models can be used successfully for history matching and production forecasting from hydraulically fractured shale gas formation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{contribution}} of electron diffusion to power losses was studied. From the frequency dependence of complex permeability, the damping and resonance parameters were determined {{in the frame}} of the forced oscillator model. The damping constant correlates well with the difference between total and hysteresis losses. The complex permeability, the loss factor and the conductivity were measured as a function of frequency between 80 K and 300 K. From the tan 6 - maximum over temperature for different frequencies an activation energy was calculated. Its value agrees with the activation energy for the conductivity, showing a clear correlation between tan 6 and electron diffusion for power materials. In an attempt to influence the electron diffusion-driven magnetic behavior, electric fields perpendicular to the magnetic flux were applied to ring cores. The dependence of magnetic properties on electric fields as a function of temperature, frequency, amplitude and phase shift between magnetic and electric fields was measured. A dramatic effect on power losses in dependence of field direction was observed, showing amaximum at the temperature of the <b>secondary</b> <b>permeability</b> maximum. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Neogene extensional {{province}} of southern Tuscany in central Italy provides an outstanding example of fossil and active structurally controlled fluid flow and epithermal ore mineralization associated with post-orogenic silicic magmatism. Characterization of the hydrodynamic regime {{leading to the}} genesis of the polysulphide deposit (known as Filone di Boccheggiano) hosted within the damage zone of the Boccheggiano Fault is a key target to assess modes of fossil hydrothermal fluid circulation in the region and, more generally, to provide inferences on fault-controlled hydrothermal fluid flow in extensional settings. We provide {{a detailed description of the}} fault zone architecture and alteration/mineralization associated with the Boccheggiano ore deposit and report the results of fluid inclusion and stable oxygen isotope studies. This investigation shows that the Boccheggiano ore consists of an adularia/illite-type epithermal deposit and that sulphide ore deposition was controlled by channelling of hydrothermal fluids of dominantly meteoric origin within the highly anisotropic permeability structure of the Boccheggiano Fault. The low permeability structure of the fault core compartmentalized the fluid outflow preventing substantial cross-fault flow, with focused fluid flow occurring at the hangingwall of the fault controlled by fracture permeability. Fluid inclusion characteristics indicate that ore minerals were deposited between 280 ° and 350 °C in the upper levels of the brittle extending crust (lithostatic pressure in the order of 0. 1 GPa). Abundant vapour-rich inclusions in ore-stage quartz are consistent with fluid immiscibility and boiling, and quartz ore vein textures suggest that mineralization in the Boccheggiano ore deposit occurred during cyclic fluid flow in a deformation regime regulated by transient and fluctuating fluid pressure conditions. Results from this study (i) predict a strongly anisotropic permeability structure of the fault damage zone during crustal extension, and (ii) indicate the rate of <b>secondary</b> (structural) <b>permeability</b> creation and maintenance by active deformation in the hangingwall of extensional faults as the major factor leading to effective hydraulic transmissivity in extensional terranes. These features intimately link ore-grade mineralization in extensional settings to telescoping of hydrothermal flow along the hangingwall block(s) of major extensional fault zones...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{intestinal}} <b>permeability</b> <b>secondary</b> {{to treatment}} with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and raised levels of anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) {{have been reported}} in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. We have therefore retrospectively investigated the presence of serum AGA of the IgA and IgG classes in 70 patients with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA). Serum IgA (but not IgG) AGA were found to be higher in JCA patients than in controls (6. 2 +/- 8. 7 vs 2. 1 +/- 1. 5 AU/ml; p less than 0. 0001). This finding was observed independently of the JCA onset subtype or disease activity; however, lower levels of IgA AGA were found in patients with pauciarticular JCA and in those in remission. No significant differences in IgA AGA serum levels were observed between untreated patients and patients treated with NSAIDs. Five patients who presented the highest levels of IgA AGA were further studied a second time; serum IgA AGA were found to be markedly reduced or normalized and no clinical or laboratory evidence of coexistent coeliac disease was observed. In conclusion, our results suggest that the elevation of IgA AGA seen in our patients is secondary to non-specific immune stimulation rather than to an NSAID-induced increase in intestinal permeability...|$|R
40|$|Massive {{chemical}} reactions {{are not expected}} when injecting CO 2 in siliceous sandstone reservoirs, but their performance can be challenged by small-scale reactions and other processes affecting their transport properties. We have conducted a core flooding test with a quartzarenite plug of Lower Cretaceous age representative of the secondary reservoir of the Hontomín test site. The sample, confined at high pressure, was successively injected with DIW and CO 2 -saturated DIW for 49 days while monitoring geophysical, chemical, and hydrodynamic parameters. The plug experienced little change, without evidence of <b>secondary</b> carbonation. However, <b>permeability</b> increased {{by a factor of}} 4 (0. 022 – 0. 085 mD), and the VP/VS ratio, whose change is related with microcracking, rose from ? 1. 68 to ? 1. 8. Porosity also increased (7. 33 – 8. 1 %) from the beginning {{to the end of the}} experiment. Fluid/rock reactions were modeled with PHREEQC- 2, and they are dominated by the dissolution of Mg-calcite. Mass balances show that ? 4 % of the initial carbonate was consumed. The results suggest that mineral dissolution and microcracking may have acted in a synergistic way at the beginning of the acidic flooding. However, dissolution processes concentrated in pore throats can better explain the permeability enhancement observed over longer periods of time...|$|R
