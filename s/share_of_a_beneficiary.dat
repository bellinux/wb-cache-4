2500|$|Most {{states have}} {{property}} laws that allow a trust agreement {{to contain a}} legally enforceable restriction on the transfer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beneficial interest in the trust (sometimes known as an [...] "anti-alienation provision"). The anti-alienation provision generally prevents creditors <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beneficiary</b> from acquiring the beneficiary's <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the trust. Such a trust is sometimes called a spendthrift trust. To prevent fraud, most states allow this protection {{only to the extent}} that the beneficiary did not transfer property to the trust. Also, such provisions do not protect cash or other property once it has been transferred from the trust to the beneficiary. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, an anti-alienation provision in a spendthrift trust is recognized. This means that the beneficiary's <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the trust generally does not become property of the bankruptcy estate.|$|R
