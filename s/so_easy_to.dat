5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to take full}} {{advantage}} of the hardware, without the imposition of porting to older platforms like the PlayStation 3. The hardware let developers improve the particle system that lights Delsin's face up while he draws neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to the game world. The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity. They found the PS4's simplified architecture <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> work with that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though the hardware was new.|$|E
25|$|Other {{disadvantages}} {{of the system}} were not <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> address. For example, the gull-wing design makes creating a convertible version of the car harder, as the hinges would be removed with the roof, and standard doors would be needed for the convertible. Mercedes did so when replacing the gullwing coupe altogether with the 300SL roadster in 1958. It was never a concern for DeLorean since no convertible version was ever planned.|$|E
25|$|Cary Grant said of Stewart's acting technique:He had {{the ability}} to talk naturally. He knew that in conversations people do often {{interrupt}} one another and it's not always <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> get a thought out. It took a little time for the sound men to get used to him, but he had an enormous impact. And then, some years later, Marlon came out and did the same thing all over again—but what people forget is that Jimmy did it first.|$|E
25|$|Because this {{reference}} frame rotates {{several times a}} minute rather than only once a day like the Earth, the Coriolis acceleration produced is many times larger and <b>so</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> observe on small time and spatial scales than is the Coriolis acceleration caused by {{the rotation of the}} Earth.|$|R

25|$|Because {{of safety}} issues, {{phosgene}} is often produced and consumed {{within the same}} plant, and extraordinary measures are made to contain it. It is listed on schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention: All production sites manufacturing more than 30 tonnes per year must be declared to the OPCW. Although less dangerous than many other chemical weapons, such as sarin, phosgene is still regarded as a viable chemical warfare agent because it is <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> manufacture {{when compared to the}} production requirements of more technically advanced chemical weapons such as the first-generation nerve agent tabun.|$|E
25|$|In {{one extreme}} {{instance}} of self-censorship, the team explored an urban legend stating that a widely available material {{could be used}} to create an explosive. To their surprise, the seemingly unlikely legend proved true, but the material was <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> obtain, and the resulting explosion so powerful, that the production team decided it would be irresponsible to allow such information to reach the general public, instead electing to destroy all footage of the experiment and agreeing never to speak of the incident. Only several years later, when DARPA solicited advice from the public regarding potentially unknown bomb risks, did Savage contact them about their discovery.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} year, 400 beer houses opened and within eight years there were 46,000 across the country, far outnumbering the {{combined}} total of long-established taverns, pubs, inns and hotels. Because it was <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> obtain permission and the profits could be huge {{compared to the}} low cost of gaining permission, the number of beer houses was continuing to rise and in some towns nearly every other house in a street could be a beer house. Finally in 1869 the growth had to be checked by magisterial control and new licensing laws were introduced. Only then was it made harder to get a licence, and the licensing laws which operate today were formulated.|$|E

25|$|In this {{approach}} the so-called earlier 'rhythmic' manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry {{a wealth of}} melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later 'melodic' manuscripts' that are written on lines or use double alphabetic and neumes notation over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, the comparison {{between the two groups}} has made it possible to correct what are obvious mistakes. In other instances it is not <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the Graduale Triplex. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation 'simplex' in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Skt. Gallen.|$|E
25|$|Immanuel Kant {{regarded}} masturbation as {{a violation}} of the moral law. In the Metaphysics of Morals (1797) he made the a posteriori argument that 'such an unnatural use of one's sexual attributes' strikes 'everyone upon his thinking of it' as 'a violation of one's duty to himself', and suggested that it was regarded as immoral even to give it its proper name (unlike the case of the similarly undutiful act of suicide). He went on, however, to acknowledge that 'it is not <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> produce a rational demonstration of the inadmissibility of that unnatural use', but ultimately concluded that its immorality lay in the fact that 'a man gives up his personality … when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive'.|$|E
500|$|Rivera had an {{impeccable}} {{ability to}} accurately locate pitches and consistently throw strikes, {{particularly on the}} inside and outside edges of the strike zone. This strength offset his reliance on one pitch and hitters' anticipation of it. His former catcher Joe Girardi said, [...] "He was <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> catch because he always put the ball right there. I don't think there's ever been a pitcher that great who was <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> catch." [...] Rivera's 4.10 career strikeout-to-walk ratio in the regular season ranks ninth-best in major league history. His control was a byproduct of his smooth, easily repeated pitching motion, which some opposing hitters found to be deceptive. One such player, Darrin Fletcher, said in 1999 that Rivera [...] "almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery. It gives you a false sense of security, and then the ball is on you and it's exploding." ...|$|E

25|$|Having played {{football}} for Cambridge against Oxford in the Varsity Match of 1890, Gosling {{was awarded a}} total of five England caps between 1892 and 1895, and showed himself – according to his contemporary G.O. Smith – one of the outstanding international forwards of the day: a shade less talented than Steve Bloomer, perhaps, but far less inclined to keep the ball, and <b>so</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> play with.|$|R

He stated with regards to Freedom of Worship, [...] "I depended on the hands alone to convey about half of the message I wish to put over." [...] Rockwell's extensive effort on this work was due to his belief that religion [...] "is an extremely delicate subject. It is <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> hurt so many people's feelings." ...|$|E

It brings you to a dark, sad place then gives you this {{slap in the face}} when she turns to the elevator and smiles. Matt [...] and I didn't feel it was a sad thing.

I've never drank or smoked in my entire life, but I've seen 15-year-olds drinking and smoking and I just think that's gross."

500|$|As {{inspiration}} for the album, Duff cited indie rock band The Faint and pop singers such as Gwen Stefani and Beyoncé, while critics compared her musical style with Stefani, Janet Jackson, Depeche Mode, Madonna and Justin Timberlake. Duff felt that the album's dance-pop themes were a deviation from the pop rock of her previous albums. [...] "I didn't necessarily plan the album to sound like this, but it was <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> write to," [...] she said. Critics have noted that Dignitys musical style is dance-pop and electropop, with influences of hip hop, rock and roll and Middle Eastern music. According to Duff, the album {{is a combination of}} dance, electro and rock music.|$|E
500|$|The film {{features}} a prevalent Moroccan chant {{of the phrase}} deshi basara (proper transliteration: Tījī basara’ah) (Arabic: تيجي بسرعة), which translates to [...] "rise up" [...] (literally: [...] "come quickly"). In November 2011, Zimmer crowdsourced online audio recordings of the chant {{to be used in}} the film's score. When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, [...] "The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like an interesting thing. We've created this world, over these last two movies, and somehow I think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind." ...|$|E

500|$|Of Easy Jet's stamina {{and busy}} {{training}} regimen, Merrick said, [...] "I guess he ate at night; I don't know when else. It was unbelievable {{the amount of}} energy he had". Training for the race track generally begins when a horse is a long yearling—between one and a half and two years of age. [...] Easy Jet was <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> train that Merrick decided to oversee the training himself rather than send the horse away to a professional trainer. In a practice race at the ranch, Merrick matched the yearling against Jet Smooth. Although his elder brother had the advantage of previous race experience, Easy Jet won the 350-yard (320m) race. Easy Jet's performance prompted Merrick to enter him in a yearling race at Blue Ribbon Downs, which the colt won by more than a length.|$|E
500|$|When Black {{opts for}} 10...Bxd2, {{he runs the}} risk to end up a tempo down over the 7.a3 {{variation}} and to be soon unable to meet White's positional threats on the queenside. White can avoid the push a2–a3 and continue with the standard plans of the 7.a3 variation. However, everything is not that bad for Black. First, to implement his plan White has to concentrate on development (9.Be2, 10.0-0) before he turns {{his attention to the}} queenside. That means Black has more time to organise his play than in the 7.a3 variation, notably to attempt a blockade of the c5-square. Moreover, as White does not put immediate pressure on Black's position, Black is not compelled to castle rapidly and he can keep his king in the centre for a longer time, or even castle queenside. Hence Lalic note that [...] "White has not wasted time with a2–a3, but in fact it is not <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> capitalise on this extra tempo." ...|$|E
500|$|Sonny Bunch of The Washington Times said, [...] "The {{episode was}} both funny and smart, a wry {{commentary}} on the inherent trickiness of marketing a rebellious art form infused with sexuality to children who have no business being sexually active themselves." [...] Tamar Anitai, a blogger for MTV, said the episode was [...] "hilarious". He said [...] "The South Park writers actually appeared to sympathize, if not side with, the Jonas Brothers ... In the end, Disney and Christianity ended up getting a far more severe skewering than the Jonas Brothers." [...] Alan Sepinwall, television writer for The Star-Ledger, {{said he thought the}} Mickey Mouse character was used as an effective satirical device for corporate greed, but said he was not particularly impressed with the overall episode because [...] "its targets — the Jonas Brothers, and the Disney company for using them to sell sex to little girls with impunity — were <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> hit". In contrast, Parents Television Council (PTC), criticized the episode for such elements, and they named this episode the [...] "Worst Cable Content of the Week".|$|E
