The convergence zone produces heavy rainfall {{of up to}} 20inches (510mm) along the western Florida Panhandle, resulting in moderate stream flooding and $8.5million in damage in the state (1975USD, $34million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|In late July, a trough of low pressure, which Hurricane Blanche avoided, was {{situated}} over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. The system developed into Tropical Depression Six at 12:00UTC on July28, while located about 60mi (100km) southwest of Cape San Blas, Florida. The depression {{combined with a}} building high pressure system, resulting {{in the development of}} a <b>strong</b> <b>convergence</b> zone. This, in turn, caused heavy rainfall along the Gulf Coast, particularly in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. With sustained winds initially at 25mph (35km/h), the storm intensified slightly while tracking west-northwestward. Early on July29, the depression attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1010mbar (29.83inHg). Several hours later, it made landfall in a rural area of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, with winds of 30mph (45km/h). The system curved northwestward and dissipated at 12:00UTC on July30, shortly after crossing into Mississippi. The remnants continued into northern Louisiana and then turned northward, before dissipating over Arkansas on August3.|$|E

In this paper, we propose several possible convergence notions, and we provide complete comparisons among these concepts and the notion of <b>strong</b> uniform <b>convergence</b> in uniform spaces. It is also shown that in particularly meaningful classes of functions these notions are equivalent and can be considered as natural definitions of <b>strong</b> proximal <b>convergence.</b> Finally we consider a function acting between two proximity spaces and we connect its continuity/strong continuity to convergence in the respective hyperspaces of a natural functor associated to the function itself...|$|R
