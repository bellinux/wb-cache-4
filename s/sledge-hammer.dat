5|$|I {{have not}} the least doubt that if these Vagabonds can be stopped they must.... Let us be the <b>sledge-hammer</b> in this, or I shall be beset by {{hundreds}} of the same crew when I {{come out with a}} long story.|$|E
5|$|Becky tells Steve {{that she}} is {{pregnant}} and he later discovers that Becky has already told Claire and Steve tells his mother, Liz. Unfortunately Becky miscarries twice, although she was unaware of her 2nd pregnancy, and medical tests reveal an abnormality of the womb, meaning she is unable to carry a child full-term, making Becky decide {{that she wants to}} adopt. During the process, Steve needs a reference from Amy's mother, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who promptly uses it to cause trouble, making Becky threaten, in return, that Tracy will never see Amy again. Unfortunately Becky and Steve are refused the right to adopt because her estranged half-sister Kylie gave a bad reference and the fact that Social Services feel that it is too soon after her miscarriages. She confronts Kylie, but the sisters eventually reconcile and Becky helps Kylie reclaim custody of her son, Max. Becky becomes very attached to Max, whilst Kylie becomes more irresponsible. Kylie announces plans to move to Cyprus with her new boyfriend and Becky begs her to reconsider, so Kylie offers to sell Max to her and Steve for £20,000, which they agree to. On the night of the tram crash, Kylie returns and demands more money, so Becky steals £5,000 from the ruins of Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop, to pay Kylie off. Tracy is released from prison and the two start feuding again, particularly after Tracy discovers Max's sale and agrees to keep quiet in exchange for Amy. When Tracy is brutally attacked, Becky is arrested for the incident until Claire admits she was responsible but Becky admits looting Dev's shop, Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati) is furious but does not report her. When Liz finds out she makes life hard for Becky. Becky gets drunk and attacks Kylie and forces Liz out of the pub. Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson) offers to buy the Rovers— with the money Becky and Steve decide {{to start a new life}} abroad and steal Amy. Jim's attempts to rob a bank fail and they are forced to cancel their plans. Steve calls Social Services to check on Max and they take him into care. Becky believes Tracy made the call and smashes her front room up with a <b>sledge-hammer.</b> Before she can hit Tracy, Steve confesses. Becky walks out on Steve and goes off the rails once more.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Frank Falzon, the {{homicide}} inspector with the San Francisco police to whom White had {{turned himself in}} after the killings, said that he met with White in 1984, and that at this meeting White had confessed that he had intended to kill not only Moscone and Milk, but another supervisor, Carol Ruth Silver, as well as then-member of the California State Assembly and future San Francisco Mayor, Willie Brown. Falzon quoted White as having said, [...] "I was on a mission. I wanted four of them. Carol Ruth Silver, she was the biggest snake ... and Willie Brown, he was masterminding the whole thing." [...] Falzon indicated that he believed White, stating, [...] "I felt like I {{had been hit by}} a <b>sledge-hammer</b> ... I found out it was a premeditated murder." ...|$|E

60|$|There was {{a rush to}} the door, and a thundering clatter as {{the heavy}} blows of the <b>sledge-hammers</b> fell on the wood; while another party began an assault upon {{the door of the}} winding-engine house.|$|R
60|$|But it was {{not until}} Saturday morning that the truth dawned upon him, and struck him like a blow from a <b>sledge-hammer.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, I reckon {{a preacher}} ain't agoin' to lie. Hev you seen any Injun Christians round here?" [...] asked Girty, waving a heavy <b>sledge-hammer.</b>|$|E
60|$|The three giggling young hussies shrink {{together}} {{as if they}} would all hide behind one another, after a vain uprearing and a demand why? Madam tells them why. So they uncomfortably squeeze together under the unexpected strokes of the q-b's <b>sledge-hammer</b> Italian and more than <b>sledge-hammer</b> retaliation, there full in the Via Maqueda. They edge round one another, each attempting to get back of the other, away from the looming q-b. I perceive that this rotary motion is equivalent to a standstill, so feel called upon to say something in the manly line.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nature {{forgot to}} shade him off, I think," [...] {{observed}} Mr. Skimpole to Ada and me. [...] "A little too boisterous--like the sea. A little too vehement--like a bull {{who has made}} up his mind to consider every colour scarlet. But I grant a <b>sledge-hammering</b> sort of merit in him!" ...|$|R
60|$|But as the oarsmen violently forced {{their boat}} through the <b>sledge-hammering</b> seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks burst through, {{and in an}} instant almost, the {{temporarily}} disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.|$|R

60|$|The report {{which he}} brought back fell like the blow of a <b>sledge-hammer</b> {{on the poor}} boy's heart. His mother, they told him, was dead. She had died {{suddenly}} in the night.|$|E

60|$|Two steel doors, tight-fastened and caulked {{against the}} Cape Horn seas, opened under the {{overhang}} of the poop {{from the cabin}} on to the main deck. These doors the men proceeded to attack with <b>sledge-hammers,</b> {{while the rest of}} the gang, sheltered by the 'midship-house, showed that it stood ready for the rush when the doors were battered down.|$|R
6000|$|... "And left us--and, abune a', me, mysell, {{locked up}} in the tolbooth a' night!" [...] exclaimed the Bailie, in ire and perturbation. [...] "Ca' for forehammers, <b>sledge-hammers,</b> pinches, and coulters; send for Deacon Yettlin, the smith, an let him ken that Bailie Jarvie's shut up in the tolbooth by a Highland blackguard, whom he'll hang up as high as Haman"-- ...|$|R
50|$|A Bulletin of 1776 {{says that}} the Beloretsk Iron Factory was built in 1762 and had two blast {{furnaces}} and fourteen <b>sledge-hammers.</b> However, the first fusion of cast iron was recorded as being done in 1767. In 1777, the factory produced more iron than any other factory in Russia. Productive capacity of the factory was 122,500 poods (~2,000 metric tons) of cast iron and 80,000 poods (~1,300 metric tons) of iron per year. There were 840 male workers at the factory.|$|R
60|$|We found, to our horror, {{on going}} up to the fallen hunter, that he was quite dead. His skull had been {{literally}} smashed in, as if it had received a blow from a <b>sledge-hammer.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{thought of}} it was too horrible. It beat into her brain until she felt that her head must burst as under the blows of a <b>sledge-hammer</b> or else that she must go mad.|$|E
60|$|From {{different}} quarters, {{as he rode}} on, {{the sounds}} of violence and outrage came to young Shelton's ears; now the blows of the <b>sledge-hammer</b> on some barricaded door, and now the miserable shrieks of women.|$|E
60|$|The four murderers, meanwhile, {{ran down}} to Isaac Martin's house, {{found him in}} the garden, and {{pointing}} their muskets at him, pulled the triggers. The pieces missed fire, and poor Martin, thinking probably {{that it was a}} practical joke, laughed at them. They cocked again, however, and fired. Martin, although he fell mortally wounded, had strength to rise again and fly towards his house. The natives followed him into it. There was one of the <b>sledge-hammers</b> of the Bounty there. One of them seized it, and with one blow beat in the poor man's skull.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Eh--yeh!' said Hal. 'I {{mind when}} where that old gaffer stands was Nether Forge--Master John Collins's foundry. Many a night has his big trip-hammer shook {{me in my}} bed here. Boom-bitty! Boom-bitty! If the wind was east, I could hear Master Tom Collins's forge at Stockens {{answering}} his brother, Boom-oop! Boom-oop! and midway between, Sir John Pelham's <b>sledge-hammers</b> at Brightling would strike in like a pack o' scholars, and [...] "Hic-haec-hoc" [...] they'd say, [...] "Hic-haec-hoc," [...] till I fell asleep. Yes. The valley was as full o' forges and fineries as a May shaw o' cuckoos. All gone to grass now!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You dog!' I said; 'I have hunted {{you from}} Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg, {{and you have}} always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow's sun rise.' He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see {{on his face that}} he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my temples beat like <b>sledge-hammers,</b> and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and {{relieved}} me.|$|R
60|$|He shouted {{his last}} words {{in a tone of}} fierce defiance, let go his friend, caught up the <b>sledge-hammer,</b> and, {{whirling}} it round his head {{as if it had been}} a mere toy, turned to rush towards the sea.|$|E
6000|$|What {{could it}} be that caused Jo Grain's heart to beat against his strong ribs with the force of a <b>sledge-hammer</b> and his eyes to blaze with excitement, as he turned on his thwart and {{crouched}} like a tiger ready to spring? ...|$|E
6000|$|May {{looked up}} in his face as she asked the question. There was {{something}} in the look and in the tone which caused George Aspel's heart to beat like a <b>sledge-hammer.</b> He stooped down, and, looking into her eyes,--still in a brotherly way, said-- ...|$|E
60|$|Old swords, and pistols without ball or powder; <b>sledge-hammers,</b> knives, axes, saws, {{and weapons}} pillaged from the butchers' shops; {{a forest of}} iron bars and wooden clubs; long ladders for scaling the walls, each carried on the {{shoulders}} of a dozen men; lighted torches; tow smeared with pitch, and tar, and brimstone; staves roughly plucked from fence and paling; and even crutches taken from crippled beggars in the streets; composed their arms. When all was ready, Hugh and Dennis, with Simon Tappertit between them, led the way. Roaring and chafing like an angry sea, the crowd pressed after them.|$|R
60|$|Leroux in vain endeavoured to {{make his}} voice heard, and so tell the crowd that his guests were not spies, but had been lodged at his house by the Duke of Burgundy himself. A tall man on horseback, one of several who were evidently leaders of the mob, pressed {{his way through the}} crowd to the door and evidently gave some orders, and a din of heavy <b>sledge-hammers</b> and axes beating against it at once mingled with the shouts of the crowd. The {{horseman}} crossed again to the other side of the street and shook his fist threateningly at Leroux.|$|R
2500|$|The album {{contains}} mainly moderate-tempo dance songs, {{described as}} [...] "anthemic style melodies with really <b>sledge-hammering</b> dance beats." [...] In the {{months prior to}} the release of Born This Way, Gaga characterized her new music as [...] "something so much deeper than a wig or lipstick or a fucking meat dress" [...] and upon hearing it, Akon remarked that she will take music to the [...] "next level." [...] The album includes references to several religious figures of Christianity, notably Judas Iscariot, Mary Magdalene, and Jesus of Nazareth. Several songs on the album give reference to sexuality and feminism. Other themes referenced in the album include individualism, equality, and freedom.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{answered}} the midshipman, [...] "that {{some of us}} at least should set up the forge. I know that Williams's fingers are tingling to grasp the <b>sledge-hammer,</b> and the sooner he goes at it, too, the better, for we're badly off for tools." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{catch the}} minnow," [...] he murmured. [...] "The big fish swim on. By-the-bye," [...] he added, [...] "I do not notice that your <b>sledge-hammer</b> blows at crime are having much effect. Two undetected murders last week, and one the week before. What are you about, my astute friend?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ruth was not {{naturally}} timid, {{but when}} she suddenly beheld a half-drunken man coming towards her, and observed {{that no one else}} was near, something like a flutter of anxiety agitated her breast. At the same moment something like a <b>sledge-hammer</b> blow smote the concave side of John Gunter's bosom.|$|E
60|$|Ay, ay! we sailors sail not in vain, We {{expatriate}} {{ourselves to}} nationalise with the universe; {{and in all}} our voyages round the world, we are still accompanied by those old circumnavigators, the stars, who are shipmates and fellow-sailors of ours--sailing in heaven's blue, as we on the azure main. Let genteel generations scoff at our hardened hands, and finger-nails tipped with tar--did they ever clasp truer palms than ours? Let them feel of our sturdy hearts beating like <b>sledge-hammers</b> in those hot smithies, our bosoms; with their amber-headed canes, let them feel of our generous pulses, and swear that they go off like thirty-two-pounders.|$|R
60|$|The passive {{resistance}} of the Tolbooth gate promised {{to do more to}} baffle the purpose of the mob than the active interference of the magistrates. The heavy <b>sledge-hammers</b> continued to din against it without intermission, and with a noise which, echoed from the lofty buildings around the spot, seemed enough to have alarmed the garrison in the Castle. It was circulated among the rioters, that the troops would march down to disperse them, unless they could execute their purpose without loss of time; or that, even without quitting the fortress, the garrison might obtain the same end by throwing a bomb or two upon the street.|$|R
60|$|Bertram {{began to}} be seriously anxious for their fate. There was no stir in the house; {{it seemed as if}} the jailor had deserted his charge, and left the prison with its wretched {{inhabitants}} to the mercy of the conflagration which was spreading towards them. In the meantime a new and fierce attack was heard upon the outer gate of the correction house, which, battered with <b>sledge-hammers</b> and crows, was soon forced. The keeper, as great a coward as a bully, with his more ferocious wife, had fled; their servants readily surrendered the keys. The liberated prisoners, celebrating their deliverance with the wildest yells of joy, mingled among the mob which had given them freedom.|$|R
