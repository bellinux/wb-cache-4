5|$|The newly established, {{strategically}} strong defensive British line {{remained in}} place until mid September 1918 when the advance to Damascus and Aleppo, which ended the war in this theatre, took place. It <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> from the Mediterranean coast {{in the west to}} north and east of Jerusalem. The line was extended during the middle of February 1918 when Jericho in the Jordan Valley was captured and the eastern end of the line was secured on the Dead Sea.|$|E
5|$|Distinguished Maya warriors entered battle wearing armour. The {{upper body}} {{was covered by}} a short jacket that was filled with rock salt, and the forearms and legs were {{protected}} with tight bindings of cloth or leather. The salt-packed cotton armour was tough enough that even arrows could not penetrate it. Armour could be decorated and was often adorned with feathers. Commoners did not wear armour in battle, usually only wearing a loincloth and warpaint. Warriors carried shields made from two right-angled wooden bars with deerskin <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> them.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{increase}} in people hit by trains in 2013, in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and strategies to eliminate {{the number of people}} hit by trains. Closed-circuit television cameras, a web of laser beams <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras focused on the station's tracks were set to be installed at that station. At the unidentified station, tests have gone so well at the testing site that these track protection systems will be installed systemwide as part of the 2015–2019 capital program.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 16th century, {{tensions}} grew between Protestant England and Catholic Spain, leading ultimately to the undeclared Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604. Spain {{was in a}} strong position to attack the south of England from its possessions in the Spanish Netherlands. New fortifications were erected along the Medway, including a chain <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> {{the width of the}} river below Upnor Castle. The castle itself was poorly manned until Lord High Admiral Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham highlighted this and recommended that the garrison should be increased. By 1596, it was garrisoned by eighty men who were each paid eight pence per day (equivalent to £6 today).|$|E
5|$|The British then {{established}} garrisons {{along their}} supply lines, which <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> the Sinai from the Suez Canal. Patrols and reconnaissances were regularly {{carried out to}} protect the advance of the railway and water pipeline, built by the Egyptian Labour Corps. These supply lines were marked by railway stations and sidings, airfields, signal installations and standing camps where troops could be accommodated in tents and huts. At this time the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) had a ration strength of 156,000 soldiers, plus 13,000 Egyptian labourers.|$|E

The routes were well organised, funded, maintained, and administrated by the Mongols. This highly sophisticated system {{of communication and}} travel made it relatively easy to send important messages and travel long distances in relatively short amounts of time. As {{a result of the}} relatively lucid communication and ease of movement, the Mongols were able to govern their vast empire effectively, thus ensuring political and economic stability.|$|E

Several species of the genus Cicindela (Carabidae) have hearing organs on the dorsal surfaces of their first abdominal segments beneath the wings; two tribes in the Dynastinae (within the Scarabaeidae) have hearing organs just beneath their pronotal shields or neck membranes. Both families are sensitive to ultrasonic frequencies, with strong evidence indicating they function to detect the presence of bats by their ultrasonic echolocation.|$|E
5|$|After Inhaúma had punched {{through the}} {{defenses}} at Curupayty, he encountered three large chains <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> {{the river at}} Humaitá that prevented further progress upriver beyond the fortress. He anchored his ships in a cove that became known as Porto Elisiário (Elisiário Port). For six months, the Brazilian warships remained stationed between Curupayty and Humaitá, bombarding both strongholds without causing any serious damage. The encirclement of Humaitá could not be completed until the Allies gained full control of the river. The Allied commander-in-chief, Argentine president Bartolomé Mitre, had pressed Inhaúma for months to execute that goal. The Brazilian had, however, developed second thoughts about the enterprise and procrastinated. He believed—unfairly—that Mitre would welcome the destruction of Brazil's warships, severely weakening the Empire militarily and geopolitically.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} of {{widespread}} and determined Turkish counterattacks fought from 27 November to 1 December by the 7th Turkish Army they evacuated Jerusalem. Troops from the Australian Mounted Division were the first mounted troops to enter Jerusalem in December 1917. Towards the end of December the British Empire forces at the Battle of Jaffa and the Defence of Jerusalem succeeded in pushing the Turkish armies north. A strong British defensive line was established which remained in place until mid September 1918. The line <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> from well north of the Nahr el Auja on the Mediterranean coast {{in the west to}} north and east of Jerusalem. It was extended during the middle of February 1918 when Jericho in the Jordan Valley was captured and the eastern end of the line was secured on the Dead Sea.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth Castle is an {{artillery}} fort, built to protect Dartmouth harbour in Devon, England. The earliest {{parts of the}} castle date from the 1380s, when, {{in response to the}} threat of a French attack, the civic authorities created a small enclosure castle overlooking the mouth of the Dart estuary. This was intended to engage enemy ships with catapults and possibly early cannon, and incorporated the local chapel of Saint Petroc within its walls. At the end of the 15th century, the castle was expanded with {{an artillery}} tower and an iron chain which could be <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> the harbour to a tower at Godmerock; this addition formed the oldest known purpose-built coast artillery fort in Britain. Further gun batteries were added during the French invasion scare of the 1540s.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{operations}} {{were limited to}} the area immediately surrounding Bulolo, but as the division became established the headquarters was shifted to Tambu Bay and brigades were pushed out towards Mubo, and the Komiatum and Bobdui Ridges, while defensive patrols were undertaken through the Wampit Valley, around the Bulwa and Zenag airstrips and towards the Markham River. <b>Stretched</b> <b>across</b> a front of over , in June the division was reinforced by the US 162nd Infantry Regiment. Following this the division took on primary responsibility for Allied operations in New Guinea. Eventually Lae fell in September and soon afterwards, its elements were moved back to Port Moresby, before being sent to support the 7th Division's campaign in the Markham and Ramu Valleys and the advance on Madang.|$|E

5|$|The Sultanate of Darfur {{was one of}} the kingdoms that <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> {{the centre}} of Africa. In 1874, it was invaded by its Islamic {{neighbours}} from the south, which resulted in the country being annexed by Egypt and joined with Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. This lasted until the Mahdist War (1881–1889), when Anglo-Egyptian suzerainty was temporarily curtailed by the forces of Muhammad Ahmad, until Anglo-Egyptian control of the region was re-established following the battle of Omdurman on 2 September 1898. In 1899, Ali Dinar became the Sultan of Darfur with the approval of the then Sirdar Lord Kitchener, on the condition that he paid an annual tribute to the British. Relations between Dinar and the Anglo-Egyptians were assisted by the Inspector-General Rudolf Carl von Slatin who had knowledge of the Darfur region and its people.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Floyd in New England <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> the region from Connecticut to Maine and {{included}} two casualties. Floyd, once {{a large and}} powerful hurricane, made landfall in North Carolina and weakened as it tracked northward along the U.S. East Coast. By September 17, 1999, the storm, downgraded in strength to a tropical storm, was situated over New England. It produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds throughout the entire region, leading to widespread downing of trees and extensive power outages before it moved away later that day. In Danbury, Connecticut, Floyd triggered severe flooding, considered the worst in 40 years, that damaged hundreds of homes. Precipitation in some areas amounted to , with wind gusts approaching hurricane force in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} threat {{passed and}} in 1553 {{all of the}} blockhouses were ordered to return their guns; Milton and Higham were demolished. In the summer of 1588, however, there was a fresh threat of invasion by the Spanish Armada. An army was mobilised to protect {{the mouth of the}} estuary and emergency improvements to the fortifications at Tilbury Blockhouse were made by Rober Dudley, the Earl of Leicester. Queen Elizabeth I visited the fort by barge on 8 August 1588 and rode in procession to the nearby army camp, where she gave a speech to the assembled forces. Fears of invasion continued even after the defeat of the Armada, and {{over the course of the}} next year the Italian engineer, Federigo Giambelli, reinforced the blockhouse with probably two concentric earthwork ramparts, with ditches and a palisade. A boom was <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> the river to Gravesend at a cost of £305.|$|E

5|$|During June1966, low {{atmospheric}} pressure <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> the western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexicoa pattern that is conducive for tropical cyclogenesis. During {{the first few}} days of the month, a dissipating trough extended from the southeastern United States into the western Caribbean. A mid-level circulation developed along the trough near Cabo Gracias a Dios on June3. By the next day, the circulation had reached the surface, which marked the development of a tropical depression over eastern Nicaragua. On June 5, the depression crossed Honduras and emerged into the western Caribbean, moving north-northeastward through an area of warm sea surface temperatures. It had a good cyclonic circulation, convection, and moisture content, but most significantly, a passing trough to the north provided the depression with favorable outflow. On June 6, the depression rapidly intensified into Tropical Storm and later Hurricane Alma. This made it the earliest hurricane in the basin since Hurricane Able in 1951.|$|E
5|$|In mid-June, a mid-level {{center of}} {{circulation}} formed {{in association with}} a quasi-stationary cold front that <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> northern Florida and the extreme northeast Gulf of Mexico. On June20, a weak and disorganized {{area of low pressure}} developed in conjunction with the front and it passed by Tampa Bay, Florida the following day. Upon moving into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, there was little convection on observed on satellite imagery, although a distinguishable wind-shift was noted by an offshore buoy. However, by June23, the presence of deep convection atop a circulation had become well-defined enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify the disturbance as a tropical depression, while centered 330mi (535km) southwest of Cape Coral, Florida. Moving generally west to west-northwestward across the central Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center sent a reconnaissance plane into the tropical depression at 1500UTC on June24, at which time winds of 60mph (95km/h) were found. About three hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonnie.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{battalion}} was <b>stretched</b> <b>across</b> several locations, with companies being formed in Seymour, Victoria, Brighton, Tasmania, and Northam, Western Australia. The Tasmanians and Western Australians had initially been intended {{to join the}} 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion, and during its formative period, the companies completed basic training in their home locations, before concentrating together at Warradale, South Australia with the Tasmanians sailing to Melbourne to link up with Victorians prior to entraining for the journey west, while the Western Australians crossed the Nullarbor Plain. At this point, the unit's establishment was completed, as {{the battalion}} structure was finalised. It was structured {{along the same lines}} as the other 2nd AIF machine gun battalions, which consisted of between 800 and 900 personnel organised into a headquarters element consisting of three platoons– signals, anti-aircraft and administration– and four machine gun companies, each equipped with 12 Vickers machine guns, to make a total of 48 across the entire battalion. Within the machine gun companies there were three platoons; these were numbered sequentially starting from 1 to 3 in Headquarters Company through to 13 to 15 in 'D' Company. A Light Aid Detachment of electrical and mechanical engineers was also attached.|$|E
