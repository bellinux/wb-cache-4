50|$|The wattle-leaved {{peppermint}} (Eucalyptus acaciiformis) is a rough-barked tree {{growing to}} about 20 m in height.

40|$|Harsh climatic {{extremes}} {{and highly}} erosive soils {{play a significant}} role in determining the structure and species composition of high elevation spruce fir forests found in New Hampshire. Increased rainfall (more than 6 in per 1000 ft in elevation), snow cover (increase in weeks of snow cover per year), relative humidity (resulting in prolonged cloud cover) and wind movement (up to 25 % more at 3, 800 ft), cou-pled with decreased mean air temperature (decrease in number of frost free days) and <b>shallow,</b> nutrient <b>poor</b> <b>soils</b> result in stands predominated by conifer-ous tree species. The coniferous stands found at high elevations experience drastically slowed and lim-ited growth due to the truncated growing season and harsh climatic extremes (Vogelmann et al. 1969) an...|$|R
50|$|However, some mature {{plants of}} the cliff mallee ash are less than a metre tall. Often seen around 1.5 metres tall. Rarely {{reaching}} three metres in height. Despite being locally abundant, it is a rare plant, with a ROTAP rating of 2RCa. Named after the Australian explorer, Allan Cunningham. Recognized by the small narrow leaves, slightly paler {{on one side of}} the leaf. The habitat is <b>poor</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> in high rainfall areas, with regular fires and occasional snow.|$|R
50|$|The Sierra Morena, {{due to its}} {{morphology}} and the acidic {{content of}} its rocks, developed principally relatively <b>poor,</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>soils,</b> suitable only for forests. In the valleys and in some areas where limestone is present, deeper soils allowed farming of cereals suitable for livestock. The more complicated morphology of the Baetic Cordillera makes it more heterogeneous, with the most heterogeneous soils in Andalusia. Very roughly, {{in contrast to the}} Sierra Morena, a predominance of basic (alkaline) materials in the Cordillera Subbética, combined with a hilly landscape, generates deeper soils with greater agricultural capacity, suitable to the cultivation of olives.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the forest is conifer (Sitka spruce, Douglas fir, Japanese larch, Norway spruce and Scots pine), relatively suited to the area's <b>poor,</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>soils,</b> but recent years have seen the increased planting of native broadleaf species such as Welsh Oak, beech and ash. This has largely been done for aesthetic reasons, i.e. to produce variety and to reduce the hard lines produced by conifers. However, commercial reasons will always dictate the need for faster-growing conifers. These have a plant-harvest cycle of between 20 and 40 years (depending on type), whereas oak requires {{the best part of}} a century.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a general}} {{increase}} in the awareness of political, business and financial institutions for the necessity of concrete action to allow sustainable development in mountain regions. This increased interest in mountain regions is documented by {{the resolution of the}} UN General Assembly that declared 2002 the International Year of Mountains. The world’s mountains clearly do not lend themselves to a simple definition because of their complexity. For each region, specific characterisation is necessary. The Arctic and Alpine regions of Europe often represent the most remote and least disturbed natural environments; yet they are threatened by acid deposition, toxic air pollutants and by climate change. These environments are fragile, being subject to adverse and harsh climatic conditions (high levels of precipitation, low temperatures, aridity, high solar radiation), natural disasters (avalanches, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions), and <b>poor,</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>soils</b> prone to erosion because of steep slopes. However, the fragility of mountain ecosystems means that they are not only vulnerable to environmental change, but that they are also excellent sensors of change. Their sensitivity and the presence of high quality environmental records preserved in lake sediments can be used to infer the speed, direction and biological impact of changing air quality and climate...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{aim was to}} gain {{information}} required for improvement of wood quality in British oaks (Quercus robur and petraea). Specific aims were 1) to investigate the nature and incidence of shake in British oaks; 2) to quantify variations in oak wood structure and properties, identifying which characteristics are under genetic control and which associated with growth rate; 3) to make prescriptions for selection and silviculture of oak, {{with a view to}} improving wood quality in future British crops. Site surveys (including soil analyses) of 42 woodlands were carried out. An index of severity was devised to standardise shake assessment within individual trees. Wood structure was analysed in oaks from shake-prone and sound woodlands. Associations of wood structure and property variations with genotype and growth rate were analysed in oaks from a seed origin trial. Environmental factors were strongly associated with shake. High shake incidence occurred on sites which gave poor rooting conditions for oak: <b>shallow,</b> nutrient <b>poor</b> <b>soils</b> with low clay content and low calcium availability, and with soil texture and/or site topography leading to seasonal droughtiness or waterlogging. Woodland type (shake-prone or sound) was a stronger influence than tree condition (shaken or sound) on wood structure: oaks from shake-prone woodlands had wider rings, smaller earlywood percentage, larger wide rays and larger earlywood vessel radial diameters. Density, sapwood width, earlywood vessel frequency and proportions of wide rays and of latewood vessels and fibres varied between seed origins; these variables therefore have selection potential for improvement of oak wood quality. Many parameters also varied with growth rate, and earlywood vessel radial diameter was strongly associated with current ring width. A model of shake development is proposed in which various predispositions (structural weaknesses) and triggers (mechanical stresses) influence a tree over time. It is proposed that predispositions are caused by environmental factors at the time of wood formation, resulting in physiological stress or cambial damage. Genotype may modify response or susceptibility to environment. Predispositions may be extended by secondary weakening. Triggers of shake are thought to be natural internal growth stresses supplemented by the action of external forces (such as wind). Recommendations are made for site choice and silviculture of future British oak crops...|$|R
