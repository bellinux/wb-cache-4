Background and Statement of Issues A resident of Spencer has expressed some concern regarding potential adverse health effects from exposure to wire <b>shredder</b> <b>fluff</b> material that was emitted by Shine Brothers on July 10, 2011. It is our understanding that this wire <b>shredder</b> <b>fluff</b> material was accidentally emitted by Shine Brothers when a cyclone separator within the facility was not properly emptied and overflowed emitting the wire <b>shredder</b> <b>fluff</b> to the outside environment. A concern regarding inhalation exposure to the fluff material and exposure to the chemicals that may be found within the wire <b>shredder</b> <b>fluff</b> material was expressed by the resident. Samples of the fluff material were collected by you and analyzed for fiber content and for the concentration of a few heavy metals. This consultation will address some general issues regarding inhalation exposure to wire <b>shredder</b> <b>fluff,</b> {{a discussion of the}} potential health effects of exposure of heavy metals from incidenta...|$|E

40|$|Auto {{shredder}} residue (ASR) is the 15 to 20 percent of vehicle materials remaining after a vehicle has been shredded and removed of reusable parts and metals. ASR {{is composed of}} plastics, rubber, foam, residual metal pieces, paper, fabric, glass, sand, and dirt (EPA, 2008; USCAR, 2008). It is also termed “auto fluff ” or “auto <b>shredder</b> <b>fluff.</b> ” 2. Annual Quantities of Auto Shredder Residue Generated and Used (1) Sectors that generate auto {{shredder residue}} Auto shredding operations, categorized under NAICS 423930 (Recyclable Material Merchant Wholesalers) are the only known generators of ASR. There are approximately 185 to 200 auto shredders in the U. S. (Boughton, 2006; DeGaspari, 1999). (2) Quantities of auto shredder residue generated The U. S. generates approximately 5 million tons of ASR annually and nearly {{all of this is}} landfilled (Hook, 2008; EPA, 2008). (3) Trends in generation of auto shredder residue Quantities of ASR produced are likely to increase in the future, due to th...|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis {{reports on}} car fluff management, {{recycling}} and recovery. Car fluff is the residual waste produced by car recycling operations, particularly from hulk <b>shredding.</b> Car <b>fluff</b> is known also as Automotive Shredder Residue (ASR) {{and it is}} made of plastics, rubbers, textiles, metals and other materials, {{and it is very}} heterogeneous both in its composition and in its particle size. In fact, fines may amount to about 50...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{blending}} polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET), a flexible polyurethane (FPU), {{and a car}} <b>shredded</b> <b>fluff</b> waste (CSF) on fluidity development of a bituminous coal during carbonization have been studied by means of high-torque, small-amplitude controlled-strain rheometry and in situ high-temperature H- 1 NMR spectroscopy. The most detrimental effects were caused by PET and PS, which completely destroyed the fluidity of the coal. The CSF had a deleterious effect on coal fluidity {{similar to that of}} PET, although the deleterious effect on the viscoelastic properties of the coal were less pronounced than those of PET and PS. On the contrary, the addition of 10 wt % PE caused a slight reduction in the concentration of fluid hydrogen and an increase in the minimum complex viscosity, and the addition of 10 wt % FPU reduced the concentration of fluid hydrogen without changing the viscoelastic properties of the coal. Although these results suggest that these two plastics could potentially be used as additives in coking blends without compromising coke porosity, {{it was found that the}} semicoke strengths were reduced by adding 2 wt % FPU and 5 wt % PE. Therefore, it is unlikely that more than 2 wt % of a plastic waste could be added to a coal blend without deterioration in coke quality...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the thermal {{recovery}} of manganese and zinc from a mixture of zinc-carbon and alkaline spent batteries containing 40. 9 % of Mn and 30. 1 % of Zn after a preliminary physical treatment. Separation of the metals is carried out {{on the basis of their}} different phase change temperatures, theboiling point of zinc being 906 °C and 1564 °C that of Mn 3 O 4, the main Mn-bearing phase in the mixture. After wet comminution and sieving to remove the anodic collectors and most of the chlorides contained in the mixture, chemical and X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) analyses were performed. The mixture was heated in CO 2 atmosphere and the temperature raised, thus permitting the zinc oxide to be reduced to metallic zinc by the carbon present in the originalmixture. Other tests were carried out by addition to the mixture of activated charcoal (95 % C) or of the automotive <b>shredder</b> residue (<b>fluff)</b> containing 45 % C. A zinc product was obtained suitable, after refining,for the production of new batteries. The treatmentresidue consisted of manganese and iron oxides that could be used to produce manganese-iron alloys. From these results, an integrated process for the recovery of the two metals was proposed. © 2014 Science Publication...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAutomotive <b>shredder</b> <b>fluff</b> is a {{by-product}} vacuumed during the shredding of end-of-life vehicles (ELV) hulks, and further refined in Post-Shredder lines of Treatment (PST). To date in Europe the mineral part exiting the PST is mostly landfilled without regards for its potentially valuable iron content. Yet, iron {{could be used}} a use {{as part of the}} ore in blast furnaces, provided several issues related to the chemical composition of fluff were solved. Besides increasing iron content, several tramp elements must be curbed below tight specifications to avoid iron spoiling, furnace wall corrosion, and changes in the hydrodynamic profiles during iron reduction. The present work aims at designing such a fluff sorting process, on the basis of two representative fluff fractions properly sampled on an industrial PST. The size distributions of these fractions and the repartitions of their chemical elements are used to rationalize and compare three different sorting processes which couple sieving, wet attrition, and dry or wet Low Intensity Magnetic Separation. The best process led to an optimized iron recovery of 78. 5 % corresponding to an elemental iron content of 51 %, close to the ore grade required in a blast furnace. At the global scale of ELV recycling, these results entail an increase by 4 % of the fluff recycling rate, thus helping to meet the European requirements for 2015...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 5 th April 2019. Closed-loop supply chain {{strategies}} for End-of-Life (EOL) products and their logistics operations have received greater attention {{in recent years}} from supply chain research community. These strategies include warranty–based acquisition, quantity–based acquisition, quality–based acquisition, centrally coordinated logistics operations and third-party logistics (3 PL) operations. The proposed research integrates two important aspects of an automobile's closed-loop supply chain strategy. The first aspect is optimal transportation planning for raw material parts, newly manufactured and EOL products in a closed-loop supply chain, using demand, collection rate and capacity of associated facilities in the network as functional parameters. We formulated a mixed integer mathematical model for the closed-loop supply chain network with a multi-echelon inventory, multi-period planning and multi-product scenario, which are used to compute the maximum contribution margin generated through different strategies. The second aspect pertains to using {{the output of the}} proposed model in first stage to handle the sequential form of a cooperative game. The proposed two–phase decision model analyzes the realization times and delivery limits of different products as an indicator of swapping different strategies. We analyze three instances to understand and validate the applicability of the model. In these scenarios, sensitivity analysis has been performed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model. We present managerial insights, leading to flexibility in decision making. It is observed that the demand, collection rate and capacity of network facilities create highly sensitive trilogy for the contribution margin of proposed network. The outcome of this research firstly confers optimal amounts of mass flows in the closed loop supply chain network from a state of the end product (new products, recycled products and non–recycled used products) to a state of the raw material (ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal and <b>shredder</b> <b>fluff).</b> Secondly, authors culminated a confound dichotomy among all reintegration strategies (conveyance, acquisition and cannibalization) by distinct enumeration and quantification (regarding realization times and delivery limits) of each one to forge a robust planning horizon for original equipment manufacturer...|$|E
