The fragility is captured by a devaluation premium in expectations that increases the average inflation rate when the currency peg is more vulnerable to “busts” than “booms”.

40|$|High {{unemployment}} rates among educated workers in Morocco {{and many other}} developing countries is a serious issue. The worsening unemployment problem among educated workers in Morocco started with the cuts to public sector hiring under structural adjustment policies implemented in 1983. Thus, this paper analyzes {{the evolution of the}} determinants of employment and the status in employment and wages in this country after 1983 using a cohort approach. Estimates based on microdata from the 1998 Moroccan labour force survey confirm the deterioration in employment of educated workers after 1983. The results also show that the contraction of employment opportunities has increased the probability of considering self-employment as an alternative to unemployment, except for university graduates who still prefer paid work and, consequently, risk long periods of unemployment. Results also exhibit a significant decline over time in returns to education, whereas paid employment opportunities and wages have improved for uneducated workers.

Institutional reforms stand a greater chance of succeeding when there is adequate institutional diagnosis and design, including assessment of the interest groups affected and the ability of top leaders to mobilize support for reform. A good case can be made for bringing the key players together in a process approach to diagnosis, so that diagnosis becomes an early stage of consensus building among those who will be affected by the reforms.

40|$|Following {{the massive}} {{economic}} policy restructuring and reforms {{since the early}} 1980 s, currency substitution, asset substitution and de facto dollarisation have become common phenomena in nearly all transition and developing economies. High and persistent inflation which have been a perennial feature of developing and transition economies is now known to be highly responsible for currency substitution, asset substitution and de facto dollarisation. This paper presents evidence on the macrodynamics of de facto dollarisation, currency substitution and asset substitution during {{the era of the}} implementation of the Financial <b>Sector</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programmes (FINSAPs) in developing and transition economies with special reference to Ghana. The study has found out that de facto dollarisation whether in the form of asset substitution or currency substitution is highly prevalent and poses a serious threat to fiscal and monetary policies effectiveness in developing and transition economies. In Ghana, the principal long-run mainspring of de facto dollarisation is the ad hoc implementation of financial sector development programme that was embarked upon about two decades ago which has resulted in high exchange rate depreciation and price fluctuations. It is, however, likely that as the financial sector develops over a long period a time will come when further development of the financial sector would no longer instigate de facto dollarisation. ...|$|R

As a consequence, the current Greek sovereign debt crisis could potentially have adverse economic implications for SEE. Both real and financial transmission channels might have a bearing, though in most countries real economic linkages do not seem as strong as the degree of interconnectedness in the realms of banking and finance, where risks might materialize both directly and indirectly (i. e. via changes in expectations and risk perceptions). So far, the Greek crisis has only had a relatively limited impact on SEE. Available buffers and policy tools have helped SEE to cope with the related risks and also provide some more room for the region to address vulnerabilities caused by the Greek crisis that may materialize in the future. Possible challenges appear to be largest in the realm of banking, even though banking <b>sector</b> <b>adjustment</b> during the crisis has been fairly orderly so far.

International donor agencies often used a "technocratic approach" {{in the conduct of}} these studies, exercising excessive control and allowing for little indigenous participation in the policy analysis process. Limited indigenous participation in and appropriation of education sector studies became identified as an obstacle to improved education policy implementation. The "participatory approach" to development was soon adopted by some donor agencies as a means to build educational research and policy analysis capacity in Sub-Saharan African countries. This study examined a set of ten donor supported education sector studies undertaken between 1990 and 1994 in Sub-Saharan African countries, determined the extent of indigenous participation and identified the conditionalisites that explain its presence or absence. In general, the research findings indicated that the practice of education sector analysis fell far short of the rhetoric which had embraced the need for increased indigenous participation. Constraints within donor agencies were traced to the administrative procedures and incentives related to project funding and disbursement pressures, while those in Sub-Saharan countries were linked to nascent democratic values and systems of governance, lack of political leadership and a public service life with inter-ministerial conflict and self-interest...|$|R

Estimates from a vector auto regression model (VAR) of key macroeconomic variables demonstrate the weak link between money supply and inflation in the both time horizons, {{which suggests that the}} hypothesis that money supply is not an effective policy instrument for management of inflationary developments cannot be rejected for Nigeria.
