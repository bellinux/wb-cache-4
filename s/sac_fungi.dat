5|$|Some true fungi specialise in the {{colonisation}} of the Myxogastriae: {{almost all}} of these are species of <b>sac</b> <b>fungi.</b> The most common such fungus is Verticillium rexianummainly species from Comatricha or Stemonitis. Gliocladium album and Sesquicillium microsporum are often found on Physaridae, while Polycephalomyces tomentosus is often found on certain species of Trichiidae. Nectriopsis violacea specialises on Fuligo septica. Bacterial associates, mainly from the family Enterobacteriaceae, were discovered on plasmodia. The combination of plasmodia and bacteria can bind atmospheric nitrogen or produce enzymes which make possible the decomposition of e.g. lignin, carboxymethylcellulose or xylan. In a few cases, the plasmodia acquired salt tolerance or tolerance of heavy metals through this association.|$|E
5|$|The Ascomycota, {{commonly}} known as <b>sac</b> <b>fungi</b> or ascomycetes, constitute the largest taxonomic group within the Eumycota. These fungi form meiotic spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an ascus. This phylum includes morels, a few mushrooms and truffles, unicellular yeasts (e.g., of the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Candida), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Claviceps. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called anamorphic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest teleomorphs in the Ascomycota. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes {{have been used for}} elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., Neurospora crassa).|$|E
5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} milk caps infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially soft, white hyphen fungus, also known as a subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other <b>sac</b> <b>fungi,</b> in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other milk caps. Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different milk caps and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|E

5|$|The tiny <b>sac</b> <b>fungus</b> Phyllachora banksiae {{subspecies}} westraliensis {{has been}} described from the leaves of B.speciosa, its sole host. This fungus manifests as round flat cream-coloured spots around 1–3mm in diameter on the upper leaf surface. The surrounding leaf tissue is sometimes discoloured orange. One or two shiny black fruit bodies measuring around 0.25–0.75 by 0.25–1mm appear in {{the centre of the}} spots.|$|R
50|$|Many herbivores detest the resinuous pittosporums, in {{particular}} their seeds, which will stick anywhere. But some animals eat them with relish, {{for example the}} kea (Nestor notabilis), which likes P. anomalum fruit and seeds. The cottony cushion scale (Icerya purchasi) is a common pest on ornamental pittosporums ({{in particular}} the New Zealand species); the <b>sac</b> <b>fungus</b> Nectriella pironii often infects Japanese cheesewood.|$|R
50|$|Other {{animals that}} eat Opuntia include the prickly pear island snail and Cyclura rock iguanas. The fruit are relished by many arid land animals, chiefly birds, which thus help {{distribute}} the seeds. Opuntia pathogens include the <b>sac</b> <b>fungus</b> Colletotrichum coccodes and Sammons' Opuntia virus. The ant Crematogaster opuntiae and the spider Theridion opuntia are named {{because of their}} association with prickly pear cacti.|$|R

50|$|The most virulent {{cork oak}} {{pathogen}} may be Diplodia corticola, a <b>sac</b> <b>fungus</b> which causes sap-bleeding sunken canker wounds in the wood, withering of the leaves, and lesions on the acorns. The fungus Biscogniauxia mediterranea {{is becoming more}} common in cork oak forests. Its fruiting bodies appear as charcoal-black cankers. Both of these fungi are transmitted by the oak pinhole borer (Platypus cylindrus), a species of weevil.|$|R
5000|$|As it {{approaches}} a mate, a haploid <b>sac</b> <b>fungus</b> develops {{one of two}} complementary organs, a [...] "female" [...] ascogonium or a [...] "male" [...] antheridium. These organs resemble gametangia except that they contain only nuclei. A bridge, the trichogyne forms, that provides a passage for nuclei to travel from the antheridium to the ascogonium. A dikaryote grows from the ascogonium, and karyogamy occurs in the fruiting body.|$|R

5000|$|A {{number of}} natural enemies have been recorded, {{such as the}} mite Aceria balasi, which attacks the inflorescence, the moths Clytie illunaris, Metzneria aprilella, and Ornativalva plutelliformis, which feed on the seeds, and the weevil Styphlus penicillus, which feeds on the leaves. Ramularia crupinae, first {{described}} from the plant, is a pathogenic <b>sac</b> <b>fungus</b> that grows on its leaves. No agents of biological pest control have been established.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the plant}} {{pathogens}} that affect this genus are the <b>sac</b> <b>fungus</b> Cochliobolus sativus, {{which has been}} noted on common barnyard grass, and rice hoja blanca virus. Both affect many other grass species, in particular most important cereals, and Echinochloa weeds {{may serve as a}} reservoir. The fungi Drechslera monoceras and Exserohilum monoceras have been evaluated with some success as potential biocontrol agents of common barnyard grass in rice fields. More research is necessary, however, because they may not be host-specific enough to be of practical use.|$|R
50|$|Grosmannia clavigera is {{a species}} of <b>sac</b> <b>fungus</b> that causes blue stain in wood. It spreads to {{lodgepole}} pine, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and whitebark pine trees from the body and a special structure in the heads of mountain pine beetles. The blue stain fungus has evolved a relationship with mountain pine beetles {{that allow them to}} travel from tree to tree on a special structure in the beetle’s heads and stops the tree from producing resin to pitch out or kill the beetle, encouraging the pine beetle infestation occurring all along the Rocky Mountains from Mexico into Canada. The beetles are able to mine and lay eggs while avoiding the tree’s defenses. The 33 Mb genome of this fungus was sequenced in 2009.|$|R
