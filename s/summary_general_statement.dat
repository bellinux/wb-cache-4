However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the <b>general</b> <b>statement.</b> One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|R
