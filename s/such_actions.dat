5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In <b>such</b> <b>actions,</b> an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E

5|$|Rebirth and {{realms of}} {{existence}} are foundational teachings of Mahavira. According to the Acaranga Sutra, Mahavira comprehended life {{to exist in}} myriad forms, such as animals, plants, insects, water bodies, fire bodies, wind bodies, elemental forms, and others. He taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing {{any one of them}} including plants, never swim in water, nor light a fire or extinguish it, nor thrash their arms in the air as <b>such</b> <b>actions</b> can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.|$|E
5|$|Several {{supporters}} of the attack later said on a messageboard that taking down websites {{was not enough to}} convince the government to back down on the web filtering policy and called for violence.

A spokesman for Electronic Frontiers Australia said he believed there was no real intention or capacity to follow through with any of the violent threats.|$|E
5|$|A demon {{comes to}} steal the ring from Thalaba, but he is stopped by the young boy. This allows Thalaba to demand {{information}} about the sorcerers and why his family was killed. Time passes and Thalaba settles into a pastoral life at Irem and plans to marry Moath's daughter, Oneiza. However, Thalaba decides that his duty prohibits him from <b>such</b> <b>actions,</b> and he leaves to fulfill his destiny. However, the sorcerer Lobaba tricks Thalaba and tries {{to steal the}} ring. After many failed attempts, Lobaba tries to convince Thalaba to harness the ring's magic power, which would bring Thalaba harm. Instead, Thalaba argues {{against the use of}} magic in general and realises that Lobaba is evil. Although Thalaba attempts to kill Lobaba and fails by the sorcerer's magic, a storm comes and destroys the sorcerer.|$|E

5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any <b>such</b> <b>actions)</b> were {{stunned by the}} size and ferocity of the offensive. The {{light at the end}} of the tunnel had been extinguished, if it had ever existed at all. The president, in an attempt to nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E
5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the mental anguish and moral {{dilemmas}} of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of <b>such</b> <b>actions,</b> and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E

Though downtown Des Moines was under a mandatory evacuation, team officials received permission from the city {{to play the game}} as long as no fans were allowed into Principal Park. In order to keep fans away, the lights and scoreboard were not turned on, the game was not broadcast in the local market, and a message on the team's website announced that the game was postponed. PCL Commissioner Branch Rickey III believed that {{this was the first time}} <b>such</b> <b>actions</b> were taken out of necessity. Kremblas' Sounds ended with a 59–81record, the second-lowest in the team's history.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of wasp species are solitary insects. Having mated, the adult female forages alone and if it builds a nest, does so {{for the benefit of}} its own offspring. Some solitary wasps nest in small groups alongside others of their species, but each is involved in caring for its own offspring (except for <b>such</b> <b>actions</b> as stealing other wasp's prey or laying in other wasp's nests). There are some species of solitary wasp that build communal nests, each insect having its own cell and providing food for its own offspring, but these wasps do not adopt the division of labour and the complex behavioural patterns adopted by eusocial species.|$|E
5|$|Whitehall's powers over Southern Rhodesia {{under the}} 1923 {{constitution}} were, on paper, considerable; the British Crown was theoretically able to cancel any passed bill within a year, or alter the constitution however it wished. These reserved powers {{were intended to}} protect the indigenous black Africans from discriminatory legislation and to safeguard British commercial interests in the colony, but as Claire Palley comments in her constitutional history of the country, {{it would have been}} extremely difficult for Whitehall to enforce <b>such</b> <b>actions,</b> and attempting to do so would have probably caused a crisis. In the event, they were never exercised. A generally co-operative relationship developed between Whitehall and the colonial government and civil service in Salisbury, and dispute was rare.|$|E

5|$|Đính and {{the leading}} generals in the MRC {{also had a}} secret plan to end the {{communist}} insurgency, which called itself the National Liberation Front (NLF) and claimed to be independent {{of the government of}} North Vietnam. They claimed that most of them were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Diệm. The generals agreed with this viewpoint and thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible. The government also rebuffed American proposals to bomb North Vietnam on the grounds that <b>such</b> <b>actions</b> would cede the moral high ground, which they claimed on the basis of fighting in a purely defensive manner. However, the plans to bring the NLF into the mainstream were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|Emmett's {{departure}} brought Lindwall's tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised his speedster not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, fearing <b>such</b> <b>actions</b> {{would be}} interpreted as retaliation and provoke a negative media and crowd reaction. After not bowling in the first innings, Miller came on and immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the bails. Washbrook then drove Lindwall for four before Miller bounced him in the next over. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. Lindwall followed Miller's lead towards Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. Following a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the matter faded away and the bowler was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman.|$|E
5|$|In Plans and the Structure of Behavior, Miller and his co-authors {{tried to}} explain through an artificial-intelligence {{computational}} perspective how animals plan and act. This was a radical break from behaviorism which explained behavior as a set or sequence of stimulus-response actions. The authors introduced a planning element controlling <b>such</b> <b>actions.</b> They saw all plans as being executed based on input using a stored or inherited information of the environment (called the image), and using a strategy called test-operate-test-exit (TOTE). The image was essentially a stored memory of all past context, akin to Tolman's cognitive map. The TOTE strategy, in its initial test phase, compared the input against the image; if there was incongruity the operate function attempted to reduce it. This cycle would be repeated till the incongruity vanished, and then the exit function would be invoked, passing control to another TOTE unit in a hierarchically arranged scheme.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, Serbs and Montenegrins {{from the local}} area attacked villages, and Adriatic Command sent the 2nd Company of the 7th Battalion from Bileća to reinforce the Ustaše. After a brief clash near Korita, during which the Ustaše and gendarmerie lost one killed and several wounded, the rebels withdrew across the nearby border into Montenegro. The 2nd Company of the 7th Battalion {{spent the night in}} the village of Stepen before establishing itself as the Avtovac garrison the following day. Due to its exposure to fire from rebels overlooking their location, the gendarmes were unable to re-occupy their post in Stepen, which meant that the Stepen–Korita road was no longer secure. On 8 June, the district office in Gacko reported to Adriatic Command that they had taken 200 Serbs as hostages and issued a proclamation to the population to cease fighting and surrender their weapons. As this proclamation met with no response, on 10 June the Ustaše Commissioner for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jure Francetić, had 19 hostages shot (one escaped). On 12 June, the gendarmerie in Ravno shot four people on the orders of the Ustaše commissioner for Ljubinje. <b>Such</b> <b>actions</b> led to Serb peasants leaving their villages to seek safety in more remote areas, and Muslim villagers became increasingly nervous about their Serb neighbours.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some {{visitors}} {{would write}} {{their names on}} the Wall, or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that <b>such</b> <b>actions</b> compromised {{the sanctity of the}} Wall. Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper Havatzelet in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration. More recently the Yalkut Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness. Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a halachic point of view. Blasphemous graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began to peel away.|$|E
5|$|Just a {{week after}} Hurricane Juan hit Nova Scotia, the Newfoundland and Labrador Emergency Measures Organization advised the general public to take {{appropriate}} actions for the anticipated effects of Hurricane Kate, including high winds and potentially up to 3in (80mm) of rain. <b>Such</b> <b>actions</b> include securing loose objects, cleaning debris from storm drains, and owning appropriate hurricane supplies (such as a charged cell phone and batteries {{in the event of}} power outages). A cruise ship scheduled to stop in St. John's bypassed Newfoundland to avoid the storm. The Newfoundland and Maritimes Weather Center issued a storm warning for Newfoundland, while the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane-force wind warning. Due to the expected combination of moisture from Kate and a cold front, the Canadian Hurricane Centre also issued a heavy rainfall warning for southeastern Newfoundland. Offshore, waves were expected to reach 33feet (10m), while marine wind warnings were issued as well.|$|E
