40|$|The witness seminar ”Systemutveckling och långtidsplanering vid SAS Data i Stockholm, 1964 – 1982 ” [Systems {{development}} and long-range planning at SAS Data Services in Stockholm, 1964 – 1982] {{took place at}} Tekniska museet [The National Museum of Science and Technology] in Stockholm on 5 December 2007 and was led by Gustav Sjöblom. SAS was a pioneer in advanced computer systems development, beginning {{with the development of}} the reservations system in Copenhagen in the late 1950 s. Computer systems development was initially carried out in the individual departments of SAS, but in 1963 – 64 SAS Data Services was established as a separate department directly under the CEO – rather than {{as a part of the}} financial department which was customary at the time – by bringing in staff with experience of rationalisation and computing from different departments within SAS. SAS Data Services was geographically divided with major offices in Copenhagen and Stockholm and a smaller office in Oslo. The theme of the witness seminar was the work carried out in Stockholm, where the department initially specialized in systems {{development and}} long-range planning, while operations and programming was based in Copenhagen. The <b>Stockholm</b> <b>group</b> soon embarked upon an ambitious and holistic plan for improving SAS operations by means of a large number of integrated computer systems such as MATS for Material Supply and Inventory Control, MOPS for Maintenance Overhaul and Planning, RES for Reservations, LOCS for Load Control and Planning and OPS for Operational Planning and Control. Although the individual systems were cutting-edge and considerable in size, what made SAS stand out was the consistency in systems planning and the integration of different systems into a long-range plan and into the core of SAS business management...|$|E
