50|$|The parish was {{established}} in 1858, three years after Northfield was founded by John W. North in 1855. The congregation originally held services in the Northfield Lyceum building. In 1866, the Reverend <b>Solomon</b> <b>S.</b> Burleson organized an effort {{to raise money for}} a new building. The architect is unknown, but there is speculation that Bishop Henry Whipple {{may have contributed to the}} design, since he had an interest in architecture. The church is designed in a Gothic Revival style, with a wood frame and board and batten siding. In 1869 children in Sunday School classes organized an effort to buy a bell for the tower. The building was expanded ten years later, lengthening the church by twenty feet. This expansion was driven by the influx of students from Carleton College.|$|R
