40|$|BACKGROUND: Stepping {{impairments}} {{are associated}} with physical and cognitive decline in older adults and increased fall risk. Exercise interventions can reduce fall risk, but adherence is often low. A new exergame involving step training may provide an enjoyable exercise alternative for preventing falls in older people. PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility and safety of unsupervised, home-based <b>step</b> <b>pad</b> training and determine {{the effectiveness of this}} intervention on stepping performance and associated fall risk in older people. DESIGN: Single-blinded two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing <b>step</b> <b>pad</b> training with control (no-intervention). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven older adults residing in independent-living units of a retirement village in Sydney, Australia. INTERVENTION: Intervention group (IG) participants were provided with a computerized <b>step</b> <b>pad</b> system connected to their TVs and played a step game as often as they liked (with a recommended dose of 2 - 3 sessions per week for 15 - 20 minutes each) for eight weeks. In addition, IG participants were asked to complete a choice stepping reaction time (CSRT) task once each week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CSRT, the Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA), neuropsychological and functional mobility measures were assessed at baseline and eight week follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-two participants completed the study (86. 5 %). IG participants played a median 2. 75 sessions/week and no adverse events were reported. Compared to the control group, the IG significantly improved their CSRT (F 31, 1  =  18. 203, p<. 001), PPA composite scores (F 31, 1  =  12. 706, p =  0. 001), as well as the postural sway (F 31, 1  =  4. 226, p =  0. 049) and contrast sensitivity (F 31, 1  =  4. 415, p =  0. 044) PPA sub-component scores. In addition, the IG improved significantly in their dual-task ability as assessed by a timed up and go test/verbal fluency task (F 31, 1  =  4. 226, p =  0. 049). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Step</b> <b>pad</b> training can be safely undertaken at home to improve physical and cognitive parameters of fall risk in older people without major cognitive and physical impairments.

40|$|With aging, {{sensorimotor}} {{and specific}} cognitive functions decline with one consequence being an increased fall risk. Taking rapid and wellcoordinated steps {{is important for}} safely moving around in a challenging environment and requires functional sensorimotor and cognitive ability to avoid falling. Interactive cognitive-motor training, such as exergaming (exercise within video games) is a recent development {{from the field of}} video games. They involve stimuli presented on a projection screen and human gross motor movements as responses. A <b>step</b> <b>pad</b> is an exergame response device that requires players to step in different directions depending on the presented stimuli with step times and errors recorded. Hence, <b>step</b> <b>pad</b> systems combine sensorimotor and cognitive abilities in a functional context. The main aims of the project were: 1. To investigate whether an easily administered step test that combines stepping and cognition can predict falls in older people without major cognitive impairment 2. To explore whether games/tasks that combine stepping and specific cognitive functions are beneficial in improving sensorimotor and cognitive risk factors for falls in older people. To answer the first question, several step tests were developed based on evidence regarding the importance of specific cognitive functions on fall risk and validated in cross-sectional and cohort studies. To answer the second question, two randomised controlled trials were conducted using different exergames. During both interventions participants exercised unsupervised at home. The main findings of this project were: - Step tests that include an inhibitory component discriminate between fallers and non-fallers - ‘iCSRT’, a test that combines rapid step initiation with inhibition and response selection predicts falls in older people - Playing a modified open source stepping exergame improved sensorimotor functions - Playing a range of stepping exergames improved some tests of cognitive functioning Findings of this PhD demonstrate that the combination of stepping and executive functioning is associated with falls in older people. An easy-to administer step test using exergame technology {{can be used as a}} fall risk screen. Stepping exergames can also be used to improve important sensorimotor and cognitive risk factors for falls. This intervention can be carried out unsupervised in the home setting...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double seals with a gas buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double seal arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double gas buffered sealing system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double gas sealing device. The double gas seal with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two gas sealing faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside gas seal leaks to process and the inside gas seal leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh <b>step</b> <b>pad</b> lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional gas seal. The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the gas seal face. With the configuration described, the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double gas sealing technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh <b>step</b> <b>pad</b> bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double gas sealing solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|E

Two of these enzymes are Escherichia coli lactaldehyde (ALD) and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenases (PAD), which participate in the metabolism of fucose and phenylalanine, respectively. These isozymes share some properties with the better characterized mammalian enzymes but have kinetic properties that are unique. It was possible to thread the sequences into the known ones for the mammalian isozymes to better understand some structural differences. Both isozymes were homotetramers, but PAD used both NAD+ and NADP+ but with a clear preference for NAD, while ALD used only NAD+.

Both enzymes possessed esterase activity that was stimulated by NADH; NAD+ stimulated the esterase activity of PAD but not of ALD.

Wet reagents are not ideal for point-of-care because they must be refrigerated and typically limit automation and require more user <b>steps.</b> Conjugate <b>pads</b> allow drying but do not offer any control of the reagent distribution upon rehydration and can {{be a source of}} error when pads do not contact the assay membrane uniformly. Furthermore, each reagent is dried on a separate pad, increasing the fabrication complexity when implementing multistep assays that require several different reagents. Conversely, our novel method allows for consistent, controlled rehydration from patterned reagent storage depots directly within the paper membrane. In this assay demonstration, four separate reagents were patterned in different regions of the assay device: a gold-antibody conjugate used for antigen detection and three different signal enhancement components that must not be mixed until immediately before use.
