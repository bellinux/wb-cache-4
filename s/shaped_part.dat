25|$|Marta D. Rădulescu (April 24, 1912 – 1959) was a Romanian poet, journalist, and novelist, {{made famous}} in the 1930s for her autofictional work. From an {{academic}} family {{with a penchant for}} radical politics, she veered into fascist politics, supporting the Iron Guard. The commitment <b>shaped</b> <b>part</b> of her work, which, from a satirical rendition of education in the provinces, becomes a document of interwar radicalization and student political battles. Scandal followed the publication of her early prose works, particularly after claims that they had been largely or entirely written by her father—or, alternatively, by her friend and putative lover N. Crevedia. Her polemic with Crevedia was consumed in the national press and in books written by both participants.|$|E

2500|$|The horse's {{circulatory system}} {{includes}} the four-chambered heart, averaging [...] in weight, {{as well as}} the blood and blood vessels. Its main purpose is to circulate blood throughout the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues, and to remove waste from these tissues. The hoof (including the frog - the V <b>shaped</b> <b>part</b> {{on the bottom of the}} horses hoof) is a very important part of the circulatory system. As the horse puts weight onto the hoof, the hoof wall is pushed outwards and the frog compressed, driving blood out of the frog, the digital pad, and the laminae of the hoof. [...] When weight is removed from the hoof, the release of pressure pulls blood back down into the foot again. [...] This effectively creates an auxiliary blood-pumping system at the end of each leg. [...] Some of this effect is lost when a horse is shod (eliminating the expansion and contraction of the hoof wall and raising the frog higher from the ground).|$|E

40|$|Part-based {{representation}} {{has become}} an essential representation for objects. Different <b>parts</b> of a <b>shape</b> have various importance to shape perception. Concerned by the contributions of local parts to the perception of global shapes, we introduce an importance measure of <b>shape</b> <b>parts</b> {{from the viewpoint of}} their “reconstructability”. Given one <b>shape</b> <b>part</b> as a local observation, we estimate the global object shapes through a proposed novel shape reconstruction method. The reconstruction quality is determined by part geometry variation and part uniqueness. Then a conditional entropy formulation is introduced to measure the part importance considering the reconstruction quality, part uniqueness and variation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefit of the proposed part importance to object detection applications. Moreover, psychological experiments are conducted to further support the consistency of our importance measure with human perception towards <b>shape</b> <b>parts.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Object {{classification}} {{needs to}} address {{not only the}} changes resulting from various viewpoints but also the different shapes that can be classified into the same category. We present a new framework and its implementation for generic object classification from raw range images, combining structural and functional concepts. The framework addresses low and mid level problems for the decomposition of range images into primitive <b>shape</b> <b>parts,</b> presenting concepts for the classification of <b>shape</b> <b>parts,</b> and calculation of part properties and relations. New concepts are described, addressing the different aspects of generic class descriptions by functional parts. A mapping of functionality (and functional parts) to the primitive <b>shape</b> <b>parts</b> is presented, introducing functional part recognizers. Our approach mainly supports a top-level recognition process in which classes are verified using a verification tree in which functional parts and their realization hypotheses are explored. An algorithm for an effective traversing of the verification tree is presented, in which probabilities of hypotheses and classes are estimated. An experimental system applying our classification concepts to several classes was implemented and tested on a database of real raw range images of objects...|$|R

A useful piece of imagery is an [...] "M" [...] shaped graph, representing overall cost on the Y axis. If the initial state is on the [...] "V" [...] <b>shaped</b> <b>part</b> of the [...] "M", II will settle into the high valley, the local minimum.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{automatic}} recognition of functional parts of man-made 3 D shapes in the presence of significant geometric and topological variations. We observe that under such challenging circumstances, the context of a part within a 3 D shape provides important cues for learning the semantics of shapes. We propose to model the context as structural relationships between <b>shape</b> <b>parts</b> and use them, in addition to part geometry, as cues for functionality recognition. We represent a 3 D shape as a graph interconnecting parts that share some spatial relationships. We model the context of a <b>shape</b> <b>part</b> as walks in the graph. Similarity between <b>shape</b> <b>parts</b> can then be defined as the similarity between their contexts, which in turn can be efficiently computed using graph kernels. This formulation enables us to: (1) find part-wise semantic correspondences between 3 D shapes in a nonsupervised manner and without relying on user-specified textual tags, and (2) design classifiers that learn in a supervised manner the functionality of the shape components. We specifically show that the performance of the proposed context-aware similarity measure in finding part-wise correspondences outperforms geometry-only-based techniques and that contextual analysis is effective in dealing with shapes exhibiting large geometric and topological variations...|$|R

5000|$|The Strike One uses a Bergmann System {{introduced}} in the Bergmann-Bayard pistol. Unlike the Browning system, the barrel does not tilt. It is locked with a Y <b>shaped</b> <b>part</b> that during the recoil locks the barrel and bolt and halfway through it drops, releasing the barrel. The barrel stops its motion, the bolt continues back, ejecting the spent cartridge case and loading fresh cartridge and on its way back the Y shaped locking fork reengages and the barrel and bolt move together forward. Instead of tilting the barrel only moves in a straight line, thus increasing the accuracy. The Strike one is rated for +P+ ammunition and specifically set up to fire Russian 9×19mm ammunition 7N21 and 7N31 which are close to [...]357 SIG in their performance. The pistol will be available in: 9×19mm Parabellum, 9×21mm IMI, [...]357 SIG, and [...]40 S&W. There is no discussion for 10mm Auto or [...]45 ACP versions, although a [...]38 Super version is being considered due to this cartridge's popularity in Italy in particular (Italian laws forbid civilians to have weapons in the same caliber as military and police). A fully automatic version of the Strike One has been offered for the Russian Armed Forces. Longer barreled version (300mm) is also available.|$|E
