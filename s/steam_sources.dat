40|$|AbstractWhen {{the unit}} is under normal operating, the <b>steam</b> <b>source</b> of plant-steam is from the fourth steam {{extraction}} of turbine.

In this paper, {{in order to improve}} the economy when the turbine is operating under the low load, reheat cold section steam is used as high-pressure steam to extract the fourth steam by the steam technology, which turns the low-pressure steam into the medium-pressure steam for recycling.

40|$|Although steam {{is widely}} used in {{industrial}} production, there is often an imbalance between steam supply and demand, which ultimately results in steam waste. To solve this problem, steam accumulators (SAs) {{can be used as}} thermal energy storage and buffer units. However, it is difficult to promote the application of SAs due to high investment costs, which directly depend on the usage volume. Thus, the operation of SAs should be optimized to reduce initial investment through volume minimization. In this work, <b>steam</b> <b>sources</b> (SSs) are classified into two types: controllable <b>steam</b> <b>sources</b> (CSSs) and uncontrollable <b>steam</b> <b>sources</b> (UCSSs). A basic oxygen furnace (BOF) was selected {{as an example of a}} UCSS to study the optimal operation of an SA with a single BOF and sets of parallel-operating BOFs. In another case, a new method whereby CSSs cooperate with SAs is reported, and the mathematical model of the minimum necessary thermal energy storage capacity (NTESC) is established. A solving program for this mathematical model is also designed. The results show that for UCSSs, applying an SA in two parallel-operating SSs requires less capacity than that required between a single SS and its consumer. For CSSs, the proposed minimum NTESC method can effectively find the optimal operation and the minimum volume of an SA. The optimized volume of an SA is smaller than that used in practice, which results in a better steam storage effect...|$|E

40|$|An {{examination}} {{has been}} made of the recovery of waste steam by three techniques: direct heat exchange to process, mechanical compression, and thermocompression. Near atmospheric <b>steam</b> <b>sources</b> were considered, but the techniques developed are equally applicable to other sources of steam. The interaction of the recovery system with the plant's steam/power system has been included. Typical operating economics have been prepared. It was found that the profitability of most recovery schemes is generally dependent on the techniques used, the existing steam/power system, and the relative costs of steam and power. However, there will always be site-specific factors to consider. It is shown that direct heat exchange and thermocompression will always yield an energy profit when interacting with PRVs in the powerhouse. A set of typical comparisons between the three recovery techniques, interacting with various powerhouse and plant steam system configurations, is presented. A brief outline of the analysis techniques needed to prepare the comparison is also shown. Only operating costs are examined; capital costs are so size - and site-specific as to be impossible to generalize.

40|$|It must be {{stressed}} that {{the assessment of the}} exploitation possibilities of the energy resources discussed in this paper requires further studies. With this proviso, the situation can be provisionally summarised as follows: The total potential of known geothermal <b>steam</b> <b>sources</b> is only 64 GW. Geothermal energy could therefore only make a significant contribution to covering the worldwide power needs if we succeed in exploiting dry geothermal reservoirs. Exploitation of tidal energy is limited to a few geographically favourable locations. The power generation potential at these locations is only about 64 GW. An important drawback of tidal power is discontinuous power generation. Large scale exploitation of wind, wave and glacier energy, and of ocean heat, requires solution of a number of technological problems. The environmental effects of exploitation of these energy resources are to some extent of a qualitatively different nature from those of operation of fossil-fuel-fired and of nuclear power plants. The scanty knowledge in this area often results in these effects being underestimated. In any case, however, it would be deliberately misleading to postulate that any form of power generation is possible without some detrimental effects on the environment. It may be stated in conclusion that, owing to their small potential or to the as yet insufficiently advanced technological development, none of the energy resources discussed in this paper can make a significant contribution to the solution of middle-term energy supply problems, i. e., to a rapid replacement of mineral oil and natural gas...|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 59 This {{tutorial}} {{will present}} {{an overview of}} the operation and design of steam turbines used for driving reactor and boiler feed pumps, called a boiler feed pump turbine (BFPT). Overall, these turbines are designed {{in much the same way}} as other mechanical drive turbines; however, there are characteristics to these units that make them unique to this application. A feed pump turbine must be integrated and completely compatible with the pump and the main turbine generator (TG) unit because these pieces of equipment are so interrelated. One of the most unique features of these turbines is their ability to operate from two separate and very different steam supplies. To accommodate these <b>steam</b> <b>sources,</b> two separate inlets must be used, each with its own special characteristics. The high pressure (HP) inlet has a separate steam chest designed to accept the boiler pressure. This inlet will feed a nozzle block that has an arc of admission of 25 percent or less. The low pressure (LP) inlet generally utilizes approximately 50 percent of the arc and has a much larger flow passing area. This type of turbine varies in output across the operating range of the plant. There are two basic operating cycles. The two pump operating cycle usually runs between 40 percent and 110 percent main unit load (MUL), this operation is achieved by using all LP steam. The one pump operating cycle, startup to approximately 65 percent MUL, uses both <b>steam</b> <b>sources.</b> The percent of each is determined by the load required, as well as the LP steam conditions. As the load increases on the TG main unit, the LP pressure supply to the BFPT increases, the HP steam is used to start up the BFPT unit and supplemented by the LP steam source to achieve the required load. There are numerous other factors beside modes of operation to consider when designing a boiler feed pump turbine. These include the speed and power requirements of the pump, steam characteristics from the main unit and boiler, and exhaust pressure. From a mechanical perspective there are a number of design features available on the style turbine to consider for maintaining reliability. The most obvious design feature is the single flow versus double flow design. The rotating component of the turbine, the rotor, is the key for maintaining reliability. It consists of an integrally forged shaft, blades with various styles of fastening, and shrouds or blade covers. The blades have either an axial or radial entry design root to secure them to the disk portion of the shaft. Shrouding also has multiple variations. It can be riveted, integral, integral with wire, or an integral interlocking design. Stationary elements consist of the diaphragms and labyrinth seals. The diaphragms direct the flow between the rotating blade rows. All boiler feed pump turbines have two journal bearings and a thrust bearing. In most cases tilting pad journal bearings are used because of their inherent stability and damping characteristics. Thrust bearings are mostly the standard double acting type. Controlling the steam flow to the turbine is done with the valve operating gear assembly. This assembly consists of simple linkage arrangement that controls the lift of the diffuser valves feeding the low pressure chest and the high pressure valve. The entire assembly is raised and lowered by an oil controlled servo motor. There are various other peripherals such as turning gears, probes, and rounding brushes that may or may not be used, which will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} carried out in {{cooperation}} between the Division of Heat and Power Technology at Chalmers University of Technology, CIT Industriell Energianalys AB, AGA Gas AB, Akzo Nobel Sverige AB, Borealis AB, INEOS Sverige AB and Perstorp Oxo AB. A Total Site Analysis (TSA) was performed in this study which {{can be used as a}} basis for future implementations of energy system integration at the chemical cluster in Stenungsund. At first stream data (Tstart, Ttarget, Q) and data on overall utility consumption of all the processes in the cluster was collected. The analysis is based on data collected on process streams heated or cooled with utility exceeding a heat load of 300 kW. Additionally steam from by-product incineration which cannot be utilised in another way is considered as process heat. With this data the current energy system was analysed by determining steam excess and deficit at each steam level and company. After that, the data was represented in curves, the so called total site profiles (TSP) and the total site composite curves (TSC). The curves were used to determine the site pinch (the limiting factor for further integration) and to identify measures to increase heat recovery. The measures found by TSA were assessed qualitatively with respect to feasibility to determine the most attractive measures. Finally the site wide potential for cogeneration and measures for reduction of external cooling demand below ambient temperature was analysed. Main findings are presented in the following: From the stream data collected is can be seen that the total demand of hot and cold utility of the cluster is 442 MW and 953 MW respectively. By-products, which have to be incinerated on-site provide 40 MW of steam. To cover the external heat demand additional 122 MW of heat is supplied by steam/hot oil from boilers or directly by flue gas from added fuels purchased or available on site. The TSP and TSC curves show a site pinch at the 2 bar(g) steam system (132 °C). The site pinch limits the potential for heat integration. To increase energy savings by heat integration it is necessary to change the position of the site pinch. It was shown that theoretically by introducing a site-wide hot water circuit, increased recovery of 2 bar(g) steam and adjustment steam levels in several heat exchangers the pinch point can be moved so that hot utility savings of 122 MW plus excess of 7 MW steam at 85 bar(g) can be realised. Only introducing a hot water circuit can save 51 MW of steam from added fuels, which corresponds to estimated savings of 122 MSEK/year. It is possible to replace more steam by hot water, but the demand for 2 bar(g) steam is limited. Therefore a demand for low pressure steam must be created by adjusting steam levels in order to utilise more waste heat in a hot water circuit. The present delivery of heat to the district heating system is not affected by a site wide hot water circuit. There is potential for increased recovery of 33 MW of 2 bar(g) steam from process heat. This would replace the production of the same amount of steam in the boilers, worth 79 MSEK/year. A qualitative assessment on the implementation of a hot water circuit shows estimated steam savings of 55. 2 MW (132 MSEK/year) with moderate changes (83. 5 MW including more complex changes, 200 MSEK/year). Technically the introduction of a hot water circuit includes hot water pipes between several plants, as most of the consumers of heat are situated at the cracker site and at Perstorp but the sources are spread out across the cluster. Also piping is necessary to transfer the 2 bar(g) steam replaced by hot water to other plants with steam deficit. The practical potential for increased 2 bar(g) steam recovery is estimated to 4. 2 MW (10 MSEK/year) with moderate changes and 26. 6 MW including more complex changes (64 MSEK/year). Increased 2 bar(g) recovery implies the construction of steam pipes from Borealis to Perstorp and INEOS, as most of the potential <b>steam</b> <b>sources</b> are located at Borealis but Perstorp and INEOS have a demand for 2 bar(g) steam The theoretical cogeneration potential in the cluster is 19 MWel in addition to the 10 MWel generated today (additional revenue is 40 MSEK/year) assuming that steam demand at all pressure levels remains the same but the steam systems are connected with each other. A practical option to increase cogeneration with the existing equipment is to supply steam below 8. 8 bar(g) produced at Borealis to INEOS, Akzo and Perstorp. This would result in additional 8. 6 MWel by cogeneration in Borealis turbo-alternator (estimated revenue: 18 MSEK/year). Some process streams below ambient temperature are heated with steam. It has been shown that 6. 5 MW steam is used for heating stream well below ambient temperature. This steam can be saved and the cooling energy can be recovered. This decreases the energy usage in the cooling system and also saves heating steam. Savings up to 48 MSEK/year were estimated. It has been shown that by site wide collaboration it is possible to increase heat recovery, cogeneration and utilisation of waste heat. The results from this study are the bases to identify concrete projects which contribute to cost and CO 2 emissions savings. The study also shows the advantages of TSA in order to find solutions for process integration by the utility system on a site wide level...|$|E

Traditional obstacle to utilisation of geothermal steam for chemical processes has been the limited steam temperatures and pressures available from the geothermal fluid separators.
