Moreover, the polymerized DNAs appear to be covalently attached to the AbiK protein, presumably because an amino acid serves as a primer.

In addition, we undertake a detailed search for ORF-less group II introns in bacterial genomes in order to find undiscovered introns that either entirely lack an ORF or encode a novel ORF.

In this study, we extensively analyzed repeated sequences in the genome of Rickettsia conorii and examined their locations in regard to coding versus noncoding regions.

Of the 10 families, three palindromic sequence families showed clear cases of insertions into open reading frames (ORFs).

40|$|Most NAE (nucleic acid enzyme) sensors are {{composed}} of an RNA-cleaving catalytic motif and an aptameric receptor. They operate by activating or repressing the catalytic activity of a relevant NAE through the conformational change in the aptamer upon target binding. To transduce a molecular recognition event to a fluorescence signal, a fluorophore-quencher pair is attached to {{opposite ends of the}} RNA substrate such that when the NAE cleaves the substrate, an increased level of fluorescence can be generated. However, almost all NAE sensors to date harbor either NAEs that cannot accommodate a fluorophore-quencher pair near the cleavage site or those that can accept such a modification but require divalent transition metal ions for catalysis. Therefore, the signaling magnitude and the versatility of current NAE sensors might not suffice for analytical and biological applications. Here we report an RNA-cleaving DNA enzyme, termed ‘MgZ’, which depends on Mg 2 + for its activity and can accommodate bulky dye moieties next to the cleavage site. MgZ was created by in vitro selection. The selection scheme entailed acidic buffering and ethanol-based reaction stoppage to remove <b>selfish</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Characterization of MgZ revealed a three-way junction structure, a cleavage rate of 1 min− 1, and 26 -fold fluorescence enhancement. Two ligand-responsive NAE sensors were rationally designed by linking an aptamer sequence to the substrate of MgZ. In the absence of the target, the aptamer-linked substrate is locked into a conformation that prohibits MgZ from accessing the substrate. In the presence of the target, the aptamer releases the substrate, which induces MgZ-mediated RNA cleavage. The discovery of MgZ and the introduction of the above NAE sensor design strategy should facilitate future efforts in sensor engineering...|$|R

In this review, we provide an overview of mobile element biology and describe the application of certain mobile elements, especially the SINEs and other retrotransposons, to forensic genomics.

Large areas of parameter space permit maintenance of mobile DNAs where, without selection, they would have gone extinct. Horizontal transfer diminishes, rather than enhances, mean copy number.

The deletion is widespread in C. briggsae natural populations and is associated with deleterious organismal effects.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Centromeres and the {{kinetochore}} {{proteins that}} bind them {{are required for}} chromosome segregation during every eukaryotic cell division. Despite this conserved function, ongoing conflict between <b>selfish</b> centromeric <b>DNA</b> and the proteins of the kinetochore causes both to rapidly evolve. Centromeres (centromeric DNA satellite arrays) are able to gain evolutionary advantages by driving during asymmetric female meiosis, in turn conferring a selective advantage to kinetochore proteins that can suppress centromeric imbalances. For example, the centromeric variant of histone H 3 (CenH 3), the basis of kinetochore function and the epigenetic mark of active centromeres, is rapidly evolving across many taxa, including primates. While conflict with driving centromeres can explain the rapid evolution of CenH 3, it cannot explain incongruent patterns of functional complementation and localization. I show that that the co-evolutionary constraints of chaperone interaction drive these divergent patterns of CenH 3 functional divergence. The {{presence or absence of}} a conserved centromeric histone chaperone, SCM 3 /HJURP, in the genome is able to fully predict the differences in functional complementation and localization of CenH 3. I expand previous evolutionary analyses using genomic sequence data and evolutionary analysis to explore how the entire primate kinetochore is shaped by conflict with centromeres. I find that the primate inner kinetochore is defined by rapid evolution, while the outer kinetochore and fibrous corona are undergoing purifying selection. Furthermore, I find that the CenH 3 chaperone HJURP is also evolving under positive selection. The extensive adaptive evolution of the primate kinetochore provides new evidence of the breath of the conflict between centromere and kinetochore, as well as new targets to investigate the functional consequences of genetic conflict on cell division and kinetochore localization...|$|R
