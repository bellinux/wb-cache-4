50|$|The Virginia groundcherry is native {{through much}} of the United States as well as Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick. It is {{considered}} rare in parts of Ontario. However, along {{with other members of the}} Physalis genus are aggressive species and have been found to be an invasive in some parts of the United States. A specific example of the aggressive capabilities of Physalis virginiana is its effect on soy bean production in Kentucky. The berries are often crushed during the soy bean harvest which allows the Physalis seeds to cling to the soybean <b>seeds.</b> <b>Certification</b> standards for soy bean production requires that no more than 62/ha black nightshade or groundcherry plants should be found at inspection, entry for. This problem has led to scientific studies on ways to reduce black nightshade and groundcherry populations around soybean farms.

5000|$|Although {{it was an}} {{important}} disease historically, Blackleg of potato is less of an issue today due to very successful results from changes in cultural practices regarding <b>seed</b> potato <b>certification</b> programs. [...] As a major problem in wet, cool seasons and irrigated fields, historically it has more heavily impacted northern U.S. states with climates amenable to disease development, with disease incidence levels as high as 10%. In places like Scotland, it historically has had disease incidence levels of up to 30%. [...] Victoria, Australia also had issues with this disease in the past. [...] In terms {{of the impact of the}} disease on yields, one past study indicated that for every 1% increase in disease incidence, yields generally trended down at 0.8%.|$|R
5000|$|Since PLRV is {{persistently}} transmitted {{it makes}} for easier means of control. Studies have shown a minimum of twelve hours {{is required for the}} virus to be transmissible by an aphid. Therefore, PLRV can be controlled effectively by reducing aphid populations. Systemic and foliar insecticides can be used to prevent aphid feeding. Since virus takes several hours to be transmitted by aphids systemic insecticides are utilized and the aphid dies before it can transmit the virus. Foliar pesticides are utilized when colonizing aphid populations get too high and are useful as a knockdown method, to rapidly reduce aphid populations.Imidacloprid, Methamidophos and Endosulfan are commonly used in aphid control. [...] One study found that ethyl-methyl parathion pesticides are less effective at controlling the green peach aphid at lower temperatures. At 25 degrees Celsius aphid mortality was 95%. At 17 degrees Celsius mortality was 90%, at 10 degrees Celsius mortality was 80%, and at 7 degrees Celsius mortality was 67%. This suggests that some chemical controls are more effective at higher temperatures. [...] Other management strategies include sanitation and <b>seed</b> <b>certification.</b> Cleaning any volunteer tubers from a field reduces any reservoirs that may persist. <b>Seed</b> <b>certification</b> programs test seed lots utilizing ELISA for the detection of multiple potato viruses. Seed lots can then be rated by the amount of infection. Highly infected seed lots are rejected and not used the next season.|$|E

40|$|Viral {{diseases}} that can reduce yield and tuber quality are major concerns for potato growers. To produce healthy potato tubers and prevent yield reduction, a certification scheme for foundation class seed potato propagation {{has been established}} at the Seed Improvement and Propagation Station in Taiwan. The certification scheme uses an ELISA technique to index specific virus diseases such as Potato virus Y (PVY), Potato leafroll virus (PLRV), Potato virus X (PVX), Potato virus A (PVA), and Potato virus S (PVS). In order to produce foundation class potato tubers, the Dorfman group testing procedure is adopted. The Dorfman testing procedure utilizes a two-stage sampling scheme. The first stage comprises making measurements on all groups. The second stage involves no retesting for negative testing groups and exhaustive testing of all constituent individual samples of positive testing groups. In the <b>seed</b> potato <b>certification</b> scheme in Taiwan, field investigations have usually used groups of 20 plants. However, because {{of the limitations of}} available financial resources, the effect of group size on cost is an important consideration. Thus, selection of group size for design considerations is a critical issue. In order to solve the problem, we present the expected cost model as a nonlinear integer programming problem and determine the optimal group size such that the expected cost is minimized. The result demonstrates that the optimal sample size for group testing is 13 plants per group and that the cost, using this optimal group size, is not greatly different from the cost when using 20 plants per group. Thus, 20 plants per group is reasonable for the group testing procedure with regard to cost considerations. The result of this research could be useful in the execution of the <b>seed</b> potato <b>certification</b> program...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Potato virus Y (PVY, genus Potyvirus) causes {{substantial}} {{economic losses}} in solanaceous plants. Routine screening for PVY {{is an essential}} part of <b>seed</b> potato <b>certification,</b> and serological assays are often used. The commercial, commonly used monoclonal antibodies, MAb 1128, MAb 1129, and MAb 1130, recognize the viral coat protein (CP) of PVY and distinguish PVYN strains from PVYO and PVYC strains, or detect all PVY strains, respectively. However, the minimal epitopes recognized by these antibodies have not been identified. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: SPOT peptide array was used to map the epitopes in CP recognized by MAb 1128, MAb 1129, and MAb 1130. Then alanine replacement as well as N- and C-terminal deletion analysis of the identified peptide epitopes was done to determine critical amino acids for antibody recognition and the respective minimal epitopes. The epitopes of all antibodies were located within the 30 N-terminal-most residues. The minimal epitope of MAb 1128 was 25 NLNKEK 30. Replacement of 25 N or 27 N with alanine weakened the recognition by MAb 1128, and replacement of 26 L, 29 E, or 30 K nearly precluded recognition. The minimal epitope for MAb 1129 was 16 RPEQGSIQSNP 26 and the most critical residues for recognition were 22 I and 23 Q. The epitope of MAb 1130 was defined by residues 5 IDAGGS 10. Mutation of residue 6 D abrogated and mutation of 9 G strongly reduced recognition of the peptide by MAb 1130. Amino acid sequence alignment demonstrated that these epitopes are relatively conserved among PVY strains. Finally, recombinant CPs were produced to demonstrate that mutations in the variable positions of the epitope regions can affect detection with the MAbs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The epitope data acquired can be compared with data on PVY CP-encoding sequences produced by laboratories worldwide and utilized to monitor how widely the new variants of PVY can be detected with current <b>seed</b> potato <b>certification</b> schemes or during the inspection of imported seed potatoes as conducted with these MAbs...|$|R

By 1972 a zero tolerance was placed on all certified seeds in Montana which led to a dramatic decline in yield loss due to BSMV. Similarly, in 1971 BSMV was eliminated in barley seeds in North Dakota.|$|E

50|$|Even though RT-PCR is {{technically}} {{more difficult to}} perform and more expensive than ELISA, it {{has the ability to}} allow for the detection of low viral loads. RT-PCR is considered to be 102 to 105 fold more sensitive than traditional ELISA. RT-PCR also allows for the detection of several viral targets in the same reaction through the use of several primer combinations. This is called multiplexing. Although multiplexing {{is technically}} more demanding than a traditional simplex reaction it allows for a higher throughput in that a single sample can be tested for several viral strains in a single reaction. Primers used for multiplexing are chosen in such a manner that they result in amplicons of various sizes. This allows for post RT-PCR analysis using gel electrophoresis. Although RT-PCR saves time, allows for multiplexing and is more sensitive than ELISA, the reagents and instrumentation needed are expensive and require a higher level of technical expertise. Also, end product analysis using gel electrophoresis is laborious, relatively more expensive, time consuming and does not lend itself to automation. For these reasons the use of RT-PCR for routine screening is not feasible and has not replaced ELISA. It does, however, provide the industry with the opportunity to screen borderline cases, {{especially in the case of}} <b>seed</b> potato <b>certification.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the past, crops were {{inspected}} visually {{to determine}} whether or not they were disease free. Visual inspection was also used as a basis for <b>seed</b> <b>certification.</b> Determination of viral status through visual inspection is incredibly difficult as the symptoms may be masked or the infection latent. As a result, post season tests and inspections were introduced. These tests involved the cultivation of previously harvested material in greenhouses. The resulting plants were inspected for a more accurate estimate of viral status. Although this method of screening did offer some degree of monitoring of viral presence it was subjective and highly ineffective. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening of crops and seed potatoes replaced visual inspection in the early 1970s. The use of ELISA offered routine diagnostic laboratories a quick, effective and sensitive method of screening for a wide range of potato plant viruses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>certification</b> {{programs}} allow only a {{very small}} level of PLRV in certified seed. In Idaho, for instance, during the second field inspection the allowable amount of PLRV is only 0.05% for G4 seed, 0.01% for G3 and G2 and none at all allowed in nuclear and G1. Very small percentages of PLRV in seed potatoes do not normally pose any risk for the commercial producer. However, even very small percentages of virus can be a problem if green peach aphids appear very early and in abundance. In years that are very favorable for insects, like the 1996 season was, the aphid population can become so large that even a very low percentage of PLRV infected seed could result in sufficient spread to cause a problem, because as the aphid population increases, so does the probability that they will encounter an infected plant. Control of aphids with insecticide application is the only means of managing this problem in production years that are highly favorable for aphids.|$|E

40|$|The {{common scab}} (Actinomyces scabies (Thax.) Güssow) {{characterized}} by the formation of raised, level or depressed corky lesions upon {{the surface of the}} potato tuber, is a well known disease of potatoes. It is also of common knowledge today that potato scab is caused by the organism Actinomyces scabies. The scab organism may be present in the soil or may be introduced into uncontaminated soil by the use of scabby tubers. To-day, this disease occurs in practically every part of the world where the potato is grown. This widespread disease of potato is considered very serious in the United States and Canada, where it produces great losses by reducing both the quality and yield of tubers. Owing to the fact that only traces of scab precludes <b>seed</b> potato <b>certification</b> and that the production of certified seed potatoes is very important in Canada, this problem is of considerable economic importance. The problem of potato scab is one of extreme importance in the Montreal district, and has been studied for four years, with the financial assistance of the Horticulture Department of Quebec and under the direction of Professor J. G. Coulson. Experiments have been carried out at Ile Jesus and in Napierville county. Studies have been made for the purpose of testing the effectiveness of certain chemicals, chiefly mercurial compounds, when applied to the soil,in controlling common scab of potatoes in mineral and muck soils, and to determine the soil factors influencing their effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Maritime pine {{provides}} essential {{ecosystem services}} in the south-western Mediterranean basin, where it covers around 4 million ha. Its scattered distribution over a range of environmental conditions makes it an ideal forest tree species for studies of local adaptation and evolutionary responses to climatic change. Highly multiplexed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays are increasingly used to study genetic variation in living organisms and for practical applications in plant and animal breeding and genetic resource conservation. We developed a 9 k Illumina Infinium SNP array and genotyped maritime pine trees from (i) a three-generation inbred (F 2) pedigree, (ii) the French breeding population and (iii) natural populations from Portugal and the French Atlantic coast. A {{large proportion of the}} exploitable SNPs (2052 / 8410, i. e. 24. 4 %) segregated in the mapping population and could be mapped, providing the densest ever gene-based linkage map for this species. Based on 5016 SNPs, natural and breeding populations from the French gene pool exhibited similar level of genetic diversity. Population genetics and structure analyses based on 3981 SNP markers common to the Portuguese and French gene pools revealed high levels of differentiation, leading to the identification of a set of highly differentiated SNPs {{that could be used for}} <b>seed</b> provenance <b>certification.</b> Finally, we discuss how the validated SNPs could facilitate the identification of ecologically and economically relevant genes in this species, improving our understanding of the demography and selective forces shaping its natural genetic diversity, and providing support for new breeding strategies.

40|$|Dickeya species (formerly Erwinia chrysanthemi) cause {{diseases}} {{on numerous}} crop and ornamental plants world-wide. Dickeya spp. (probably D. dianthicola) were first reported on potato in the Netherlands in the 1970 s and {{have since been}} detected in many other European countries. However, since 2004 – 5 a new pathogen, with the proposed name ‘D. solani’, has been spreading across Europe via trade in seed tubers and is causing increasing economic losses. Although disease symptoms are often indistinguishable {{from those of the}} more established blackleg pathogen Pectobacterium spp., Dickeya spp. can initiate disease from lower inoculum levels, have a greater ability to spread through the plant’s vascular tissue, are considerably more aggressive, and have higher optimal temperatures for disease development (the latter potentially leading to increased disease problems as Europe’s climate warms). However, they also appear to be less hardy than Pectobacterium spp. in soil and other environments outside the plant. Scotland is currently the only country in Europe to enforce zero tolerance for Dickeya spp. in its potato crop in an attempt to keep its seed tuber industry free from disease. However, {{there are a number of}} other ways to control the disease, including <b>seed</b> tuber <b>certification,</b> on-farm methods and the use of diagnostics.
