500|$|The London Quarterly Review {{began with}} the {{observation}} that [...] "When an intelligent man tells us that he has spent eleven of {{the best years of}} his life in any district, we may be pretty <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> something to say about it which will interest even those who generally find travels dull reading". The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable, and free of the usual [...] "personal twaddle" [...] of travel and adventure books. The reviewer also remarks on Bates's subtitle [...] "...of the origin of species", that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully. In the reviewer's opinion, Bates says little about [...] "the Darwinian hypothesis", focusing instead steadily on natural history, while making [...] "very shrewd remarks" [...] about human society and giving [...] "most glowing" [...] descriptions of tropical scenery. The reviewer notes {{that most of the people}} Bates meets [...] "had a tinge of colour" [...] but made the [...] "lonely Englishman" [...] comfortable with their [...] "winning cordiality", and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist, complete with insect-net, hunting-bag, pincushion, and an old pair of spectacles. As for nature, the reviewer considers that [...] "in Brazil man is oppressed, crushed, by the immensity of nature".|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{character}} by the Washington Post, Violette said that [...] "He's {{a guy who has}} a lot of dreams and hopes. But he's not able to make them concrete because I think he's a little bit lazy. He's {{the kind of guy who}} always has bad luck [...] [...] [...] but I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a good heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Use of {{the term}} largely faded out afterwards, and it was largely seen as offensive. In 1981 San Francisco Chronicle {{columnist}} Herb Caen criticized Oakland A's radio announcer Bill King for saying a Bobby Murcer shot was [...] "not a Chinese home run". Caen called the remark [...] "racist" [...] and wrote: [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> heard from militant Oriental groups, all of which hit hard".|$|E
