In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame.|$|E

5|$|Today {{herbs are}} {{typically}} {{thought of as}} culinary plants, but in the traditional cottage garden they {{were considered to be}} any plant with household uses. Herbs were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented herbs would be <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor along with rushes to cover odors.

Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies {{can be found in}} these habitats most of the year. Other preferred habitats include steep slopes and plateaus, and old-growth conifer forests. In Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, urban and suburban areas under olive trees (Olea europaea).|$|E
5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times {{was more interested in}} meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E

Tech quarterback Al Hill scored two touchdowns, and Dan Whelchel (called Walthall) scored a third when he recovered a fumble by Theodore Shaver after crossing the goal line. Although Furman's lineup included future South Carolina Hall-of-Famer Speedy Speer, there was little Speer could do to affect the outcome. Tech's starting lineup was Ulrich (left end), Higgins (left tackle), Whelchel (left guard), Johnson (center), Wright (right guard), Doyle (right tackle), Colcord (right end), Hill (quarterback), Smith (left halfback), Shaver (right halfback), and Harlan (fullback).|$|E

He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, archaeological {{techniques}} such as field walking {{have led to the}} discovery of finds ranging in age from prehistoric flints and Bronze Age axe heads to Roman and late medieval finds. Featuring prominently amongst these finds were Roman artefacts including coins, brooches and a snake bracelet. At the invitation of local historian Jim Balme, Time Team excavated in Warburton in September 2006. They were searching for a Roman fortlet that previous archaeological digs by South Trafford Archaeological Group (STAG) indicated might be present. Though no evidence of a Roman fortlet was found, the discovery of strip lynchets indicates that there was a Romano-British farm in Warburton. The presence of Roman finds was explained as rubbish, mixed in with manure to be <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crops.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 2006, Kyoto Animation, the animators {{of another}} Key game-turned-anime, Air, decided to animate a new {{adaptation}} of Kanon. This version, directed by Tatsuya Ishihara, aired between October 5, 2006 and March 15, 2007 on BS-i, containing 24 episodes. The series was later rebroadcast on TBS. ADV Films announced on September 21, 2007 at the Anime Weekend Atlanta anime convention {{that they have}} officially licensed the second Kanon anime series. ADV had previously posted a trailer for the series in August 2007, but was soon taken offline once the news had been <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet. The first English-dubbed episode was made available via streaming online at Anime News Network between December 23 and December 30, 2007.

There were minor clashes between some groups of protesters and the police; the police then removed some protesters from the area. One group of protesters also observed a one-day hunger strike at Jantar Mantar. All roads leading to India Gate were closed by police and areas where protesters had gathered during the previous week were out of bounds to the public.

40|$|Controlling {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of liquid droplets on surfaces via surface energy patterning {{can be used to}} control material delivery to specified regions via selective liquid/solid wetting. While studies of the equilibrium shape of liquid droplets on heterogenous substrates exist, much less is known about the corresponding wetting kinetics. We make significant progress towards elucidating details of this topic by studying, via large-scale atomistic simulations, liquid nanodroplets <b>spreading</b> <b>on</b> chemically patterned surfaces. A model is presented for lines of polymer liquid (droplets) on substrates consisting of alternating strips of wetting (equilibrium contact angle approximately 0 degrees) and non-wetting (equilibrium contact angle approximately 90 degrees) material. Droplet spreading is compared for different wavelength of the pattern and strength of surface interaction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wetting strips. For small wavelength, droplets partially <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> both <b>the</b> wetting and non-wetting regions of the substrate to attain a finite contact angle less than 90 degrees. In this case, the extent of <b>spreading</b> depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> interaction strength in the wetting regions. A transition is observed such that, for large wavelength, <b>the</b> droplet <b>spreads</b> only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wetting region of the substrate by pulling material from non-wetting regions. In most cases, a precursor film <b>spreads</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wetting portion of the substrate at a rate strongly dependent upon interaction strength.
