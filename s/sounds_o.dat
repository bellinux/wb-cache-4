40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method that}} identifies sounds of non-registered musical instruments (i. e., musical instruments that are not contained in the training data) at a category level. Although {{the problem of how}} to deal with non-registered musical instruments is essential in musical instrument identification, it has not been dealt with in previous studies. Our method solves this problem by distinguishing between registered and non-registered instruments and identifying the category name of the non-registered instruments. When a given sound is registered, its instrument name, e. g. violin, is identified. Even if it is not registered, its category name, e. g. strings, can be identified. The important issue in achieving such identification is to adopt a musical instrument hierarchy reflecting the acoustical similarity. We present a method for acquiring such a hierarchy from a musical instrument sound database. Experimental results show that around 77 % of non-registered instrument <b>sounds,</b> <b>o...</b>|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} paper is to present the {{evolution}} of the Latin stressed vowels i, e, o. u in Medieval French. Special attention is paid to the fate of the labio-velar <b>sounds</b> <b>o,</b> u, which coalesced in Vulgar Latin into a close-mid vowel o. On the other hand, the Latin ü is known to have turned into ü (y) leaving thus a gap in the phonetic system of Medieval French. We think that the close-mid labial o should have immediately changed its pronounciation and transformed into a new u. Notice that according to many phonetic studies, (almost) any phonetic system in the world holds the vowel u. regarded generally as one of the three universal sounds (i, a, u). Beyond that, we propose a slightly modified relative and absolute chronology of phonetic changes suffered by the French stressed vowels, often yielding rising and falling diphthongs...|$|E

40|$|Chapter One {{deals with}} the purpose and {{the scope of the}} study. The purpose is to examine the impact of {{diglossia}} on Palestinian students learning the segmental phonemes of English: How the co-existence of Standard Arabic (SA) and Palestinian Arabic (PA) affect the ability of those learners. ^ Chapter Two centers on the treatment of diglossia in linguistics and sociolinguistics. A well-supported argument is presented in favor of Ferguson 2 ̆ 7 s (1959) paradigm which applies rigorously to the Arabic linguistic situation. ^ Chapter Three reviews various studies on diglossia and its relationship to language learning/teaching. While some studies are found to be productive, others are inadequate in terms of theory and practice. ^ Chapter Four outlines the theoretical framework upon which the study is based. It focuses on transfer, contrastive analysis, inter- language, and error analysis. It is argued that transfer is central in language learning and that error analysis is a more reliable theory. ^ Chapter Five is concerned with the results. Contrary to Dulay and Burt 2 ̆ 7 s (1974, 1975) argument, native language (NL) interference is significant. It comes from both SA, e. g. /z - (2 ̆ 7) j/, /ay - aey/, spelling pronunciation cases, and PA, e. g. /b - b/, /c - s/, consonant cluster cases. NL interference also comes from either SA or PA, e. g. /p - b/, /v - f/, /g - k/. These findings confirm the first hypothesis that pho- nological and phonetic NL (diglossic) interference comes from both Arabic varieties. Taken together SA and PA facilitate the learning of several English sounds. The subjects tend to transfer the SA <b>sounds</b> (<b>o,</b> (2 ̆ 7) j, (theta)), and the PA sounds (ow, c and ey) to English. These findings support the second hypothesis that SA and PA enrich the learner 2 ̆ 7 s phonemic inventory and that diglossic NL is advantageous. ^ Chapter Six proposes that more attention should be paid to: the listening skill, pronunciation in phonetic context, avoiding overusing the repetition technique, and employing a multiple-method strategy in language teaching programs. ...|$|E
