5|$|The Macdonalds {{initially}} {{lived with}} another family, but then resided over a store which Hugh Macdonald ran. Soon after their arrival, John's younger brother James {{died from a}} blow to the head by a servant who was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after the boys. After Hugh's store failed, the family moved to Hay Bay (south of Napanee, Ontario), west of Kingston, where Hugh unsuccessfully ran another shop. His father, in 1829, was appointed a magistrate for the Midland District. John Macdonald's mother was a lifelong influence on her son, helping him in his difficult first marriage and remaining a force in his life until her 1862 death.|$|E
5|$|Eric and Leslie Ludy {{met when}} Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a {{friendship}} {{for several months}} before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but {{to wait for the}} life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool {{in the creation of the}} reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like.|$|E
25|$|Barty Crouch Sr. {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} in the series at the Quidditch World Cup in Goblet of Fire. Crouch accuses Harry, Ron and Hermione of attempting to set off the Dark Mark, and when Winky is found to have Harry's wand, he angrily dismisses Winky, as the house-elf is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after his son, who is always under an Invisibility Cloak. Voldemort and his servant Peter Pettigrew {{show up at the}} Crouch family home and put Crouch Sr. under the Imperius Curse, freeing Crouch Jr from the Imperius Curse placed on him by his father and thus allowing him to rejoin Voldemort. Crouch continues to appear in public at first {{and is one of the}} five judges at the Triwizard Tournament. However, worried that Crouch will fight off the Imperius Curse, Voldemort later keeps him imprisoned within the house and has him communicate exclusively through supervised owl post. Later in the book, Crouch, who has escaped from his home, meets Harry and Viktor Krum in the Forbidden Forest and begs to see Dumbledore. However, Harry, while on his way to inform Dumbledore of the events, unwittingly alerts Crouch Jr, in the disguise of Mad-Eye Moody, to his father's presence. Crouch Jr immediately goes to the Forest, kills his own father, transfigures the body into a bone, and buries it on the Hogwarts grounds.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{contained}} several {{scenes that}} were reminiscent of past episodes of the series. The shot in which Jim and Dwight survey {{the office was}} filmed {{to be similar to}} a scene that featured Dwight and Michael in the third season installment [...] "Gay Witch Hunt". In addition, Dwight pulling Angela over was filmed in a way that recalled the sixth season episode [...] "The Delivery". Although the scene wherein Jim gives advice to Dwight was shot in a similar manner to Jim's farewell to Michael in the seventh season episode [...] "Goodbye, Michael", it was not intentionally <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like it, according to Rogers. In addition, the obstacle course was not a direct reference to the second season episode [...] "Office Olympics", although Rogers understood that there were similarities.|$|E
500|$|Alfredson has {{described}} the casting process as {{the most difficult part}} of making the film. He had particular concerns about the interaction between the two leads, and the fact that those who had read the book would have a preconceived notion of how the characters were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look.</b> He wanted the actors to look innocent, and be able to interact in front of the camera. They were supposed to be [...] "mirror images of each other. She is everything he isn't. Dark, strong, brave, and a girl. (...) Like two sides of the same coin." [...] On another occasion, Alfredson stated that [...] "asting is 70 percent of the job; it's not about picking the right people to make the roles. It is about creating chords, how a B and A minor interact together, and are played together." [...] In the end, Alfredson expressed satisfaction with the result, and has frequently lauded Hedebrant and Leandersson for being [...] "extremely intelligent", [...] "incredibly wise", and [...] "unprecedentedly fantastic." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, {{for the first time in}} my life, I couldn’t dance strong. I was too busy trying to hide my breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part of who I am as a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E

He used the metaphor of basket-weaving to describe this concept: you learn from your teacher, and from books, basically how a basket is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> and then you use trial-and-error to produce a basket that {{is in line with}} what you have been taught about how baskets should be. These teachings from Ajaan Lee correspond to the factors of the first jhana known as directed-thought (Pali: [...] "vitakka"), and evaluation (Pali: [...] "vicara").|$|E

While attending the international business conference at Philippines, Aziz maintained that: [...] "This global institution (IMF) which is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at everything going on was not even in the room where meetings are going on". In 2008, Aziz gave vehement criticism to IMF and according to him, the [...] "IMF has played a very negative role" [...] in global crises.|$|E
2500|$|A {{concern with}} {{language}} {{was central to}} Kraus's outlook, and he viewed his contemporaries' careless use of language as symptomatic of their careless treatment of the world. Viennese composer Ernst Krenek described meeting the writer in 1932: [...] "At {{a time when people}} were generally decrying the Japanese bombardment of Shanghai, I met Karl Kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems. He said something like: 'I know that everything is futile when the house is burning. But I have to do this, {{as long as it is}} at all possible; for if those who were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after commas had always made sure they were in the right place, Shanghai would not be burning'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Seedman's {{personal}} style made him stand out. He complemented his cigar with white-on-white patterned shirts with [...] "Al" [...] monogrammed on the sleeves, elaborate rings on both hands including an onyx pinky ring, and a pearl-handled revolver as his weapon. [...] " [...] what a Jewish gangster is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like," [...] one fellow detective told The New York Times. [...] "I didn't {{do any of}} this stuff consciously, but it was my style," [...] Seedman explained late in his life. [...] "I've been referred to as the last of the old-time Broadway-style detectives." [...] "He's got style; he's the way cops like to see themselves," [...] another officer said to the Times in 1972.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1992, Diamond got a brand new gimmick in [...] "Maximillian Moon" [...] ("Max Moon" [...] for short). Diamond wasn’t {{originally}} intended to play Max Moon. The gimmick was created for Konnan, but Konnan left the WWF after a backstage disagreement. Since Diamond fit the costume, he was chosen {{to take over the}} character. The suit was a very elaborate powder blue bodysuit with markings that were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like a circuit board and white protruding rings around his arms making him look rather [...] "outlandish". The elaborate outfit also came with two wrist devices that shot out fireworks and a jet pack that was supposed to make Max Moon look like a man of the future.|$|E
2500|$|... 10-for-200: Also {{known as}} Bidding A Flight or Wheels. Bidding 10-for-200 commits a side {{to win at}} least 10 tricks; if successful, the team scores 200 points. If the side wins fewer than 10 tricks, they lose 200 points. Some play a lost bid only loses 100, not 200. In some variations, to make a 10-for-200 bid, the side must win exactly 10 tricks. If a team pulls more than 10 the extra tricks are still bags or [...] "ob's" [...] Some play that any bid of 10 is {{automatically}} a 10-for-200 bid. In some places the 10-for-200 bid is called 10-for-2, which is written on the score sheet as 10-4-2. Another way of writing the 200 score is with the two zeros linked together at the top; this is called Wheels, as the zeroes are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like train wheels. Making this bid is also significant in that the other team is automatically set if Nils are not allowed, since they would not even make Board, thus the winning team will be ahead by at least 240 points (200 for the score + 40 point penalty of the other team).|$|E

But it is done to their hand. Two ladies, Mrs. Latouche of Dublin, and her niece, Miss Boyle, came to spend a day or two. The aunt is a fine old lady; the conversation that of a serious person frightened out of her wits by the violence and superstition of our workers of miracles in the west.[401] Miss Boyle is a pretty young woman, rather quiet for an Irish lass.|$|R

Murray informed the observers that these servants are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be <b>looking</b> anxiously for their master's return, Jacques having suddenly disappeared, after lending much money to the king, who took that mediæval way of paying his debts.|$|R
2500|$|Regarding {{elements}} of game design, {{areas such as}} gameplay, mechanics, and similar features {{have been described as}} gender neutral, however presentational aspects of games have been identified as strongly gender-linked. Specifically, gaming is often seen as fantasy and escapism in which empathy and identification with the character is much more easily achieved if the character shares the same gender as the player. Gamers of both genders tend to crave realism and the more realistic the gender of the character, the easier it is for a player to identify with the character. A 2009 academic study published in New Media & Society, however, found that 85% of playable characters in video games are male. Erin Hamilton argues that part of the problem comes from the difficulty in [...] "juxtaposing femininity and feminism in a good video game." [...] When female characters do appear in video games, they are often regarded as presenting unhealthy messages concerning unrealistic body images and provocative sexual and violent behaviors for players of both genders. Stereotypical female behaviors such as giggling or sighing are often presented non-ironically, and this leads young children (especially girls who identify with the female character) to think that this is how girls are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> and act. Furthermore, over-sexualized depictions of scantily clad female video game characters such as Tomb Raiders Lara Croft are not appealing to some girls.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Doesn't Really Matter", Jackson {{speaks of}} looking past {{physical}} appearance, choosing {{to love the}} person inside. Using a vocal falsetto, Jackson assures [...] " [...] doesn’t really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm {{in love with the}} inner being," [...] considered a [...] "sweet song of unconditional love." [...] Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said [...] "It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like – all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, {{is the most important thing}} as well as being happy with who you are." [...] The song is based on Jackson's character Denise's [...] "unconditional love" [...] for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, [...] "I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that – how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him. [...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside." [...] Jimmy Jam added, [...] "It lyrically goes with her character in the movie. The song is about 'it's what's inside that counts.' You think it's funny when you hear that Janet and Klump have a relationship, but they make it believable." ...|$|E
