5|$|The Divas {{rivalry between}} Mickie James and Trish <b>Stratus</b> over the WWE Women's Championship {{continued}} entering the event. <b>Stratus</b> and James first fought over the title at New Year's Revolution, with <b>Stratus</b> retaining. In {{the months that}} followed, James' obsession with <b>Stratus</b> grew {{to the point that}} she confessed to <b>Stratus</b> that {{she was in love with}} her; making <b>Stratus</b> uncomfortable. James made one final attempt to kiss <b>Stratus</b> at Saturday Night's Main Event on March 18, after the duo defeated Candice Michelle and Victoria. After she was rebuffed, James attacked <b>Stratus</b> and later vowed to destroy her, turning James into a villainess. At WrestleMania 22, the evil James defeated <b>Stratus</b> to capture the Women's Championship for the first time in her career. In the following weeks, James continued her mind games by dressing like <b>Stratus</b> and claiming to be her. <b>Stratus</b> eventually confronted James by dressing like her and mocking her personality. It was later announced that a Women's Championship rematch between James and <b>Stratus</b> would take place at Backlash.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Trish <b>Stratus</b> and Lita for the WWE Women's Championship. Lita was disqualified for hitting <b>Stratus</b> with a chair, meaning <b>Stratus</b> {{retained}} the title.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} a tag team match {{featuring}} {{the team of}} Trish <b>Stratus</b> and Ashley against the team of Victoria and Torrie Wilson (with Candice Michelle as Victoria and Wilson's manager). The match started off with Wilson and <b>Stratus</b> in the ring. Wilson tagged in Victoria, who applied a full-body choke on <b>Stratus,</b> but <b>Stratus</b> started to work on Victoria's arm. Victoria countered Stratus' arm takedown. <b>Stratus</b> then performed a Headscissors Takedown. Back and forth action continued; the match, however, {{came to an end}} when <b>Stratus</b> was able to perform a roundhouse kick on Victoria, giving the victory to <b>Stratus</b> and Ashley.|$|E
5|$|Another feud {{heading into}} the event was between Chris Jericho and Christian and Trish <b>Stratus.</b> At WrestleMania XX, Christian {{defeated}} Jericho. After the match, <b>Stratus,</b> Jericho's on-screen girlfriend at the time, turned on Jericho and joined Christian. On April 5, Christian {{announced that he would}} be teaming up with <b>Stratus</b> to take on Jericho in a Handicap match at Backlash.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, <b>Stratus</b> was sidelined {{with the}} Women's Championship after {{suffering}} a herniated disc, with the storyline explanation that Viscera had injured her at Backlash after she insulted him for losing to Kane. This left the company without a Women's Champion for four months, as <b>Stratus</b> remained the champion {{during the time of}} her injury, thus ignoring the 30 day clause stating that a champion must defend their respective title at least once every 30 days. She returned to Raw on September 12, 2005 as a face by siding with Ashley Massaro against Vince's Devils (Candice Michelle, Victoria and Torrie Wilson). The feud also involved the debuting Mickie James, who introduced herself as Stratus' biggest fan. In November, during the Eddie Guerrero Tribute Show, <b>Stratus</b> took part in an inter-promotional Divas battle royal that was won by SmackDown! Diva Melina. The next week, MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) kidnapped <b>Stratus</b> for Melina, who challenged a tied up and gagged <b>Stratus</b> to a match for the Women's Championship. The two fought at Survivor Series, with <b>Stratus</b> defeating Melina. <b>Stratus</b> and Mickie James continued teaming together in late 2005, while James became increasingly obsessed with <b>Stratus.</b> On the December 26 episode of Raw, the storyline between <b>Stratus</b> and James developed into a lesbian one, when James initiated an intimate kiss with <b>Stratus</b> under a sprig of mistletoe, causing a surprised <b>Stratus</b> to flee the locker room.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, Trish <b>Stratus</b> (accompanied by Mickie James) defended her WWE Women's Championship against Melina (accompanied by WWE Tag Team Champions Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro. <b>Stratus</b> immediately took control until Melina fought back. When Nitro and Mercury interfered, the referee ejected them from ringside. Melina kept control until <b>Stratus</b> fought back with forearm shots. <b>Stratus</b> pinned Melina after a diving bulldog {{to retain the}} title.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} months, <b>Stratus</b> was placed into {{an alliance with}} Gail Kim. It was short-lived, however, as Kim turned on <b>Stratus</b> and teamed with Molly Holly, putting the women in a storyline feud. The duo defeated <b>Stratus</b> and several tag team partners until <b>Stratus</b> allied herself with a returning Lita. The team defeated Kim and Holly in several matches, including a match at Unforgiven.|$|E
5|$|James and <b>Stratus</b> teamed {{together}} at the March 18, 2006 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event to defeat Candice Michelle and Victoria. After the match, James agreed to honor Stratus' wishes and attempted to kiss her. After <b>Stratus</b> pushed her away, James attacked <b>Stratus</b> and vowed to destroy her, becoming a villain in the process {{for the first time}} in her WWE career. The feud between James and <b>Stratus</b> culminated in a Women's Championship match at WrestleMania 22, which James won, to earn her first Women's Championship. Her angle with <b>Stratus</b> continued into Backlash during a rematch, after <b>Stratus</b> legitimately dislocated her shoulder when James threw her out of the ring. The feud would come to an end on the June 26 episode of Raw, when James defeated <b>Stratus</b> in a Women's Championship match.|$|E
5|$|James, {{under her}} real name, debuted in WWE on the October 10, 2005 episode of Raw as a face, under the gimmick of WWE Women's Champion Trish Stratus' biggest fan. The angle had the two Divas {{competing}} together in tag team matches, with James' character becoming increasingly obsessed with <b>Stratus.</b> The storyline included a Halloween costume contest, in which James was dressed like <b>Stratus</b> and helped <b>Stratus</b> retain the Women's Championship in a Fulfill Your Fantasy battle royal at Taboo Tuesday by eliminating herself and Victoria {{at the same}} time. James even began utilizing Stratus' signature finishing moves as her own during matches. James later became the number one contender for the WWE Women's Championship on December 12, by defeating Victoria in a match to determine who would face <b>Stratus</b> at New Year's Revolution. Subsequently, the storyline between James and <b>Stratus</b> developed into a lesbian angle, after James kissed <b>Stratus</b> under a sprig of mistletoe. In the championship match at the pay-per-view, James lost to <b>Stratus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lita {{returned}} to WWE television in March 2005, mentoring Christy Hemme, {{who was in}} the midst of a storyline with <b>Stratus</b> that featured a title match between them at WrestleMania 21. Despite Lita's coaching, Hemme was defeated by <b>Stratus.</b> Lita continued to feud with <b>Stratus</b> by proxy over the following weeks, with Kane defeating Stratus' companion, Viscera, at Backlash on May 1.|$|E
5|$|On the March 14, 2011 {{episode of}} Raw, LayCool helped Vickie Guerrero defeat Trish <b>Stratus</b> in a no {{disqualification}} match, {{to get a}} job on Raw. After the match, LayCool were attacked by <b>Stratus</b> and special guest star Snooki. On the following episode of Raw, LayCool teamed up with Dolph Ziggler and Vickie Guerrero, defeating <b>Stratus</b> and John Morrison in a 3-on-2 handicap mixed tag team match. At WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, LayCool and Ziggler lost to Snooki, <b>Stratus,</b> and Morrison in a six-person mixed tag team match after Snooki pinned McCool.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stratus</b> {{returned}} to the ring on June 26, where she had a Women's Championship match with Mickie James. <b>Stratus</b> {{would go on to}} lose the match, thus finally ending their nine-month long storyline. On the same night, she started a romantic angle with Carlito after he saved her from a double team attack by Melina and Johnny Nitro. They competed as a team, and won a mixed tag team match against Melina and Nitro at Saturday Night's Main Event on July 15. As a couple, <b>Stratus</b> and Carlito briefly feuded with WWE Champion Edge and Lita (who turned heel) after the pair interrupted Stratus' title match with Mickie James. The two couples competed in several tag team matches, including a six-person tag team match where Edge, Lita and Randy Orton defeated <b>Stratus,</b> Carlito and John Cena after Orton RKO'd <b>Stratus</b> and Lita followed up with the pin. Stratus' last match on Raw occurred on September 11, 2006 where she defeated former rival Mickie James. In late August, Lita stated that <b>Stratus</b> would retire following the Unforgiven pay-per-view, which was later confirmed by <b>Stratus.</b> At Unforgiven on September 17, in her hometown of Toronto, <b>Stratus</b> won against Lita with fellow Canadian Bret Hart's signature submission maneuver, the Sharpshooter. Her victory earned her a seventh Women's Championship, the most in WWE history, and she retired as the champion.|$|E
5|$|Stratus' second {{reign as}} {{champion}} {{came to an}} end on June 23, when she was defeated at King of the Ring by Molly Holly. The two Divas continued their storyline feud for the next three months. After a failed attempt to win the title in July, <b>Stratus</b> won the championship back at Unforgiven. While feuding with Holly, <b>Stratus</b> was also involved in an angle with new Diva Victoria, who held a storyline grudge against <b>Stratus,</b> claiming she was betrayed by <b>Stratus</b> when they both worked as fitness models. The two competed in several title matches, with <b>Stratus</b> retaining until Survivor Series, where Victoria won the title in a Hardcore match. On March 17, 2003, Victoria and Steven Richards defeated Jazz and <b>Stratus</b> in a tag team match when Jazz walked out on <b>Stratus.</b> After the match, Jeff Hardy saved <b>Stratus</b> from an attack by Victoria and Richards and then kissed her, resulting in <b>Stratus</b> becoming Hardy's on-screen girlfriend once more. The two would talk and kiss backstage, compete as an intergender tag team, and come to each other's aid when in danger during singles competition. At no point was their previous relationship acknowledged. The storyline was suddenly dropped when WWE released Hardy in April. This marked the second time in two years that a romance between <b>Stratus</b> and Hardy was abruptly scrapped due to a setback in one of their personal lives. In neither instance did the angle fully play out or reach a conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{disputes between}} the McMahons led to Linda McMahon {{being in a}} comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of being asked for a divorce by Vince, who {{took the opportunity to}} have a public affair with Trish <b>Stratus.</b> McMahon briefly feuded with <b>Stratus,</b> defeating her at No Way Out. Over the next few weeks, Vince {{made it clear that he}} favored McMahon over <b>Stratus,</b> allowing McMahon to bully and verbally abuse <b>Stratus.</b> At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight. During the match, <b>Stratus</b> slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently upset with Vince's constant misogynistic treatment of her.|$|E
5|$|The {{match that}} {{followed}} was a Fatal 4-Way Match for the WWE Women's Championship, with Victoria defending the title against Trish <b>Stratus,</b> Lita, and Gail Kim. The {{start of the}} match saw Victoria and Lita double team <b>Stratus,</b> however, <b>Stratus</b> avoided the assault, as she rolled out of the ring. Lita and Victoria went on to double team Kim, however, <b>Stratus</b> pulled Lita out of the ring, afterward Victoria performed a moonsault and landed on Kim's torso. Lita then drove Kim's head into the mat. <b>Stratus</b> {{then went on to}} use a roll up on Lita to gain a pinfall victory, becoming Women's champion for a fifth time.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the {{encounter}} of Victoria and Trish <b>Stratus</b> (with Tyson Tomko) for the WWE Women's Championship. Victoria gained control over <b>Stratus</b> early into the match, however, <b>Stratus</b> gained control after Tomko interfered on her behalf. After <b>Stratus</b> gained the advantage, she performed a Stratusfaction on Victoria {{and got a}} successful pinfall, thus <b>Stratus</b> retained the Women's Championship. After the match, Tomko tried to attack Victoria, until she was saved by an unknown man in a dress. Tomko then challenged the mystery superstar into a match.|$|E
5|$|The odd {{relationship}} between <b>Stratus</b> and James continued into 2006, {{with the two}} Divas competing {{against each other in}} a title match at New Year's Revolution, where <b>Stratus</b> emerged victorious. Despite the defeat, James continued to be enamored of <b>Stratus</b> which made her feel uncomfortable, and on March 6, <b>Stratus</b> confronted James, telling her that she needed space. The duo briefly reconciled on the March 18 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, teaming together to defeat Candice Michelle and Victoria; however, after the match, James turned on <b>Stratus</b> and attacked her. A match at WrestleMania 22 saw <b>Stratus</b> lose the Women's Championship to James, ending her 448-day reign. The match, at the time, was widely {{recognized as one of the}} best women's matches in the company. During a rematch at Backlash, <b>Stratus</b> suffered a legitimate dislocated shoulder after taking a bump to the outside of the ring. While she was rehabilitating for six weeks, she continued to appear on-screen.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Mickie James and Trish <b>Stratus</b> for the WWE Women's Championship. The match had {{escalated}} outside the ring. When <b>Stratus</b> delivered punches to Mickie, {{who was on}} the second turnbuckle, Mickie threw her over the top rope, causing <b>Stratus</b> to land on her right arm. Afterwards, Mickie choked <b>Stratus</b> with a wristband she was wearing that fell off during the match, therefore giving the win to <b>Stratus</b> by disqualification, but per WWE regulations, a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission therefore Mickie retained the Championship.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2003, Jericho and Christian began romances with WWE Divas Trish <b>Stratus</b> and Lita, respectively. As {{part of the}} angle, it was {{revealed}} to be a bet over who could sleep with their respective female first, with a Canadian dollar at stake. Despite the bet, Jericho continued his relationship with <b>Stratus,</b> which ultimately resulted in Christian and Jericho turning on each other. At Royal Rumble, Christian competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Jericho, At the WrestleMania XX pay-per-view event on March 14, 2004, Christian faced Jericho in a singles match with <b>Stratus</b> on Jericho's side. <b>Stratus,</b> however, accidentally struck Jericho, allowing Christian to defeat him. <b>Stratus</b> then joined forces with Christian, becoming his on-screen girlfriend in the process. At Backlash, Christian and <b>Stratus</b> faced Chris Jericho in an Intergender handicap match which Jericho won, During a steel cage match against Jericho on the May 10, 2004. episode of Raw, Christian suffered a severe back injury, causing him to miss almost four months of in-ring action. He returned on the August 30 episode of Raw, resuming his feud with Jericho ending in a ladder match for the vacant Intercontinental Championship at Unforgiven.|$|E
5|$|At WrestleMania XIX, <b>Stratus</b> ended her {{feud with}} Victoria by {{defeating}} her and Jazz to capture her fourth Women's Championship, only {{to lose the}} title to Jazz at the following pay-per-view, Backlash. The Raw after Backlash, Eric Bischoff ordered a No Disqualification match between him and <b>Stratus.</b> If <b>Stratus</b> won, she would get a championship rematch the next week; if Bischoff won, he would get to spend a night with her. Bischoff {{would go on to}} win the match, though the stipulation was nulified when Linda McMahon confronted him after the match.|$|E
5|$|Her first {{televised}} WWE {{match was}} a seven-woman battle royal on the June 30, 2003 episode of Raw with the WWE Women's Championship, then held by an injured Jazz, on the line. Kim won the match by lastly eliminating Victoria. Kim held the title for four weeks, successfully defending it once against Molly Holly, before losing it to Holly on the July 28 episode of Raw. The following week, Kim turned heel on Trish <b>Stratus,</b> which {{stemmed from a}} previous Raw episode where <b>Stratus</b> cost Kim and herself a tag match against Victoria and Holly; Kim subsequently formed an alliance with Holly to take on <b>Stratus,</b> defeating her and various partners on several occasions, until <b>Stratus</b> was later assisted by Lita. At WWE's Unforgiven pay-per-view event on September 21, <b>Stratus</b> and Lita defeated Kim and Holly in a tag team match. The four women continued to feud until November, when Kim was sidelined with a broken right collarbone.|$|E
5|$|In July 2001, Lita and Trish <b>Stratus</b> {{joined forces}} to combat Stacy Keibler and Torrie Wilson, members of The Alliance: Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling wrestlers who were invading the WWF as part of The Invasion storyline. At the Invasion {{pay-per-view}} on July 22, Lita and <b>Stratus</b> defeated Keibler and Wilson in the first ever tag team bra and panties match by stripping their opponents to their underwear. Throughout The Invasion, Lita, <b>Stratus,</b> and Jacqueline feuded with Alliance members Keibler, Wilson, Ivory, and Mighty Molly. The Invasion storyline ended on November 18 at Survivor Series, where Lita {{took part in a}} six-pack challenge for the WWF Women's Championship, which had been vacated by Chyna earlier that month; <b>Stratus</b> won the match and the title.|$|E
5|$|Kim {{returned}} to Raw in April 2004 and immediately reforged her alliance with Holly. In May 2004, Kim submitted then-Women's Champion Victoria twice, in singles match and a six-woman tag match, earning herself a title shot at Bad Blood. However, Lita pinned Kim on the June 7 episode of Raw, and Lita and Trish <b>Stratus</b> {{were added to}} the championship match. At Bad Blood on June 13, she faced Lita, <b>Stratus,</b> and Victoria in a Fatal Four-Way match for the WWE Women's Championship, which was won by <b>Stratus.</b>|$|E
5|$|She {{took over}} the 2004 Raw Diva Search for a few weeks, which led to several tag matches against the heel gimmicks of Gail Kim, Trish <b>Stratus,</b> and Molly Holly and with {{partners}} Nidia and the face gimmick of Victoria. Keibler got upset victories over Kim, <b>Stratus,</b> and Holly. She earned a Women's Championship title match on October 11, 2004, but she was defeated by <b>Stratus,</b> who retained the title.

5|$|<b>Stratus</b> {{made her}} in-ring debut at the June 22 taping of SmackDown!, winning a tag team match with T & A against the Hardy Boyz and Lita. A storyline feud between <b>Stratus</b> and Lita {{developed}} after the match with <b>Stratus</b> attacking Lita on episodes of Raw and SmackDown!.

While chasing after the Women's Championship, <b>Stratus</b> won the WWE Hardcore Championship on May 6, pinning Crash Holly after Bubba Ray Dudley hit him over the head with a trash can. She lost the title to Steven Richards soon afterward however, due to the stipulation that the belt was to be defended 24/7 as long as there was a referee present.

5|$|Molly {{earned her}} second Women's Championship by {{defeating}} Gail Kim on Raw on July 28, 2003. Kim later turned villainous and joined Molly in her feud with <b>Stratus.</b> During {{an attack on}} <b>Stratus,</b> Lita made her return, helping Trish fend off her attackers.

5|$|On the January 28, 2013, {{episode of}} Raw, <b>Stratus</b> was {{announced}} as a WWE Hall of Fame inductee {{as part of}} the 2013 class, which made her, at the time, the youngest person to ever be inducted. <b>Stratus</b> chose Stephanie McMahon to induct her into the Hall of Fame in April. That record has been broken by Beth Phoenix, who has been inducted in 2017 at age 36.|$|E
5|$|She was {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 5, 2014, by Trish <b>Stratus.</b>|$|E
