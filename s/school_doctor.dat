500|$|Though not {{appearing}} as depicted, {{the species is}} a real-world hookworm that infects {{a large number of}} Earth's population, which as said in the episode, has been used by some as an alternative treatment for asthma and other allergies. Popular Mechanics published an article assessing the episode's science; they concluded that the worms depicted in [...] "Snakehead" [...] -- [...] "hybrid parasites, a new species bio-engineered from an intestinal hookworm"—cannot grow as quickly nor as large in real life, though it is possible for hosts to die from [...] "parasitic asphyxiation".

60|$|The first intimation Grey {{received}} of {{this came}} to him late in the evening. He had been reading a novel which, whatever its other merits may have been, was not interesting, and it had sent him to sleep. He awoke to hear a well-known voice observe with some unction: 'Ah! M'yes. Leeches and hot fomentations.' This effectually banished sleep. If there were two {{things in the world}} that he loathed, they were leeches and hot fomentations, and the <b>School</b> <b>doctor</b> apparently regarded them as a panacea for every kind of bodily ailment, from a fractured skull to a cold in the head. It was this gentleman who had just spoken, but Grey's alarm vanished as he perceived that the words had no personal application to himself. The object of the remark was a fellow-sufferer in the next bed but one. Now Grey was certain that when he had fallen asleep there had been nobody in that bed. When, therefore, the medical expert had departed on his fell errand, the quest of leeches and hot fomentations, he sat up and gave tongue.|$|E

60|$|Before {{the end of}} the quarter, {{two things}} {{occurred}} which made almost as serious a difference to Ernest's and Edie's lives as the dismissal from Pilbury Regis Grammar School. It was about a week or ten days after Herr Max's unfortunate visit that Ernest awoke one morning with a very curious and unpleasant taste in his mouth, accompanied by a violent fit of coughing. He knew what the taste was well enough; and he mentioned the matter casually to Edie a little later in the morning. Edie was naturally frightened at the symptoms, and made him go to see the <b>school</b> <b>doctor.</b> The doctor felt his pulse attentively, listened with his stethoscope at the chest, punched and pummelled the patient all over in the most orthodox fashion, and asked the usual inquisitorial personal questions about all the other members of his family. When he heard about Ronald's predisposition, he shook his head seriously, and feared there was really something in it. Increased vocal resonance {{at the top of the}} left lung, he must admit. Some tendency to tubercular deposit there, and perhaps even a slight deep-seated cavity. Ernest must take care of himself for the present, and keep himself as free as possible from all kind of worry or anxiety.|$|E
6000|$|A second {{important}} centripetal consideration {{at present}} is {{the desirability of}} access to good schools and to the doctor. To leave the great centres is either to abandon one's children, or to buy air for them {{at the cost of}} educational disadvantages. But access, be it noted, is another word for transit. It is doubtful if these two needs will so much keep people close to the great city centres as draw them together about secondary centres. New centres they may be--compare Hindhead, for example--in many cases; but also, it may be, in many cases the more healthy and picturesque of the existing small towns will develop a new life. Already, {{in the case of the}} London area, such once practically autonomous places as Guildford, Tunbridge Wells, and Godalming have become economically the centres of lax suburbs, and the same fate may very probably overtake, for example, Shrewsbury, Stratford, and Exeter, and remoter and yet remoter townships. Indeed, for all that this particular centripetal force can do, the confluent [...] "residential suburbs" [...] of London, of the great Lancashire-Yorkshire city, and of the Scotch city, may quite conceivably replace the summer lodging-house watering-places of to-day, and extend themselves right round the coast of Great Britain, before the end of the next century, and every open space of mountain and heather be dotted--not too thickly--with clumps of prosperous houses about <b>school,</b> <b>doctor,</b> engineers, book and provision shops.|$|E
