25|$|The {{edge of the}} bit has a {{sharpened}} spur to cut {{the fibers}} of the wood, as in the lip and <b>spur</b> <b>drill</b> bit. A radial cutting edge planes the wood {{from the base of}} the hole. In this version, there is minimal or no spiral to remove chips from the hole. The bit must be periodically withdrawn to clear the chips.|$|E
25|$|Husky's {{move into}} the area <b>spurred</b> <b>drilling</b> and production. Within two years of Husky's arrival, there were oversupplies of heavy oil and {{shortages}} of storage space. Producers solved the problem by storing the oil in earthen pits holding up to 16,000 cubic metres each. For a while Husky bought the oil by weight rather than volume since it was clogged with earth, tumbleweed and jackrabbits. The company had to strain and remeasure the stuff before it could begin refining.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Drilling is an {{important}} and final operation in the assembly of structural components of aircraft and automobiles. This paper determines the influence of cutting forces in the drilling of GF/PC composites. An assembly, {{the quality of the}} drilled holes highly affects the joint of two or more structural components. Drilling of glass fiber composite materials is a vital task for manufacturers. The best methodology for achieving good quality holes during the drilling of glass fiber reinforced plastics is by identify of the cutting forces. Improper cutting forces lead to the damage of composite materials. This paper studies the influence of various feed rate on thrust force, spindle speed and drill bit geometry using Brad and <b>spur</b> <b>drills.</b> This experimental result shows that delamination fully depends on the feed rate. The experimental results have been clearly explained with the help of 3 D response graph and Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) images...|$|R
50|$|At just 24 {{years of}} age, Easley joined the Oklahoma House of Representatives in January 1985 as its {{youngest}} member. As a House member that year, he authored a law requiring drivers and passengers in moving motor vehicles to wear seatbelts. In 1990, Easley won {{a seat in}} the Oklahoma Senate, and as a Senator, turned his attention to bettering the state’s economy and environment. A joint resolution he authored in 1991 created a new state commission to study how to boost natural gas prices, and, in 1992, he authored a law recommended by the commission that required operators of hundreds of the state’s largest natural gas wells to cut production during the warmest months of the year in an effort to boost prices for the commodity to <b>spur</b> more <b>drilling</b> activity within the state.|$|R
25|$|Conventional {{twist drill}} bits tend to wander when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting drill bit. In wood, the lip and <b>spur</b> <b>drill</b> bit is another solution: The {{centre of the}} drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist drill bit, but a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the drill bit in line.|$|E
25|$|In metal, the lip and <b>spur</b> <b>drill</b> bit is {{confined}} to drilling only the thinnest and softest sheet metals in a drill press. The bits have an extremely fast cutting tool geometry: no point angle and a large (considering the flat cutting edge) lip angle causes the edges {{to take a very}} aggressive cut with relatively little point pressure. This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they have a tendency to punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind.|$|E
25|$|Metals are {{typically}} isotropic, and an ordinary twist drill bit shears {{the edges of}} the hole cleanly. Wood drilled across the grain has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend {{to pull out of the}} wood hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. The lip and <b>spur</b> <b>drill</b> bit has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.|$|E
40|$|Further {{report on}} the {{stability}} of a proposed subdivision near Lilydale. W. R. Moore In a previous report, this area was classified as a potential lands lip zone {{on the basis of}} the thickness, irregularity and distrib-ution of Quaternary talus gravel. This gravel was tilted when a land-slide occurred in the underlying Triassic sediments, forming two benches on the top of a <b>spur.</b> Diamond <b>drilling</b> was undertaken in an attempt to locate a possible shear zone within the Triassic sediments; this was located at a depth of 9. 3 m. Water table measurements in this hole indicated that water could rise to within the gravel. Fur-ther shear testing on clay from a nearby auger hole confirms that movement is a possibility when the watertable is above the slip plane. With this possibility, the area remains a potential lands lip zone in which one house site is possible, provided certain recommended con-ditions are accepted to reduce the risk. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{oil and gas}} {{extraction}} technique called hydraulic fracturing (also called fracing, fracking, or hydrofracking) has swept the country and has raised the stakes of the energy policy debate. As operators drill thousands of new wells and inject water and chemicals down these wells in order to fracture underground shale and tight sandstone formations, concerned citizens’ groups and the media have pointed to flaming tap water and have worried about chemical contamination; at the same time, industry representatives and many state regulators have sworn that the practice has never contaminated groundwater. The outpouring of attention to injection—just one stage of a complex well development process—threatens to distract from the core issues of “tight” oil and gas development and to leave the most pressing concerns unaddressed. Through a comparison of regulation and alleged violations of environmental and oil and gas laws at hydraulically fractured well sites, this Article illuminates the factors that must inform policy and regulatory changes that guide modern oil and gas development. The examples of violations so far suggest that the most pressing risks may predominantly arise not from the injection of chemicals and water but from other stages of the well development process introduced by fracturing and from the higher rate of well <b>drilling</b> <b>spurred</b> by fracturing. This does not suggest that fracturing itself poses no risks. Rather, we must recognize the new risks introduced by several non-injection stages essential to the fracturing process, {{as well as by}} the drilling enabled by fracturing, and shift our attention to the most problematic stages. Chemicals may spill when transported to well sites, and new types of wastes must be stored and disposed of. Furthermore, methane may contaminate underground water sources during the drilling process preceding fracturing. If policymakers and regulators allow drilling and fracturing to continue at their current frenzied pace, it is imperative that they change course to recognize and respond to these core risks. The analysis in this Article offers an initial path forward...|$|R
40|$|Strontium {{concentrations}} and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr {{values were}} measured on pore-water and sedimentary carbonate samples from sediments recovered at Sites 1049 - 1053 on the Blake <b>Spur</b> during Ocean <b>Drilling</b> Program Leg 171 B. These sites form a 40 -km-long depth transect extending along {{the crest of}} the Blake Spur from near the upper edge of the Blake Escarpment (a steep cliff composed of Mesozoic carbonates) westward toward the interior of the Blake-Bahama Platform. Although these sites were selected for paleoceanographic purposes, they also form a hydrologic transect across the upper eastern flank of the Blake-Bahama Platform. Here, we use pore-water strontium concentrations and isotopes as a proxy to define patterns of fluid movement through the flanks of this platform. Pore-water strontium concentration increases with depth at all sites implying that strontium has been added during sediment burial and diagenesis. The isotopic values decrease from seawater-like values in the shallow samples (~ 0. 70913) to values as low as 0. 707342 in one of the deepest samples (~ 625 meters below seafloor). The change in pore-water strontium isotopic values is independent of the strontium isotopic compositions predicted from the host sediment age and measured on bulk carbonate in some samples. In most cases the difference between predicted sediment strontium isotopic composition and measured value is less than ± 2 about the mean of the measured strontium value. Both the increase in concentration and the decrease in the strontium isotope values with increasing depth indicate that strontium was expelled from older carbonates. The strontium concentration and isotope profiles vary between sites according to their proximity to the Blake-Bahama Platform edge. Profiles from Site 1049 (nearest the platform edge) show the greatest amount of mixing with modern seawater, whereas the site most distal to the platform edge (Site 1052) shows the most significant influence of older, deeper carbonates on the pore-water strontium isotopic composition...|$|R

In this paper the sisal fibers are incorporated with glass fiber by using polymer matrix and the S-GFRP hybrid composites have been prepared.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of process cutting parameters such as feed rate, drill diameter, type of drill bit and spindle speed on thrust force produced on drilling of Glass Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastic polymer (GFRTP) Composite material is being studied. Thrust force {{is an important}} and un-avoidable parameter in hole making operation. Drilling is final and important operation in assembly of components. Drilling of thermoplastic composite materials should have good interlaminer quality and dimensional stability. Drilling is not properly done then it affects the mating of two components, assembly tolerance, reduces the performance and decreases the number of cycle per components. Experiment is conducted with help of Vertical Machining Center (VMC). Input parameter is taken in account of Solid Carbide material Brad and <b>spur</b> <b>drill</b> bit with three different drill diameters like 6, 9 and 12 mm. The experimental result indicate that feed rate and drill diameter is the important factor for {{the increase in the}} thrust force and spindle speed is the man factor for change in torque by using Design of Experiments (DOE). The optimization of cutting parameters during drill is carried out using Box-Behnken Design and analysis of variance (ANOVA) ...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{materials}} are widely {{employed in the}} naval, aerospace and transportation industries owing to the combination of being lightweight and having a high modulus of elasticity, strength and stiffness. Drilling is an operation generally used in composite materials to assemble the final product. Damages such as the burr at the drill entrance and exit, geometric deviations and delamination are typically found in composites subjected to drilling. Drills with special geometries and pilot holes are alternatives used to improve hole quality {{as well as to}} increase tool life. The present study is focused on the drilling of a sandwich composite material (two external aluminum plates bound to a polyethylene core). In order to minimize thrust force and burr height, the influence of drill geometry, the pilot hole and the cutting parameters was assessed. Thrust force and burr height values were collected and used to perform an analysis of variance. The results indicated that the tool and the cutting speed were the parameters with more weight on the thrust force and for burr height they were the tool and the interaction between tool and feed. The results indicated that drilling with a pilot hole of Ø 4 mm exhibited the best performance with regard to thrust force but facilitated plastic deformation, thus leading to the elevation of burr height, while the lowest burr height was obtained using the Brad and <b>Spur</b> <b>drill</b> geometry...|$|E
