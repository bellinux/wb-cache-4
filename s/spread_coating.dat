For-mulations based on liquid MDI (Isonate 143 L), equipment, compounding, handling, and processing procedures are described in detail.

The results of reticulation degree showed that gel formation only happened in samples where the amine type accelerator has been used concomitantly with the epoxy resin. The results of Young's modulus seem to confirm the hypothesis of formation of a three dimensional network between the molecules of PVC and epoxy resin, but it was not possible to confirm a chemical reaction between these two polymers because of the large number of molecules present in the formulation.

The liquid <b>spreading</b> on <b>coated</b> papers was found to vary depending on the liquid physical properties. Liquids with lower surface tension (silicon oil) and viscosity prevailed better wettability and vice versa. High surface roughness reduced the liquid spreading.

40|$|The high VOC {{emissions}} from anthropogenic sources are detrimental {{to both the}} environment and humans, contributing with ground-level ozone and particle matter formation. Heterogeneous photocatalysis provides significant potential for VOC degradation. However, the approaches {{to be used for}} photocatalyst immobilization in scaled and highly efficient photoreactors are still not well established. Furthermore, {{there is a lack of}} reported photonic efficiencies and a shortage of required methods to establish these efficiencies. To address these issues, this PhD Dissertation reports the study of photonic efficiencies, TiO 2 immobilization on a stainless steel mesh and kinetic models in a scaled-up Photo-CREC-Air Reactor. Acetone and acetaldehyde are considered with a 25 - 320 initial concentration range. The irradiation field is experimentally evaluated in order to estimate the photon absorption on the TiO 2 film through macroscopic balances. Quantum Yields (QYs) and Photochemical Thermodynamic Efficiency Factors (PTEFs) are also established. TiO 2 coatings are prepared using two methods: an Air Assisted Spray with an Automatized Spinning Coating (TiO 2 -AAS-ASC) and a <b>Spread</b> <b>Coating</b> (TiO 2 -SCM). TiO 2 -AAS-ASC shows a more efficient use of the photocatalyst than the TiO 2 -SCM, and also displays homogeneity, limited particle agglomeration and stability under flow. Moreover, the TiO 2 -AAS-ASC shows a high degree of photonic energy utilization. A series-parallel Langmuir-Hinshelwood based kinetic model describes the photodegradation of acetone and acetaldehyde data well with a 0. 97 - 0. 98 range correlation coefficient. It is believed that altogether the approach reported in the present PhD Dissertation contributes to clarify key engineering issues of significant value for the scale-up of photocatalytic reactors for air treatment...|$|E

The results obtained show a significant influence of the original polymer properties in the viscosity aging and viscoelastic behaviour of the plastisol. First, a significant decrease in viscosity can be achieved by changing a particular surfactant during the polymerization step. Second, the type of particle aggregates present in the powder, can determine the evolution of the particle size in the plastisol which, in turn, correlates directly with the observed modifications in the aging and viscoelastic behavio...|$|R
