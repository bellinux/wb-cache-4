40|$|Abstract: Background. In well-differentiated thyroid carci-noma, {{predictors}} of future positivity of <b>stimulated</b> thyroglobulin (> 2 lg/L) after initial radioactive iodine treatment are not known. Methods. In a retrospective study, we used logistic regres-sion analysis {{to determine whether}} postoperative <b>stimulated</b> thy-roglobulin measurements and pathologic stage independently predict future <b>stimulated</b> thyroglobulin positivity. Results. We followed 141 patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma for a median of 35 months; follow-up stimu-lated thyroglobulin measurements were positive in 20. 6 % (29 / 141). The natural logarithm of the postsurgical <b>stimulated</b> thyro-golobulin was independently associated with a positive stimu-lated thyroglobulin at long-term follow-up (odds ratio [OR], 4. 44; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 33 – 8. 45; p <. 001); there was a trend for a positive association of TNM stage with positive follow-up <b>stimulated</b> thyroglobulin (p 5. 054). Lymph node positivity predicted a positive <b>stimulated</b> thyroglobulin in papillary cancer. Conclusions. <b>Stimulated</b> thyroglobulin measurements prior to initial radioactive iodine treatment independently predict future <b>stimulated</b> thyroglobulin positivity in well-differentiate...|$|R
5|$|Extracts of the puffball {{have strong}} {{antitumor}} activity in mouse models attributable to protein-bound polysaccharides, the compounds calvatan, craniformin, and a tautomer of rubroflavin.
