40|$|Grace to the {{analysis}} of several commercial companies effectively performed “on the field”, we could remark the necessity to change the method of cost calculation, our motivation being related to the simplification of calculations and the reduction of the labour volume, but especially the necessity to know in due time the deviations occurred as well as the causes having led to their apparition. The importance of knowing the deviations in due time results from the very basic characteristics of the constructions execution, i. e. the performance of works during several budgetary years, which leads to the modifications of prices and materials, the introduction of new technologies, and to the performance of open air activities, making the execution of constructions works be influenced by the atmospheric condition. But {{the most important aspect of}} knowing the deviations is the correct determination of expenses and their inscribing in the corresponding period, in view of determining the result of the budgetary year.

The BioPharmOps site in Huningue, France is expanding their product line but {{is also trying to}} reduce costs; cost pressures are increasing as biotech products become a larger part of Novartis' pipeline. The site uses a <b>standard</b> <b>cost</b> <b>method</b> to calculate their product costs. However, when using standard costs it can be time-consuming to extrapolate and predict costs when inputs and assumptions (such as product mix or process parameters) are changed. This project describes development of a model that allows the factory to quickly and easily simulate new product mixes and process flows. This model provides the site with a different view of their costs that will help them understand their cost drivers more completely and thereby help enable strategic decision-making at the site. A model of this type can be used to provide unexpected insights but the data in it are not meant to stand alone. By using results from a cost model like this along with operational metrics like throughput time or changeover time, a site should be able to quickly predict the cost impact of process changes or changes in the production plan. by Christina M.

40|$|Most of the {{research}} concerned with the economics of health systems has focussed on allocative efficiency. Specifically, much effort {{has been devoted to}} the development and application of techniques of economic evaluation. The consideration of technical efficiency has figured less prominently in the search for 'solutions' to the problems of health systems. Those working on the economic evaluation of health care interventions have adopted the assumption that interventions are being, or will be, produced in a technically efficient manner. The aim of this thesis is to challenge this assumption and illustrate the potential implications of assuming technical efficiency when allocating scarce resources. Two case studies from Bangladesh are presented: vaccination services in Dhaka City and primary health care in rural Bangladesh. The specific objectives of this thesis are to: estimate the cost of these services using <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> methods; and analyse the same data sets using parametric (stochastic frontier analysis) and non-parametric (data envelopment analysis) techniques in order to identify whether, and to what degree, the services were being delivered efficiently. Applying efficiency measurement techniques illustrated that <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> <b>methods</b> disguise a high degree of inefficiency. By investigating production practices, costs related to inefficiencies can be identified and addressed. The thesis illustrates that if something is deemed worth doing then it should be carried out in a way which ensures the optimum use of scarce resources. An exclusive focus on switching resources from less cost-effective to more cost-effective activities will not realise the full benefits in terms of improved allocative efficiency if providers on the ground are not producing services at lowest cost. Recommendations are made for policy-makers on how technical efficiency can be improved. Recommendations for future research are also made.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} in forest biomass has made chipping increasingly popular all across Europe. Many operators have equipped for the purpose, but the large variety of working conditions found in the European forests {{makes it difficult to}} correctly estimate the productivity of each specific operation, leading to uncertainty in crucial decisions, such as: operation scheduling, price setting, machinery selection and acquisition. In 2001, the Italian National Council for Research (CNR) and the University of California (UC) developed a spreadsheet freeware capable of returning reliable estimates of chipping productivity and cost, on the basis of user-defined input data. The model is still available from the CNR website and is the object of frequent downloading and inquiries. Such model contains a set of predictive equations derived from the results of 102 field trials, conducted with 30 different machines, under a range of working conditions. In order to facilitate comparison with other estimates and to achieve methodological transparency, the equations are assembled into a simple Microsoft Excel workbook, and the costs are calculated with <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> <b>methods</b> currently used in Forest and Agricultural Engineering. Since then CNR has continued to work on the subject, with the goal of updating and refining the model. Such work has included 45 validation tests and a separate study on the delay (idle) time typical for different chipping operation layouts. The study was concluded in 2009 and confirms that the model developed by CNR can provide reliable estimates of chipper productivity under a range of operational conditions. Authors believe that such a model can assist European foresters in keeping ahead with the growing biomass sector, thus helping them to seize an important business opportunity. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

How does a product affect global warming, smog, fossil fuel depletion, and human toxicity? How about its costs over time? Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) addresses these questions by measuring the life-cycle environmental and economic performance of construction products. Used by thousands of designers worldwide, BEES measures environmental performance using the life-cycle assessment approach specified in the ISO 14040 series of standards. All stages {{in the life of a}} product are analyzed: raw material acquisition, manufacture, transportation, installation, use, and recycling and waste management. Twelve environmental impacts are assessed: global warming, acidification, eutrophication, fossil fuel depletion, indoor air quality, habitat alteration, smog, ozone depletion, ecological toxicity, human health, criteria air pollutants, and water intake. Economic performance is measured using the American Society for Testing and Materials, International (ASTM) <b>standard</b> life-cycle <b>cost</b> <b>method,</b> which covers the costs of initial investment, replacement, operation, maintenance and repair, and disposal.

40|$|The evolved {{methods of}} {{management}} accounting {{have been developed}} {{with the purpose of}} removing the disadvantages of the classical methods, they are methods adapted to the new market conditions, which provide much more useful cost-related information so that the management of the company is able to take certain strategic decisions. Out of the category of evolved methods, the most used is the one of standard-costs due to the advantages that it presents, being used widely in calculating the production costs in some developed countries. The main advantages of the standard-cost method are: in-advance knowledge of the production costs and the measures that ensure compliance to these; {{with the help of the}} deviations calculated from the <b>standard</b> <b>costs,</b> one manages a systematic control over the costs, thus allowing the making of decision in due time, in as far as the elimination of the deviations and the improvement of the activity are concerned and it is a method of analysis, control and cost forecast; Although the advantages of using standards are significant, there are a few disadvantages to the employment of the standard-cost method: sometimes there can appear difficulties in establishing the deviations from the <b>standard</b> <b>costs,</b> the <b>method</b> does not allow an accurate calculation of the fixed costs. As a result of the study, we can observe the fact that the evolved methods of management accounting, as compared to the classical ones, present a series of advantages linked to a better analysis, control, and foreseeing of costs, whereas the main disadvantage is related to the large amount of work necessary for these methods to be applie...|$|R
50|$|Under most {{circumstances}} it is {{not necessary}} to calculate product or service costs. Traditional manufacturing companies usually calculate a fully absorbed product <b>cost</b> using complex <b>methods</b> for the allocation of overhead costs, and they use these product costs for decision-making, inventory valuation, and performance measurements in the form of variance analysis and such metrics as individual efficiency. Similar methods are used in service organizations to estimate the cost of each service they provide. Companies employing lean accounting <b>methods</b> recognize that <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> and other <b>methods</b> for fully absorbed product or service costing lead to poor decisions and motivate anti-lean behavior. These companies also find that there is no need to calculate a product cost because all the uses of product costs within traditional companies can be addressed in lean accounting using simpler and better methods. Decision-making, inventory valuation, performance measurements, and other uses of fully absorbed product costs are all achieved using other lean accounting methods. If a product cost is required - for reporting international transfer pricing, for example - then these can be calculated using simpler and more lean-focused methods like Features & Characteristics costing.|$|R

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents, in particular, face substantial inequalities in asthma-related outcomes. Triple A (Adolescent Asthma Action) is a peer-led education intervention, which aims to improve asthma self-management and reduce the uptake of smoking among adolescents. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the cost of implementing the Triple A program in Australia. <b>Standard</b> economic <b>costing</b> <b>methods</b> were used. It involved identifying the resources that were utilised (such as personnel and program materials), measuring them and then valuing them. We later performed sensitivity analysis so as to identify the cost drivers and a stress test to test how the intervention can perform when some inputs are lacking. Results indicate that the estimated cost of implementing the Triple A program in five schools was $ 41 060, assuming that the opportunity cost of all the participants and venues was accounted for. This translated to $ 8212 per school or $ 50 per target student. From sensitivity analysis and a stress test, it was identified that the cost of the intervention (in practice) was $ 14 per student. This appears to be a modest cost, given the burden of asthma. In conclusion, the Triple A program is an affordable intervention to implement in high schools. The potential asthma cost savings due to the program are significant. If the Triple A program is implemented nation-wide, the benefits would be substantial...|$|R
