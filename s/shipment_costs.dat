30|$|From the {{observations}} {{in the existing}} literature in which the ordering cost is fixed per cycle, it is seen that whenever the number of replenishment cycles is more, the ordering cost be very high than the ordering cost in one cycle though in each case total quantity delivered is same in finite time horizon. Practically, in real business world, this concept is not completely error free. Again, whenever number of replenishment cycles is more then the <b>shipment</b> <b>cost</b> is reduced inversely since the quantity delivered is less per cycle. That is, if a_ 1 be the <b>shipment</b> <b>cost</b> for total quantity Q to be delivered in one time in the business period then for n replenishment, the <b>shipment</b> <b>cost</b> per cycle will be a_ 1 /n, since {{in this case the}} total quantity Q is delivered in n cycle of amount Q/n per cycle. So, the <b>shipment</b> <b>cost</b> per cycle varies inversely with n. Again, if the total quantity Q is delivered in more than one cycle, clearly due to the processing the delivery supplier must claim an extra charge which is known as processing cost. Notedly, this type of cost will be increased whenever number of replenishment cycles also increases. That is, the ordering cost can not be constant for a fixed time horizon. But, till now, no one has considered variable ordering cost depending on replenishment cycle in a fixed time horizon.|$|R

40|$|One way {{to hedge}} against random {{fluctuations}} of demand in supply chains {{is to keep}} inventories at various points in the chain. Another is to actually modify the leadtimes in the system dynamically. Working with multiple suppliers, using multiple transportation options, having the option to expedite certain processes, or having different possible routes for a unit {{to go through the}} supply chain are all examples of having flexibility in the supply chain leadtimes. In this paper, we study a serial inventory system with complete leadtime flexibility. For expositional purposes, we use a terminology that corresponds to making shipment (routing) decisions in the supply chain, however, the model can represent many different types of leadtime flexibility, such as the ones described above. In particular, we allow the option of shipping units from any stage in the supply chain to any downstream stage. This option gives the manager an additional flexibility that can be utilized as the uncertain demand is revealed. The shipments incur origin-destination dependent costs.

The results of a detailed numerical study pertaining to static time horizon reveal that the shift in inventory ownership provides system-wide cost benefits in specific settings.

The value of the shift in decision-making power is greater than IS particularly when the variability of underlying demand is low and time-dependent variation in production cost is high. However, when the shipment cost is negligible and order issuing efficiency of the supplier is low, the cost benefits of shift in decision-making power beyond IS are not significant...|$|E
40|$|At the top ranking as the world’s busiest port in 2004, Hong Kong {{has been}} {{overtaken}} by Singapore, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, {{to become the}} 4 th busiest in 2014. Container handling throughput has been recording a continuous downfall. After China has joined the World Trade Organization, its opened economy benefited Hong Kong. But with the aggressive development of ports in the PRD region, their port facilities, infrastructure, labour and expertise caught Hong Kong. Their operation efficiency is at a competitive level to Hong Kong. Along with cheaper terminal handling charges, shippers tend to use Shenzhen ports for Chinese cargoes. Manufacturing cargoes had been the major source since containerization developed Hong Kong’s shipping and logistics industry. Because of lower production costs, plants were relocated to South China region. Though manufacturers could use ports in the Pearl River Delta, Hong Kong still attracted {{a certain amount of}} transshipments. The rapid appreciation of RMB has led to increased production costs in the Mainland. Factories has begun to moved out of China and set up their business in Southeast Asia countries like Myanmar, Vietnam, etc. The main cargo source has been getting far away from Hong Kong ports. Since then, more and more international transshipments have been handling by Hong Kong ports. But the overall port infrastructure has not been improving at the same pace. Strategic alliances of shipping lines see them deploying more mega-sized vessels to Hong Kong to enjoy greater economies of scale. It caused port congestion as the limited facilities are dedicated to the vessel which other smaller ships cannot be served simultaneously. Subsequent higher turnaround time and longer transit time lead to the higher <b>shipment</b> <b>costs</b> due to the increased storage cost. Hong Kong enjoys a lot of benefits from its free port status. Cabotage law in place helps a hand to induce substantial amount of international transshipments heading to China. More free trade zones have established in the Mainland. Operators and international carriers are calling for easing the cabotage rule in Chinese ports. High terminal charges partly contributed to the expensive <b>shipment</b> <b>costs,</b> together with longer turnaround and transit time have been discouraging shippers to use Hong Kong. Potential direct Chinese shipments may take more international transshipments from Hong Kong. Operation deficiency, uncompetitive rates, and comparatively longer turnaround time, all reduce Hong Kong’s competitiveness. Lack of land supply and port congestion are the main factors hindering the port’s growth. Hong Kong government should increase land supply for cargo storage, transshipment value-added handling, and increase port infrastructures. Building more berths could accommodate more mega-sized vessels, results in alleviating port congestion. Efficiency would be enhanced once cargo handling facilities are increased. Government support and good coordination between terminal operators are essential for implementation. published_or_final_versionTransport Policy and PlanningMasterMaster of Arts in Transport Policy and Plannin...|$|E
