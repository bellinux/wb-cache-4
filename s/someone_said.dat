25|$|This is {{a series}} of vignettes recounting a social {{occasion}} during which <b>someone</b> <b>said</b> something that should not have been said, or an awkward occurrence. The participant's task is to identify what was said that was awkward, why it was awkward, how people would have felt in reaction to the faux pas and to a factual control question. Although first designed for use in people on the autism spectrum, the test is also sensitive to patients with OFC dysfunction, who cannot judge when something socially awkward has happened despite appearing to understand the story perfectly well.|$|E
500|$|Barbara Cloud of the Pittsburgh Press gave {{attribution}} to Hershey {{for starting}} a trend {{when she had}} collagen injected into her lips {{for her role in}} Beaches (1988). Humorist Erma Bombeck said of the movie, which also starred Bette Midler, [...] "I have no idea what Beaches was all about. All I could focus on was Barbara Hershey's lips. She looked like she stopped off at a gas station and <b>someone</b> <b>said,</b> 'Your lips are down 30 pounds. Better let me hit 'em with some air.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} the lines [...] "Way back in time / <b>Someone</b> <b>said</b> try some, I tried some / Now buy some, I bought some..." [...] before Harrison states that {{he opened his eyes}} [...] "and I saw you". According to Christian theologian Dale Allison, the lyrics are a [...] "reflection on some sort of {{conversion}} experience", in which Harrison provides [...] "before and after" [...] comparisons. Before his spiritual awakening, Harrison sings of variously possessing, seeing, feeling and knowing [...] "ot a thing" [...] until, Allison writes, [...] "he called upon God's love, which then came into him." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{development}} of the song by NME.com, vocalist Chris Martin said, [...] "From that version, [...] we went and did a whole other version of it. A whole other song. What happened with the song 'Talk' is that it was all going great and then <b>someone</b> <b>said</b> 'That should be the first single' and we all just freaked out and scrapped it all. [...] We’ve just mixed it and it sounds great. I think we’ve had such pain getting to that place, I’m not sure anyone quite knows {{what to do with it}} anymore. When we heard it mixed properly, it sounded mega." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written in 1926 by vaudevillians Lou Handman and Roy Turk with three verses, {{followed}} by a spoken bridge. They based the bridge on a line in Ruggero Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, and [...] "You know <b>someone</b> <b>said</b> that the world's a stage. And each must play a part" [...] refers to [...] "All the world's a stage" [...] from William Shakespeare's As You Like It. This recitation is printed on the inside back cover of the original 1927 sheet music, and is sung on Stanley Kirbys recording in 1928, Al Jolson's recording in 1949 and Blue Barrron recording in 1950 (US top 20 hit). Billboard reported in 1960 its discovery that {{it was written by}} songwriter and vaudeville pianist Dave Dreyer.|$|E
500|$|Leader {{and founder}} of the Brotherhood, Magneto is a mutant Holocaust {{survivor}} who wages war against humanity in the name of mutant superiority. He has the ability to control and manipulate metal, making him {{one of the most powerful}} mutants. Well-known for his homosexuality, McKellen found a parallel of the cure with many prejudices: [...] "It's abhorrent to me, as it would be if a person said I need curing of my sexuality, or if <b>someone</b> <b>said</b> that black people could take a pill that would 'cure' them of being black." [...] McKellen's shooting schedule had to accommodate his work in both The Da Vinci Code and the London theatre, going as far as filming the actor in England to later superimpose into the Vancouver plates.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the debate, {{the judge}} must make a {{decision}} between the advocacies of two teams. Offense is the way that teams definitively differentiate between the value of their advocacies so that the judge can make an informed choice. Debate is impossible without offense; a debate between <b>someone</b> who <b>said</b> [...] "ice cream isn't perfect" [...] and <b>someone</b> who <b>said</b> [...] "ice cream isn't the worst food ever" [...] would be inconclusive because neither argument actively provides direction in choosing whether or not to get ice cream.|$|R

500|$|Queen Elizabeth {{had been}} widowed for {{only three years}} when Gilliat entered her service at her London {{residence}} of Clarence House, his obituary in The Independent credited him with helping her carve out a new role for herself and described his attitude: Like her, he took a genuine interest in the lives and doings of all with whom he came into contact and made them feel that they were important to him. He made no distinction between old and young, rich and poor, high and low, white and coloured. He thought the best of everyone [...] <b>someone</b> <b>said</b> of him, 'All Martin's geese are swans' [...] and treated them all alike. Gilliat was an expert at 'breaking the ice' between nervous guests and the Queen at her parties. Gilliat once deployed his skills at a party for the young Bhumibol Adulyadej, the King of Thailand, by asking the king to demonstrate his skill of standing on his head, which the King did.|$|E
500|$|St Hill {{was born}} on 6 July 1893 in Port of Spain, Trinidad, and {{according}} to C. L. R. James, his family were lower middle-class. He had two brothers who played first-class cricket for Trinidad, Cyl and Edwin; the latter also played Test matches for West Indies. Cricket in Trinidad {{at the time was}} divided along racial lines. For cricket clubs on the island, the colour of a player's skin was crucial. St Hill played for Shannon, a club associated with black lower middle-class players such as teachers or clerks. Another club, Maple, was associated with middle-class people but would only accept men with a lighter skin tone. When <b>someone</b> <b>said</b> to St Hill that Maple would welcome a player as good as him, he replied, [...] "Yes, but they wouldn't want my brothers", both of whom were darker skinned. By 1912, St Hill found a job in a department store and remained in this position all his life. By this stage, he had established a good reputation as a batsman and was popular with players and spectators.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, {{shortly after}} the British race McLaren's {{experienced}} team manager Teddy Mayer decided not to continue with Villeneuve for the following year. His explanation was that Villeneuve [...] "was looking as though {{he might be a}} bit expensive" [...] and that Patrick Tambay, the team's eventual choice for 1978, was showing similar promise. Villeneuve was left with no solid options for 1978, although Canadian Walter Wolf, for whom Villeneuve had driven in Can-Am racing, considered giving him a drive at Wolf Racing. Rumours circulated that Villeneuve was one of several drivers in whom Ferrari's team was interested, and in August 1977 he flew to Italy to meet Enzo Ferrari, who was immediately reminded of the pre-war European champion Tazio Nuvolari: [...] "When they presented me with this 'piccolo Canadese' (little Canadian), this minuscule bundle of nerves, I immediately recognised in him the physique of Nuvolari and said to myself, let's give him a try." [...] Ferrari was satisfied with Villeneuve's promise after a session at Ferrari's Fiorano test track, despite the Canadian making many mistakes and setting relatively slow times, and Villeneuve signed to drive for Ferrari in the last two races of the 1977 season and the 1978 season. Villeneuve later remarked that: [...] "If <b>someone</b> <b>said</b> to me that you can have three wishes, my first would have been to get into racing, my second to be in Formula 1, my third to drive for Ferrari..." ...|$|E

500|$|By 2001, Arulpragasam {{designed}} the cover for Elastica's last single [...] "The Bitch Don't Work", {{and went on}} the road with the band to video document their tour. The tour's supporting act, electroclash artist Peaches, introduced Arulpragasam to the Roland MC-505 and encouraged her to make music, a medium in which Arulpragasam lacked confidence. While holidaying together in Bequia in the Caribbean, Arulpragasam began experimenting with Frischmann's MC-505. She adopted her stage name, [...] "M.I.A.", standing for [...] "Missing In Acton" [...] during this time. In her 2012 book Arulpragasam writes, [...] "M.I.A. came to be because of my missing cousin. I wanted to make a film about where he was since he was M.I.A. (Missing in Action) in Sri Lanka. We were the same age, went to the same schools growing up. I was also living in Acton at the time. So I was living in Acton looking for my cousin missing in action." [...] Of her time in Bequia, she told [...] "I started going out to this chicken shed with a sound system. You buy rum through a hatch and dance in the street. They convinced me to come to church where people sing so amazingly. But I couldn’t clap along to hallelujah. I was out of rhythm. <b>Someone</b> <b>said,</b> ‘What happened to Jesus? I saw you dancing last night and you were totally fine.’ They stopped the service and taught me to clap in time. It was embarrassing". Returning to West London, where she shared an apartment with Frischmann, she began working with a simple set-up (a second-hand 4-track tape machine, the MC-505, and a radio microphone), composing and recording a six-song demo tape that included [...] "Lady Killa", [...] "M.I.A.", and [...] "Galang".|$|E

During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when <b>someone</b> <b>said</b> something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day <b>someone</b> <b>said</b> something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life."
