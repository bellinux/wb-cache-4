5|$|Hunt drew {{criticism}} for {{his style of}} returning the football; upon receiving the ball, he would run straight at opposition players rather than attempting to evade them. As a result, he received several high tackles, causing the Broncos to ask the NRL to protect Hunt by punishing opposition players more severely. The referees' board <b>supported</b> <b>this</b> position, and stated that fullbacks such as Hunt needed to be protected due to greater risk of injury.|$|E

5|$|Another {{concern is}} the risk of {{clearing}} rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for sugarcane production, such as the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Cerrado. Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7% of sugarcane plantations are located at least 2,000km from the Amazon, and expansion during the last 25 years {{took place in the}} Center-South region, also far away from the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest. In São Paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands. The impact assessment commissioned by the Dutch government <b>supported</b> <b>this</b> argument.|$|E
5|$|John of Bohemia's heir, Charles, Margrave of Moravia, visited Charles in Visegrád {{in early}} 1338.

Two leading Polish lords, Zbigniew, chancellor of Cracow, and Spycimir Leliwita, also <b>supported</b> <b>this</b> plan and persuaded CasimirIII, who lost his first wife on 26May 1339, to start negotiations with Charles. In July, Casimir came to Hungary and designated his sister (Charles's wife), Elizabeth, and her sons as his heirs.

5|$|Paleontologists {{have long}} {{classified}} Alioramus within the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea, but because its remains were {{for many years}} poorly known, a more precise classification had remained elusive until the discovery of A. altai. A cladistic analysis published in 2003 found Alioramus could be further classified into the family Tyrannosauridae and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae, alongside Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Daspletosaurus. A 2004 study <b>supported</b> <b>this</b> result but suggested it was equally probable that Alioramus belonged outside the family Tyrannosauridae entirely, with its supposed juvenile characters actually reflecting a more basal position within Tyrannosauroidea. Another study omitted Alioramus altogether due to the only specimen's fragmentary nature. The discovery of A. altai in 2009 confirmed {{the placement of the}} genus within the Tyrannosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|The 26-year-old FitzRoy had {{hopes of}} {{commanding}} a second expedition {{to continue the}} South American survey, but when he heard that the Lords of the Admiralty no longer <b>supported</b> <b>this,</b> he grew concerned about how to return the Fuegians who had been taught English {{with the idea that}} they could become missionaries. He made an agreement with the owner of a small merchant-vessel to take himself and five others back to South America, but a kind uncle heard of this and contacted the Admiralty. Soon afterwards FitzRoy heard that he was to be appointed commander of HMS Chanticleer to go to Tierra del Fuego, but due to her poor condition Beagle was substituted. On 27 June 1831 FitzRoy was commissioned as commander of the voyage, and Lieutenants John Clements Wickham and Bartholomew James Sulivan were appointed.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Authority's response, titled Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting, {{recommended}} that the Australian Government support the early introduction of digital broadcasting as a free-to-air service with the loan of a 7MHz channel for each broadcaster, in order to enable high-definition television from the outset. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations <b>supported</b> <b>this,</b> as well as freedom for its members to launch multi-channel services. At the same time, the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association, questioned the commercial viability of HDTV, was opposed {{to the idea of}} multi-channeling, and argued for a competitive system that would allow the entry of new players.|$|E

5|$|The Court <b>supported</b> <b>this</b> {{interpretation}} {{by recognizing}} that the First Amendment sought to prevent government actions from discouraging protected activity. Citing Branti v. Finkel, the Court pointed out that precedent never required plaintiffs in political affiliation cases to show change in allegiance to be successful, and similarly extended that logic to this case: the potential chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech still exists, regardless of the factual basis of the employer's reasoning. Because employees thinking of engaging in protected activity will be equally dissuaded by an incorrect dismissal as by a correct dismissal, both reasonings {{should be considered in}} violation of the First Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The MacBook Pro {{comes with}} the {{successor}} to BIOS, Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 1.1. EFI handles booting differently from BIOS-based computers, but provides backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software. Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially <b>supported.</b> <b>This</b> is {{made possible by the}} presence of the Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation Apple has provided on top of EFI.|$|E
5|$|The {{authors of}} a 2002 {{article about the}} spinosaur Irritator {{proposed}} that Suchomimus tenerensis was similar enough to B. walkeri {{to be considered a}} species within the same genus (B. tenerensis), and suggested that Suchomimus was identical to Cristatusaurus; both are from the Elrhaz Formation of Niger. At about 9.5m (30ft) and 2.5 tonnes (5,511lb), Suchomimus was larger than Baryonyx. In a 2004 conference abstract, palaeontologists Steve Hutt and Penny Newbery <b>supported</b> <b>this</b> view based on a large theropod vertebra from the Isle of Wight which they attributed to Baryonyx; this indicated that the vertebrae of the two genera were more similar than previously thought. Later studies have kept the genera separate.|$|E

5|$|The moral {{defense of}} the attacks on Japanese cities rests on an {{argument}} that they saved lives by shortening the war. The USSBS concluded {{that the effects of}} strategic bombing and blockade would have forced Japan to surrender by the end of 1945 even if atomic bombs had not been used and the Soviet Union had remained neutral. Historian E. Bartlett Kerr <b>supported</b> <b>this</b> assessment, and argued that the firebombing of Japan's major cities was the key factor motivating Hirohito's decision to end the war. American historian Barrett Tillman has also written that area attacks were unavoidable because, owing to the limitations of their bombsight and the high winds common over Japan, the B-29s were incapable of bombing individual targets without also causing widespread damage to surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} {{friction}} within the Catholic groups, first over Sukarno's 1957 decree {{that he was}} president for life and establishment of a guided democracy policy. A faction, led by Soegijapranata, <b>supported</b> <b>this</b> decree, while Catholic Party leader I. J. Kasimo's faction was heavily against it. Sukarno, who had a good working relationship with Soegijapranata, asked the vicar to join the National Council, a request that Soegijapranata refused; he did, however, assign two delegates to the Council, ensuring Catholic representation. This, along with Soegijapranata's support of Sukarno's decree on 5 July 1949 calling {{for a return to}} the 1945 constitution, resulted in Bishop of Jakarta Adrianus Djajasepoetra's denunciation of Soegijapranata as a sycophant. However, Soegijapranata was strongly against Sukarno's idea of Nasakom, which based part of the nation's government on communism.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops is {{the best}} known genus of the Ceratopsidae, a family of large North American horned dinosaurs. The exact {{location}} of Triceratops among the ceratopsians has been debated over the years. Confusion stemmed mainly from the combination of short, solid frills (similar to that of Centrosaurinae), and the long brow horns (more akin to Ceratopsinae, also known as Chasmosaurinae). In the first overview of horned dinosaurs, R. S. Lull hypothesized two lineages, one of Monoclonius and Centrosaurus leading to Triceratops, the other with Ceratops and Torosaurus, making Triceratops a centrosaurine as the group is understood today. Later revisions <b>supported</b> <b>this</b> view, formally describing the first, short-frilled group as Centrosaurinae (including Triceratops), and the second, long-frilled group as Chasmosaurinae.|$|E
