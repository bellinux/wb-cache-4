25|$|The {{military}} cannot {{continue to}} be an organization with unmatched institutional reach and political influence, while limiting state capacity, because in doing <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> evermore challenging for civilian supremacy to take a stance, thus establishing effective civil-military relations. If these problems are not addressed properly, as long as civil-military relations of countries continue to interact within undefined boundaries, without clear subordination and authority and with the constrictions of limited budgets, {{it is unlikely that}} countries that still struggle with the concept will achieve a stable and efficient civil-military relationship, something that will continue to damage state capacity and stability.|$|E

On the other hand, tungsten impurities in a plasma are much more damaging than carbon impurities, and self-sputtering of tungsten can be high, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> necessary {{to ensure that the}} plasma in contact with the tungsten is not too hot (a few tens of eV rather than hundreds of eV). Tungsten also has disadvantages in terms of eddy currents and melting in off-normal events, as well as some radiological issues.|$|E

500|$|In October 2010, Mason {{stated that}} a romantic {{interest}} for Chris could be {{introduced in the}} future. He {{said that it was}} not confirmed, but there was a chance that Chris would find someone. Mason admitted that he would find it [...] "awkward" [...] if he had to perform a male kissing scene. The following year, Mason revealed that the writers had plans for a romance for Chris on their radar and a few weeks later it was announced that Bobby Morley had joined the cast as Aidan Foster, a love interest for Chris. Aidan and Chris formed the serial's first gay couple. Bower called the storyline [...] "a natural progression" [...] for Chris, noting that he needed to meet someone at some stage. Bower told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Chris's romance will be handled in a sensitive way and will be treated within the character. She explained [...] "Chris is a naturally shy person – he is not a person who either flaunts his sexuality or his heart. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> done according to that character. And {{it may not be a}} full-on relationship. The character that Bob is playing is older and further down the track with his relationship testing, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a relationship story rather than a gay male romance." [...] Mason said that Chris and Aidan's relationship would have a slow build up.|$|E

500|$|Paul Kelly {{has written}} a memoir, How to Make Gravy, which was {{published}} by Penguin Books (Australia) on 22 September 2010. [...] "It's a mongrel memoir. It's a bit hard to describe at the moment. It's not traditional; it's writing around the A-Z theme – I tell stories around the song lyrics in alphabetical order. It's slow, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a while coming, but I'll get there". As a companion to his memoir, he issued an 8×CD box set, A – Z Recordings, with live performances from his A – Z Tours from 2004 to 2010. The 105 tracks are listed alphabetically, and were typically performed over four nights. The set includes a booklet of photographs. The related audio book on 16×CDs has Kelly joined by Australian actors, Cate Blanchett, Russell Crowe, Judy Davis, Hugh Jackman and Ben Mendelsohn each reading a chosen chapter.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there was}} no desire in Brazil among the {{majority}} of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. They launched a coup d'état, arrested Prime Minister Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889. The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion. Historian Lídia Besouchet noted that [...] "arely has a revolution been so minor." [...] During the ordeal PedroII showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that politicians and military leaders put forward. When he heard the news of his deposition he simply commented: [...] "If it is <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then."

500|$|Ouro Preto {{arrived at}} the palace at 4 p.m and {{suggested}} that Pedro II nominate senator Gaspar da Silveira Martins, who would arrive in the city two days later, as the new President. Deodoro avoided meeting personally with Pedro II, but once he heard that the Emperor had chosen a personal enemy of his for the office, he finally decided on the inauguration of the Republic. The recently elected Chamber of Deputies was only to be called into session on 20 November, and the Senate was in recess. For this reason, Princess Isabel insisted that her father convoke the Council of State {{to deal with the}} situation. But she was given the reply, [...] "Later on." [...] The princess, on her own initiative, called the council members. [...] The Council assembled at 11 p.m, and after two hours recommended that the Emperor appoint Antônio Saraiva instead of Silveira Martins. After accepting the office, this politician sent an emissary to negotiate with Deodoro. But Deodoro responded that {{it was too late to}} change his mind. Upon hearing the reply, Pedro II commented, [...] "If it is <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then." ...|$|E

In her second column, [...] "Odds stacked against Indian women", Zinta analysed the eve teasing phenomenon in India, and criticised those who practice it.

Why should women feel unsafe in a country which had an internationally revered woman prime minister?" [...] The column caught the attention of readers worldwide, and she received thousands of e-mails about it. It was applauded particularly by women for its stand against abuse of Indian women. Her third column, [...] "The darkness that all actors fear", was a more personal column and dealt with her stardom, fans, insecurity and fears as an actor. Her fourth and final column, titled [...] "Facing death in Sri Lanka and Thailand", described her two near-death experiences in late 2004.|$|E
500|$|Ron {{particularly}} despises {{talking to}} members of the public, which is why he deliberately designed his office to be uninviting to visitors, in part by mounting a double-barreled, sawed-off shotgun on a swivel atop his desk aimed at the guest chair, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> pointed at anyone who wants to speak to him, a claymore mine (front-pointed toward enemy), and a Czech hedgehog. Despite his lack of interest in the job, Ron occasionally demonstrates he is a good manager who recognizes the abilities of his co-workers. He claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him, and that his best friend was a co-worker he knew for three years without ever learning his name. However, Ron cares more about his colleagues than he lets on and often helps them in spite of himself. Despite sharing a nearly opposite view on the role of government, Ron gets along well with Knope, and the two share a strong mutual respect. Although Leslie had considered a job offer in the neighboring town of Eagleton, she stays based on advice from Ron that, no matter how many job offers she gets, Pawnee will always be her hometown. Ron also developed a grudging, avuncular affection for April's husband, Andy Dwyer, and decided to give him the [...] "Ron Swanson Scholarship" [...] ($940) so Andy can attend one college course: Women's Studies, after Andy and April couldn't afford to pay it. In the voiceover while Ron drops Andy off for his first day of class, he recalls his own first day of college when his father dropped him off at the steel mill. His father thought he shouldn't bother with college, but Ron hitched a ride to the school and went anyway.|$|E

When he is accidentally awakened from his sleep by Mega Man, Juno makes many strange revelations, among them referring to Mega Man as [...] "Mega Man Trigger", and realizing that Mega Man is suffering from memory loss. Juno claims that the island's population needs to be purged <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more controllable, and confronts Mega Man {{when he tries to}} stop him.

Data gives new commands to the system, stopping the Purification and also deleting Juno's backup data from Eden. Data then reveals to Mega Man that he contains all of his previous memories from when he was Mega Man Trigger. Mega Man had stored his memories into Data as a way to prevent Eden from ever tampering with it. Data promises that he will restore Mega Man's memory when the time comes. The residents proclaim Mega Man a hero and the Caskett family rides off in the repaired Flutter to continue their journey.|$|E
