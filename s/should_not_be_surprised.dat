God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty. But I have been mistaken. My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.|$|E

500|$|The Australian Financial Review (AFR) had {{for years}} carried stories {{critical}} of managed investment schemes. An AFR story had prompted the letter, supporting the forest industries, from federal government minister Wilson Tuckey in 2000. When Great Southern collapsed, Tuckey was asked for comment by the Sydney Morning Herald. He said [...] "Everyone thought [...] {{was a good idea}} at the time". He argued investors would probably not lose their money, but [...] "shareholders and lenders could be in a bit of trouble". With both Great Southern Group and Timbercorp under administration, the AFR continued its editorial attack on government MIS policy. An AFR journalist wrote, [...] "as a general rule, MIS industries are inherently doomed to fail both from an investment and a social good perspective... Taxpayers <b>should...</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> that they continue to fall over".|$|E

I <b>should</b> <b>n't</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear of her preaching in the jail, adopting a nice dirty little orphan, or passing round tracts at a Woman's Rights meeting," [...] said Trix, who never could forgive Belle for having a lovely complexion, and so much hair of her own that she never patronized either rats, mice, waterfalls, switches, or puff-combs.|$|R
500|$|In January 1980, the {{producers}} and writers began plotting the culminating episodes for season 3. Executive producer Philip Capice says {{they decided to}} attempt {{to work in a}} ploy to hold interest over the summer. CBS ordered two extra episodes, which gave them a chance to weave many storylines into the scripts. He noted that [...] "J.R. had developed into a character we felt everyone out there wanted to see get his comeuppance. And we did need that sort of a cliffhanger to carry us over to the new season." [...] He said that there was consensus that a mystery with several suspects was optimal and that it should be a sudden event. Capice denied rumors that the shooting was a ploy to make it easy to write Hagman out of the script if his contract negotiations became too difficult. Producer Leonard Katzman, executive story consultant Art Lewis and story editor Camille Marchetta decided the actual culprit in mid-March by process of logical elimination with the belief that the audience <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by someone who was not important to the show as the shooter.|$|E
500|$|Season 2 leaves Tyrion [...] "broke, beaten, scarred {{for life}} and {{stripped}} of his power," [...] despite having been instrumental in saving King's Landing from invasion. It is his chance to escape the sordid and deadly [...] "game of thrones," [...] but he cannot bring himself to, confessing, [...] "Bad people are what I'm good at." [...] So Tyrion finds he must submit to Tywin's plan of marrying him to Sansa Stark; despite being drunk in order to soothe his many woes, Tyrion manages to save Sansa from being publicly stripped and likely raped by Joffrey, and later [...] "chooses decency over filial loyalty and elects not to consummate the marriage after all." [...] Tyrion is also now powerless against Joffrey's malice, but Tywin has asserted his control over the young king, if only when it serves his own desires; he stops Joffrey from presenting Sansa with her brother's head, but not because he cares about Sansa or Tyrion's outrage. Despite Tywin's continuous determination to make Tyrion feel [...] "miserable and unloved," [...] he believes {{he is a good}} father – because he resisted the urge to cast Tyrion into the sea at birth. Though he <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by his father's coldblooded machinations, Tyrion is horrified by Tywin's involvement in the Red Wedding; Todd VanDerWerff writes, [...] "only Tyrion seems to understand that the blood they spilled will eventually be avenged. The North may have calmed for now, but it won't be calm always." [...] Of that storyline, Matt Fowler of IGN notes, [...] "Only an event that powerful could keep series-favorite Tyrion out of an episode for the first time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burke {{adds that}} it {{requires}} a [...] "certain manly discipline {{to serve as an}} altar boy in service at the side of a priest, and most priests have their first deep experiences of the liturgy as altar boys. If we are not training young men as altar boys, giving them an experience of serving God in the liturgy, we <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> that vocations have fallen dramatically." ...|$|E

60|$|No answer came. Naturally he <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> at this; {{and yet he}} felt {{a little}} checked, {{even though she had}} only refrained from {{volunteering}} a reply that <b>was</b> <b>not</b> demanded.|$|R
2500|$|His friend William Tiptaft wrote, [...] "We shall preach in churches, chapels, barns, rooms, or in {{the open}} air. We shall, if the Lord {{strengthens}} us for the work, give great offence. But it is a glorious work to preach the everlasting gospel. It is the very purpose for which I was ordained. Christ will not turn us out of His Church for following His steps in preaching the gospel in every city and village. I <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if the Bishop withdraw Bulteel's license as he is only a curate." ...|$|E
2500|$|We <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at {{the lack}} of ruins in America in general. Actually the {{scarcity}} of identifiable remains in the Old World is even more impressive. In view of the nature of their civilization one should not be puzzled if the Nephites had left us no ruins at all. People underestimate the capacity of things to disappear, and do not realize that the ancients almost never built of stone. Many a great civilization which has left a notable mark in history and literature has left behind not a single recognizable trace of itself. We must stop looking for the wrong things.|$|E
2500|$|... "A light rod and reel {{would be}} a {{convenience}} in catching the pacu. We used to fish for the latter variety in the quiet pools while allowing the canoe to drift, and always saved some of the fish as bait for the big fellows. We fished for the pacu as the native does, kneading a ball of mandioc farina with water and placing it on the hook as bait. I <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised,</b> though, if it were possible, with carefully chosen flies, to catch some of the fish that {{every once in a}} while we saw rise to the surface and drag some luckless insect under." ...|$|E
60|$|Evidently to them it {{appeared}} a short and convenient cut. I <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> had the man suggested our strapping ourselves in, and then rolling over and over, carriage and all, to the bottom.|$|R
6000|$|Again {{she seemed}} to immerse herself in that {{atmosphere}} of contemplative eternity, and so strangely did it affect me that I <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> to have awaked a century or so later and found her just beginning to enunciate her reply-- ...|$|R

2500|$|Earlier {{attempts}} at reconciliation of Christianity with Newtonian mechanics appear {{quite different from}} later {{attempts at}} reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of evolution or relativity. Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a struggle for existence. These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal patterns of biological cooperation. According to John Habgood, all man really knows {{here is that the}} universe seems to be a mix of good and evil, beauty and pain, and that suffering may somehow be {{part of the process of}} creation. Habgood holds that Christians <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> that suffering may be used creatively by God, given their faith in the symbol of the Cross.|$|E

60|$|I did not {{altogether}} like her thrusting the whole responsibility, in this marked manner, on my shoulders.
