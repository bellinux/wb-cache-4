5|$|In 1803, Harrison {{began to}} lobby Congress to repeal Article Six of the Northwest Ordinance, which {{prohibited}} <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original Northwest Territory, in order permit <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indiana Territory. He claimed legalizing slavery {{was necessary to}} make the region more appealing to settlers and ultimately make the territory economically viable. That same year Harrison had indenturing legalized by the General Court. The territory was granted representation in the United States Congress in 1805, and pro-slavery Benjamin Parke became the territory's first representative. Parke used his position to get Congress to support Harrison's appeal. He was able pass legislation to have Article Six suspended for ten years, and the territories covered by the ordinance were granted the ability to legalize slavery. By the same act, Congress removed the General Court's legislative power and created a legislative council to be elected by popular vote.|$|E
5|$|Juneteenth, {{which is}} the oldest nationally celebrated {{commemoration}} of the ending of <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, owes its origins to {{the announcement of the}} Emancipation Proclamation upon the return of Union forces to Galveston in 1865. Galveston was the first city in Texas to provide a secondary school and public library for African Americans.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> 1843, <b>the</b> abolitionists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northeast {{founded the}} Northern Baptist Mission Society <b>in</b> {{opposition}} to <b>slavery.</b> <b>In</b> 1844, <b>the</b> Home Mission Society refused to ordain James E. Reeve of Georgia as a missionary {{because he was}} put forward as a slaveholder. They refused to decide on <b>the</b> basis of <b>slavery.</b> <b>In</b> May 1845, <b>in</b> Augusta, Georgia, <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> supporters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southeast broke with the Triennial Convention and founded the Southern Baptist Convention. The Triennial Baptists were concentrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northeast. <b>The</b> abolitionists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northeast inherited the Triennial Convention and the Northern Baptist Mission Society was dissolved. William Bullein Johnson joined the Southern Baptists.|$|R

5|$|Like much of {{the rest}} of French West Africa, {{authorities}} enforced explicit rules in an attempt to end <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. In 1903, the government instructed French administrators to not use slave as an administrative category anymore. This was followed in 1905 by a formal French decree that ended slavery throughout French West Africa.|$|E
5|$|Posey {{had created}} a rift in the {{politics}} of the territory by supporting slavery, much to the chagrin of opponents like Jennings, Dennis Pennington, and others who dominated the Territorial Legislature and who sought to use the bid for statehood to permanently end <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> territory.|$|E
5|$|The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery is a {{historical}} non-fiction book written by American historian Eric Foner. Published in 2010 by W. W.

25|$|Through the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 {{under the}} Congress of the Confederation, <b>slavery</b> was {{prohibited}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> territories {{northwest of the}} Ohio River; existing slaves were not freed for years, although {{they could no longer}} be sold. This was a compromise. Thomas Jefferson proposed in 1784 to end <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> territories, but his bill lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Congress by one vote. The territories south of the Ohio River (and Missouri) had authorized slavery.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> British {{prohibited}} <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> 1835, <b>the</b> {{influx of}} African workers {{did not end}} because British warships captured Arab slavers and forced the liberated slaves to work on plantations as apprentices without pay.|$|R

5|$|The {{early years}} of the 19th century once again saw an {{increased}} public interest in abolition. Since Napoleon had reintroduced <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> French colonies, support of abolition was no longer perceived as being pro-French.|$|E
5|$|The {{mayor of}} Bayamón mobilized 500 soldiers. The ringleaders and {{followers}} of the conspiracy were captured immediately. A total of 61 slaves were imprisoned in Bayamón and San Juan.

Indiana remained anti-slavery and in the American Civil War remained with the Union and contributed men to the war.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} {{election}} to Abraham Lincoln, Breckinridge worked for adoption of the Crittenden Compromise—authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden—as a means of preserving the Union. Breckinridge believed the Crittenden proposal—restoring the Missouri Compromise line as the separator between slave and free territory in exchange for stricter enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and federal non-interference with <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> territories and Washington, D.C.—was the most extreme proposal to which the South would agree. Ultimately, the compromise was rejected and the Civil War soon followed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811–1896) moved to Florida in 1867, {{she was already}} internationally famous for {{authoring}} Uncle Tom's Cabin, published as a serial between 1851 and 1852. The novel expounded upon her abolitionist views and was extraordinarily influential in condemning <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Stowe's opposition to slavery sprang from a moral passion based on her Christian faith. She had grown up {{the daughter of a}} Presbyterian minister, Lyman Beecher; seven of her brothers became ministers in Calvinist or Congregational denominations, and she married a minister.|$|E

5|$|Fictional {{accounts}} sometimes {{portray the}} rebelling slaves as ancient Roman freedom fighters, struggling {{to change a}} corrupt Roman society and to end the Roman institution of slavery.

5|$|Igbo Landing (alternatively {{written as}} Ibo Landing, Ebo Landing, or Ebos Landing) is a {{historic}} site at Dunbar Creek on St. Simons Island, Glynn County, Georgia. It was the setting of a mass suicide in 1803 by captive Igbo people who had taken control of their slave ship and refused to submit to <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. The event's moral value as a story of resistance towards slavery has symbolic importance in African American folklore and literary history.|$|E
5|$|In April 1858, Tubman was {{introduced}} to the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Although she never advocated violence against whites, she agreed with his course of direct action and supported his goals. Like Tubman, he spoke of being called by God, and trusted the divine to protect him from the wrath of slaveholders. She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter.|$|E

5|$|In July 1861, Stevens {{secured the}} passage of an act to {{confiscate}} the property, including slaves, of certain rebels. In November 1861, Stevens introduced a resolution to emancipate all slaves; it was defeated. However, legislation did pass that abolished <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> District of Columbia and in the territories. By March 1862, to Stevens's exasperation, the most Lincoln had publicly supported was gradual emancipation in the Border states, with the masters compensated by the federal government.|$|E

5|$|In {{part due}} to the ongoing violent {{political}} confrontations in the Kansas, opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act remained strong in Illinois and throughout the North. As the 1856 elections approached, Lincoln abandoned the defunct Whig Party in favor of the Republicans. He attended the May 1856 Bloomington Convention, which formally established the Illinois Republican Party. The convention platform asserted that Congress had the right to regulate <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> territories and called for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the final speech of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union. At the June 1856 Republican National Convention, Lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot, though the party nominated a ticket of John C. Frémont and William Dayton. Lincoln strongly supported the Republican ticket, campaigning for the party throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Ambassador James Buchanan, who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> territories, while the Know Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore. In the 1856 elections, Buchanan defeated both his challengers, but Frémont won several Northern states and Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor of Illinois. Though Lincoln did not himself win office, his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading Republican in Illinois.|$|E
