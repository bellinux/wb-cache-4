The epistemological framework of this study is an integrated one including both modem and postmodern approaches to the study of revictimisation. The dominant postmodern approach is that of constructivism. Both quantitative and qualitative methods of research are used to collect and analyse the data. The story of revictimisation was recounted firstly through responses to a questionnaire by a sample of coloured women within the context of a coloured community. Secondly, the unique stories of <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation</b> were re-authored through the co-author's lens in the form of themes that emerged from the stories told by each of the three narrators. The effects of <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation,</b> as well as the specific ways each narrator survived their abuse experiences was discussed. Recurring themes evident in the stories of all three narrators were elucidated in a co-constructed story of stories. A comparison between the quantitative research results, the qualitative story constructions and the literature on <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation</b> concluded the re-constructed story where the numerous stories, within either a unique, cultural or universal context, were integrated into a conceptual whole. The information gained could serve as guidelines for those working with adult survivors of child sexual abuse within a coloured context. An understanding of <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation</b> and the risk factors involved in the effects of child sexual abuse may be useful in the prevention of <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|People {{who have}} been sexually abused as {{children}} are {{two to three times}} more likely to be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood. This paper explores the complex array of variables related to <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation.</b> Abstract There is a complex array of variables related to <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation.</b> Although prevalence is difficult to ascertain, several studies relate that people {{who have been}} sexually abused as children are two to {{three times more likely to}} be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood. Much of the literature on <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation</b> focuses on the individual risk factors for the victim/survivor - their risk perception and emotional dysregulation resulting from initial sexual victimisation - and how these create vulnerability for <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation.</b> Broader contextual factors beyond the victim/survivor, however, are often ignored. These contextual factors are explored here with a particular emphasis on minority groups, such as people with a disability; gay, lesbian and bisexual people; and Indigenous people. This focus demonstrates that individual risk factors often do not account for how perpetrators may target vulnerable people who have previously been victimised, how community and organisational attitudes and norms may support <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation,</b> and how broader social norms create vulnerability for certain groups. A focus on these broader contextual factors helps to inform prevention strategies. Key messages 	People who are sexually abused in childhood are two to three times more likely to be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood. 	Individual risk factors include a history of child sexual abuse, poor risk perception, emotional dysregulation, cumulative past abuse, family conflict and distress. 	Broader contextual factors, such as perpetrator tactics, community and organisational attitudes, and social norms, are also risk factors for <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation.</b> 	Those vulnerable to <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation,</b> including minority groups such as people with a disability; gay, lesbian and bisexual people; and Indigenous people may require greater support and advocacy in order to alleviate trauma and trauma symptoms, and increase their resilience. 	Similar strategies used in the sexual violence primary prevention space may be used to prevent <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation.</b> This includes respectful relationships education, gender equity principles and a focus on important sites of social norm reproduction, such as sporting sites and the media, to convey messages of respect and equality...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{inspired}} by the processes of preparing for ethical scrutiny and seeking ethical approval {{for a series of}} studies examining causal mechanisms that might facilitate <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation.</b> The focus here is on just four of the issues that arose {{in the context of the}} first study: a web-based survey. One of the aims of the survey is to test whether victims of child sexual abuse who experienced a period of psychogenic or dissociative amnesia demonstrate an exaggerated risk for adolescent/adult sexual assault during this amnesic phase. That is, cases where survivors report ‘suddenly remembering’ in adulthood that they were abused as children, but state that prior to this ‘remembering’ they had no prior knowledge of their abuse. The study design is considered to be the first ethical issue. To enhance the methodological robustness a strategy has been employed to reduce the erroneous inclusion of currently amnesic participants in the non-abused comparison group. Secondly, consideration is given to the likely harms and benefits that might be incurred or bestowed upon the participants. Thirdly, problems of both re-traumatisation and vicarious traumatisation in relation to the researcher are contemplated and juxtaposed against the possibility of the facilitation of post-traumatic growth and a personal shift towards wisdom and generativity. Finally, the survey title was originally criticised as negating ‘fully’ informed consent and a defence is therefore offered that ultimately gained ethical approval. It is hoped that these deliberations and insights may prove useful to others in planning their own research and ethics proposals...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This study {{concerns}} resilience {{related to}} juvenile delinquency among {{victims of sexual}} abuse: sexual abuse has been recognized as a powerful risk factor {{for the emergence of}} deviant and criminal behavior. Objective: Our study aims to explore and highlight the protective factors that prevent victims of sexual abuse from engaging in a delinquent trajectory. Method: The sample consists of teenage girls who have revealed at minimum last year, their intergenerational abuse. These girls, all between 12 and 18 years old, are divided into sub-groups: the non-offender victims and the victims who are also offenders. Each teenage victim is compared to a normative population on different psychological functioning dimensions : self-esteem (Harter's self-perception profile for adolescents), aggressiveness (the Buss-Perry Aggression questionnaire) and Post-Traumatic Stress, with the Impact of Event scale-Revised, (IES-R) -Horowitz. We analyze family characteristics such as familial attachment and family climate, social characteristics such as associations with peers, and environmental factors such as reactions to revelations of sexual abuse, the presence of family and extra-familial resources, psychological care. Results and conclusion: The results show that teenage victims of sexual assault present lower self-esteem and a negative self-perception in all fields, except for the perception of their attractiveness. Over-investment of this single dimension of self-perception can lead to a sexualization of their relationships with others and expose them to the risk of <b>sexual</b> <b>revictimisation.</b> The comparative analyses between the adolescent delinquent and non-delinquent victims highlight risk factors in connection with setting them off on a delinquent trajectory and protective factors supporting their resilience. The results highlight specific characteristics to the offender juvenile victims supporting a delinquent trajectory : aggressiveness, PTSD, defensive strategy of avoidance and characteristics of abuse (chronicity of abuse). The victim committed in delinquent trajectories presented more aggressiveness, consumeristic behaviour, post-traumatic stress and defensive strategy of avoidance than non-offender victims. Delinquent behaviour, just like substance abuse, could be a strategy of risk avoidance in connection with reliving sexual trauma, which hinders the process of resilience. Compared to the process of resilience, immediate and differed paternal support (during and after the revelations) seems the most important factor of protection. Being able to benefit from psychological councelling and having an extra-familial resource (a significant relationship with someone in the social environment) also constitute factors that support the resilience of these teenagers and prevent them from going down the path of delinquency. The interventions should aim at establishing a therapeutic alliance with these young girls during the early process of revealing the sexual abuse and mobilize and activate the support of the father (when he is not the abuser) or of a meaningful paternal figure as early as possible during the revealing phase and to accompany him in this restructuring function.
