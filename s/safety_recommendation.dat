5|$|On 2 May 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{issued a}} <b>Safety</b> <b>Recommendation</b> {{document}} that included an interim {{summary of the}} investigation to date, {{as well as some}} immediate safety recommendations that the NTSB believes should be implemented by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to enhance flight safety. The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) outage, unknown to its flight crew prior to the collision, according to the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR):Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the collision avoidance system in the Legacy airplane was not functioning {{at the time of the}} accident, thereby disabling the system's ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR data indicate that the flight crew was unaware that the collision avoidance system was not functioning until after the accident.|$|E

[...] Based {{on the results of}} investigations within its jurisdiction, the NTSB issues formal <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> to agencies and institutions with the power to implement those recommendations. [...] The NTSB considers <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> to be its primary tool for preventing future civil transportation accidents. [...] However, the NTSB does not have the authority to enforce its <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations.</b>|$|R

25|$|Indeed, {{the need}} to issue <b>Safety</b> <b>Recommendation</b> 2008-009, {{affecting}} all 777 airframes which had yet to incorporate the Boeing Service Bulletin (SB 777-28-0025) – {{as was the case}} with G-YMMM – was given as the main reason for issuing the first special bulletin, well before the accident investigation itself was complete.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2012, the TAIC {{released}} an urgent <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> after investigators found apparent anomalies {{in the maintenance}} of the crash balloon. The recommendation to the Civil Aviation Authority recommended that they urgently check the maintenance practices and airworthiness, especially in relation to the inspection of burners, fuel systems and envelopes, and maintenance record-keeping, of the other 74 hot air balloons registered in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{were also}} carried out {{that showed that}} aircrew could have {{difficulty}} recognising that incorrect data had been entered in avionic equipment resulting in poor take-off performance. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has issued a <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> to the United States Federal Aviation Administration and a safety advisory notice to the International Air Transport Association and the Flight Safety Foundation. In addition Airbus are investigating the development of software to help pilots recognise unusual or poor performance on take-off.|$|E

25|$|The {{inflated}} {{escape slide}} blocked both forward doors from {{being used to}} evacuate the aircraft, and prevented two flight attendants seated on the forward jumpseat from assisting the evacuation. There was no fire, but had there been a fire, this malfunctioning slide would have dramatically affected the survivability of the occupants. As {{a result of this}} occurrence, the NTSB issued a <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> to replace the slide cover latch brackets on forward slide compartments of all older Boeing 737 models with the latch brackets installed on later models.|$|E
25|$|On 11 March 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board issued urgent <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> SB-09-11 {{calling for}} the {{redesign}} of the fuel-oil heat exchangers used on Rolls-Royce Trent 800 Series engines. A build-up of ice from water naturally occurring in the fuel had caused a restriction {{of the flow of}} fuel to the engines of G-YMMM. Rolls-Royce had already started on redesigning the component, with an in-service date of March 2010 at the latest. All affected engines were to be fitted with the redesigned component within six months of its certification. In May 2010 the Airworthiness Directive was extended to cover the Trent 500 and 700 series engines as well.|$|E
25|$|The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} benefit of requiring upper torso restraints (UTR, i.e., shoulder harnesses) in passenger seats of aircraft weighing less than 5,670kg in response to a <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> arising from the investigation of a 1999 accident involving a Cessna Titan near Glasgow. As a result of that study, the CAA changed its regulations to require shoulder harnesses for passengers on all aircraft registered after February 1, 1989, if that aircraft has a maximum takeoff weight of 5,700 or less and 9 passenger seats or fewer. The CAA also forwarded a recommendation to the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) of Europe, recommending that European regulators adopt a similar standard. However, {{at the time of the}} Loganair accident, the JAA had not acted on the recommendation. Although the UK regulation covered the accident aircraft (it was first certified in May, 1989), Loganair had obtained an exemption from the CAA concerning this issue.|$|E

25|$|On 24 August 2010, an Airbus A321-231 (registration G-MEDJ) {{en route}} from Khartoum to Beirut as flight BD996 {{suffered}} a serious electrical malfunction which caused the intermittent failure of the captain and co-pilot's electronic displays together with the uncommanded application of left rudder trim. The latter caused the aircraft to stray 20 nautical miles off course. The aircraft was cruising at 36,000ft at the time, with both autopilot and autothrust engaged. The captain ultimately disengaged both and flew the aircraft manually, landing in Beirut without further mishap. Airbus indicated that an electrical power interruption had occurred which had caused a reset of the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC). Such an event may cause a small incremental offset of the rudder trim, according to the aircraft manufacturer. The Air Accidents Investigations Board (AAIB) subsequently issued <b>Safety</b> <b>Recommendation</b> 2010-092, recommending that Airbus alert all operators of A320 series aircraft {{of the possibility that}} an electrical malfunction may not be clearly annunciated on the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitoring system (ECAM) and that such an event may lead to an uncommanded input of rudder trim.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the four}} {{children}} deemed {{too young to}} require seats of their own ("lap children"), one died from smoke inhalation. The NTSB added a <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> to the FAA on its [...] "List of Most Wanted Safety Improvements" [...] in May 1999 suggesting a requirement for children under 2 to be safely restrained, which was removed in November 2006. The accident sparked a campaign led by United Flight 232's senior flight attendant, Jan Brown Lohr, for all children to have seats on aircraft. [...] Though {{it is no longer}} on the [...] "most wanted" [...] list, aircraft restraints for children under 2 is still recommended practice by the NTSB and FAA, though it is not required by the FAA as of May 2016. [...] The NTSB asked the International Civil Aviation Organization to make this a requirement in September 2013.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this accident, the AAIB issued <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> 2006-101 (regarding {{shoulder}} harnesses) and a copy of their earlier study to the JAA and to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which would take over from the JAA as the primary European regulatory body {{over a period of several}} years, beginning before the accident. While considering this recommendation, the EASA took the interim step of issuing its own Safety Information Bulletin (SIB 2008-24), which advised the air transport community of the CAA's earlier study and of the benefits of shoulder harnesses. In 2011, the EASA published its opinion that the requirement recommended by the AAIB following the Loganair accident that shoulder harnesses should be mandatory for each passenger seat in all commercial air transport aircraft weighing less than 5,700kg, regardless of when the aircraft was first registered. The European Commission accepted the EASA opinion, and [...] new regulations requiring shoulder harnesses as described in the AAIB's <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> 2006-101 became law for commercial air transport operators in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 November 2008, Delta Air Lines Flight 18 from Shanghai to Atlanta {{experienced}} an [...] "uncommanded rollback" [...] of one engine while in cruise at 39,000 feet. The crew followed manual recovery procedures {{and the flight}} continued without incident. The US NTSB assigned one of the investigators {{who worked on the}} BA Flight 38 investigation to this incident, and looked specifically for any similarity between the two incidents. The NTSB <b>Safety</b> <b>Recommendation</b> report concluded that ice clogging the FOHE was the likely cause. [...] The evidence was stronger in this case since data from the flight data recorder allowed the investigators to locate where the fuel flow was restricted.|$|E

2500|$|The {{other two}} safety {{recommendations}} (2006-102 and 2006-103, requiring two pilots on all air ambulance flights and requiring radar altimeters or other height-sensing devices on single-pilot air-transport aircraft) were {{addressed to the}} CAA and the JAA only. The JAA responded in 2007 with a letter saying the JAA was [...] "no longer {{in a position to}} undertake any work on these topics and responsibility must now lie with EASA." [...] Later that year the AAIB wrote to the EASA to request that they consider safety recommendations 2006-102 and 2006-103 as well. (<b>Safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> 2006-101 had already been addressed to the EASA, so no further action was required.) The EASA responded in 2009 that it had accepted both recommendations into its 4-year Rulemaking Programme. However, the recommendations were passed from one 4-Year Rulemaking Programme to the next. The 2013–2016 EASA status report on its 4-year Rulemaking Programme indicates they expect to issue an opinion on 2006-102 (requiring two pilots on air ambulance flights) by 2019 and a decision by 2020. An opinion on 2006-103 (requiring automatic height-sensing devices) is scheduled to be given by 2018, with a decision made by 2019.|$|E
