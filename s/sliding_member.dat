The {{aircraft}} then {{came to rest on}} the left wing and suffered substantial damage. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service. The cause of the accident was that a hammer, lodged between the inboard drag strut and <b>sliding</b> <b>member,</b> caused the landing gear to collapse.|$|E
40|$|The {{apparatus}} comprises {{a cooling}} body (31) having a convex cooling surface (32) as a perimeter, a unit for guiding a band-shaped substrate {{such that the}} substrate partially encircles the convex cooling surface at a contact area, and openings distributed over the contact area of the cooling surface and extend through the cooling surface into a cooling body. A first subset of openings extends inside a first channel in the cooling body, which opens end face of the cooling body, and a second subset of the openings extends into a second channel within the cooling body. The apparatus comprises a cooling body (31) having a convex cooling surface (32) as a perimeter, a unit for guiding a band-shaped substrate such that the substrate partially encircles the convex cooling surface at a contact area, and openings distributed over the contact area of the cooling surface and extend through the cooling surface into a cooling body. A first subset of openings extends inside a first channel in the cooling body, which opens end face of the cooling body, a second subset of the openings extends into a second channel within the cooling body, which opens the end face of the cooling body, and a third subset of the openings extends into a third channel within the cooling body, which opens one end face of the cooling body. The first subset of openings and the third subset of the openings are arranged in a direction of movement of the substrate. The apparatus further comprises a first unit for providing a fluid such that the fluid flows through the first channel to the cooling body, and a second unit for pumping the fluid from the second channel and the third channel. The convex cooling surface {{is part of a}} fixed mold shoulder. The cooling body is designed as cylindrical cooling roll or as cylindrical cooling drum. A stationary <b>sliding</b> <b>member</b> (36) is arranged on an end face the cylindrical cooling body, is rotated about a cylindrical axis of the cylindrical cooling body, and comprises a connecting unit for supplying the fluid into the first channel, and a connecting unit for pumping the fluid from the second channel and the third channel. The <b>sliding</b> <b>member</b> further comprises a sealing element, which is firmly connected with the <b>sliding</b> <b>member</b> on a side. The sealing element comprises a sliding mechanical contact with a front end of the cooling body, and plastics. The apparatus further comprises a mechanical spring element, which presses the <b>sliding</b> <b>member</b> against {{the front end of the}} cooling body. The first, second and third channels extend from top to opposite front end of the cooling body and extend parallel to the cylinder axis of the cooling body. The cooling surface has apertures at its edge...|$|E
30|$|A bellow is a {{variable}} volume vessel. In previous work, {{we used a}} cylinder, but this structure has a <b>sliding</b> <b>member</b> in its body. As a result, there was much friction when it was being driven and the working fluid also leaked. Considering the application of our actuator to high temperature environments, we surmised that these issues would be a bottleneck. Consequently, we designed the bellow to be driven without friction because the expansion and contraction characteristics of a bellow are produced by its distinctive structure. In addition, the chamber also includes the spring properties itself.|$|E

Whereas Hinterland was a five-piece rock band, however, the Hope Slide leans more toward the electronic end of things, albeit with all the moody dream-pop atmospherics for which Lucas and Galloway are known.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{utilization of}} polymers in <b>sliding</b> <b>members</b> has triggered much {{research on the}} enhancement of surface quality and tribological performance. In this regard, no work has considered the application of roller burnishing as a new surface treatment method for polymeric surfaces. The present work aims to investigate the influence of burnishing feed and roller contact width on the sliding friction and wear performance of acetal homopolymer and polyurethane. Dry and lubricated sliding conditions for both parallel and crossed burnished orientations were considered. The results revealed that low burnishing feed rate and smaller roller contact width led to a decrease in coefficient of friction for both polymers while improvement in the wear resistance was observed. Hence, it can be suggested that the roller burnishing process has high potential as a valuable polymer surface treatment technique...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} to produce reliable quantitative information about adhesive wear phenomena of metallic materials in the early stage of dry sliding. The outcome of this study {{will contribute to the}} refinement of the physical model of a wear mechanism. A devised technical method was employed in the study to enable data acquisition linked with the position of measurement on the specimen and objective combinational analyses of plural kinds of tribological data. Quantitative analyses on the relationship between friction force and specimen displacement perpendicular to the sliding surface was carried out. Data analyses on the self-mated dry sliding of austenitic stainless steel clarified the existence of several elemental processes of adhesive mechanism with quantitative parameters such as the growth rate and the size of adhesive substances generated at the interface between <b>sliding</b> <b>members.</b> The influences of the relative humidity (RH) in an atmospheric air on the numerical parameters were revealed as well and they were interpreted into the physical model of the adhesive wear mechanism...|$|R

A user retracts a foreign body capturing device including a handle, rim, and net into the elongate bore by sliding a thumb-engagable control member in a first direction. The device is extended by <b>sliding</b> the control <b>member</b> in a second direction opposite to the first. The rim is formed of a material having memory so that it expands into an elliptical shape when extended from the elongate bore. The net depends from the rim and is used to capture intraocular foreign bodies. Gradual curves at the trailing end of the rim facilitate its re-entry into the elongate bore when a foreign body is captured in the net. The incision in the eye is small...|$|R
50|$|The Bay Area Electric Railroad Association {{was started}} {{by a group of}} San Francisco Bay Area rail fans in 1946. The group was {{specifically}} interested in electric traction, more than main line railroads. Other groups such as the California/Nevada Historical Society usually had meetings and excursions on main line subjects. BAERA held monthly social meetings, frequently showing <b>members</b> <b>slides</b> and movies to the group. The BAERA also had excursions on the many street car lines and Interurbans in the Bay Area. As a result of an excursion over the Key System the Association purchased Key System 271 a wooden street car that had started out in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania. Soon other cars were given by members or purchased for the Association. These included Sacramento Northern 62, a Birney street car built in 1920. The car ran local service in Chico, California until 1947 and had the last 5-cent fare in the State of California.|$|R
5000|$|Rack slides are {{specifically}} intended for mounting equipment into 19-inch racks or 23-inch racks. These can be friction bearing, ball bearing, or roller bearing. They are sized {{to fit into}} racks with mounting flanges on the ends to mate to the mounting holes in racks. In some cases, one mounting flange is formed into the rack slide with an adapter bracket attached {{to the other end}} to accommodate different depths of the rack. The outer fixed member is attached to the rack and the inner moving member is generally screwed {{to the side of the}} mounted equipment. Rack slides are typically compound or 3-part slides allowing full extension of the mounted equipment and generally include provision for <b>sliding</b> the inner <b>member</b> completely free to allow removal of the equipment from the rack. They can also include stops to prevent accidentally pulling the equipment out of the rack without releasing the stop mechanism.|$|R
3000|$|Yevtushenko et al. [10] {{proved that}} the results from {{measurements}} agree well with predictions from finite element method (FEM) simulations of brake discs. Grzes et al. [11] proposed a numerical–experimental scheme {{for the analysis of}} temperature in a railway braking system based on FEM model results, which included brake disc–brake pad contact surfaces and interface heat distribution. Adamowicz and [...] Grzes [12] evaluated the impact of the convective mode of heat transfer on the thermal behaviour of a disc brake system during repetitive braking at constant velocity using a fully three-dimensional FEM model and investigated the issue of non-uniform frictional heating effects. The highlights from [12] can be confirmed by the FEM simulations performed in this paper. In another study, Adamowicz and Grzes [13] studied and compared the temperature distributions caused by mutual <b>sliding</b> of two <b>members</b> of the disc brake system using two- and three-dimensional FEM modelling techniques; they concluded that FEM simulations enable temperature variations in a real brake disc to be predicted. Belhocine et al. [4] analysed the thermal behaviour of full and ventilated brake discs of vehicles; numerical simulation of the coupled transient thermal field and stress field was carried out by a sequential thermal-structural coupled method and the results obtained by the simulation were satisfactory compared with those from the literature.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper aims {{to study}} and compare the {{temperature}} distributions caused by mutual <b>sliding</b> of two <b>members</b> of the disc brake system basing on two- and three-dimensional FE modeling techniques {{and complexity of the}} phenomenon. First step of the analysis based on the previously developed model where the intensity of heat flux was assumed to be uniformly distributed on the friction surface of disc during braking process, and the heat is transferred exclusively in axial direction, whereas during the second, the three-dimensional rotor is subjected to the non-axisymmetric thermal load to simulate realistic thermal behaviour of the brake action. Operation conditions, thermo-physical properties of materials and dimensions of the brake system were adopted from the real representation of the braking process of the passenger vehicle. Arbitrarily selected four values of the velocities at the moment of brake engagement were applied to the models so as to investigate theirs influence on the obtained solutions of the temperature evolutions on the contact surface of the disc volume referring to two separated finite element analysis. The large amount of heat generated at the pad/disc interface during emergency braking indisputably evokes non-uniform temperature distributions in the domain of the rotor, whereas the pad element is constantly heated during mutual sliding. The obtained results of the original code of three-dimensional modeling technique implemented to the conventional FE software revel high agreement with the solution of simplified process of friction heating...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} contrasted two {{measures}} of psychological androgyny, the Bem Sex-Role Inventory and the Personal Attributes Questionnaire, {{in terms of}} experimental subjects 2 ̆ 7 bipolar ratings of four gestures (pointing, touching, standing over, and invading another 2 ̆ 7 s personal space). This perceptual task partially replicated {{a study conducted by}} N. Henley in 1977 dealing with the communication (through nonverbal behavior) of power differences between the sexes. This study examined whether an individual 2 ̆ 7 s classification on either androgyny measure was related to the latter 2 ̆ 7 s submissiveness-dominance and asexuality-sexuality ratings of photographic <b>slides</b> depicting <b>members</b> of a dyad enacting various combinations of the gestures targeted for study (see above). It also examined the relationship of one 2 ̆ 7 s score on a sex-role attitudes questionnaire (Attitudes Toward Feminism Scale) to her/his perceptual ratings and androgyny classification. The present study thus afforded an opportunity to determine whether Henley 2 ̆ 7 s research findings could be replicated and to contrast two popular measures of androgyny in terms of behavior previously found to differentiate the sexes. Eighty female and 50 male University of Windsor undergraduate students participated in this project. Statistical analyses of their responses revealed that Henley 2 ̆ 7 s findings were, in large measure, replicated. Subjects generally rated the targeted gestures as dominance gestures and gave them significantly higher dominance ratings when combined in a model 2 ̆ 7 s pose. Both sexes gave gestures enacted by a man higher dominance ratings than those by a woman and they gave gestures by a woman to a man higher sexuality ratings than gestures by a man to a woman. Sex of subject was not a distinguishing variable in these results nor was androgyny classification nor subjects 2 ̆ 7 classification on the Attitudes Toward Feminism Scale. Correlations among the above three 2 ̆ 2 subject 2 ̆ 2 variables were also examined and differences between subjects 2 ̆ 7 classifications on the two androgyny scales were discussed.
