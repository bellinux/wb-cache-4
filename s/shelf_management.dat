This strategy is flexible and efficient, as it can address both linear and nonlinear problems of realistic size while achieving near-optimal solutions through easily implemented algorithms in reasonable timescales.

However <b>shelf</b> space <b>management</b> models have up to now assumed that replenishment systems are efficient and that replenishment costs are not decision relevant.

40|$|<b>Shelf</b> <b>management</b> is {{a crucial}} task in retailing. Because of {{the large number of}} {{products}} found in most retail stores (sometimes more than 60 [*] 000), current shelf space management models can only solve sub-problems of the overall store optimization problem, since the size of the complete optimization problem would be prohibitively large. Consequently, an optimal allocation of store shelf space to products has not yet been achieved. We show that a hierarchical decomposition technique, consisting of two interwoven models, is suitable to overcome this limitation and, thus, is capable of finding accurate solutions to very large and complex shelf space management problems. We further conclude that other important variables (such as product-price) can be included into the methodology and their optimal values can be determined using the same solution technique. Our methodology is illustrated on a real-life application where we predict a 22. 33 % increase in store profits if our model's solution is implemented. ...|$|E

The importance of these dependencies is further shown by the substantive profit gains we obtain with our proposed shelf optimization approach. The basis of our model is a standard sales equation that explains sales using item-specific marketing effect parameters and intercepts. In a Hierarchical Bayes (HB) fashion, we augment this model with a second layer that relates the effect parameters to shelf and SKU descriptors. We also take into account potential endogeneity of facings. After estimating the parameters of the two-level model using Bayesian methodology, we carefully investigate the dependencies of SKU sales and SKU marketing effectiveness on the shelf layout. Next, we search for the shelf arrangement that maximizes the expected total profit using simulated annealing (SA). We appear to be able to increase profits for all the stores analyzed, and our approach appears to outperform well-known rules of thumb. <b>shelf</b> <b>management,</b> sales models, Hierarchical Bayes, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, simulated annealing...|$|E

Stakeholders include federal and provincial departments, aboriginal communities, municipal and local planning authorities, ocean industry and resource use sectors, coastal communities, environmental interest groups, and university researchers. This large ocean management area possesses important living and non-living marine resources, high biological productivity and diversity, and increasing levels of multiple use and competition for ocean space and resources. The ESSIM vision is to achieve environmental, economic, social/community, and institutional sustainability in the eastern Scotian Shelf. The ESSIM Initiative is building a collaborative planning process that involves all interested and affected parties. Ongoing information sharing and dialogue with stakeholder groups is providing capacity building and important input to current proposals for a collaborative planning structure and the ocean management plan. A joint federal-provincial working group has been established to move the Initiative forward within government and to address policy and regulatory coordination for ocean management. The future ocean management plan will include a balanced set of environmental, social, economic and institutional objectives, indicators and management strategies, as well as spatial and temporal planning approaches to address multiple ocean use.
