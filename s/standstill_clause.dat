40|$|The Association with Turkey entered {{its final}} stage with the {{establishment}} of the Customs Union regarding free movement of goods; 1 the instruments of the transitional stage, however, are the ones that govern the free movement of workers, services and establishment, namely the two Association Council Decisions adopted in 1980 and the Additional Protocol (AP) to the Association Agreement. 2 There have been developments facilitating free movement in these latter areas for the last 15 years. 3 However, these developments were not triggered by the adoption of new Association Council Decisions or Protocols, but merely by the removal of obstacles that had been introduced contrary to the standstill obligation in these areas. 4 Genc is also such a case. It concerns a Danish Law introduced in 2004 that makes family reunification more difficult for children whose parents do not apply for reunification within the two-year period following the date on which they obtain permanent residence in Denmark. The ECJ delivered a judgment on another family reunification case two years ago. Dogan concerned a family reunification measure introduced by Germany (the requirement to pass a German language test in the country oforigin) in contravention to the <b>standstill</b> <b>clause</b> on freedom of establishment (Art. 41 (1) AP). 5 The Court ruled that such a measure constituted a “new restriction” under the <b>standstill</b> <b>clause</b> and that Germany was not able to justify it, because it was disproportionate and went beyond what was necessary to achieve the aim of “preventing forced marriages and the promotion of integration”. 6 Dogan was the first case in which the Court established that family reunification fell within the scope of a <b>standstill</b> <b>clause,</b> and the Danish court and government sought to challenge that finding so as to prevent it from becoming established case law. They asked the ECJ to reconsider its judgment in light of its recent case law (in particular Ziebell and Demirkan), 7 in which it adopted a more restrictive approach to interpreting provisions of Association Law, after discarding the previously acknowledged objective of accession and replacing it with an “exclusively economic” one. At the request of the Danish Government, the Court delivered the judgment in a Grand Chamber. It in fact confirmed not only that family reunification fell within the scope of the standstill clauses, but also the changing nature or softening of those clauses. While these clauses were initially interpreted as clauses containing an absolute prohibition on “new restrictions”, under the new line of case law, they are much softer, allowing for derogations and justifications replicating those under the EU free movement rules...|$|E
40|$|The New Requirements Imposed by EU Member States to the Reunification of Third-country Children for a Potential Successful Integration: A View {{from the}} EU Court of Justice The recent trend of {{immigration}} laws in EU member States {{is to add}} new and more stringent conditions on third-country children family reunification in order to enable a foreseeable successful integration. Recently, the legitimacy of these conditions has been examined by the EU Court of Justice {{in the light of}} its <b>standstill</b> <b>clause</b> jurisprudence evaluating whether the new integration conditions may be justified by an “overriding reason in the public interest”. This contribution analyses the assessments stemming from the Court’s decision which may have important repercussions also on the application of others UE Directives on family reunification. Furthermore, it has also implications on the right of family reunification, as enshrined in Article 8 ECHR, and {{in the light of the}} best interests of the child protected by the International Convention of 198...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary An {{underlying}} {{phenomenon of}} international trade in goods {{is that none of}} it does occur without an aspect of services rendered to the process. In regional trade agreements, significant market opening commitments are made between parties than done under the multilateral context. Under the economic partnership agreement (EPA) between the European Union and East African countries (EAC), the EU, the world’s most competitive services exporter, will be eagerly looking to gain substantial new opportunities in EAC services sectors than the EAC countries have committed at the WTO. And, to guarantee that new barriers will not be introduced in sectors that have not been committed or opened in the EAC EPA, the EU will most likely insist on including a <b>standstill</b> <b>clause</b> in the agreement. This paper explores some of the options which EAC countries and the EU should consider in moving forward the discussion on services liberalisation as part of their EPA. Although there is more scope to expand the contribution of trade in services to development of EAC countries, this can only happen under a competitive and well regulated environment. However, the limited level of regulatory development and lack of functional competition law in the EAC countries; the limited competitiveness of local service providers; and, the limited knowledge on the readiness of services sectors for liberalisation, all suggest that the EAC should move forward cautiously on liberalising their services sector t...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Today, it {{is known}} that the {{association}} law between Turkey and the Community grants rights to Turkish citizens which are legally enforceable before the national authorities and courts of the Member States, thanks to the decisions of the Court of Justice. Recent years have witnessed a number of cases before the Court regarding the standstill provisions in association law relating to workers {{on the one hand and}} freedom of establishment and to provide services on the other. One striking example is the Soysal case, which paved the way for certain Turkish nationals to travel to Germany without a visa. Therefore, there is a strong need to explore the exact boundaries of the abovementioned <b>standstill</b> <b>clauses.</b> This paper examines the nature, scope and effects of these standstill provisions...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the concept}} of {{ecological}} restoration has risen to the fore in international and regional biodiversity policies as a newly coined tool for the intentional recovery of degraded ecosystems. The EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 has also embraced ecological restoration and translated it into an ambitious target to restore 15 % of the degraded ecosystems in the EU. Although the concrete delineation of these recent policies remains uncertain, to say the least, {{it is obvious that}} the EU Nature Directives will play a crucial role in achieving these restoration targets. In recent years, the relevance of the non-regression or <b>standstill</b> <b>clause</b> contained in Article 6 (2) of the Habitats Directive – which does not seem to focus on recovery but rather on avoiding additional losses in Natura 2000 sites – to achieving these objectives has gained considerable traction. This paper argues that taking into account recent CJEU case-law developments and the lack of proper enforcement of conservation duties during the past two decades, Article 6 (2) of the Habitats Directive will be a major catalyst for the implementation of more robust recovery policies, especially in cases of previous non-compliance with the conservation duties that EU Member States have regarding the Natura 2000 Network. Its legal teeth allow it to bolster recovery and remediation programmes across the EU, tackling past, interim and ongoing biodiversity losses in the context of the Natura 2000 Network, and to remove bothersome obstacles that stand in the way of further restoration...|$|E
