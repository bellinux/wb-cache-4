40|$|Climate change, {{industrial}} development, and thawing of permafrost all {{contribute to}} a rapidly changing Arctic, {{especially in terms of}} exposure of wildlife to contaminants. Migratory birds, the most widely distributed and abundant taxon present in the Arctic, may be ideal bioindicators to monitor contaminants and establish baselines from which future changes may be determined. I conducted two studies to determine contaminant levels and factors influencing them, measure toxicity using established thresholds and by testing blood-based biomarkers for relationships to varying trace element levels, and determine the relative sources of elements in five species of sea ducks which breed along the northern coast of Alaska: the long-tailed duck, and Steller’s, spectacled, king, and common eiders. The first study focused on levels of Se, Cd, Cu, Hg, and Pb in liver and kidneys in collected carcasses, with an emphasis on determining the patterns of variation among species, sexes (adult males versus females), and age classes (adults versus juveniles). Trace element concentrations were explained reasonably well by between-species differences in body mass, with smaller long-tailed ducks from Prudhoe Bay and Steller’s eiders from Barrow having similar concentrations of elements, and higher levels in larger species. Levels were also negatively associated with mass-specific metabolic rate and migration distance, with small long-tailed ducks and Steller’s eiders having high metabolic rates and longer migration distance. Adult male <b>spectacled</b> <b>eiders</b> had exceptionally high Se, Cd, and Cu, with Cu levels being among the highest reported for any wild bird. Pb was highest in female common eiders and juvenile long-tailed ducks, emphasizing a potential exposure risk at Prudhoe Bay, where both were sampled. Hg showed variation not explained by metabolism, migration distance, or body mass, perhaps due to local variation in exposure on breeding sites. My second study attempted to address similar questions, but with an emphasis on blood of incubating females and juveniles, and to address potential biases associated with biomonitoring in these species. The relevance of bioindicators to related taxa is assumed, but rarely tested. Common eiders are a widely-used indicator of marine environments, but few studies compare them to other species. I tested the levels of elements, their relationships to blood-based health metrics (biomarkers), and determined whether blood and feathers of the same individuals provide consistent information. Similar to my first study, levels of elements were similar in blood of long-tailed duck and Steller’s eiders, as well as between <b>spectacled</b> and king <b>eiders,</b> but common eiders had levels similar to one group or intermediate between them. Biomarker responses, however, were not consistent with element concentrations, with <b>spectacled</b> and common <b>eiders</b> having similar responses, and Steller’s and king eiders, despite differing body mass and element concentrations. Levels of Pb, and the proportion of birds sampled exceeding toxic levels, were greatest at Barrow and lower at two reference sites, emphasizing the anthropogenic source of Pb, similar to results of my first study, but in a different set of tissues. In no species were the element concentrations and biomarker responses consistent, demonstrating that use of one species to infer information on elements exposure and effects in another is not always suitable. These studies emphasized two species of particular conservation concern, the threatened Steller’s and <b>spectacled</b> <b>eiders,</b> as well as three related species. I provide baseline information on trace element concentrations in four tissue types widely used for biomonitoring of trace elements (blood, feather, liver, and kidney), and caution future biomonitoring efforts using surrogate or indicator species, as the element concentrations in sympatric species, the associations with biomarkers, and number exceeding threshold concentrations of select elements vary greatly among species. Future biomonitoring should focus on species of interest to reduce bias and better inform management decisions regarding trace elements...|$|R

The sandgrouse is a species that has adapted to desert living: its breast feathers are capable of absorbing water, which it can pass on to its young. The crab plover also nests in the sand, and burrows until it finds a comfortable temperature. Birds that choose remote places can proliferate hugely, like the flamingos on an African soda lake. Meanwhile, during winter, the entire world population of <b>spectacled</b> <b>eiders</b> {{can be found in}} just a few assemblies on patches of the Arctic Ocean.

In North America, purple martins have become totally dependent on humans for their nest sites. Attenborough highlights man's influence by describing the Pacific island of Guam, whose bird population was wiped out following the accidental introduction of brown tree snakes during the 1940s. Examples of species that were hunted to extinction are the huia, the great auk and, most famously, the dodo.

Selenium concentrations in livers of nesting white-winged scoters were high; however, the eggs they laid contained less selenium than expected based on relationships for freshwater bird species. Histological evaluation found a high prevalence of hepatocellular vacuolation (49 %), a degenerative change frequently associated with sublethal toxic insult.

Except for the two isolated Southern Hemisphere species, all of the sea ducks have considerable sexual dimorphism in plumage. Males in breeding plumage are usually elaborately patterned, often with predominantly black and white markings, which probably serve very well to localize and identify these birds at considerable distances in their marine environments. However, iridescent coloration is generally limited to the head, and the wing speculum patterns, instead of being iridescent, are generally white and black. Nesting is usually done on fairly open shoreline or in grassy tundra, as in the eiders and long-tailed duck, or in cavities, under heavy brush, or in similar well-concealed locations, as in the goldeneyes, mergansers, and harlequin duck. Females of the ground-nesting forms approach the patterns found among female dabbling ducks in their cryptic coloration, and the downy young of these species are also rather brownish and obscurely patterned.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Steller’s eider (Polysticta stellen] is {{apparently}} extinct as a breeding bird on the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) delta, {{one of two}} areas in Alaska where it was a regular breeder. Once considered a common breeding bird on the Y-K delta, {{it has not been}} found nesting since 1975, despite recent extensive geographic coverage of waterfowl habitats and ground searches of historically important nesting areas. The Y-K delta was the only known subarctic breeding area in the species ’ range. Size of the former population and reasons for its disappearance are unclear, but possible factors responsible for the decline include changes in patterns of movement and increased mortality resulting from overharvest, predation, habitat change, weather, and reduction in food. The Steller’s eider is now considered a rare species in the Yakutsk Republic, U. S. S. R., {{the center of the world}} breeding range. The North American population is now restricted to a small geographical area near Barrow and it has not yet received special consideration or protection comparable to that in the U. S. S. R. Because most of the world population breeds in the U. S. S. R. and winters in Alaska, effective conservation of the species will require cooperation at the international level.

40|$|Delineating {{protected}} areas for sensitive species {{is a growing}} challenge as changing climate alters the geographic pattern of habitats as well as human responses to those shifts. When human impacts are expected within projected ranges of threatened species, there is often demand to demarcate the minimum habitat required to ensure the species 2 ̆ 7 persistence. Because diminished or wide-ranging populations may not occupy all viable (and needed) habitat at once, one must identify thresholds of resources that will support the species even in unoccupied areas. Long-term data on the shifting mosaic of critical resources may indicate ranges of future variability. We addressed these issues for the <b>Spectacled</b> <b>Eider</b> (Somateria fischeri), a federally threatened species that winters in pack ice of the Bering Sea. Changing climate has decreased ice cover and severely reduced the eiders 2 ̆ 7 benthic prey and has increased prospects for expansion of bottom trawling that may further affect prey communities. To assess long-term changes in habitats that will support eiders, we linked data on benthic prey, sea ice, and weather from 1970 to 2001 with a spatially explicit simulation model of eider energy balance that integrated field, laboratory, and remote-sensing studies. Areas estimated to have prey densities adequate for eiders in 1970 – 1974 did not include most areas that were viable 20 years later (1993 – 1994). Unless the entire area with adequate prey in 1993 – 1994 had been protected, the much reduced viable area in 1999 – 2001 {{might well have been}} excluded. During long non-foraging periods (as at night), eiders can save much energy by resting on ice vs. floating on water; thus, loss of ice cover in the future might substantially decrease the area in which prey densities are adequate to offset the eiders 2 ̆ 7 energy needs. For wide-ranging benthivores such as eiders, our results emphasize that fixed {{protected areas}} based on current conditions can be too small or inflexible to subsume long-term shifts in habitat conditions. Better knowledge of patterns of natural disturbance experienced by prey communities, and appropriate allocation of human disturbance over seasons or years, may yield alternative strategies to large-scale closures that may be politically and economically problemati...|$|E
40|$|The 21 {{species of}} sea ducks {{are one of}} the larger subgroups (Tribe Mergini) of the {{waterfowl}} family Anatidae, and the 16 species (one historically extinct) that are native to North America represent the largest number to be found on any continent, and also the largest number of endemic sea duck species native to any continent. Although generally not important as game birds, the sea ducks include some economically important birds such as the eiders, the basis for the Arctic eiderdown industry and a historically important food source for some Native American cultures. They also include what is probably the most northerly breeding species of all waterfowl and an icon of Arctic bird life, the long-tailed duck. The sea ducks also include species having some of the most complex and diverse pair-forming postural and acoustic displays of all waterfowl (goldeneyes and bufflehead), and some of the deepest diving species of all waterfowl (scoters and long-tailed duck). Sea ducks are highly prone to population disasters caused by oil spills and other water contaminants and, like other seabirds, are among the first bird groups that are being affected by current global warming trends in polar regions. This book is an effort to summarize succinctly our current knowledge of sea duck biology and to provide a convenient survey of the vast technical literature on the group, with over 900 literature references. It also includes 90, 000 words of text (more than 40 percent of which is new), 15 updated range maps, 11 black 2 ̆ 6 white and 20 color photographs, over 30 ink drawings, and nearly 150 sketches. Lastly, the North American sea ducks include the now extinct Labrador duck, the only northern hemisphere waterfowl species to have gone extinct in modern times. I have gratefully reprinted a Labrador duck watercolor by Sir Peter Scott. Considering recent population crashes in other sea ducks, such as the Steller’s eider and <b>spectacled</b> <b>eider,</b> it should also offer a sobering reminder of the fragility of our natural world and its inhabitants, including us. doi: 10. 13014 /K 22 Z 13 FS[URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{species of}} {{waterfowl}} breeding in North America have distribution patterns that collectively reflect the past geologic and ecological histories of this continent. In general, our waterfowl species {{may be grouped}} into those that are limited (endemic) to North America, those that are shared between North and South America, {{and those that are}} shared with Europe and/or Asia. Of the forty-four species known to breed in continental North America, the resulting grouping of breeding distributions is as follows: Limited to North America: Snow goose (also on Greenland and Wrangel Island), Ross goose, Canada goose (also on Greenland), wood duck, American wigeon, black duck, blue-winged teal, redhead, canvasback, ringnecked duck, lesser scaup, Labrador duck (extinct), surf scoter, bufflehead, hooded merganser. Shared with Eurasia: Trumpeter swan (whooper swan), whistling swan (Bewick swan), white-fronted goose, brant goose, gadwall, green-winged teal, mallard, pintail, shoveler, greater scaup, common eider, king eider, harlequin duck, oldsquaw, black scoter, white-winged scoter, common goldeneye, red-breasted merganser, common merganser. Shared with South America: Fulvous whistling duck, black-bellied whistling duck, muscovy duck, cinnamon teal, masked duck, ruddy duck. Shared with Asia only: Emperor goose, <b>spectacled</b> <b>eider,</b> Steller eider (rarely to Norway). Shared with Europe only: Barrow goldeneye (Iceland and Greenland). Native to Eurasia, introduced into North America: Mute swan. It is thus clear that the strongest zoogeographic affinities of our waterfowl are with Europe and Asia, since twenty-three out of the forty-four native North American species have. populations shared with one or both of these areas. Only six species are shared with South America, and, of these, the fulvous whistling duck has a more general tropical distribution that includes Africa and southern Asia. Consequently, it would appear that South America has played only a minor role in providing waterfowl stock for North America, and vice versa. Certainly the great number of waterfowl species shared between the North American and Eurasian landmasses can be largely attributed to Pleistocene and post-Pleistocene history. Ploeger (1968) analyzed the distributions of eighteen species of arctic-breeding Anatidae and concluded that both their present distributions and their described geographic variations could be at· tributed to the physical-geographical situation existing in the Northern Hemisphere during Late Glacial times. Only a minority (38 percent) of these species exhibit noticeable geographic variation, and most of the eighteen have breeding ranges that include both North America and Eurasia. The exceptions are three Eurasian geese (red-breasted, bean, and lesser white-fronted geese), three North American geese (Canada, Ross, and snow geese), and the North Atlantic barnacle goose. It is of interest that these are all geese, a group noted for their strongly traditional wintering and breeding grounds, as opposed to the less tradition-bound ducks...|$|E
