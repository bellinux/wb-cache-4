40|$|IFR) traffic, Air Traffic Control (ATC) {{must rely}} on pilots to use charted airport {{sketches}} and diagrams as well as <b>standard</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>departures</b> (SIDs) and obstacle departure procedures (ODPs). While many charted (and uncharted) departures are based on radar vectors, the bulk of IFR departures in the NAS require pilots to navigate out of the terminal environment to the en route phase. IFR takeoffs and departures are fast-paced phases of flight, and pilots often are overloaded with critical flight information. During takeoff, pilots are busy requesting and receiving clearances, preparing their aircraft for departure, and taxiing to the active runway. During IFR conditions, they are doing this with minimal visibility, {{and they may be}} without constant radio communication if flying out of a non-towered airport. Historically, takeoff minimums for commercial operations have been successively reduced through a combination of improved signage, runway markings and lighting aids, and concentrated pilot training and qualifications. Today at major terminals, some commercial operators with appropriate equipment, pilot qualifications, and approved Operations Specifications (OpsSpecs) may takeoff with visibility as low as runway visual range (RVR) 3, or 300 feet runway visual range. One of the consequences of takeoffs with reduced visibility is that pilots are challenged in maintaining situational awareness during taxi operations. SURFACE MOVEMENT SAFETY One of the biggest safety concerns in aviation is the surface movement accident. As a direct result, the FAA has rapidly expanded the information available to pilots including the addition of taxiway and runway information in FAA publications, particularly the IFR U. S. Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP) booklets and Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) volumes. The FAA has also implemented new procedures and created educational and awareness programs for pilots, air traffic controllers, and ground operators. By focusing resources to attack this problem head on, the FAA hopes to reduce and eventually eliminate surface movement accidents.

RNAV (RNP) Instrument Approach Procedures (IAP) and RNAV <b>Standard</b> <b>Instrument</b> <b>Departures</b> (SID) and <b>Standard</b> Terminal Arrivals (STARs) often have more waypoints, altitude constraints and other elements than conventional procedures, resulting in charts being cartographically complex. Thus, a chart review was conducted to objectively understand the procedure elements that contributed to increased information density and high levels of visual clutter. A total of sixty-three approach, fifty-two departure, and fifty-four arrival procedures were analyzed. Primary findings were that the factors associated with high levels of visual clutter included having multiple flight paths per page for approach and departure procedures, and having complex altitude constraints for arrival procedures. Multiple waypoints per path was also a factor for both arrivals and approaches. In addition, having RF legs were additional factor contributing to visual clutter for approach procedures. One method to mitigate the increased information density and visual clutter on the RNAV and RNP procedure depiction is {{to reduce the number of}} flight paths shown on a single page by separating the depicted paths to multiple pages. However, there are a number of drawbacks to 4 this clutter mitigation technique. Example drawbacks include having more paper to carry in the flight deck and more time spent searching for the correct page within a set of separated pages. An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of reducing the number of paths depicted on single-page “Modified” charts. FAA AeroNav Products and Jeppesen created versions of the Modified chart in their standard cartographical conventions. The experiment was conducted to evaluate whether these Modified charts would impact information retrieval time and accuracy compared with the “Current” charts being used now. Current FAA AeroNav Products and Jeppesen charts were used as the baseline condition. Six procedures were studied, including three RNAV departure procedures from Dallas/Fort Worth, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City airports, and three RNAV (RNP) approach procedures from Boise, Bozeman, and Palm Springs airports. During the experiment, pilots were shown the same procedure in Current and Modified chart formats.

40|$|A {{key element}} of future Air Traffic Management {{concepts}} like SESAR or NextGen is the stepwise introduction of the extensive use of 4 D trajectories. Two of the expected areas of benefit are reduced lateral flight path lengths through direct flight routings {{and the application of}} near idle descent flight profiles from en-route flight level to landing. High density terminal areas of large international airports present a particular challenge to these concepts due to their traffic share {{on the one hand and}} the traffic complexity on the other hand. This paper presents an approach to estimate requirements and costs for applying 4 D ATM in a high density Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) in a specific example. The approach is starting from a scenario where trajectory uncertainty is completely eliminated and aircraft proceed along their pre-planned 4 D trajectories exactly. This “ideal” scenario is called Utopia. Utopia is used to calculate the upper bound for improvements which theoretically could be obtained from using 4 D ATM. The only constraints that must be met in Utopia are conflict free runway threshold times. Then Utopia is degraded sequentially by the introduction of additional constraints and parameter uncertainties. Examples for such degradations are the stepwise increase of separation requirements between trajectories within the TMA or TMA entry time deviations. To compensate the degradation effects measures have to be taken to fulfil the initial constraints of conflict free threshold times. Measures are e. g. level segments in profile, speed changes or lateral route extensions. The degraded scenarios are evaluated with regard to feasibility and compensation costs. The results give an indication on the range of the degradation which can be compensated by specific measures. Indicators used for scenario evaluation are lateral route lengths, normalized flight times, number of separation conflicts and model fuel consumption. A reference scenario based on today’s route structure in a high density TMA is used as a lower bound starting point for the calculation of possible improvements. Aircraft in this scenario follow <b>standard</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>departures</b> and <b>standard</b> arrival routes that include guidance along a trombone as seen in many high density approach patterns today. All scenarios are evaluated using the air traffic simulator TrafficSim. TrafficSim is designed to support the development and validation of pilot assistant systems dealing with airborne separation assurance systems and air traffic management tools. It is as well suitable as a “proof of concept simulation” for new ATM-concepts or operations. All aircraft in the scenarios under study are equipped with a flight management system (FMS) that is capable of meeting multiple time constraints in a 4 D trajectory. The traffic example used is based on an actual busy day of real traffic at a major hub in Central Europe. Real traffic is considered as important to depict the spatial and temporal distribution of demand, the traffic mix and the relationships between arrival and departure peaks. The traffic example contains about 1400 arrivals and departures and is being used consistently over all scenarios under study. Thus a direct and fast comparison between scenario results is facilitated. First results of the Utopia approach under study give an indication on the relation between the expected benefits of advanced 4 D application in high density TMAs and the requirements associated to such a concept. In addition, the scenario and evaluation method developed can be used as a testing environment for new concepts to organize high density TMA traffic using 4 D trajectories...|$|R

During the experiment, pilots were shown the same procedure in Current and Modified chart formats. All charts were displayed electronically on a high-resolution computer monitor. Pilots were asked information retrieval questions associated with each chart. Pilot response time and accuracy with which pilots answered the information retrieval questions were recorded. Pilots completed the task in two blocks, one for approaches and one for departures. The Current and Modified charts within each block were presented in random order, and the order of the two blocks was counterbalanced. Each block began with six practice questions. Each session took approximately one hour to complete. Data were collected from 28 commercial airline pilots and 19 corporate pilots with average flight experience of 11, 484 hours. Fourteen pilots used FAA AeroNav charts, and 33 pilots used Jeppesen charts. Pilots were found to answer questions faster using Modified charts than Current charts. This effect was statistically significant with a p-value less than 0. 01. For approach procedures, the mean response time for Current charts was 16. 9 seconds, compared with 10. 6 seconds for Modified charts. For departure procedures, the mean response time for Current charts was 16. 2 seconds, compared with 13. 2 seconds for Modified charts. Response times were also significantly faster for Modified charts than for Current charts when analyzed for each airport, chart manufacturer (Jeppesen and FAA AeroNav Products), and pilot type (Corporate and Airline). Overall question response accuracy for all 47 participants was 99. 5 %. There were no statistically significant differences found for the response accuracy between Modified and Current chart use. by Abhizna Butchibabu. Thesis (S. M.)
