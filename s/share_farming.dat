Varied estimates of broad-sense heritability (h 2 B) between locations were found for all characters, indicating the presence of genotype x location interaction on the genetic performance of the hybrids. One hundred-grain weight gave the highest h 2 B estimates at both locations, Field 2 and <b>Share</b> <b>farm</b> (66. 4 and 93. 8 %, respectively), {{as well as in}} the combined analysis (80. 2 %). Narrow-sense heritability (h 2 N) estimates obtained from the variance components method were generally in agreement with those from the parent-offspring regression method, although those obtained from the latter were slightly higher for almost all traits. The h 2 N estimates for grain yield recorded were 54. 0 and 36. 7 %, at field 2 and <b>Share</b> <b>farm,</b> respectively, from variance components method, while 44. 7 and 34. 2 %, respectively, from parent-offspring regression method. Grain yield of the hybrids was most highly correlated with grain weight and grain weight/ear. Grain yield correlations with grain weight gave r values of 0. 87, 0. 90 and 0. 91, respectively at field 2, <b>Share</b> <b>farm</b> and the locations combined, while its correlation coefficients with grain weight/ear were 0. 87, 0. 81 and 0. 90, respectively. Flowering and maturity characters were negatively correlated with most other characters, indicating that early flowering and maturing hybrids were more favourable for grain yield and the other characters measured.

In doing so it offers a new explanation for the expansion of the industry and the problems that later developed. Few historians have written on <b>share</b> <b>farming.</b> Dunsdorfs considers its influence, but only in the wheat industry. On writing about the impact of dairying on family life in Victoria, Lake makes only passing reference to it. Davidson examines the dairying industry during the Depression, and argued that its expansion occurred as beef and sheep zone fanners changed over. He does not consider {{the role of}} <b>share</b> <b>farming,</b> and for that reason we find his explanation deficient. We argue that <b>share</b> <b>farming</b> was crucial to the expansion of the dairy industry as the means whereby those with little or no capital entered it. In times of prosperity, dairying 2 ̆ 7 on shares 2 ̆ 7 offered a modest prosperity; in depression, it offered subsistence and an alternative to the dole. After 1890 dairying spread rapidly in New South Wales, assisted mainly by changes in technology and land legislation and the development of overseas markets.

40|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{sustainability}} of an ageing farming population have brought interest in so called entry-exit issues in policy circles. Policy interventions to date have offered limited scope in stimulating farm transfer in UK, however, the increase in unconventional tenures which include partnerships, <b>share</b> <b>farming</b> and contract farming (collectively called joint ventures) would appear to offer new opportunities for those wishing to enter or leave farming. In recognition of this the Fresh Start initiative in Cornwall set up a matchmaking element {{with the aim of}} identifying and facilitating potential joint ventures agreements between new and older farmers. The emphasis was on setting up long-term arrangements that would enable the new entrant to ‘buy into ’ an existing farm business, gradually taking over managerial control. This paper examines the processes of matching partners for the possible formation of farm joint ventures, using qualitative data derived from interviews with the participants, deliverers and stakeholders involved in the matchmaking element of this initiative. The results reveal that there is a deep rooted reluctance amongst participants in the initiative to enter formal long term joint ventures due to differing motivations, expectations, and concerns about their respective responsibilities in the working relationship and about the validity of the legal framework. Only where a relationship had already been informally established was there a commitment to formalise a joint venture agreement. Future emphasis in policy should therefore be on helping to facilitate and formalise existing partnerships, rather than trying to artificially orchestrate matches where the parties do not know each other...|$|E

40|$|This project reviews {{trends in}} farm {{ownership}} opportunity and farm labour supply within New Zealand and evaluates schemes whereby farm workers may accumulate capital to use towards the eventual achievement of farm ownership. A steady movement towards fewer farm holdings and fewer farm workers has been halted {{in recent years}} with some evidence of a reversed pattern now applying. A review of statistics suggests a danger of reduced farmer contact by a largely urbanised society leading to inadequate numbers of young people making farming their vocation. Rising land values, rising livestock values {{and the effect of}} inflation on interest rates means the prospective farm purchaser faces a greatly increased capital ongoing and a higher debt servicing cost. To reduce the discouragement of these trends government has sponsored schemes whereby eligible farm employees may deposit money {{over a period of years}} and receive either substantial grants or a guarantee of inflation protected funds which may be withdrawn on the purchase of a farm. Entry to farm ownership by using sharemilking as the means of accumulating capital has been a traditional pathway in the dairy industry. Proposals for <b>share</b> <b>farming</b> in the sheep and beef industry have recently been widely publicised but these proposals seem to overlook the relative lack of incentive that exists for sheep farm owners to participate. Capital sharing proposals through leasing or company ownership, offer greater attractiveness with less inherent disadvantages. The possibility of farm workers contributing to pooled investment schemes as a hedge against inflation does not seem likely to succeed. The difficulties and costs inherent in administering many small individual/contributions and the basic unattractiveness of assigning individual control of savings to some other person to manage outweigh the probable advantages of such a scheme...|$|E
40|$|ResumoNeste estudo, é comparada a capacidade de infiltração de água no solo mensurada em período seco (agosto) e úmido (dezembro). Os usos da terra onde foi mensurada a infiltração foram mapeados previamente (floresta com araucária, agricultura, erva-mate, reflorestamento, pastagem, capoeira e faxinal). A mensuração da infiltração foi feita através de infiltrômetro com anel duplo, sendo que, em cada uso, foram feitas oito repetições em cada período. Verificou-se que ocorreu diferença significativa na capacidade de infiltração de água no solo mensurada no período seco em comparação com o período úmido. As diferenças ocorreram tanto no volume total infiltrado, quanto na taxa de infiltração final. Dentre os usos mensurados, as áreas de pastagens apresentaram a menor capacidade de infiltração. Conclui-se que o padrão e a dinâmica do uso da terra (mosaico espacial), na bacia do arroio Boa Vista, são responsáveis por diferentes respostas na capacidade de infiltração de água. Por consequência, esperam-se também diferentes comportamentos hidro-erosivos em cada unidade de terra existente na bacia. AbstractThis article {{offers a}} {{comparison}} between the infiltration capacity {{of water in the}} soil measured during dry (August) and wet (December) seasons at the Boa Vista stream basin, in Guamiranga (Paraná State, South Brazil). The land uses there infiltration was measured were previously mapped and featured mixed Ombrophyla Forest, agriculture, Ilex paraguariensis plantations, reforestation, pasture, shrubs and “faxinal” (properties without fencing, whose owners <b>share</b> <b>farming</b> facilities). A double ring infiltrometer was used to measure water infiltration in the soil, with eight repetitions during each season. A significant difference was verified in the infiltration capacity when the soils measured during the dry period were compared with those measured during the wet period. Differences appeared both in the total infiltrated volume, and in the final water infiltration rate. Regarding measurements according to the land uses, the pasture areas featured the lowest infiltration capacity. It is plausible to conclude that the pattern and the land use dynamics (spatial mosaic) at the Boa Vista stream basin are accountable for different infiltration capacity responses. As a consequence, different hydro-erosive behaviors also are expected at each land use unit existing in the basin...|$|E
