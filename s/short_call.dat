5|$|The alpine pika can emit three {{different}} vocalizations. The long call is heard during the mating season from only the subspecies O. a. alpina, O. a. changaica, and O. a. nitida. The <b>short</b> <b>call</b> is a harsh, sharp whistle that is easily distinguishable from the short high-pitched whistle {{of the northern}} pika. The alarm call is given out immediately any danger from predators or humans is perceived, and can travel greater distances than the calls of most other pika species.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{receives}} a <b>short</b> <b>call</b> from Duncan {{just as the}} FBI agents track Duncan’s location. Veronica goes into an abandoned apartment, where she meets Duncan. It {{turns out that the}} set of events that seemed to point towards Duncan having stolen the baby were a scam so that Veronica and Duncan could successfully smuggle Duncan and the baby to Mexico together. Sheriff Lamb learns this fact just as Keith finds diapers in the apartment. A reporter contacts Wallace. Sheriff Lamb goes down to Mexico and asks around for Duncan Kane. Keith confronts Veronica about her actions regarding the baby, angry that she used him and tells her he'll never be able to fully trust her again. The FBI agents search Veronica’s apartment, but Keith has removed the diapers and continues to claim he doesn't know anything. Weevil learns that Felix was dating Molly Fitzpatrick. Sheriff Lamb continues his search before finding his trunk unloaded. Duncan, disguised as a hitchhiker, gets picked up by Vinnie Van Lowe and Astrid (Celeste’s assistant), and they drive off into the distance.|$|E

50|$|Pikas have {{distinct}} {{calls that}} vary in duration. The call {{can either be}} short and quick, a little longer and more drawn out, or they can be songs. The <b>short</b> <b>calls</b> are an example of geographic variation. The pikas determine the appropriate time to make <b>short</b> <b>calls</b> by listening for cues for sound localization. The calls are used as either a warning signal or {{as a way to}} attract the opposite sex. There are also different calls depending on the season. In the spring, the songs become more frequent due to the breeding season. In late summer, the vocalizations become <b>short</b> <b>calls.</b> Through various studies, the acoustic characteristics of the vocalizations can be a useful taxonomic tool.|$|R

25|$|Reverse {{convertibles}} are a {{less common}} variation, mostly issued synthetically. They would be {{opposite of the}} vanilla structure: the conversion price would act as a knock-in <b>short</b> <b>call</b> option: as the stock price drops below the conversion price the investor would start to be exposed the underlying stock performance and {{no longer able to}} redeem at par its bond. This negative convexity would be compensated by a usually high regular coupon payment.|$|E
25|$|SPIT (SPam over Internet Telephony) is VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) spam, usually using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol). This {{is nearly}} {{identical}} to telemarketing calls over traditional phone lines. When the user chooses to receive the spam call, a pre-recorded spam message or advertisement is usually played back. This is generally easier for the spammer as VoIP services are cheap and easy to anonymize over the Internet, {{and there are many}} options for sending mass amounts of calls from a single location. Accounts or IP addresses being used for VoIP spam can usually be identified by a large number of outgoing calls, low call completion and <b>short</b> <b>call</b> length.|$|E

500|$|The alpine pika (Ochotona alpina), {{also known}} as [...] "Alta Pika", [...] "Altaischer Pfeighase", [...] "Pika de l'atai", and [...] "Pika alpina", is a species of small mammal in the pika family, Ochotonidae. The summer pelage of {{different}} subspecies varies drastically but, in general, it is dark or cinnamon brown, turning to grey with a yellowish tinge during the winter. It is found in western Mongolia, eastern Kazakhstan, and Russia (Tuva, Irkutsk, Altai, and Krasnoyarsk), {{as well as in}} China (northern Xinjiang and Heilongjiang), in very cold, mountainous regions. It is a generalist herbivore, and mainly forages on mosses, tree branches, pine nuts, and plant stems. It can emit three series of different vocalizations: a long call, a <b>short</b> <b>call,</b> and an alarm call. It is rated as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, a {{research}} {{team led by}} David Burney and Ramilisonina performed interviews in and around Belo sur Mer, including Ambararata and Antsira, to find subfossil megafaunal sites used early in the century by other paleontologists. [...] During carefully controlled interviews, the team recorded stories of recent sightings of dwarf hippos (called kilopilopitsofy) and of a large lemur-like creature known as kidoky; {{a report of the}} interviews was published in 1998 with encouragement from primatologist Alison Jolly and anthropologist Laurie Godfrey. [...] In one interview, an 85-year-old man named Jean Noelson Pascou recounted seeing the rare kidoky up close in 1952. [...] Pascou said that the animal looks similar to a sifaka, but had a human-like face, and was [...] "the size of a seven-year-old girl". It had dark fur and a discernible white spot both on the forehead and below the mouth. [...] According to Pascou, it was a shy animal that fled on the ground instead of in the trees. [...] Burney interpreted the old man as saying that it moved in [...] "a series of leaps", but Godfrey later claimed that [...] "a series of bounds" [...] was a better translation — a description that would closely match the foot anatomy of monkey lemurs, such as Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur. [...] Pascou could also imitate its call, a long single [...] "whoop", and said that kidoky would come closer and continue calling if he imitated the call correctly. [...] The call Pascou imitated was comparable to that of a <b>short</b> <b>call</b> for an indri, which lives {{on the other side of}} Madagascar. [...] When shown a picture of an indri, Pascou said kidoky did not look like that, and that it had a rounder face, more similar to a sifaka. [...] Pascou also speculated that kidoky could stand on two legs and that it was a solitary animal.|$|E

40|$|WOS:A 1993 MN 88600002 International audienceStructural {{patterns}} and 24 -hour {{rhythms of the}} loud calls of Alouatta seniculus were studied in a wild population living in primary rain forest in French Guyana. These loud calls are low-pitched noisy hoarse sounds with an upper frequency limit around 3, 000 Hz. Their spectral energy is concentrated in two clusters, each of which includes two dominant frequency bands. Loud calls comprise one or several vocal units with alternating crescendos and decrescendos. Five different types of units can be distinguished. Depending on their duration, loud calls can be roughly divided into two classes: long and <b>short</b> <b>calls.</b> Long calls (mean duration 3. 2 8 min) include three phases. After {{the end of the}} calls, one or two blowing noises of weak amplitude may be heard. <b>Short</b> <b>calls</b> (mean duration 11 s) are frequently uttered in clusters of several calls given by the same troop at intervals of a few seconds to a few minutes. Observations carried out over the 24 -hour cycle show that the calling rate is higher at night, with a peak around dawn and that long calls are more frequent at night, while <b>short</b> <b>calls</b> are mainly heard during the day. Most long calls are emitted from the sleeping sites and carry great distances. They probably play a role in inter-troop communication. Despite their intensity, <b>short</b> <b>calls</b> are used for short-distance communication. The occurrence of two different loud calls in Guyanan howlers and the amount of night calling in these monkeys are discussed with reference to studies of other howler populations...|$|R
