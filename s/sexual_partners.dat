5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the disease include not having sex or having few <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> and using condoms. Screening women at risk for chlamydial {{infection}} followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID. If the diagnosis is suspected, treatment is typically advised. Treating a woman's <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> should also occur. In those with mild or moderate symptoms a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of doxycycline and possibly metronidazole by mouth is recommended. For {{those who do not}} improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used.|$|E

5|$|Circumcision has a {{protective}} effect against {{the risks of}} penile cancer in men, and cervical cancer in the female <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> of heterosexual men. Penile cancer is rare, with about 1 new case per 100,000 people per year in developed countries and higher incidence rates per 100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa (for example: 1.6 in Zimbabwe, 2.7 in Uganda and 3.2 in Swaziland). The number of new cases is also high in certain South American countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay at about 4.3 per 100,000. It is least common in Israeli Jews—0.1 per 100,000—related {{in part to the}} very high rate of circumcision of babies.|$|E
5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity. Others believe that marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

5|$|Henry had a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed {{a substantial number}} of <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> resulting in a large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported. It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.|$|E
5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{bacteria}} that spread from the vagina and cervix. Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases. Often multiple different bacteria are involved. Without treatment about 10 percent of those with a chlamydial infection and 40 percent of those with a gonorrhea infection will develop PID. Risk factors {{are similar to those}} of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high number of <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> and drug use. Vaginal douching may also increase the risk. The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms. It is recommended that the disease be considered in all women of childbearing age who have lower abdominal pain. A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery. Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the sex trade. Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E

25|$|A nonscientific survey {{conducted}} in 2007 by condom-maker Durex measured promiscuity by a {{total number of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b> The survey found Austrian men had {{the highest number of}} sex partners of males globally with 29.3 <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> on average. New Zealand women had the highest number of sex partners for females in the world with an average of 20.4 <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b> In all of the countries surveyed, except New Zealand, men reported more <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> than women.|$|E
25|$|It is {{recommended}} that <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> be tested and potentially treated.

25|$|Early {{evidence}} {{suggested that}} antibiotic treatment of male partners could re-establish the normal microbiota {{of the male}} urogenital tract and prevent the recurrence of infection.

It also found that such treatment may lead treated <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> to report increased adverse events.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> {{people have had}} in their lifetimes varies widely within a population. A 2007 {{nationwide}} survey in the United States found the median number of female <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> reported by men was seven and the median number of male partners reported by women was four. The men possibly exaggerated their reported number of partners, women reported a number lower than the actual number, or a minority of women had a sufficiently larger number than most other women to create a mean {{significantly higher than the}} median, or all of the above (see Pareto principle). About 29% of men and 9% of women reported to have had more than 15 <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> in their lifetimes. Studies of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases consistently demonstrate {{a small percentage of the}} studied population has more partners than the average man or woman, and a smaller number of people have fewer than the statistical average. An important question in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections is whether or not these groups copulate mostly at random (with <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> from throughout a population) or within their social groups (assortative mixing).|$|E

40|$|Data {{are taken}} from a {{representative}} sample of the Australian population to determine the qualities that are desired in a <b>sexual</b> <b>partner.</b> These qualities are considered in three categories: those reflecting the perceived reproductive value of the partner (evolutionary imperative), the emotional attachment to a partner and the pure pleasure associated with having sex. Subjects completed a telephone-based survey 876 males; 908 females; aged 18 - 59). The qualities respondents report they most desire in a <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> are that the person is someone who cares about them, and whom they love. They also rank highly the criterion that their partner should enjoy sex, and much less highly that they themselves should enjoy the sex. Evolutionary imperatives are ranked fairly low as criteria sought in a <b>sexual</b> <b>partner.</b> Males and females generally expressed similar preferences in a <b>sexual</b> <b>partner,</b> as do persons in different age groups, and persons in different marital status categories. Heterosexual males appear to place a higher emphasis on the physical appearance of a partner when compared with non-heterosexuals. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT...|$|R
40|$|The {{preference}} {{to seek out}} a <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> {{of the opposite sex}} is robust and ensures reproduction and survival of the species. Development of female-directed partner preference in the male is dependent on exposure of the developing brain to gonadal steroids synthesized during critical periods of sexual differentiation of the central nervous system. In the absence of androgen exposure, a male-directed partner preference develops. The development and expression of <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> preference has been extensively studied in rat, ferret, and sheep model systems. From these models it is clear that gonadal testosterone, often through estrogenic metabolites, cause both masculinization and defeminization of behavior during critical periods of brain development. Changes in the steroid environment during these critical periods result in atypical <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> preference. In this manuscript, we review the major findings which support the hypothesis that the organizational actions of sex steroids are responsible for sexual differentiation of <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> preferences in select non-human species. We also explore how this information has helped to frame our understanding of the biological influences on human sexual orientation and gender identity...|$|R
