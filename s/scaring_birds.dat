60|$|Mr. Tillotson paused. There {{was a long}} silence. Spode felt strangely moved, {{he hardly}} knew why, in the {{presence}} of this man, so frail, so ancient, in body three parts dead, in the spirit so full of life and hopeful patience. He felt ashamed. What was the use of his own youth and cleverness? He saw himself suddenly as a boy with a rattle <b>scaring</b> <b>birds</b> rattling his noisy cleverness, waving his arms in ceaseless and futile activity, never resting in his efforts to scare away the birds that were always trying to settle in his mind. And what birds! widewinged and beautiful, all those serene thoughts and faiths and emotions that only visit minds that have humbled themselves to quiet. Those gracious visitants he was for ever using all his energies to drive away. But this old man, with his hedgehogs and his honest doubts {{and all the rest of}} it--his mind was like a field made beautiful by the free coming and going, the unafraid alightings of a multitude of white, bright-winged creatures. He felt ashamed. But then, was it possible to alter one's life? Wasn't it a little absurd to risk a conversion? Spode shrugged his shoulders.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{commentators}} have credited this purported effect with increasing {{public awareness of}} the dangers of pollution, for instance {{in the case of the}} fate of sea otters after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, and in the public interest in <b>scaring</b> <b>birds</b> off airfields in non-lethal ways. In the case of invasive species, perceived cuteness may help thwart efforts to eradicate non-native intruders, such as the white fallow deer in Point Reyes, California. The effect is also cited as the anthropomorphic quality of modern cinema: most people in modern Western civilization are not familiar with wildlife, other than [...] "through TV or cinema, where fuzzy little critters discuss romance, self-determination and loyalty like pals over a cup of coffee", which has led to influences on public policy and the image of businesses cast in movies as polluting or otherwise harming the environment.|$|E
50|$|In December 2006 the European Commission opened legal {{infringement}} procedures {{against the}} Polish government for consenting {{to the road}} developments, which would severely damage important and protected natural sites. In February 2007 {{the governor of the}} local province signed the go-ahead for the construction works to start, claiming that all legal requirements had been met, {{despite the fact that the}} region is protected by the EU Natura 2000 program and Poland can be severely fined by the EU for constructing the highway. On 13 February 2007 the Polish Ombudsman launched an appeal against the decision, with the aim of halting construction works. The appeal was based on suspicion that alternative routings of the bypass were not taken into consideration. An independent road designer's variant omits the Rospuda valley and was estimated to cost €17 million less than the currently planned environmentally damaging variant. There have been strong protests by activists and politicians both in Poland and abroad. However, the construction has not been called off. In February 2007 a number of environmental activists pitched a camp in the endangered region to prevent the construction work. The Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza has launched an on-line petition signed by over 140,000 people asking the Polish President Lech Kaczyński to respect the law, preserve the Rospuda Valley and direct the Augustów bypass via a different route. On February 22, 2007 the construction of the Augustów bypass expressway began with the taking of geodetic measurements. There was unofficial information that earthworks are, for now, being begun only from the Augustów side, away from the protected area, and where both road variants overlap. On February 27, 2007 <b>scaring</b> <b>birds</b> away from the Rospuda valley started with permission issued by the Chief Nature Conservator, suggesting that heavy construction works in the valley will soon begin, as the Polish public television TVP reported.|$|E
40|$|Birdstrikes are {{a global}} problem costing the {{aviation}} industry billions of dollars each year. It was hypothesised that infrasound might {{play a role in}} birds ’ detection of approaching aircraft, as {{it has been shown that}} various species can detect or produce low frequency sound. To test this, various artificial and recorded aircraft sounds at infrasonic frequencies were tested on groups of birds (mean = 10) at a small airfield. Changes in bird behaviour were recorded, but only rarely did the birds lift or disperse and on these occasions no significant relationships with the frequencies or amplitudes of the sounds were established (P= 0. 554, P= 0. 456). It was concluded therefore that sounds of the frequency patterns and amplitude tested were not effective at deterring or <b>scaring</b> <b>birds...</b>|$|E

40|$|Many {{animals are}} marked with {{conspicuous}} circular features often called ‘eyespots’, which intimidate predators, preventing or halting an attack. It {{has long been}} assumed that eyespots work by mimicking the eyes of larger animals, but recent experiments have indicated that conspicuousness and contrast is important in eyespot function, and not eye mimicry. We undertake two further experiments {{to distinguish between the}} conspicuousness and mimicry hypotheses, by using artificial prey presented to wild avian predators in the field. In experiment 1, we test if eyespot effectiveness depends on the marking shape (bar or circle) and arrangement (eye-like and non-eye-like positions). We find no difference between shapes or arrangement; all spots were equally effective in <b>scaring</b> <b>birds.</b> In experiment 2, we test if the often yellow and black colors of eyespots mimic the eyes of birds of prey. We find no effect of shape, and no advantage to yellow and black spots over non-eye-like but equally conspicuous colors. The consistent finding is that eyespot function lies in being a conspicuous signal to predators, and not necessarily due to eye mimicry [Current Zoology 55 (5) : – 2009]...|$|E

Streamer lines were an innovation of Japanese tuna fishermen to prevent bait loss to birds. They are inexpensive, simple and require no modification to fishing gear. What are streamer lines? A streamer line (also called a tori or <b>bird</b> <b>scaring</b> line) is a line with streamers that is towed from a high point near the stern as baited hooks are deployed (Figure 1). As the vessel moves forward, drag on the line creates an aerial segment (extent) from which streamers are suspended at regular intervals. With streamer lines, the aerial extent is critical when attempting to <b>scare</b> <b>birds</b> away from baited hooks. A towed object is used to create additional drag to maximise the aerial extent.

5000|$|Wind driven scare devices include tapes, balloons, kites, and {{lightweight}} spinning turbines {{propelled by}} wind.
