25|$|After his somber {{meeting with}} his chieftains, Haile Selassie visited Sir Sidney Barton at the British Legation. He spoke <b>softly</b> <b>to</b> Sir Sidney but to the point. Britain had {{encouraged}} him with fine words and had made many promises. However, Britain had provided Ethiopia with few guns for which the Ethiopians had paid cash. Haile Selassie stressed that he had risked his own life for Ethiopia {{but also for the}} League of Nations. He asked Sir Sidney whether Britain would now come to his aid in this hour of direst need. Shortly afterwards Haile Selassie drove away, his mouth grim with disappointment.|$|E
500|$|According to some versions, {{including}} {{comments from}} some of the kids standing outside the store, Till may have wolf-whistled at Bryant. Following his disappearance, a newspaper account stated that Till sometimes whistled to alleviate his stuttering. His speech was sometimes unclear; his mother said he had particular difficulty with pronouncing [...] "b" [...] sounds, and he may have whistled to overcome problems asking for bubble gum. She said that, to help with his articulation, she taught Till how to whistle <b>softly</b> <b>to</b> himself before pronouncing his words.|$|E

500|$|After {{winning the}} toss, England opted to put Bangladesh into bat, but their new-ball bowlers failed to {{maintain}} a good line and length, providing opener Tamim Iqbal with plenty of bad deliveries to put away for boundaries. Their breakthrough came in the 10th over, when Bresnan bowled a slower ball to Imrul Kayes who found a leading edge and was caught by Luke Wright at mid-on. Two more wickets followed closely as Junaid Siddique hit a half-volley <b>softly</b> <b>to</b> the fielder at square leg in the next over, and then Aftab Ahmed was run out in the 13th over, leaving Bangladesh with 82 runs {{for the loss of}} three wickets (82/3). Captain Shakib Al Hasan and vice-captain Mushfiqur Rahim both provided Tamim with some support, but both were undone by their own rashness; Shakib advanced down the wicket to Graeme Swann and provided an edge for Matt Prior to catch behind the stumps, while Mushfiqur attempted a run which was never available and presented Kevin Pietersen with his second run out of the match. Tamim alone provided resistance, showing [...] "imperious strokeplay all around the ground" [...] and a measure of maturity in his innings. His 125 came off 120 balls, including 13 fours and 3 sixes, eventually being dismissed in the 43rd over, bowled by Broad, with Bangladesh on 214/9. The final two batsmen lasted three overs, adding 14 to score, leaving England requiring 229 to win.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too <b>softly.</b> <b>To</b> provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{had been}} given nutritive enemas; on September 11, he took some broth by mouth. [...] When it seemed to do him good, the {{following}} morning they allowed him toast, coffee, and chicken broth. [...] His subsequent pain was diagnosed as indigestion; he was given purgatives and most doctors left after their evening consultation. [...] In the early morning of September 13, McKinley suffered a collapse. [...] Urgent word to return to Buffalo was sent to Vice President Roosevelt, [...] from the nearest telegraph or telephone in the Adirondack wilderness; a park ranger was sent to find him. [...] Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. As yet unknown to the doctors, gangrene was growing {{on the walls of}} his stomach and toxins were passing into his blood. [...] McKinley drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} all day; when awake he was the model patient. [...] By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, [...] "It is useless, gentlemen. I think we ought to have prayer." [...] His friends and family were admitted, and the First Lady sobbed over him, [...] "I want to go, too. [...] I want to go, too." [...] Her husband replied, [...] "We are all going, we are all going. [...] God's will be done, not ours" [...] and with final strength put an arm around her. [...] He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee", although other accounts have her singing it <b>softly</b> <b>to</b> him. [...] Ida McKinley was led away, her place briefly taken by Senator Hanna. [...] Morgan recounts their final encounter, [...] "Sometime that terrible evening, Mark Hanna had approached the bedside, tears standing in his eyes, his hands and head shaking in disbelief that thirty years of friendship could end thus." [...] When a tentative, formal greeting gained no coherent response, Hanna [...] "cried out over the years of friendship, 'William, William, don't you know me?'" ...|$|E

[...] She made four sacred hoops. [...] The white one she threw to the east. [...] The blue one she threw to the south. The yellow one she threw to the west. [...] The black one she threw to the north. [...] At once a strong wind began to circle the hogan. [...] "The wind is too strong for the monsters to enter," [...] she told her sons. [...] We will be safe for one day. [...] But tomorrow the power will be gone." [...] At night, the twins spoke <b>softly</b> <b>to</b> one another. [...] "The monsters are coming for us," [...] they said. [...] "We must leave so the others will be safe." [...] Before dawn, they left and ran down the holy path to the east.|$|E
2500|$|Emily's unsociability and {{extremely}} shy nature have subsequently been reported many times. According to Norma Crandall, her [...] "warm, human aspect" [...] was [...] "usually revealed only in {{her love of}} nature and of animals". In a similar description, Literary news (1883) states: [...] " [...] loved the solemn moors, she loved all wild, free creatures and things", and critics attest that her love of the moors is manifest in Wuthering Heights. Over the years, Emily's love of nature {{has been the subject}} of many anecdotes. A newspaper dated 31 December 1899, gives the folksy account that [...] "with bird and beast [...] had the most intimate relations, and from her walks she often came with fledgling or young rabbit in hand, talking <b>softly</b> <b>to</b> it, quite sure, too, that it understood". Elizabeth Gaskell, in her biography of Charlotte, told the story of Emily's punishing her pet dog Keeper for lying [...] "on the delicate white counterpane" [...] that covered one of the beds in the Parsonage. According to Gaskell, she struck him with her fists till he was [...] "half-blind" [...] with his eyes [...] "swelled up". This story is apocryphal, and contradicts the following account of Emily's and Keeper's relationship: ...|$|E
2500|$|Influenced by {{contemporaneous}} hits such as [...] "Come Back to Me (My Love)" [...] and [...] "Come <b>Softly</b> <b>to</b> Me", Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song {{in early}} 1960 which, using elements from [...] "Uptown", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers. It also featured a note hit by Orbison in falsetto that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, [...] "came not from his throat but deeper within". The song was [...] "Only the Lonely". Orbison and Melson tried {{to sell it to}} Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers but were turned down. They instead recorded the song at RCA's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy: building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background. This combination became Orbison's trademark sound. The single shot to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told Rolling Stone in 1988, [...] "I liked the sound of [...] I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of [...] "Ooby Dooby" [...] and [...] "Only the Lonely", it kind of turned into a good voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Drug Ballad" [...] {{features}} Dina Rae {{and describes}} the rapper's struggles with his drug addiction, and writes {{about some of}} his experiences under the influence, including ecstasy which makes him [...] "sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you/we just met, but I think I'm in love with you". [...] "Amityville" [...] is a bass-heavy ode to living in Detroit, where the rapper discusses the city's crowning as murder capital of the United States. [...] "Bitch Please II" [...] features Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Xzibit, and contains elements of g-funk, as well as R crooning from Nate Dogg on the chorus. [...] "Kim", the prequel to [...] "'97 Bonnie and Clyde" [...] from The Slim Shady LP, features Eminem [...] "screaming at his ex in an insane stream-of-consciousness hate spew". The song begins with Eminem talking <b>softly</b> <b>to</b> his daughter, but as the beat starts, the rapper takes on portraying two characters, utilizing his own enraged, threatening voice, and the terrified shrieks of his wife Kim. As the song ends, Eminem kills her while taunting, [...] "Bleed, bitch, bleed!" [...] "Kim" [...] is followed by [...] "Under the Influence", which sees Eminem speaking in gibberish for the chorus, and later rap group D12 [...] "runs rampant" [...] on the track. [...] "Criminal" [...] features production from Dr. Dre, which consists of [...] "piano licks, swerving synth, and a deceptively simplistic bass rumble over which Em snakes and snarls and warns that 'you can't stop me from topping these charts...'". He pokes fun at critics who take his lyrical content seriously, explaining that [...] "half the shit I say, I just {{make it up to}} make you mad".|$|E
