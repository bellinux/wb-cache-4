King Béla IV was also considering <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> Knights Hospitallers in the lands between the Carpathians and the Lower Danube. His diploma of 1247 for the Knights evidences the existence of four Romanian polities in the region. They were under the rule of voivodes Litovoi and Seneslau, and of knezes Farcaş and John.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Europeans began <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> land {{east of the}} Mississippi River {{that was}} {{inhabited}} by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans.

5|$|Ludlow Castle was {{probably}} founded by Walter de Lacy around 1075. Walter {{had arrived in}} England in 1066 as part of William fitzOsbern's household during the Norman conquest of England. FitzOsbern was made the Earl of Hereford and tasked with <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> area; at the same time, several castles were founded in {{the west of the}} county, securing its border with Wales. Walter de Lacy was the earl's second in command, and was rewarded with 163manors spread across seven counties, with 91 in Herefordshire alone.|$|E
50|$|Mostly early Acadians (descendants of the {{original}} French colonists) <b>settled</b> <b>the</b> Saint John and Madawaska River basins.

5|$|Albert {{returned}} to the United Kingdom with Ernest in October 1839 to visit the Queen, with the object of <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> marriage. Albert and Victoria felt mutual affection and the Queen proposed to him on 15 October 1839. Victoria's intention to marry was declared formally to the Privy Council on 23 November, and the couple married on 10 February 1840 at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace. Just before the marriage, Albert was naturalised by Act of Parliament, and granted the style of Royal Highness by an Order in Council.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Europeans began <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> land {{east of the}} Mississippi River {{that was}} {{inhabited}} by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans. Chickasaw land in West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky was ceded in the Jackson Purchase after negotiations in which the United States was represented by General Andrew Jackson and Governor Isaac Shelby, while the Chickasaw were represented by their chiefs and warriors. In 1818, both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa. In the treaty, the United States agreed to pay the Chickasaw $300,000 in return for the right to the land east of the Mississippi River and north of the Mississippi state line.|$|E

5|$|His health declining, Baltimore's {{persistence}} {{over the}} charter finally {{paid off in}} 1632. The king first granted him a location south of Jamestown, but Baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> new land of Carolina into a sugar plantation. Baltimore eventually compromised by accepting redrawn boundaries {{to the north of}} the Potomac River, on either side of the Chesapeake Bay. The charter was about to pass when the fifty-two-year-old Baltimore died in his lodgings at Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 15 April 1632. Five weeks later, on 20 June 1632, the charter for Maryland passed the seals.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November, Fraser {{contacted}} Whitlam {{and invited}} him to negotiations with the Coalition aimed at <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> dispute. Whitlam agreed, and a meeting was set for 9am on Tuesday 11 November, at Parliament House. That Tuesday was also the deadline for an election to be called {{if it were to}} be held before Christmas. Both Government and Opposition leaders were in Melbourne on the night of 10 November for the Lord Mayor's banquet. To ensure the Opposition leaders could reach Canberra in time for the meeting, Whitlam brought them back in his VIP aircraft, which arrived in Canberra at midnight.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} {{financial problems}} with Seattle Transit put the Blue Streak program in jeopardy, leading to calls {{to suspend the}} program before it launched. Service was originally slated to begin in 1968, and delays led {{to the federal government}} establishing a deadline in early 1969 for a city decision on whether to move forward. A park and ride lot in Northgate was secured in August 1969, <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> demands of the federal government. The United States Department of Transportation approved $2 million in operating funds for Blue Streak in January 1970, providing two-thirds of the system's operating budget for {{the first two years of}} service.|$|E

5|$|The first Europeans {{to come to}} {{the area}} in the {{vicinity}} of Darby Creek were the Dutch, though they did not establish any permanent settlements. In 1643, Swedish colonists led by Johan Printz established New Sweden near the confluence of Darby Creek and the Delaware River. The settlement they established served as the seat of government for the Swedes in North America for 12 years. They may have built impoundments in the creek to isolate marsh areas. Dutch settlers conquered the Swedish villages in 1655. In 1664, the Dutch surrendered the Darby Creek drainage basin to the English, who began <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> area after William Penn was issued a charter in 1681. The Darby Creek Ferry House, near the site of Printz's headquarters, was erected in 1694.|$|E
5|$|Europeans began <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> river valleys {{around the}} Metacomet Ridge in the mid–17th century. Forests were cut down or burned {{to make room}} for agriculture, {{resulting}} in the near complete denuding of the once contiguous forests of southern New England by the 19th century. Steep terrain like the Metacomet Ridge, while not suitable for planting crops, was widely harvested of timber {{as a result of the}} expanding charcoal industry that boomed before the mining of coal from the mid–Appalachian regions replaced it as a source of fuel. In other cases, ridgetop forests burned when lower elevation land was set afire, and some uplands were used for pasturing. Traprock was harvested from talus slopes of the Metacomet Ridge to build house foundations; copper ore was discovered at the base of Peak Mountain in northern Connecticut and was mined by prisoners incarcerated at Old Newgate Prison located there.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Earl of Pembroke {{had been}} {{negotiating}} with France {{to resolve the}} long-standing disagreements over the administration of Gascony, {{and as part of}} this Edward and Isabella agreed to travel to Paris in June 1313 to meet with Philip IV. Edward probably hoped both to resolve the problems in the south of France and to win Philip's support in the dispute with the barons; for Philip it was an opportunity to impress his son-in-law with his power and wealth. It proved a spectacular visit, including a grand ceremony in which the two kings knighted Philip's sons and 200 other men in Notre Dame, large banquets along the River Seine, and a public declaration that both kings and their queens would join a crusade to the Levant. Philip gave lenient terms for <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> problems in Gascony, and the event was spoiled only by a serious fire in Edward's quarters.|$|E

5|$|Of the 56 {{people on}} board, 38, {{including}} Hood and Beaumont, {{died in the}} crash. Eighteen survived, albeit with injuries, and {{climbed out of the}} wreckage. After briefly <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> others, one of the passengers, Dr Cecil MacLaren, led four others—young newlyweds Robert and Shannon Hargreaves, Mrs Sharon Coles, and her four-year-old daughter Tracey—off {{in the direction of a}} nearby village in search of water. The other 13 remained close to the wreckage. Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45. Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same. This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4).|$|E
5|$|Philip's {{relatively}} lenient {{treatment of}} the Phocians in 346 BC now bore fruit. Reaching Elatea, he ordered the city to be re-populated, and {{during the next few}} months the whole Phocian confederation was restored to its former state. This provided Philip with a base in Greece, and new, grateful allies in the Phocians. Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC, but the decisive phase of the campaign did not occur until August 338 BC. During this period Philip discharged his responsibility to the Amphicytonic council by <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> situation in Amphissa. He tricked a force of 10,000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts, then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens, turning it over to Delphi. He probably also engaged in diplomatic attempts to try and avoid further conflict in Greece, although if so, he was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The Samanid emir, Isma'il ibn Ahmad, {{launched}} an expedition against the Oghuz Turks in 893, {{forcing them to}} invade the Pechenegs' lands between the Volga and Ural rivers. After being expelled from their homeland, the Pechenegs departed for the west in search of new pastures. The Magyars had in the meantime invaded Bulgaria in alliance with the Byzantine Emperor Leo the Wise. Simeon I of Bulgaria sent envoys to the Pechenegs and persuaded them to storm into Etelköz. The unexpected invasion destroyed the unguarded dwelling places of the Magyars, forcing them to leave the Pontic steppes and seek refuge over the Carpathian Mountains. The Magyars occupied their new homeland in several phases, initially <b>settling</b> <b>the</b> lands east of the Danube and only invading the March of Pannonia after Arnulf of East Francia died in 899. They destroyed Moravia before 906 and consolidated their control of the Carpathian Basin through their victory over a Bavarian army in the Battle of Brezalauspurc in 907.|$|E
