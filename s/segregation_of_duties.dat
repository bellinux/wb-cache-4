Some small and medium enterprises (SME) leaders lack strategies for improving internal control systems. The purpose of this multiple case {{study was to explore}} the strategies leaders of SMEs in Nigeria use for improving internal control practices. Building on the internal control theory and transactional leadership theory, semistructured face-to-face and phone interviews were conducted with 8 purposively-selected leaders of SMEs in Nigeria who successfully implemented internal control practices. The 5 themes that emerged from the thematic analysis of the interview data were: <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> duty; adherence to processes, policies, and procedures; staffing, training, and experience; information technology; and staff empowerment and management commitment. The findings from this study indicate that leaders of SMEs in Nigeria use similar strategies to improve internal control practices. All participants used <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> and adherence to processes, policies, and procedures as strategies for improving internal control practices. SME leaders should possess adequate leadership skills for improving internal control systems in their business. The result of this study may contribute to positive social change by providing SME leaders with knowledge on strategies for improving internal control practices which will minimize loss of assets and boost profitability and business sustainability. With increase in business profitability, leaders of SMEs will increase the firms 2 ̆ 7 corporate social responsibility through payment of more taxes, and provision of employment opportunities and social amenities to the local community...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Cost and Management Accounting)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. Small, {{medium and}} micro {{enterprises}} (SMMEs) in South Africa {{are perceived to}} be failing partly due to ineffective management practices. Using a questionnaire survey, this study sought to determine the inventory-management practices of SMMEs operating in the Cape Metropole, and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the inventory-management practices currently used by these entities. In addition, the study sought to determine the challenges, if any, that are experienced by SMMEs from the inventory-management practices currently used. This study was motivated by a dearth of research on inventory-management practices of SMMEs. The findings of the study revealed that most of the SMMEs used ‘Rule of Thumb’ as an inventory-management practice. Regarding the effectiveness of the practices used, the study revealed that the SMMEs investigated were perceived to be moderately effective, with SMMEs practising good inventory management techniques such as warehousing, stocktaking, budgeting, good ordering habits and <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> warehouse <b>duties.</b> In relation to the challenges faced by SMMEs from the inventory-management practices currently used, the findings suggested that theft, shortage of inventory, errors due to incompetent staff, physical inventory not matching up with records and an inability to keep up with the demand of the customers were some of the main challenges faced. This study contributes to the literature on inventory-management practices of SMMEs and fills the gap of knowledge in this neglected area of research. The findings of this study are of significance to the decision-makers of SMEs as they will be enlightened on the best practices and different inventory-management practices that are vital for their businesses’ survival and that have been adopted by their competitors. This should enable them to evaluate their own inventory-management practices and to decide whether to improve, change or continue with their current practice. The South African Government could also draw on the findings of this research to inform its future intervention strategies meant to improve the survival rates of these entities. This could be in the form of the creation of short courses meant to assist SMMEs to improve their inventory-management practices...|$|R

50|$|When {{you have}} a {{function}} that deals with money either incoming or outgoing {{it is very important}} to make sure that duties are segregated to minimize and hopefully prevent fraud. One of the key ways to ensure proper <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> (SoD) from a systems perspective is to review individuals’ access authorizations. Certain systems such as SAP claim to come with the capability to perform SoD tests, but the functionality provided is elementary, requiring very time consuming queries to be built and is limited to the transaction level only with little or no use of the object or field values assigned to the user through the transaction, which often produces misleading results. For complex systems such as SAP, it is often preferred to use tools developed specifically to assess and analyze SoD conflicts and other types of system activity. For other systems or for multiple system formats you should monitor which users may have super user access to the system giving them unlimited access to all aspects of the system. Also, developing a matrix for all functions highlighting the points where proper <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> has been breached will help identify potential material weaknesses by cross checking each employee’s available accesses. This is as important if not more so in the development function as it is in production. Ensuring that people who develop the programs are not the ones who are authorized to pull it into production is key to preventing unauthorized programs into the production environment where they can be used to perpetrate fraud.|$|E

Turning on native impacts the performance of the server. Generally, the native audit trails of databases do not provide sufficient controls to enforce separation of duties; therefore, the network and/or kernel module level host based monitoring capabilities provides a higher degree of confidence for forensics and preservation of evidence.|$|E
