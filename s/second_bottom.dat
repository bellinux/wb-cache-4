5|$|In October 2016, Neil Warnock was {{appointed}} first team manager of Cardiff. Warnock {{took over the}} team with Cardiff <b>second</b> <b>bottom</b> of the table after two wins from 11 games, however, Cardiff finished the 2016–17 season 12th after a good run of form. The start of the 2017–18 season saw Cardiff break a club record of winning their opening three league games of a season, {{the first time in}} the club's 107-year professional history.|$|E
5|$|In Robson's {{first home}} match in charge, bottom-placed Newcastle faced <b>second</b> <b>bottom</b> Sheffield Wednesday, {{thrashing}} them 8–0. In {{his first season}} in charge, 1999–2000, Robson led the club to an 11th-place finish, with 14 wins from his 32 matches in charge. In late 2000, following the resignation of ex-Magpies boss Kevin Keegan as England manager, the FA asked Newcastle club chairman Freddy Shepherd to permit Robson to take over in a part-time caretaker capacity, but the request was refused. Robson guided Newcastle from bottom of the Premier League to a fourth-place finish in the 2001–02 season. The following season, Newcastle finished third, ensuring qualification for the UEFA Champions League {{for the second consecutive}} year.|$|E
5|$|The new league {{began on}} 12 September 2003 when Sheffield Steelers, {{who went on}} to become the inaugural league champions, {{defeated}} the newly formed London Racers 6–1 at Alexandra Palace. The Racers endured a difficult first season, moving to a different rink only weeks into the season and having to wait 40 games to record a win, a 3–0 victory over Cardiff Devils. The Racers finished the season with 10 points, 38 points behind <b>second</b> <b>bottom</b> Basingstoke. The other new team, Manchester Phoenix fared slightly better, qualifying for the playoff finals after finishing sixth in the league, where they were defeated 6–1 by Nottingham in the semi final. The club played at the 17,500 capacity MEN Arena which had been home to Manchester Storm, but Phoenix crowds averaged 2,250, well below the break-even mark of 3,000. Late in the season, Phoenix choose to play a game at IceSheffield rather than pay the considerable cost of hiring the arena for a mid-week game (which usually had lower attendances). In the close season they allowed fans to vote on the option of either suspending playing operations while a new rink was constructed or playing in exile away from Manchester while a new rink was built. Supporters opted to suspend playing operations pending the construction of a new facility.|$|E

25|$|Adams played {{regularly}} in the County Championship during 1927, though Northamptonshire had still made little progress in the league, finishing <b>second</b> <b>bottom.</b> Over the next two years, before making his exit from the game, Adams played just two first-class games, quitting in 1929.|$|E
25|$|He {{was named}} first-team coach of Kent for the 2010 season on 31 July 2009. Kent {{finished}} the season <b>second</b> <b>bottom</b> of the County Championship and were {{relegated to the}} second tier after earning promotion the previous season. Kent won three of their sixteen matches and finished with 151 points. In the Clydesdale Bank 40, Kent finished runners up in their group to Warwickshire, narrowly missing out on reaching the Quarter finals. Kent failed to progress beyond the group stage of the domestic T20 competition, finishing seventh in their group.|$|E
25|$|Kent {{endured a}} {{difficult}} second season under Farbrace.

In the Twenty20 competition they qualified from the group, finishing third and earning {{a place in the}} Quarter finals. However, they lost the quarter final against Leicestershire in a high scoring game. At {{the end of the season}} Farbrace left his role and was replaced by Jimmy Adams.|$|E

25|$|Hadden {{replaced}} Matt Williams and {{was appointed}} on 15 September 2005. Hadden coached the Merchiston Castle School 1st XV after being appointed Head of Physical Education {{at the school}} in 1983. He coached several Scottish age-group teams before being appointed assistant coach of the Caledonian Reds in 1997. He was later appointed coach of Edinburgh Gunners (now Edinburgh Rugby) in 2000 prior to becoming the Scotland coach. He has since coached Scotland to notable wins over England and France in the 2006 Six Nations and again winning the Calcutta Cup against England in the 2008 Six Nations. He parted company with the national side on 2 April 2009 after a second consecutive disappointing Six Nations where they finished <b>second</b> <b>bottom</b> after winning just one match.|$|E
25|$|A {{victory in}} their FA Cup fifth-round replay sent Middlesbrough {{into the home}} match with Liverpool with {{optimism}} that their disastrous run of form in the league would finally come to an end, and their hopes came true. Liverpool were riding high in second place, while Boro began the day in <b>second</b> <b>bottom.</b> A stroke of luck put the home side ahead as Xabi Alonso diverted the ball into his own net from a corner. Tuncay doubled the advantage in the second half, and they could have had more as the visitors left themselves open at the back {{as they tried to}} find a way back. Brad Jones kept a fourth consecutive home clean sheet and Boro moved out of the relegation zone with their 2–0 win, while Liverpool had now failed to win at the Riverside for seven seasons.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 2000–01 season, Bristol Rovers {{had been}} the only team in the Football League never to have played in the first or the fourth levels of the league. This record ended when the team were relegated to Division 3 for the 2001–02 season. Holloway {{resigned}} at the halfway point of the season, and Garry Thompson took over {{for the rest of the}} campaign, but was unable to prevent relegation. Gerry Francis returned to the club and oversaw a good start that saw them top the division at the end of August; results soon faded however, and it became clear that Rovers were not going to get out of the division at the first attempt. Francis resigned due to personal issues in December with the side in 20th place, leading to Garry Thompson being reinstated as manager. Despite masterminding a cup upset against Premier League opponents Derby County, Rovers' League form remained poor, and the club hit its lowest ebb, finishing <b>second</b> <b>bottom</b> of the whole League and only surviving due to a truly awful season by bottom-placed Halifax Town.|$|E

25|$|After three {{successive}} {{seasons in}} the United Counties Premier Division, the club joined Division Two North of the Isthmian League in 1984, and the following season earned promotion to Division One after finishing the season as champions. However, two years later the club were relegated back to the Division Two North, having finished <b>second</b> <b>bottom</b> of the division. After two fourth-placed finishes, under the new management of Paul Fairclough, the club won promotion during the 1990–91 campaign, winning 34 of their 42 games, including every match played at home, scoring 122 goals and amassing 107 points. The following season, the club won the Division One championship, remaining unbeaten at home again, and were promoted to the Isthmian Premier Division. The club's long unbeaten home record was finally ended by Dulwich Hamlet, with the streak lasting 44 matches, of which 42 were won. During the 1993–94 season, Stevenage won the Premier Division, and were subsequently promoted to the Football Conference. Two seasons later, they won the Conference, but were denied promotion to the Football League, due to insufficient ground facilities, thus reprieving Torquay United, who had finished bottom of Division Three. During the same season, the Hertfordshire club reached the First Round of the FA Cup for the first time, but lost 2–1 to Third Division side Hereford United at Edgar Street.|$|E
500|$|Somerset {{began their}} season by playing out a high-scoring draw {{at home against}} Warwickshire, in which both teams reached 500 in their first innings. James Hildreth scored a triple-century, {{reaching}} the milestone earlier in an English season than any player previously, {{and became the first}} English player to pass 300 runs in an innings for Somerset since Harold Gimblett in 1948. In contrast, Somerset had to battle back for a draw in their second match. After Durham scored 543 in their first innings, Somerset [...] to 69 all out in reply; only Langer passed 20 runs, while six of his batting colleagues made ducks. After being forced to follow-on, Trescothick, Langer and Kieswetter all scored centuries to secure a draw. Somerset's third match resulted in their only loss of the County Championship season, coming against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge; {{and at the end of}} May, they were <b>second</b> <b>bottom</b> in the first division. Their next match finished in a draw against Lancashire, a result which was always likely after the first day was lost to rain. Somerset next picked up victories against Yorkshire and Sussex before scoring the second-highest ever fourth innings winning total in the County Championship to beat Yorkshire at Taunton. These three wins propelled Somerset to third in the competition at the start of July, and they did not drop below this position for the remainder of the season.|$|E
