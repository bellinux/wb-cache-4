5|$|Suborder Polystilifera. Includes about 100 pelagic and 50 benthic species. Their pads bear many tiny <b>stylets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Class Enopla ("armed"). All have <b>stylets</b> except order Bdellonemertea. Their {{mouth is}} located {{underneath}} and {{ahead of the}} brain. Their main nerve cords run inside body-wall muscles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{one might}} expect <b>stylets</b> to be fossilized since they are made of the mineral calcium phosphate, none have been found. As nemertea are {{otherwise}} completely soft-bodied, one would expect fossils {{of them to be}} extremely rare.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{lidocaine}} {{and olive}} oil reduced the <b>stylet</b> extraction force for the conventional PVC <b>stylet.</b> The Sn <b>stylet</b> required less extraction force than the PVC <b>stylet,</b> regardless of the lubricant used, likely due to its deformable and lubricious nature. These findings confirm {{the utility of the}} Sn <b>stylet</b> for tracheal intubation.|$|R
5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices {{have been designed to}} act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid <b>stylets,</b> the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid <b>stylets,</b> such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In most of {{the class}} Enopla ("armed"), the {{proboscis}} exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this class has a stylet, a calcareous barb, with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. The prey is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are sucked into the mouth. The stylet is attached about one-third of distance {{from the end of}} the ed proboscis, which extends only enough to expose the stylet. On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back-up <b>stylets</b> to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost. Instead of one stylet, the Polystilifera have a pad that bears many tiny <b>stylets,</b> and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla. The Enopla can only attack after contacting the prey.|$|E
5|$|Order Bdellonemertea. Includes seven species, {{of which}} six live as commensals in {{the mantle of}} large clams and one in that of a {{freshwater}} snail. The hosts filter feed and all the hosts steal food from them. These nemerteans have short, wide bodies and have no <b>stylets</b> but have a sucking pharynx and a posterior stucker, with which they move like inchworms.|$|E

5|$|The left {{mandible}} is used {{briefly to}} cut into the food plant; saliva is injected and the maxillary <b>stylets,</b> which form a tube, are then inserted and the semi-digested food pumped from ruptured cells. This process leaves cells destroyed or collapsed, and a distinctive silvery or bronze scarring on the surfaces of the stems or leaves where the thrips have fed.|$|E
5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} metal wire {{designed to be}} inserted into the endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available <b>stylets,</b> such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} name Octopoda was first coined and given as {{the order of}} octopuses in 1818 by English biologist William Elford Leach, who classified them as Octopoida the previous year. The Octopoda consists of 300 known species and {{can be divided into}} two suborders, the Incirrina and the Cirrina. The incirrate octopuses (the majority of species) lack the cirri and paired swimming fins of the cirrates. In addition, the internal shell of incirrates is either present as a pair of <b>stylets</b> or absent altogether.|$|E

5|$|Whereas many {{dipteran}} larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations, {{the majority}} of adults live above ground and are capable of flight. Predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates, such as honeydew, for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted. The flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp <b>stylets</b> that pierce the skin, the insects inserting anticoagulant saliva and absorbing the blood that flows; in this process, certain diseases can be transmitted. The bot flies (Oestridae) have evolved to parasitize mammals. Many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts. In many dipteran groups, swarming is a feature of adult life, with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations; these insects are mostly males, and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to females.|$|E
25|$|The tips of {{the right}} and left maxillary <b>stylets</b> are not the same; the right is hook-like and curved, and the left is straight. The right and left mandibular <b>stylets</b> extend along the outer sides of their {{respective}} maxillary <b>stylets</b> and do not reach anywhere near the tip of the fused maxillary <b>stylets.</b> The <b>stylets</b> are retained in a groove in the labium, and during feeding, they are freed from the groove as the jointed labium is bent or folded out of the way; its tip never enters the wound.|$|E
25|$|Sponging {{mouthparts}} {{are used}} to sponge and suck liquids, and lack <b>stylets</b> (e.g. most Diptera).|$|E

5000|$|A <b>stylet</b> is a hard, sharp, {{anatomical}} structure {{found in some}} invertebrates.For example, the word <b>stylet</b> or stomatostyle {{is used for the}} primitive piercing mouthparts of some nematodes [...] and some nemerteans. In these groups the <b>stylet</b> is a hardened protrusible opening to the stomach.|$|R
25|$|Piercing-sucking {{mouthparts}} have <b>stylets,</b> and {{are used}} to penetrate solid tissue and then suck up liquid food.|$|E
25|$|Siphoning {{mouthparts}} lack <b>stylets</b> and {{are used}} to suck liquids, and are commonly found among species of Lepidoptera.|$|E
25|$|The mouthparts, {{along with}} the rest of the head, can be {{articulated}} in at least three different positions: prognathous, opisthognathous, and hypognathous. In species with prognathous articulation, the head is positioned vertically aligned with the body, such as species of Formicidae; while in a hypognathous type, the head is aligned horizontally adjacent to the body. An opisthognathous head is positioned diagonally, such as species of Blattodea and some Coleoptera. The mouthparts vary greatly between insects of different orders, but the two main functional groups are mandibulate and haustellate. Haustellate mouthparts are used for sucking liquids and can be further classified by the presence of <b>stylets,</b> which include piercing-sucking, sponging, and siphoning. The <b>stylets</b> are needle-like projections used to penetrate plant and animal tissues. The <b>stylets</b> and the feeding tube form the modified mandibles, maxilla, and hypopharynx.|$|E
40|$|During endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle {{aspiration}} (EBUS-TBNA), {{a needle}} {{is commonly used}} with a <b>stylet,</b> although recently the <b>stylet</b> has been omitted. This prospective study aimed to compare the quality of specimens obtained by EBUS-TBNA performed with and without a <b>stylet.</b> Between November 2013 and November 2014, 131 patients with lung cancer underwent EBUS-TBNA, {{with a total of}} 148 mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes sampled both with and without an inner-stylet, yielding 296 cytological specimens. Specimens were scored cytologically using five parameters: background blood or clot, amount of cellular material, degree of cellular degeneration, degree of cellular trauma, and retention of appropriate architecture. The procedure with a <b>stylet</b> required significantly longer operation time than without a <b>stylet</b> (14. 5 ± 0. 8 vs 12. 7 ± 1. 1 min, P< 0. 001). Excellent specimens were obtained in 261 / 296 and 260 / 296 samples in the procedures with and without a <b>stylet,</b> respectively (P= 0. 9), while the remaining 35 and 36 samples, respectively, were adequate. The diagnosing and staging of lung cancer using EBUS-TBNA did not differ significantly between the groups. In conclusion, specimen collection by EBUS-TBNA without a <b>stylet</b> is easier and faster than the procedure using a <b>stylet</b> and absence of a <b>stylet</b> did not alter specimen quality or diagnostic accuracy...|$|R
5|$|Suborder Monostilifera. Includes 500 {{species with}} a single central <b>stylet.</b> Some use the <b>stylet</b> for {{locomotion}} {{as well as for}} capturing prey.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reniform}} nematode has esophageal glands overlapping the intestine {{and a short}} <b>stylet.</b> The dorsal esophageal gland orifice is located posterior to the <b>stylet</b> knobs. The immature female is slender and may be spiral- or C-shaped in death. It is about 0.3 to 0.5 millimeters long. The mature female has a swollen, kidney-shaped body with a short tail, a short, thin <b>stylet</b> with rounded <b>stylet</b> knobs, a three-part esophagus, a long and narrow isthmus, and a well-developed metacarpus. The vulva is just behind {{the middle of the}} body. The male is vermiform: with a wormlike appearance. It has a weak <b>stylet,</b> curved spicules, and a pointed tail. The esophagus is reduced.|$|R
25|$|Most aphids have soft bodies, {{which may}} be green, black, brown, pink, or almost colorless. Aphids have {{antennae}} {{with as many as}} six segments. They feed themselves through sucking mouthparts called <b>stylets,</b> enclosed in a sheath called a rostrum, which is formed from modifications of the mandible and maxilla of the insect mouthparts. They have long, thin legs and two-jointed, two-clawed tarsi.|$|E
25|$|The mandibular stylet tips {{have small}} teeth, and through {{alternately}} moving these <b>stylets</b> back and forth, the insect cuts {{a path through}} tissue for the maxillary bundle to reach an appropriately sized blood vessel. Pressure from the blood vessel itself fills the insect with blood in three to five minutes. The bug then withdraws the stylet bundle from the feeding position and retracts {{it back into the}} labial groove, folds the entire unit back under the head, and returns to its hiding place. It takes between five and ten minutes for a bed bug to become completely engorged with blood. In all, the insect may spend less than 20 minutes in physical contact with its host, and does not try to feed again until it has either completed a moult or, if an adult, has thoroughly digested the meal.|$|E
25|$|Mouthparts {{can have}} {{multiple}} functions. Some insects combine piercing parts along with sponging ones {{which are then}} used to pierce through tissues of plants and animals. Female mosquitoes feed on blood (hemophagous) making them disease vectors. The mosquito mouthparts consist of the proboscis, paired mandibles and maxillae. The maxillae form needle-like structures, called <b>stylets,</b> which are enclosed by the labium. When mosquito bites, maxillae penetrate the skin and anchor the mouthparts, thus allowing other parts to be inserted. The sheath-like labium slides back, and the remaining mouthparts pass through its tip and into the tissue. Then, through the hypopharynx, the mosquito injects saliva, which contains anticoagulants to stop the blood from clotting. And finally, the labrum (upper lip) is used to suck up the blood. Species of the genus Anopheles are characterized by their long palpi (two parts with widening end), almost reaching the end of labrum.|$|E
40|$|Despite lack of evidence, {{use of a}} <b>stylet</b> during EUS-FNA is {{believed}} to improve quality and diagnostic yield of specimens. Use of a <b>stylet</b> is time consuming and increases cost of the needle. Recent pilot {{studies have suggested that}} use of a <b>stylet</b> does not impact diagnostic yield of malignancy.
