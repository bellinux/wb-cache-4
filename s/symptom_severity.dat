Design A cross-sectional study. Setting Patients from an urban hospital referred to a university clinic. Methods Two hundred and forty-four (n[*]=[*] 224) women with CTS were included. Demographic and clinical data, duration of <b>symptoms,</b> function, <b>symptom's</b> <b>severity</b> of the <b>symptoms,</b> pain intensity, and depression were self-reported collected. Correlation and path analysis with maximum likelihood estimation were conducted to assess the direct and indirect effect of hand function on pain, age, years with the disease, <b>symptoms</b> <b>severity,</b> and depression. Results Significant positive correlations between function and pain intensity, years with pain and <b>symptoms</b> <b>severity</b> were observed. The path analysis found direct effects from depression, <b>symptoms</b> <b>severity,</b> and years with pain to function (all, P[*]<[*] 0. 01). Paths between function and depression on pain intensity (both, P[*]<[*] 0. 01) were also observed. The amount of function explained by all predictors was 22 %. The indirect effects in the path analysis revealed that function exerted an indirect effect from depression to pain intensity (B[*]=[*] 0. 18; P[*]<[*] 0. 01), and from <b>symptoms</b> <b>severity</b> to the intensity of pain (B[*]=[*] 0. 10; P[*]<[*] 0. 01).

25|$|There is a {{continuous}} spectrum of different clinical presentations from incontinence of flatus (gas), through incontinence of mucus or liquid stool, to solids. The term anal incontinence often {{is used to}} describe flatus incontinence, however it is also used as a synonym for FI generally. It may occur together with incontinence of liquids or solids, or it may present in isolation. Flatus incontinence {{may be the first}} sign of FI. Once continence to flatus is lost, it is rarely restored. Anal incontinence may be equally disabling as the other types. Fecal leakage, fecal soiling and fecal seepage are minor degrees of FI, and describe incontinence of liquid stool, mucus, or very small amounts of solid stool. They cover a spectrum of increasing <b>symptom</b> <b>severity</b> (staining, soilage, seepage and accidents). Rarely, minor FI in adults may be described as encopresis. Fecal leakage is a related topic to rectal discharge, but this term does not necessarily imply any degree of incontinence. Discharge generally refers to conditions where there is pus or increased mucus production, or anatomical lesions that prevent the anal canal from closing fully, whereas fecal leakage generally concerns disorders of IAS function and functional evacuation disorders which cause a solid fecal mass to be retained in the rectum. Solid stool incontinence may be called complete (or major) incontinence, and anything less as partial (or minor) incontinence (i.e. incontinence of flatus (gas), liquid stool and/or mucus).|$|E

Methods: In this prospective single-blinded study, 61 wrists of 47 patients randomized to open carpal tunnel release without (Group- 1) or with (Group- 2) flexor tenosynovectomy and microsurgical epineurectomy. Physical examination including Phalen and Tinel’s signs, visible thenar atrophy, two-point discrimination, and grip strength measurement was performed. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Quick Disability of Arm Shoulder Hand (DASH) Questionnaire, <b>Symptoms</b> <b>Severity</b> Scale, Functional Status Scale, and electrophysiological study were assessed. 				 					Results: The increase in the grip strength and Quick Disability of Arm Shoulder Hand Questionnaire score were significantly better in flexor tenosynovectomy and microsurgical epineurectomy group. The average pre-operative two-point discrimination was 6. 3  ±  2  mm in Group- 1 and 5. 8  ±  1. 7  mm in Group- 2. Post-operatively at the end of 12  months, the mean two-point discrimination was measured as 5. 9  ±  1. 6  mm in Group- 1 and 5. 6  ±  1. 3  mm in Group- 2.

40|$|Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common childhood-onset neuropsychiatric conditions. Despite {{extensive}} research, the etiopathophysiological factors underlying ADHD are not completely understood. It has been suggested that iron deficiency may contribute to ADHD <b>symptoms</b> <b>severity.</b> Whereas evidence from studies based on serum ferritin measures, a marker of peripheral iron status, is somewhat mixed, preliminary recent evidence suggests a deficiency of brain iron in individuals with ADHD. Therefore, it has been proposed that either a deficiency of peripheral iron or a dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier, in the presence of normal peripheral iron levels, may contribute to low brain iron levels, which, in turn, would increase the risk for ADHD symptoms in a subgroup of individuals with this disorder. It has also been found that individuals with ADHD may be at increased risk of severe cardiovascular events during treatment with ADHD drugs, although the extent to which this occurs in ADHD patients compared to non-ADHD individuals is still matter of investigation. Since iron depletion has been recently reported as a risk factor for adverse prognosis in heart failure, iron deficiency might contribute both to ADHD <b>symptoms</b> <b>severity</b> before treatment and to increased risk of severe cardiovascular events during treatment with ADHD drugs in a selected subgroup of patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that the effective treatment of iron deficiency might lead both to improvement of ADHD <b>symptoms</b> <b>severity</b> and to a decrease of the risk of cardiovascular events during treatment with ADHD drugs. If empirical studies confirm this hypothesis, the clinician would be advised to systematically check iron status and effectively treat iron deficiency before starting a pharmacological treatment with ADHD drugs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

A coordinated series of methods will be utilized to revise the current ICD- 10 {{to arrive at a}} new generation of classification.

The traditional form and uses of the ICD for mortality and morbidity reporting will be maintained. To assist additional needs different users the revised classification will have in three interoperable formats for primary care, clinical specialty care various knowledge domains such as constellation of signs and <b>symptoms,</b> <b>severity</b> and course, and research.

To assess peritraumatic reactions we employed the Physical Reactions Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire and Tonic Immobility questions. As confounding variables, we considered negative affect (measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Trait Version), sex and time elapsed since trauma. Results: Tonic immobility was the only predictor of PTSD <b>symptoms</b> <b>severity</b> that kept the statistical significance after controlling for potential confounders. Limitations: This study was based on a relatively small sample recruited in a tertiary clinic, a fact that may limit the generalizability of its findings. the retrospective design may have predisposed to recall bias. Conclusions: Our study provides good reason to conduct more research on tonic immobility in PTSD with other samples and with different time frames in an attempt to replicate these stimulating results.
