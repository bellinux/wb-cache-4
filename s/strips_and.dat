40|$|The {{transfer}} of electrical {{power from the}} overhead line to the train is carried out through the sliding contact between the pantograph’s contact <b>strip</b> <b>and</b> the overhead line’s contact wire. The state of the contact {{is defined by the}} current collection quality, where electrical arcs play a predominant role. Indeed, electrical arcs are generated when, during current collection, contact losses occur due to the dynamics of pantograph-catenary interaction. The main effects of the electrical arcs are electromagnetic disturbances and high values of local temperature on the <b>strip</b> <b>and</b> on the wire, which in turn cause an increase of wear rate on contact <b>strip</b> <b>and</b> contact wire. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze, by means of laboratory tests, the effect of electrical arc occurrence on the wear of <b>strip</b> <b>and</b> wire. Two different kinds of carbon based strip are considered: plain carbon <b>strip</b> <b>and</b> copper impregnated carbon strip. The contact wire considered in this work is a pure copper wire...|$|R

5|$|Colder October and November weather limited aerial {{activities}} {{over the}} NDH.

The Partisans were trying to secure and expand their territory {{in the eastern part}} of Yugoslavia, which they had liberated in the autumn of 1941. The ZNDH flew daily supply missions with their Avia-Fokker F.39 and due to the lack of other aircraft also used the venerable Breguets and Potez.

5|$|First {{described}} by the botanist Robert Brown in the early 19th century, no separate varieties of Banksia menziesii are recognised. It is found in Western Australia, from the Perth (32° S) region north to the Murchison River (27° S), and generally grows on sandy soils, in scrubland or low woodland. Banksia menziesii provides food for {{a wide array of}} invertebrate and vertebrate animals; birds and in particular honeyeaters are prominent visitors. A relatively hardy plant, Banksia menziesii is commonly seen in gardens, nature <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> parks in Australian urban areas with Mediterranean climates, but its sensitivity to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi makes it short-lived in places with humid summers, such as Sydney. Banksia menziesii is widely used in the cut flower industry both in Australia and overseas.|$|E
5|$|Hanging scroll: Hanging scrolls {{originated}} in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on bamboo <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> silk banners in ancient China. The earliest hanging scrolls {{are related to}} and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history. These banners were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui {{dating back to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives for hanging scrolls were summarized, which are still followed to this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), the scrolls became well suited to the art styles of the artists, consequently hanging scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.|$|E

5|$|In India carrots {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} ways, as salads or as {{vegetables}} added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in thin <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|E
5|$|Several manga {{based on}} the games have been {{published}}. The longest-running of these, , Warriors of Eden, and Maboroshi no Daichi, were published in Monthly Shōnen Gangan. Emblem of Roto, by Chiaki Kawamata and Junji Koyanagi, with art by Kamui Fujiwara, consists of twenty-one volumes published between 1991 and 1997. In 2004 Young Gangan ran a mini-series called Emblem of Roto Returns. It takes place between the timeframe of Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest I. Warriors of Eden consists of eleven volumes, with art by Fujiwara. The series is a retelling of Dragon Quest VII with some minor changes. Maboroshi no Daichi consists of ten volumes. The series is a retelling of Dragon QuestVI with some minor changes. Other shorter manga series have been released including several based on other games, some official 4koma <b>strips,</b> <b>and</b> a manga about {{the making of the}} original Dragon Quest game.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had {{maintained}} {{the attacks on}} airfields in south-western England which they had started the previous day. On 12 August, most of the Kentish airfields had been attacked; and on 13 August, the Germans concentrated on the second line airfields south of London. The concentration on Detling and Eastchurch was a failure, as both were Coastal Command stations and bore no relation to Fighter Command. The Germans may have reasoned that if bases such as Manston, Hawkinge and Lympne were neutralised through the attacks on 12 August, then Fighter Command may have had to move onto these airfields. In fact, the bombing of 12 August had failed to knock out these <b>strips,</b> <b>and</b> Adlertag had failed to destroy or render Detling or Eastchurch nonoperational. Owing to poor intelligence, weather conditions, and RAF resistance, attacks on other targets had failed or been unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E
5|$|Existing {{state funds}} {{were used for}} the first stages of the SR522 {{corridor}} project, including the addition of median rumble <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> improved pavement markers in 1995, which helped reduce head-on collisions. The city of Monroe replaced the eastern half of SR522 interchange with Main Street (164th Street Southeast) with a roundabout, the first to be built in Snohomish County, in 2001. The first stage of the corridor project was completed in 2001 and widened a section between SR9 and Paradise Lake Road (SR524) in Maltby, at a cost of $22 million. The second stage, a new single-point urban interchange at Echo Lake Road southwest of Monroe, was completed in 2006 at a cost of $37 million. The third stage of the SR522 corridor project was completed in 2014, widening the highway to four lanes across the Snohomish River and through Monroe to US2, where a new eastbound offramp was also constructed separately in 2012. A new roundabout at the 164th Street Southeast interchange was also opened as part of the project, completing the dogbone interchange.|$|E
5|$|Nestling {{birds are}} common prey, being taken more often from nests in trees {{rather than on}} the ground. Grey jays find them by moving from perch to perch and {{scanning}} surroundings. Avian nest predation by grey jays is not necessarily higher in fragmented versus unfragmented forest. Evidence from studies in the Pacific Northwest suggest a moderate increase in nest predation in logged plots adjacent to mature conifer forest, which is the grey jay's preferred habitat. Studies of nest predation by grey jays in Quebec have shown that the birds prefer preying on nests in open forest with high prominence of jack pine, and greater rates of predation in riparian forest <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> green-tree retention stands versus clearcuts. This may be due to increased availability of perch sites for avian predators such as the grey jay. Grey jays are suspected but not proven to prey on nests of the threatened marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) in coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
