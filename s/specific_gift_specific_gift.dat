50|$|Because honor played such a {{large role}} in these transactions, the heads of court who would be {{receiving}} these gifts were obliged to reciprocate these gifts {{in one form or another}} for a number of reasons. In Viking culture, people in power often maintained their positions of power by maintaining favor with their subjects, usually by hosting large feasts and ensuring their well-being in terms of food and shelter. The most important part of this was being willing to be conspicuous with one’s wealth, sharing it with the people who supported you, and if a visitor comes from far away with a <b>specific</b> <b>gift</b> to pay tribute to you, it would be in the leader’s best interest to repay their gift, showing that not only were they being honorable by repaying a gift, but these leaders would often attempt to go above and beyond in their gift giving in order to bolster their reputation and forge strong relationships with new people.

50|$|The couple often {{registers}} {{for gifts}} {{at a store}} {{well in advance of}} their wedding. This allows them to create a list of household items, usually including china, silverware and crystalware, linens or other fabrics, pots and pans, etc. Registries are intended to aid guests in selecting gifts the newlyweds truly want, and the service is sufficiently profitable that most retailers, from luxury shops to discount stores, offer the opportunity. Registry information should, according to etiquette, be provided only to guests upon direct request, and never included in the invitation. Some couples additionally or instead register with services that enable money gifts intended to fund items such as a honeymoon, home purchase or college fund. Some find bridal registries inappropriate as they contravene traditional notions behind gifts, such as that all gifts are optional and delightful surprises personally chosen by the giver, and that registries lead to a type of price-based competition, as the couple knows the cost of each gift. Traditionally, weddings were considered a personal event and inviting people to the wedding who are not known to at least one member of the couple well {{enough to be able to}} choose an appropriate gift was considered inappropriate, and registries should therefore be unnecessary. Whether considered appropriate or not, others believe that weddings are opportunities to extract funds or <b>specific</b> <b>gifts</b> from as many people as possible, and that even an invitation carries an expectation of monetary reward rather than merely congratulations.|$|R
60|$|But I do want {{to point}} out here that though these are {{reasonable}} and, to all undogmatic men, most helpful criticisms of the Socialist design, they are no sort of justification for things as they are. All the difficulties that the ordinary exposition of Socialism seems to leave unsolved are at least equally not solved now. Only rarely does the right man seem to struggle to his place of adequate opportunity. Men and women get their chance in various ways; some of implacable temper and versatile gifts thrust themselves to the position they need for the exercise of their powers; others display an astonishing facility in securing honours and occasions they can then only waste; others, outside their <b>specific</b> <b>gift,</b> are the creatures of luck or the victims of modesty, tactlessness or incapacity. Most of the large businesses of the world now {{are in the hands of}} private proprietors and managed either directly by an owner or by directors or managers acting for directors. The quality of promotion or the recognition of capacity varies very much in these great concerns, but they are on the whole probably inferior to the public services. Even where the administration is keenest it must be remembered it is not seeking the men who work the machine best, but the men who can work it cheapest and with the maximum of profit. It is pure romancing to represent the ordinary business magnate as being in perpetual search for capacity among the members of his staff. He wants them to get along and not make trouble.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is incorporated}} a cross-disciplinary range of perspectives in research. There is theological, historical and empirical research. Its essence consists therefore {{of a case}} study {{in the history of the}} international missionaries of the Assemblies of God in Great Britain and Northern Ireland 1965 - 2000. It does not attempt to simply relate a chronological account of what people did in various areas of the world. Rather it attempts to map the understanding of `the divine call' to mission work as perceived by these missionaries. This is fitted into the context of the time, politically, socially and economically as well as missiologically. The history of the understanding of `the divine call' through the centuries assists the understanding of how 20 `h Century people understand call. Then this is narrowed down to the Pentecostal fellowship known as the Assemblies of God. The research is conducted from the perspective of the home nation, the denominational directors of world mission and the missionaries themselves. The main sources are the original Minutes of the agency, their magazines and firsthand accounts through the means of questionnaires of the available missionaries; this is shown to be representative of the whole group from 1965 - 2000. The debate leads from the assumptions of an individualistic understanding of a primary and secondary `call', first to discipleship, secondly to a specific task in a specific location or operating from a <b>specific</b> <b>gift,</b> and on to a third aspect of how the local home churches themselves should be participants in the callings of their missionaries.

Gift-giving or dāna has been {{an integral part of}} Hindu dharma (religious ethics) particularly in relation to rājadharma (royal obligation) that had immense social and political implications in the empire of Vijayanagar, that ruled South India between c. 1336 and 1565 ACE. 3 The theory of gifting has been studied exhaustively by eminent scholars such as Marcel Mauss (1966) who emphasized the force of obligatory return and exchange and its creation of a set of relations. 4 Mariam Helm who based her research upon dāna in South Asia, concludes that it had an ethical basis 5 while Diana Eck (2013) examines dāna as an intricate aspect of dharma with its ethical and philosophical foundations. 6 In regard to the definition of dāna, the concept has been discussed elaborately in ancient Indian Hindu sacred texts including the Dānastutis in the RgVeda, Viśṇudharmottara Puraṇa (1912) and the Manusmriti; all the texts unequivocally agree about its importance for the sake of gaining puṇya (merit), pleasing the gods, obtainment of heaven and assurance of safety and protection. 7 The Viśṇusmriti and the Manusmriti clearly mention the particular benefits accrued by the giving of <b>specific</b> <b>gifts</b> (such as cows, gold, mountain, land, lamps, crops, knowledge, food, clothes, bed, shoes, fan etc.). 8 They explicitly state the importance of its acceptance, the charity to be directed towards worthy persons, the auspicious time, the ritual procedure of gift-giving and the spirit with which it should be done.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Liturgics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Chapter 1 {{emphasizes}} the central {{position that the}} worship service occupies {{in the life of}} the believer, but then the whole person of the believer. The atmosphere is therefore vital. This is researched in part 2 by an exegetical study of 1 Corinthians 1 - 14, as well as the rest of Scripture. The variations through history are also studied. The atmosphere in the worship service should be such that the worshipper meets God with the necessary awe and respect. The service must also create an atmosphere of love, warmth, friendliness, and joy. All present must be invited and made welcome by the service. The atmosphere must further encourage and create room for everybody to participate and use their <b>specific</b> <b>gifts.</b> It can therefore change from service to service and within a single service. Important instruments in the atmosphere are the liturgical space, symbols, rituals, physical movement, gestures, music, song and the senses. Part 3 studies the contribution of adjacent sciences, like the theory of communication, cognitive science, symbolism, music, architecture and multimedia. These sciences support the principles of part 2 and give important perspectives for the practical application thereof. The situation in practice is studied by empirical research. The atmosphere is clearly not sufficiently integrated in the worship service. Although some elements are present, they are purely coincidental. A specific aimed strategy is lacking. Part 4 tries to bridge the gap between the base theory (part 2) and the practice (part 3) by suggesting practical guidelines. Because every congregation is in a unique context, a model is given to realize the principles. The image of the 'house of God is used to summarize and explain the principles. The final conclusion is that atmosphere plays a vital role in the worship service. In practice very little is made hereof. If the Atmosphere in the worship service is adjusted to what it should (and can!) be, the worship service will come closer to the purpose for which it is there and will it become even more of a meeting of the total person with the totality of God and with the totality of the fellow believer and the world.

30|$|There {{are about}} nine inscriptional records which praise {{the gifts of}} Acyuta Raya who {{was known for his}} {{generosity}} and magnanimity. Acyuta Raya made numerous donations to temples, brāhmaṇas and poets with gifts of gold, villages and lands. 28 In fact, the king is said to have visited Kanchipuram in c. 1532 A.C.E. and had himself weighed against gold. Another record of Acyuta Raya is in the Vitthala temple which refers to the gift of the golden mountain suvarnameru c. 1533 ACE. 29 However, it is not certain whether the above mentioned gift giving scene (Fig. 2) depicts a <b>specific</b> <b>gift</b> made by the king or whether it represents a generic scene. Among the nine inscriptions of Acyuta Raya, seven in the Vitthala temple at Vijayanagara praise the king for the gift of pot of gold, ānandanidhi in August c. 1539 ACE. It is likely that the most likely gift-giving event would be that of ānandanidhi performed in c. 1539 ACE. as Acyuta Raya is said to have performed it several times. The gift of ānandanidhi, meaning a pot of gold made to the learned brāhmaṇas involved pots made of udambara wood filled with precious stones and coins of gold, silver or copper. It was performed in c. 1533 ACE. and in c. 1539 ACE. when gifts were given to brāhmaṇas. However, it is only the ānandanidhi gift of c. 1539 ACE that has been mentioned in seven of his nine gift-giving inscriptions at Vijayanagara. It has been mentioned twice in the Krishnaswamy temple, twice in the Acyuta Raya temple (one of these is on the gôpura of the temple), once in the Pattabhirama temple, once in the Cikkahude temple and once in the Vitthala temple. By the gift of c. 1539 ACE Acyuta Raya is said to have made the brāhmaṇas equal to Kubera, the god of wealth and the merit accruing from this ceremony is said to be longevity, perfect health and imperial sovereignty. 30 As the temple was built and consecrated in c. 1539 ACE. when the particular gift was made, the gift-giving scene on the pillar must have been carved at that time. The fact that the figures are not as well-finished as the other figures in the shrine supports the view that they must have been carved within a short time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pharmaceutical company representatives (PCRs) {{influence}} the prescribing habits and professional behaviour of physicians. However, the skills for interacting with PCRs are not {{taught in the}} traditional medical school curriculum. We examined whether an innovative, mandatory workshop for third year medical students had immediate effects on knowledge and attitudes regarding interactions with PCRs. Methods Surveys issued {{before and after the}} workshop intervention solicited opinions (five point Likert scales) from third year students (n = 75) about the degree of bias in PCR information, the influence of PCRs on prescribing habits, the acceptability of <b>specific</b> <b>gifts,</b> and the educational value of PCR information for both practicing physicians and students. Two faculty members and one PCR led the workshop, which highlighted typical physician-PCR interactions, the use of samples and gifts, the validity and legal boundaries of PCR information, and associated ethical issues. Role plays with the PCR demonstrated appropriate and inappropriate strategies for interacting with PCRs. Results The majority of third year students (56 %, 42 / 75) had experienced more than three personal conversations with a PCR about a drug product since starting medical school. Five percent (4 / 75) claimed no previous personal experience with PCRs. Most students (57. 3 %, 43 / 75) were not aware of available guidelines regarding PCR interactions. Twenty-eight percent of students (21 / 75) thought that none of the named activities/gifts (lunch access, free stethoscope, textbooks, educational CD-ROMS, sporting events) should be restricted, while 24. 0 % (8 / 75) thought that students should be restricted only from sporting events. The perceived educational value of PCR information to both practicing physicians and students increased after the workshop intervention from 17. 7 % to 43. 2 % (chi square, p =. 0001), and 22. 1 % to 40. 5 % (p =. 0007), respectively. Student perceptions of the degree of bias of PCR information decreased from 84. 1 % to 72. 9 % (p =. 065), but the perceived degree of influence on prescribing increased (44. 2 % to 62. 1 % (p =. 02)). Conclusions Students have exposure to PCRs early in their medical training. A single workshop intervention may influence student attitudes toward interactions with PCRs. Students were more likely to acknowledge the educational value of PCR interactions and their impact on prescribing after the workshop intervention. </p...|$|R
