30|$|A {{low-cost}} {{technology of}} treating furs with different contents of fatty substances was developed, which {{involves the use}} of solutions based on electrochemically activated water. The technology foresees substantial economy of water and chemical reagents, a two to threefold accceleration of soaking and tanning processes, and the formation of fur materials with necessary physical/chemical properties. The exclusion of such toxic reagents as formalin and <b>sodium</b> <b>silicofluoride</b> from treatment allows to regard this technology as ecologically safe compared to other technologies of fur manufacture.|$|E
40|$|Some have {{hypothesized}} that community water containing <b>sodium</b> <b>silicofluoride</b> and hydrofluosilicic acid may increase blood lead (PbB) concentrations in children by leaching of lead from water conduits and by increasing absorption of lead from water. Our analysis aimed {{to evaluate the}} relation between water fluoridation method and PbB concentrations in children. We used PbB concentration data (n = 9, 477) from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 – 1994) for children 1 – 16 years of age, merged with water fluoridation data from the 1992 Fluoridation Census. The main outcome measure was geometric mean PbB concentration, and covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty status, urbanicity, and length of time living in residence. Geometric mean PbB concentrations for each water fluoridation method were 2. 40 µg/dL (<b>sodium</b> <b>silicofluoride),</b> 2. 34 µg/dL (hydrofluosilicic acid), 1. 78 µg/dL (sodium fluoride), 2. 24 µg/dL (natural fluoride and no fluoride), and 2. 14 µg/dL (unknown/mixed status). In multiple linear and logistic regression, there was a statistical interaction between water fluoridation method and year in which dwelling was built. Controlling for covariates, water fluoridation method was significant only in the models that included dwellings built before 1946 and dwellings of unknown age. Across stratum-specific models for dwellings of known age, neithe...|$|E

Expandable micas seem to be formed by the transformation from talc taking place without he entire disruption of the original atomic arrangement. This takes place with the loss of one Mg 2 + from an octahedral site and by the intercalation ofevery two Na + into the interlayer site of talc.

40|$|THE use of {{fluoride}} compounds {{other than}} the sodium salt in fluoridation programs has been questioned, ' since data are not available to indicate if all inorganic fluoride compounds furnish equal numbers of fluoride ions to the organism, thus commensurately reducing dental caries. McClure 2 con-cluded that sodium fluoride and <b>sodium</b> <b>silicofluoride</b> produce equal fluoride storage in the skeleton of the rat, thus indicating that equal amounts are metabolically available. However, no data are available in which the metabolism (the amount excreted in the feces and urine {{in relation to the}} amount ingested) of the 2 fluorides is compared in addition to the skeletal storage. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the metabolism of small concentrations of fluorine (at levels similar to those which are produced in artificially fortified fluorine-deficient communal water supplies) furnished as sodium fluoride, sodium silico-fluoride, and stannous fluoride. 3 - 5 PROCEDURE A total of 9 rats (Sprague-Dawley strain) from three 30 -day-old litter...|$|E
30|$|The {{influence}} of characteristics of electrochemically activated aqueous processing mediums {{in the treatment}} of fur skins with different contents of fatty substances was investigated. The use of electroactive water, namely anolytes and catholytes, forgoing antiseptics or surface-active materials, helped to restore the hydration of fur skins and to remove from them soluble proteins, carbohydrates and fatty substances. The activating effect of anolyte and catholyte in solutions of water on the processes of treating raw furs is explained by their special physical and chemical properties, namely the presence of free radicals, ions and molecules of water which easily penetrate cells’ membranes and into the structure of non-collagen components and microfiber structure of dermic collagen. The stage of lengthy acid and salt treatment is excluded from the technical treatment as a result of using electroactivated water with high oxidizing power. A low-cost technology of processing different kinds of fur with the use of electroactivated water provides for substantial economy of water and chemical reagents, a two to threefold acceleration of the soaking and tanning processes and creation of highly elastic fur materials with a specified set of physical and chemical properties. At the same time the technology of preparatory processes of fur treatment excludes the use of such toxic antiseptics as formalin and <b>sodium</b> <b>silicofluoride,</b> which gives grounds to regard it as ecologically safe.|$|E
40|$|Fluoride in {{drinking}} water may be present from natural sources or added as sodium fluoride (NaF), <b>sodium</b> <b>silicofluoride</b> (Na 2 SiF 6) or fluorosilicic acid (H 2 SiF 6). Results from an early study with rats suggested that, when ingested as Na 2 SiF 6, the absorption and excretion of fluoride were greater than when ingested as NaF. Objective: The present single-blind, crossover study with 10 adults was done to determine three key pharmacokinetic parameters: the maximum plasma fluoride concentrations (C-max), the elapsed time to reach the maximum concentrations (T-max) and the 6 -h areas under the time-plasma concentration curves (AUCs) after ingestion of 500 ml, of water containing 0. 67 or 5. 45 mg F/L present naturally or added as NaF or H 2 SiF 6. Design: Blood was collected prior to and at nine time points during 6 h after ingestion of the test solutions. Plasma was analysed by electrode after HMDS-facilitated diffusion and the data were analysed for statistically significant differences using repeated measures ANOVA. Results: The C-max, T-max and AUC values after ingestion of the solutions containing natural fluoride, NaF or H 2 SiF 6 {{did not differ significantly}} at either dose level. Further, the Tmax values associated with the 0. 67 and SAS mg/L solutions did not differ significantly indicating that the absorption, distribution and elimination rates were not affected by the dose size. Conclusions: Considered together with published reports, the present findings support the conclusion that the major features of fluoride metabolism are not affected differently by the chemical compounds commonly used to fluoridate water nor are they affected by whether the fluoride is present naturally or added artificially.
