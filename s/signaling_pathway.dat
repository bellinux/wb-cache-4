At present the signal transduction networks are far from complete. As an effective complement to experimental methods, computational modeling is suited to rapidly reconstruct the <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> at low cost.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered {{by a variety of}} modulators. For example, the steroid hormone estradiol may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent dendritic spine growth. Additionally, β-adrenergic receptor agonists such as norepinephrine may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. Nitric oxide synthase activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, activation of dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway.</b>|$|E

25|$|There are {{primarily}} two ways that networks can evolve, {{both of which}} can occur simultaneously. The first is that network topology can be changed by the addition or subtraction of nodes (genes) or parts of the network (modules) may be expressed in different contexts. The Drosophila Hippo <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> provides a good example. The Hippo <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> controls both mitotic growth and post-mitotic cellular differentiation. Recently {{it was found that}} the network the Hippo <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> operates in differs between these two functions which in turn changes the behavior of the Hippo <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway.</b> This suggests that the Hippo <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> operates as a conserved regulatory module that can be used for multiple functions depending on context. Thus, changing network topology can allow a conserved module to serve multiple functions and alter the final output of the network. The second way networks can evolve is by changing the strength of interactions between nodes, such as how strongly a transcription factor may bind to a cis-regulatory element. Such variation in strength of network edges has been shown to underlie between species variation in vulva cell fate patterning of Caenorhabditis worms.|$|E

HbF inducer agents can trigger several molecular <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> critical for erythropoiesis. Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), mitogen activated protein kinas (MAPK) and Phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) are considered as main <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways,</b> which may {{play a significant role}} in HbF induction. All these <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> are triggered by erythropoietin (EPO) as the main growth factor inducing erythroid differentiation, when it binds to its cell surface receptor, EPO-R. HbF inducer agents have been shown to upregulate HbF production level by triggering certain <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways.</b> As a result, understanding the pivotal <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> influencing HbF induction leads to effective upregulation of HbF. In this mini review article, we try to consider the correlation between HbF inducer agents and their molecular mechanisms of γ-globin upregulation. Several studies suggest that activating P 38 MAPK, RAS and STAT 5 <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> result in efficient HbF induction. Nevertheless, the role of other erythroid <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> in HbF induction seems to be indispensible and should be emphasized...|$|R
40|$|The {{plant hormones}} brassinosteroid (BR) and {{gibberellin}} (GA) have {{important roles in}} a wide range of processes involved in plant growth and development. In this paper we derive and analyse new mathematical models for the BR <b>signalling</b> <b>pathway</b> and for the crosstalk between the BR and GA <b>signalling</b> <b>pathways.</b> To analyse the effects of spatial heterogeneity of the signalling processes, along with spatially-homogeneous ODE models we derive coupled PDE-ODE systems modelling the temporal and spatial dynamics of molecules involved in the <b>signalling</b> <b>pathways.</b> The values of the parameters in the model for the BR <b>signalling</b> <b>pathway</b> are determined using experimental data on the gene expression of BR biosynthetic enzymes. The stability of steady state solutions of our mathematical model, shown for a wide range of parameters, can be related to the BR homeostasis. Our results for the crosstalk model suggest that the interaction between transcription factors BZR and DELLA exerts more influence on the dynamics of the <b>signalling</b> <b>pathways</b> than BZR-mediated biosynthesis of GA, suggesting that the interaction between transcription factors may constitute the principal mechanism of the crosstalk between the BR and GA <b>signalling</b> <b>pathways.</b> In general, perturbations in the GA <b>signalling</b> <b>pathway</b> have larger effects on the dynamics of components of the BR <b>signalling</b> <b>pathway</b> than perturbations in the BR <b>signalling</b> <b>pathway</b> on the dynamics of the GA pathway. The perturbation in the crosstalk mechanism also has a larger effect on the dynamics of the BR pathway than of the GA pathway. Large changes in the dynamics of the GA signalling processes can be observed only in the case where there are disturbances in both the BR <b>signalling</b> <b>pathway</b> and the crosstalk mechanism.

40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} plays a {{key role}} in the development of type 2 diabetes. It arises from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental and lifestyle factors including lack of physical exercise and poor nutrition habits. The increased risk of type 2 diabetes is molecularly based on defects in insulin signaling, insulin secretion, and inflammation. The present review aims to give an overview on the molecular mechanisms underlying the uptake of glucose and related <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> after acute and chronic exercise. Physical exercise, as crucial part in the prevention and treatment of diabetes, has marked acute and chronic effects on glucose disposal and related inflammatory <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways.</b> Exercise can stimulate molecular <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> leading to glucose transport into the cell. Furthermore, physical exercise has the potential to modulate inflammatory processes by affecting specific inflammatory <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> which can interfere with <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> of the glucose uptake.
