40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Rip {{currents}} pose {{a serious}} danger to visitors of bathing beaches; {{they are also}} an important process in surf zone circulation. Haller et al. [2014] demonstrated that <b>shore-based</b> X-band <b>radar</b> {{can be used to}} compliment in situ measurements of rip currents.

Herein, we analyze the expected radar backscatter characteristics of a rip current, which also contains a surf zone eddy, in order to assess their detectability by radar. The approach follows the method of Rascle et al. [2014] whereby the changes to the mean square slope (mss) of the water surface, calculated based on the surface current deformation tensor, are taken as directly related to radar backscatter intensity. The rip current and surf zone eddy were modeled using pre-existing idealized flow fields. The mss anomaly results show that the imaging mechanism of rip currents is dependent on both the surface current divergence and strain in the wind direction. The level of dependency on these two deformation tensor components varies in the rip current and surf zone eddy. The expected mss anomaly was then qualitatively compared to existing radar measurements from a field experiment and shown to have a similar brightness pattern and structure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Sea surface {{currents}} in coastal oceans are accessible to continuous direct observations by <b>shore-based</b> high-frequency Doppler <b>radar</b> systems. Inferring current structure {{in shallow water}} from such surface current observations is attempted. The approach assumes frictionally dominated flow and vertically varying current velocity {{on the scale of}} the Ekman boundary layer. The approximation of the velocity variation with depth is consequently derivable in terms of orthogonal basis functions from the sea surface kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions; specifically, the viscous momentum and shear equations evaluated at the sea surface. The inference procedure developed is demonstrated with sea surface data obtained in the coastal High-Resolution Remote Sensing Experiment on the continental shelf off Cape Hatteras. Despite uncertainties in the surface measurements, qualitative agreement is obtained between the inferred subsurface current and the current measured in situ. The sensitivity of the inference to the measurement uncertainties {{as well as to the}} model assumptions is investigated, and the inferred result is found to be generally robust. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePerhaps for {{the first}} time, {{satellite}} altimeters provided transects of the 12 / 26 / 04 tsunami elevation across the Indian Ocean, while the event unfolded. Here we use well-established Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radar technology, to develop a method that could provide warning of an incoming tsunami to coastal populations. When a tsunami reaches the continental shelf, the mostly depth-uniform current it induces greatly increases in speed (maybe up to 10 - 20 cm/s) and may induce significant Doppler shifts in ocean surface waves, particularly for those of smaller wavelength (high frequency). Given proper processing, such shifts could be identified by <b>shore-based</b> UHF <b>radars</b> as a tsunami signature and trigger a warning. Due to the tsunami slowing down with decreasing water depth, from the shelf break to shore, warning times of 5 - 15 minutes could be conceivable, depending on the shelf width, which could be sufficient to proceed with vertical evacuation in exposed areas. Here, we use a Higher Order Spectral (HOS) Method to model fully nonlinear sea states caused by wind, down to typical UHF wavelength of order 10 cm, as well as Doppler shifts and wave shoaling/refraction caused by slowly varying depth uniform currents. Such currents can be obtained for selected case studies, e. g., from tsunami propagation modeling, using a standard long wave model.

We first validate two models simulating tsunami generation by deforming submarine mass failures (SMFs) against laboratory experiments for SMF made of glass beads moving down a steep slope. These are two-layer models, in which the upper layer is water, simulated with the non-hydrostatic 3 D non-hydrostatic model NHWAVE, and the SMF bottom layer is simulated with depth-integrated equations and represented either as a dense Newtonian fluid or a granular medium. ^ At most nearshore locations surface elevations caused by the rigid slump are significantly larger (up to a factor of 2) than those caused by the 3 deforming slides. Hence, the rigid slump provides a conservative estimate of SMF tsunami impact in terms of maximum inundation/runup at the coast, while using a more realistic rheology with some level of SMF deformation, in general, leads to a reduced tsunami impact at the coast. This validates as conservative the tsunami hazard assessment and inundation mapping performed to date as part of NTHMP, on the basis of Currituck SMF proxies simulated as rigid slump. ^ Algorithms for tsunami detection by High Frequency Radar : development and case studies for tsunami impact in British Columbia, Canada.

In a previous work, they validated this algorithm for idealized tsunami wave trains propagating over a simple sea floor geometry in a direction normally incident to shore.

However, little is known {{of the effect of}} installing and operating these devices. The NERC/DEFRA collaboration FLOWBEC- 4 D (Flow, Water column & Benthic Ecology 4 D) is investigating these effects at test sites in Orkney (EMEC) and Cornwall (Wave Hub), combining the data from bird observations, <b>shore-based</b> marine X-band <b>radar</b> surveys of wave and current data, detailed modelling of the flow and water column, passive acoustic monitoring and the deployment of a remote-sensing sonar platform.

The first field deployments are planned for May-July 2012 with first underwater tests earlier in spring. Self-contained and intended to be deployed for 2 weeks at a time with short turnaround times between deployments, this platform is based on the Imagenex Delta T multibeam sonar (260 kHz) with associated power supplies, instrumentation and data recording devices. The sonar faces vertically upwards with the multibeam swath orientated parallel to the tidal flow. Versatile duty cycling allows acoustic snapshots at specific intervals of interest. Range and volume backscatter intensity measurements are used to reconstruct the evolution of the environment around the sonar.

Two maritime security threats (Reds) are a hijacked large ship carrying dangerous cargo or a SB manned by terrorists attempting to cause damage to other vessels or the port. The Red SB can either conduct a direct attack or a sneak attack by hiding among other neutral SBs. The defense force consists of shore-based sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and patrol craft (PC). The <b>shore-based</b> <b>radar</b> and the UAVs classify unidentified vessels as suspicious or not suspicious and suspicious SB must be inspected by a USV or PC. Analytical models are introduced to analyze requirements for numbers of surveillance assets and to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} CONOPS to achieve a desired probability of detecting and intercepting the threat. They incorporate both differential equations and probabilistic arguments. Results indicate that if the UAVs generate many false positives then the USVs and PCs have a higher workload which decreases the probability of detecting a threat. USVs and PCs should give a high priority to inspecting suspicious SBs rather than identifying unsuspicious SBs to achieve a higher probability of detecting a threat.

40|$|International audienceWhere coastal tsunami hazard {{is governed}} by {{near-field}} sources, such as submarine mass failures or meteo-tsunamis, tsunami propagation times may be too small for a detection based on deep or shallow water buoys. To offer sufficient warning time, it has been proposed to implement early warning systems relying on high-frequency (HF) radar remote sensing, that can provide a dense spatial coverage as far offshore as 200 - 300 km (e. g., for Diginext Ltd. 's Stradivarius <b>radar).</b> <b>Shore-based</b> HF <b>radars</b> {{have been used to}} measure nearshore currents (e. g., CODAR SeaSonde(A (R)) system;), by inverting the Doppler spectral shifts, these cause on ocean waves at the Bragg frequency. Both modeling work and an analysis of radar data following the Tohoku 2011 tsunami, have shown that, given proper detection algorithms, such radars could be used to detect tsunami-induced currents and issue a warning. However, long wave physics is such that tsunami currents will only rise above noise and background currents (i. e., be at least 10 - 15 cm/s), and become detectable, in fairly shallow water which would limit the direct detection of tsunami currents by HF radar to nearshore areas, unless there is a very wide shallow shelf. Here, we use numerical simulations of both HF radar remote sensing and tsunami propagation to develop and validate a new type of tsunami detection algorithm that does not have these limitations. To simulate the radar backscattered signal, we develop a numerical model including second-order effects in both wind waves and radar signal, with the wave angular frequency being modulated by a time-varying surface current, combining tsunami and background currents. In each ``radar cell'', the model represents wind waves with random phases and amplitudes extracted from a specified (wind speed dependent) energy density frequency spectrum, and includes effects of random environmental noise and background current; phases, noise, and background current are extracted from independent Gaussian distributions. The principle of the new algorithm is to compute correlations of HF radar signals measured/simulated in many pairs of distant ``cells'' located along the same tsunami wave ray, shifted in time by the tsunami propagation time between these cell locations; both rays and travel time are easily obtained as a function of long wave phase speed and local bathymetry. It is expected that, {{in the presence of a}} tsunami current, correlations computed as a function of range and an additional time lag will show a narrow elevated peak near the zero time lag, whereas no pattern in correlation will be observed in the absence of a tsunami current; this is because surface waves and background current are uncorrelated between pair of cells, particularly when time-shifted by the long-wave propagation time. This change in correlation pattern can be used as a threshold for tsunami detection. To validate the algorithm, we first identify key features of tsunami propagation in the Western Mediterranean Basin, where Stradivarius is deployed, by way of direct numerical simulations with a long wave model. Then, for the purpose of validating the algorithm we only model HF radar detection for idealized tsunami wave trains and bathymetry, but verify that such idealized case studies capture well the salient tsunami wave physics. Results show that, in the presence of strong background currents, the proposed method still allows detecting a tsunami with currents as low as 0. 05 m/s, whereas a standard direct inversion based on radar signal Doppler spectra fails to reproduce tsunami currents weaker than 0. 15 - 0. 2 m/s. Hence, the new algorithm allows detecting tsunami arrival in deeper water, beyond the shelf and further away from the coast, and providing an early warning. Because the standard detection of tsunami currents works well at short range, we envision that, in a field situation, the new algorithm could complement the standard approach of direct near-field detection by providing a warning that a tsunami is approaching, at larger range and in greater depth. This warning would then be confirmed at shorter range by a direct inversion of tsunami currents, from which the magnitude of the tsunami would also estimated. Hence, both algorithms would be complementary. In future work, the algorithm will be applied to actual tsunami case studies performed using a state-of-the-art long wave model, such as briefly presented here in the Mediterranean Basin...|$|R
40|$|This {{body of work}} uses {{state of}} the art {{numerical}} models to assess and reduce tsunami hazard. The first manuscript describes the use of these models to explore nonlinear interaction between tide and tsunami in the context of hazard assessment. Inundation due to several probable maximum tsunamis (PMTs) is considered in the Hudson River Estuary (HRE). Of the sources considered, a submarine mass failure (SMF) poses the most significant tsunami threat in this region and across the entire US East Coast. The next manuscript focuses on the how SMF mechanics effect tsunami generation. In addition to inundation, SMF tsunamis are dangerous because of their short or nonexistent warning times. The final manuscript discusses developments to an algorithm which extend the range of tsunami detection by <b>shore-based</b> HF <b>radar,</b> thereby increasing warning times. Tsunami hazard assessment in the Hudson River Estuary based on dynamic tsunami-tide simulation The first manuscript is part of a tsunami inundation mapping activity carried out along the US East Coast (USEC) since 2010, under the auspice of the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation program (NTHMP). Two densely built low-lying regions are situated along this coast: Chesapeake Bay and HRE. HRE is the object of this work, with specific focus on assessing tsunami hazard in Manhattan, the Hudson River and East River areas. In the NTHMP work, inundation maps are computed as envelopes of maximum surface elevation along the coast and inland, by simulating the impact of selected PMTs in the Atlantic Ocean margin and basin. At present, such simulations assume a static reference level near shore equal to the local mean high water (MHW) level. Instead we simulate maximum inundation resulting from dynamic interactions between the incident PMTs and a tide, which is calibrated to achieve MHW at its maximum level. To identify conditions leading to maximum tsunami inundation, each PMT is simulated at four different phases of the tide and results are compared to those obtained for a static reference level in the HRE. We conclude that changes in inundation resulting from the inclusion of a dynamic tide in the specific case of the HRE, although of scientific interest, are not significant for tsunami hazard assessment and that the standard approach of specifying a static reference level equal to MHW is conservative. However, in other estuaries with similarly complex bathymetry/topography and stronger tidal currents, a simplified static approach might not be appropriate. Modeling coastal tsunami hazard from submarine mass failures: effect of slide rheology, experimental validation, and case studies of the US East coast We first validate two models simulating tsunami generation by deforming submarine mass failures (SMFs) against laboratory experiments for SMF made of glass beads moving down a steep slope. These are two-layer models, in which the upper layer is water, simulated with the non-hydrostatic 3 D (-layer) non-hydrostatic model NHWAVE, and the SMF bottom layer is simulated with depth-integrated equations and represented either as a dense Newtonian fluid or a granular medium. Using the dense fluid model, we assess model convergence with grid resolution, and sensitivity of slide motion and generated surface elevations to slide parameters. A more limited validation is conducted for the granular slide model. Both models can accurately simulate time series of surface elevations measured at 4 gages, while providing a good simulation of both the geometry and kinematics of the moving slide material. The viscous slide model, which at present {{is the only one that}} can be applied to an arbitrary bottom bathymetry, is then used to simulate the historic Currituck SMF motion, in order to determine relevant viscous slide parameters to simulate SMF tsunamis on the east coast. The same parameters are then applied to simulate tsunami generation from a possible SMF sited near the Hudson River Canyon. Simulations are performed for 3 deforming slides with different dissipation parameters and the rigid slump, and results compared; all SMFs have the same initial volume, location, and geometry. Simulations of tsunami propagation are then done for the tsunamis in two levels of nested grids, using the Boussinesq model FUNWAVE-TVD, and maximum surface elevations computed along a 5 m depth contour off of the coast of New Jersey and New York. At most nearshore locations surface elevations caused by the rigid slump are significantly larger (up to a factor of 2) than those caused by the 3 deforming slides. Hence, the rigid slump provides a conservative estimate of SMF tsunami impact in terms of maximum inundation/runup at the coast, while using a more realistic rheology with some level of SMF deformation, in general, leads to a reduced tsunami impact at the coast. This validates as conservative the tsunami hazard assessment and inundation mapping performed to date as part of NTHMP, on the basis of Currituck SMF proxies simulated as rigid slump. Algorithms for tsunami detection by High Frequency Radar : development and case studies for tsunami impact in British Columbia, Canada To mitigate the tsunami hazard along the shores of Vancouver Island in British Columbia (Canada), Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) has been developing a Tsunami EarlyWarning System (TEWS), combining instruments (seismometers, pressure sensors) deployed on the sea floor as part of their Neptune Observatory, and a <b>shore-based</b> High-Frequency (HF) <b>radar.</b> This HF radar can remotely sense ocean currents up to a 80 km range, based on the Doppler shift they cause in ocean waves at the radar Bragg frequency. Using this method, however, tsunami detection is limited to shallow water areas where they are sufficiently large due to shoaling and, hence, to the continental shelf. To extend detection range into deep water, thereby increasing warning time, the authors have proposed a new detection algorithm based on spatial correlations of the raw radar signal at two distant locations along the same wave ray. In a previous work, they validated this algorithm for idealized tsunami wave trains propagating over a simple sea floor geometry in a direction normally incident to shore. In the final manuscript, this algorithm is extended and validated for realistic tsunami case studies conducted for seismic sources and using the bathymetry off of Vancouver Island, BC. Tsunami currents computed with a state-of-the-art long wave model are spatially averaged over the HF radar cells aligned along individual wave rays, obtained by solving geometric optic equations. A model simulating the radar backscattered signal in space and time as a function of the simulated tsunami currents is applied for the characteristics of the WERA HF radar deployed by ONC near Tofino, BC. Finally, numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm works on realistic tsunami data. This is used to develop relevant correlation thresholds for tsunami detection...|$|R
40|$|The Alliance for Coastal Technologies (ACT) {{convened a}} {{workshop}} on "Wave Sensor Technologies" in St. Petersburg, Florida on March 7 - 9, 2007, {{hosted by the}} University of South Florida (USF) College of Marine Science, an ACT partner institution. The primary objectives of this workshop were to: 1) define {{the present state of}} wave measurement technologies, 2) identify the major impediments to their advancement, and 3) make strategic recommendations for future development and on the necessary steps to integrate wave measurement sensors into operational coastal ocean observing systems. The participants were from various sectors, including research scientists, technology developers and industry providers, and technology users, such as operational coastal managers and coastal decision makers. Waves consistently are ranked as a critical variable for numerous coastal issues, from maritime transportation to beach erosion to habitat restoration. For the purposes of this workshop, the participants focused on measuring "wind waves" (i. e., waves on the water surface, generated by the wind, restored by gravity and existing between approximately 3 and 30 -second periods), although it was recognized that a wide range of both forced and free waves exist on and in the oceans. Also, whereas the workshop put emphasis on the nearshore coastal component of wave measurements, the participants also stressed the importance of open ocean surface waves measurement. Wave sensor technologies that are presently available for both environments include bottom-mounted pressure gauges, surface following buoys, wave staffs, acoustic Doppler current profilers, and <b>shore-based</b> remote sensing <b>radar</b> instruments. One of the recurring themes of workshop discussions was the dichotomous nature of wave data users. The two separate groups, open ocean wave data users and the nearshore/coastal wave data users, have different requirements. Generally, the user requirements increase both in spatial/temporal resolution and precision as one moves closer to shore. Most ocean going mariners are adequately satisfied with measurements of wave period and height and a wave general direction. However, most coastal and nearshore users require at least the first five Fourier parameters ("First 5 ") : wave energy and the first four directional Fourier coefficients. Furthermore, wave research scientists would like sensors capable of providing measurements beyond the first four Fourier coefficients. It was debated whether or not high precision wave observations in one location can take the place of a less precise measurement at a different location. This could be accomplished by advancing wave models and using wave models to extend data to nearby areas. However, the consensus was that models are no substitution for in situ wave data.
