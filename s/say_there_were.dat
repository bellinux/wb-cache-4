25|$|Simultaneously {{with these}} conflicts, bison, a {{keystone}} species {{and the primary}} protein source that Native people had survived on for centuries were being destroyed. Some estimates <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> over 13 million bison in Montana in 1870. In 1875, General Philip Sheridan pleaded to {{a joint session of}} Congress to authorize the slaughtering of herds in order to deprive the Indians of their source of food. By 1884, commercial hunting had brought bison to the verge of extinction; only about 325 bison remained in the entire United States.|$|E
25|$|The authors <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> two {{possible}} ways of erecting the stauros, which {{would probably have}} been not much higher than the height of a man. The condemned man could be fastened to the cross lying on the ground at the place of execution, then lifted up on it. Alternatively, it was probably usual to have the stake implanted in the ground before the execution. The victim was tied to the crosspiece and was hoisted up with the horizontal beam and made fast to the vertical stake. They say that as this was the simpler form of erection, and the carrying of the crossbeam (patibulum) was probably a form of punishment for slaves, the crux commissa may be taken as the normal practice.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. IGN contributor Robert Canning {{felt that}} the episode [...] "didn't have the same comedic appeal" [...] as [...] "Klaus and Greta", but did <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> [...] "some funny moments to be sure", but overall the episode lacked. He commented that the main plot had its faults, but that the weak link in the story was Cheyenne Jackson's Danny. He wrote that the Sue character had been great in the past, but that her [...] "expanded role" [...] in this episode was less successful. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff wrote that [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] was [...] "dead in spots. I mean, I laughed out loud a number of times, {{but not nearly as}} much". He noted he liked Liz and Jack battling over Danny, but [...] "something about it never landed in the way it should have", and opined that the show {{did not know what to}} do with Jackson. Overall, he gave the episode a B rating. Sean Gandert for Paste {{felt that the}} Liz, Jack, and Danny plot was less interesting [...] "and in general pretty meh." [...] He noted that [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] was [...] "a big let-down" [...] after the airing of [...] "Klaus and Greta". Leonard Pierce for The A.V. Club called the episode uneven.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{he was the}} {{youngest}} of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred [...] "could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to <b>say,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time".|$|E

2500|$|... 27 April 2008: Insurgents, {{reportedly}} {{from the}} Haqqani network, used automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades {{to attack a}} military parade that Karzai was attending in Kabul. Karzai was safe, but at least three people were killed, including a parliamentarian, a ten-year-old girl and a minority leader, and ten injured. Others attending the event included government ministers, former warlords, diplomats and the military top brass, {{all of whom had}} gathered to mark the 16th anniversary of the fall of the Afghan communist government to the mujahideen. Responding to the attack during the ceremony, the UN said the attackers [...] "have shown their utter disrespect for the history and people of Afghanistan." [...] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack, stating, [...] "We fired rockets {{at the scene of the}} celebration." [...] He went on to <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> 6 Taliban at the scene and that 3 were killed. [...] "Our aim was not to directly hit someone," [...] Mujahed said when asked if the intention was to kill Karzai. [...] "We just wanted to show to the world that we can attack anywhere we want to". The ability of the attackers to get so close to Karzai suggested they had inside help. Defense minister Wardak confirmed that a police captain was connected with the group behind the assassination attempt and that an army officer supplied the weapons and ammunition used in the attack.|$|E
