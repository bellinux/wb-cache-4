IG Farben purchased prisoners for human experimentation of a <b>sleep-inducing</b> <b>drug</b> and later reported that all test subjects died. IG Farben employees frequently said, [...] "If you don’t work faster, you’ll be gassed." [...] IG Farben held a large investment in Degesch which produced Zyklon B used to gas and kill prisoners during the Holocaust.|$|E

40|$|Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), {{the major}} {{inhibitory}} neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, {{is also known}} to be important for brain development. Therefore, disturbances of GABA receptor (GABA-R) mediated signaling (GABA-R signal) during brain development may influence normal brain maturation and cause late-onset brain malfunctions. In this study, we examined whether the temporal stimulation of the GABA-R signal during brain development induces late-onset adverse effects on the brain in adult male mice. To stimulate the GABA-R signal, we used either the benzodiazepine <b>sleep-inducing</b> <b>drug</b> triazolam (TZ) or the non-benzodiazepine drug zolpidem (ZP). We detected deficits in learning and memory in mice treated with TZ during the juvenile period, {{as seen in the}} fear conditioning test. On the other hand, ZP administration during the juvenile period had little effect. In addition, decreased protein expression of GluR 1 and GluR 4, which are excitatory neurotransmitter receptors, was detected in the hippocampi of mice treated with TZ during the juvenile period. We measured mRNA expression of the immediate early genes (IEGs), which are neuronal activity markers, in the hippocampus shortly after the administration of TZ or ZP to juvenile mice. Decreased IEG expression was detected in mice with juvenile TZ administration, but not in mice with juvenile ZP administration. Our findings demonstrate that TZ administration during the juvenile period can induce irreversible brain dysfunction in adult mice. It may need to take an extra care for the prescription of benzodiazepine sleep-inducing drugs to juveniles because it might cause late onset learning and memory defects...|$|E
40|$|Dr Wells, {{a general}} practitioner, {{looks at the}} problem of {{barbiturate}} dependence {{from the point of}} view of the prescribing doctor who has to choose for his patients - of all ages - the drug, usually a hypnotic, which is sought for insomnia or states of anxiety and stress. He argues that it is wise to prescribe non-barbiturates, but that even in elderly people it is possible and the right course of action is to wean these patients from their dependence on <b>sleep-inducing</b> <b>drugs.</b> Young people often acquire the drug habit by taking hypnotics from a bedside table or a bathroom cabinet in their own homes...|$|R
40|$|Sleep {{disorders}} are common conditions that affect about 40 {{million people in}} the U. S every year, the most common of which is insomnia, which is characterized by difficulty falling or staying asleep. Zolpidem (Ambien®) is a non-benzodiazepine prescription drug that is used to treat insomnia and is often preferred over the commonly used benzodiazepines due to a lesser side effect profile. This is because the non-benzodiazepine binding is more selective to GABA-A receptors versus the non-selective binding of benzodiazepines. With the increasing popularity of non-benzodiazepines, drug abuse and driving-while-impaired cases involving <b>sleep-inducing</b> <b>drugs</b> have risen. Therefore, a highly sensitive and rapid homogeneous immunoassay (EMIT-type assay) has been developed for the detection of zolpidem in urine. The zolpidem antibody is highly specific and does not cross-react with other newer sleep aids such as zopiclone and zaleplon. This assay has a detection limit of 5 ng/mL for zolpidem in urine. Further evaluation of this assay using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS–MS) analysis of authentic urine samples demonstrated that the accuracy of the assay is greater than 90 %. Because this assay is designed to measure the non-conjugated drug in urine, it resulted in simplification for gas chromatography–MS or LC–MS–MS confirmation methods that do not require urine hydrolysis before solid-phase extraction or liquid–liquid extraction...|$|R
40|$|Bromocarbamides are <b>sleep-inducing</b> <b>drugs</b> {{which can}} lead, in man, to {{intoxication}} and death due to respiratory failure. To prove whether hemodynamic factors or the changed endothelial permeability induce pulmonary edema, animal experiments were performed. The fine structural changes in pulmonary edema in rabbits were observed at 60, 90 and 120 minutes after oral administration. The major findings were a) large blebs between capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium and b) interstitial edema {{of the vessel}} wall. The bleb contents were much less electron dense than the blood contents in the capillary. Colloidal carbon did not enter the bleb or the edematous interstitial tissue. Exogenous peroxidase uptake in pinocytotie vesicles increased in pathologic cases. The hemodynamic measurements in animal receiving artificial respiration which maintained the blood pO 2 at a steady state showed similar blebs in the pulmonary vessels, indicating that anoxia is not the major cause of the vascular lesion. Moreover, pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance could {{be held in the}} normal range in artificially respirated animals under bromocarbamide intoxication. Thus, hemodynamic factors are not likely to play a pathogenetic role in bringing about pulmonary edema. The chief, early factor is the increased endothelial permeability due to increased cytoplasmic transport. From this a practical suggestion for treating patients with bromocarbamide intoxication is derived: the usual fluid replacement in shock patients should be handled with great care to avoid fluid overload of the lung...|$|R
40|$|This article explores several equivocations in the {{relationship}} between state healthcare workers and the Pehuenche population in southern Chile. In particular, it focuses on radical differences in understanding the body, personhood, sleeping and dreaming. In Alto Bío Bío, Chile, while healthcare workers diagnose their Pehuenche patients with ‘sleep disorders’ and prescribe them <b>sleep-inducing</b> psychotropic <b>drugs,</b> some Pehuenche persons fear that by preventing them from waking up, the drugs will render them unable to escape a fatal attack by evil spirits. The sleeping pills, therefore, enact understandings of the body, personhood, sleeping and dreaming that are not at all univocal. This enactment generates a controversy-inducing ‘ontological disorder’ based in an ‘uncontrolled equivocation’, as described by the anthropologist Viveiros de Castro, in which interlocutors are not speaking about the same thing, but they are not aware of this. In more general terms, the article reflects on the application of technologies premised on multicultural ideology (one nature, many cultures) in contexts where alterity is radically manifested and where the limits of the actors’ different conceptions of personhood appear in all their ontological splendour...|$|R
40|$|The National Poisons Information Centre (NVIC) of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) was {{consulted}} in 2004 {{more frequently}} about acute intoxications than in 2003, representing {{an increase of}} about 6 %. In 2004, over 35, 000 enquiries were received about more than 47, 000 different exposures to chemical substances. The NVIC is specialized in providing quick and adequate information on possible effects and treatment of patients exposed to chemical substances. Physicians and other relief workers, such as {{the police and the}} fire brigade, can consult with the NVIC by telephone, 24 hours a day. This 24 -hour availability is important in case of calamities or terrorist attacks. In 2004, the NVIC was consulted for close to 26, 000 cases of medication overdose, of which a considerable number were due to overdoses of <b>sleep-inducing</b> <b>drugs</b> or painkillers. Particularly the number of consultations on overdoses where over-the-counter medications were ingested increased greatly; these included such painkillers as ibuprofen and diclofenac. Percentagewise, the largest increase among adults, compared to 2003, was seen for quetiapine, an antipsychotic drug (73 %). Despite the NVIC's focus in 2004 on overdoses of multivitamins among children, the number of consultations on multivitamins increased by 19 % compared to 2003. Over 3, 300 consultations concerned exposure of young children to household products. Especially noteworthy were the increases of 76 % and 32 % for the number of exposures to air fresheners and lamp oil, respectively. These products may be coloured, which makes them look like lemonade, and attractive to children, who mistakenly, take a few sips. Recently, various cleaning products containing sodium percarbonate have come on to the market. Because of the possible health risks associated with sodium percarbonate, the NVIC broadened its investigations to include a study on the clinical course of intoxications caused by ingestion of these cleaning products. Results showed limited health risks when products containing less than 10 % sodium percarbonate were ingested; patients {{did not need to be}} hospitalized. This is important both for the patient (avoids unnecessary treatment) and for the health care system (where costs are reduced). In spite of the public campaign in 2004 to reduce the alcohol consumption among young people, both the number of consultations on alcohol and the number of intoxications due to drugs increased considerably among 13 to 17 -year-olds...|$|R
40|$|The National Poisons Information Centre (NVIC) of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) {{provides}} information by telephone, 24 hours a day, on possible effects {{and treatment of}} health-threatening complaints caused by exposure to chemical substances. The NVIC functions in the Netherlands as the central point of contact for (potentially) acute intoxications; it is consulted frequently by physicians and other relief workers such as {{the police and the}} fire brigade. The annual {{increase in the number of}} enquiries continued in 2003, increasing from nearly 32, 000 consultations in 2002 to more than 33, 000 in 2003, concerning 43, 948 different exposures to chemical substances. This survey was compiled to provide insight into the acute intoxications in the Netherlands showing the highest incidence. Following the introduction, chapter 2 of the report describes the role of the NVIC in noting new developments and trends in acute intoxications. The (consumer) products that were frequently involved in acute intoxications and the substances that caused potentially serious health effects are indicated. Chapter 3 goes more deeply into the role of the NVIC in calamities and describes a number of incidents that took place in 2003, for illustration. It also discusses the electronic differential diagnostic system for chemical substances, the latest product developed by the NVIC. This system serves to interpret a patient's complaints and symptoms as soon as possible and to identify the causative agents. Overdosing with medicines occurred frequently in 2003, with the NVIC being consulted for 23, 163 cases of exposure to medication. The number of enquiries about <b>sleep-inducing</b> <b>drugs,</b> anxiolytics, antidepressants and antipsychotics increased once again. The same goes for the painkillers paracetamol and ibuprofen. In terms of percentage, the largest increase for children aged 0 to 12 was seen for the multivitamins, with an increase of 25 % compared to 2002. The tendency to make packages and vitamin products look like sweets is an undesirable development from the viewpoint of intoxication prevention. Likewise, more and more non-food (cosmetic) products have packaging or an appearance that resembles drinks or foodstuffs. Since consumers, especially children, can confuse these products with genuine foodstuffs, they are more inclined to put them in their mouths, suck on them or swallow them, thus increasing the risk of intoxication. Mistaking denture-cleaning tablets for peppermints, has been a cause of accidental ingestion of these tablets for years in the very old. Small children were most frequently involved in (potential) intoxication with household products (especially cleaning and petroleum-containing products). During, and shortly after, the large public information campaign "Toxic Seducers" by the Consumer Safety Institute from September 2000 to the spring of 2002, the number of intoxications caused by these products in children appeared to decrease. However, in 2003 exposures had increased again by 19 % compared to 2002. Informing parents about the dangers of products in their homes thus remains necessary. The number of times the NVIC was consulted in 2003 about acute alcohol intoxication in young people between 13 and 17 increased by 63 % compared to 2002. The total number of enquiries about drug intoxications has risen considerably too, almost doubling during the past four years, from 656 enquiries in 2000 to 1210 enquiries in 2003. The highest increases were found in the smart-product group, containing "energizers" such as ginseng and, especially, ephedra. After showing a sharp increase in 2000 and 2001, the number of intoxications with GHB (gamma hydroxybutyric acid) has now more-or-less stabilised...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{impairment}} {{of the adult}} brain can result from deficits in the ontogeny of GABAergic synaptic transmission. Gene defects underlying autism spectrum disorders, Rett’s syndrome or some forms of epilepsy, but also a diverse set of syndromes accompanying perinatal trauma, hormonal imbalances, intake of <b>sleep-inducing</b> or mood-improving <b>drugs</b> or, quite common, alcohol intake during pregnancy can alter GABA signaling early in life. The search for therapeutically relevant endogenous molecules or exogenous compounds able to alleviate the consequences of dysfunction of GABAergic transmission in the embryonic or postnatal brain requires {{a clear understanding of}} its site- and state-dependent development. At the level of single synapses, it is necessary to discriminate between presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations, and to define parameters that can be regarded as both suitable and accessible for the quantification of developmental changes. Here we focus on the performance of GABAergic synapses in two brain structures, the hippocampus and the superior colliculus, describe some novel aspects of neurotrophin effects during the development of GABAergic synaptic transmission and examine the applicability of the following rules: (1) synaptic transmission starts with GABA, (2) nascent/immature GABAergic synapses operate in a ballistic mode (multivesicular release), (3) immature synaptic terminals release vesicles with higher probability than mature synapses, (4) immature GABAergic synapses are prone to paired pulse and tetanic depression, (5) synapse maturation is characterized by an increasing dominance of synchronous over asynchronous release, (6) in immature neurons GABA acts as a depolarizing transmitter, (7) synapse maturation implies inhibitory postsynaptic current shortening due to an increase in alpha 1 subunit expression, (8) extrasynaptic (tonic) conductances can inhibit the development of synaptic (phasic) GABA actions...|$|R
