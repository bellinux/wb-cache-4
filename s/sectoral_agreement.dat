The study uses document analysis and interviews with multiple stakeholders, including representatives of the public sector, private sector, and recycling cooperatives. Content analysis was used to analyze and interpret the data collected. The findings point to expanding the collection of recyclables, with potential benefits for income generation in cooperatives, but with no impact on the process of effectively developing more sustainable products and packaging. The absence of individual targets provides an alternative for companies to comply with the legislation through very reduced costs. The proposal related to managing packs of different features equally, and the packaging development paradigm that focuses on competitiveness at the expense of recyclability, commits the results promised by the <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreement...</b>|$|E
40|$|Using linked employer-employee data, {{this paper}} {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} collective bargaining coverage on wages over an interval of continuing decline in unionism. Unobserved firm and worker heterogeneity is dealt with using two establishment sub-samples, comprising collective bargaining joiners and never members {{on the one hand}} and collective bargaining leavers and always members on the other, each in combination with subsets of worker job stayers. The counterfactuals are then reversed for robustness checks. Joining a <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreement</b> is found always to produce higher wages, while exiting a <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreement</b> no longer produces wage losses if the transition is to a firm agreement. Leaving a firm agreement to non-coverage also leads to wage reductions, while joining one from non-coverage seems decreasingly favourable. The reverse counterfactuals yield correspondingly smaller estimates (in absolute value) of wage development than reported for the initial counterfactuals.

30|$|While {{it is true}} {{that the}} {{findings}} of the German literature reported in Metcalf have been superseded by a new literature having a basis in nationally representative data, the issue of works council impact remains mixed (see, in particular, Addison 2009, Chap. 6). But there is some suggestion that their effect on firm performance (productivity) may be positive in circumstances where they are firmly embedded in the dual system and their effect on wages altogether less pronounced (Hübler and Jirjahn 2003). Here, rent seeking might be confined to collective bargaining proper. However, since greater works council involvement is the handmaiden of decentralization, more work is required on the new bargaining arrangements under opening clauses and pacts for competitiveness. We shall provide evidence on both of these contractual innovations in the next section when discussing decentralization of collective bargaining. For present purposes, however, we shall focus on investments in intangible capital, where many of the standard theoretical arguments carry over from investment in physical capital. Again, most of the empirical literature on innovation deals with the US experience, and the evidence is no more favorably disposed toward unionism than in the case of investments in physical capital (Menezes-Filho and van Reenen 2003). Here, however, the German literature subsequent to Metcalf’s review has been altogether more positive. Thus, a recent study by Addison et al. (2013), using data from the IAB Establishment Panel for the observation window 2007 – 2012, provides encouraging estimates of the effect of collective bargaining on four categories (three product and one process) of innovation. Since both collective agreement and workplace codetermination status are observed, the modeling strategy is ultimately designed to generate estimates of the effect of trade unions and works councils on innovation that are free, as far as possible, from the contamination of selection issues associated with endogenous decisions regarding the choice of these two institutional entities. Prior to that, controlling for a wide set of covariates, the authors’ estimates using pooled data suggest that the conjunction of the two institutions is relatively friendly to innovation. Arguments associated with more innovation of all types included training at the workplace and competition but not the profit situation. The authors’ subsequent analysis of <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreement</b> and works council transitions and their relationship to innovation is conducted within a difference-in-differences framework in which establishments leaving/joining a <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreement</b> are compared with those that remain covered/uncovered. It is found that joining a <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreement</b> in the presence of a works council, or leaving a <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreement</b> in its absence, seemingly proves advantageous to innovation. Taken as a whole, the study provides only weak evidence that collective bargaining inhibits innovation but stronger support for the notion that secotral bargaining in conjunction with works councils - the dual system - offers a favorable milieu for innovative activity.|$|E

30|$|Compared to {{individual}} bargaining or unilateral pay determination, collective bargaining {{is associated with}} higher earnings, more security for employees and more earnings equality. In the literature a gap between union and non-union wages, or more properly specified between workers covered and not covered by collective agreements, of 4 (Norway) to 20 percent (Canada) has been reported (Hartog et al. 2002). A study based on ISSP survey data for 1995 – 99 covering 17 countries found a union or collective bargaining ‘mark up’ varying from less than 1 percent, negative or insignificant in Sweden, Italy or the Netherlands, 4 percent in Germany, 7 percent in Norway and Spain, rising to more than 20 percent in Japan (Blanchflower and Bryson 2003). A recent study of German wage data found that {{the gap between the}} average wages of covered and uncovered workers had risen from 8 to 19 percent between 1999 and 2010, or from 1 to 10 percent if controlled for firm size. The authors concluded that the decline of collective bargaining in Germany {{in the past two decades}} - with the coverage rate decreasing from over 80 to under 60 percent - has contributed more to rising wage inequality than international trade (Felbermayr et al. 2014). Addison et al. (2014), using a different methodology and controlling for employee heterogeneity, report a smaller ‘wage gap’ in Germany of 3 – 4 percent during the first half of the 2000 s.

30|$|In {{the context}} of this paper I define {{decentralisation}} as moving negotiations and decisions over wages and terms of employment closer to the individual enterprise. Decentralisation occurs when central or sectoral agreements are articulated with or replaced by enterprise agreements. This occurs either through the breaking up of sectoral or national agreements when employers stop negotiating jointly and some or all of them negotiate an enterprise-level agreement. Or decentralisation happens through a process of articulation or devolution within the central or <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreement</b> when more issues are settled at lower levels (Guigni 1965; Crouch 1993). Traxler (1995) has coined the movement of retaining sectoral (or central) bargaining with more room for additional enterprise bargaining ‘organized decentralisation’, which he has contrasted with ‘disorganized decentralisation’ when national or sectoral agreements are ended.|$|E
30|$|In Spain, pay {{guidelines}} {{based on}} inflation forecasts in the cross-sectoral agreements since 2002 {{in combination with}} the wage revision clauses in <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreements</b> which adjust wages to observed inflation operate as a form of ‘soft’ or ‘non-automatic’ indexation. In Italy, the cross-sector agreement of 2009 has adopted {{more or less the same}} model, whereas previously, based on the triparite reform pact of 1993, past inflation had been the basis for wage adjustments in <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreements.</b> In Spain, meanwhile, there has been a sharp decline in the use of revision clauses. With no cross-industry agreement signed in 2009, the new biennial central framework agreements reached in 2010 and 2012 no longer incorporate official inflation forecasts. Probably reflecting this, the proportion of employees covered by collective agreements with wage revision clauses fell from two-thirds in 2007, prior to the crisis, to an estimated one-third in 2012.|$|R
30|$|Although {{identifying}} {{the sources of}} these rigidities {{is beyond the scope}} of this paper, these results would be in line with previous analyses, which have documented the presence of rigidities in the adjustment of labor costs in Spain 16 along with very large employment volatility 17. The Spanish labor market 18 is characterized by a high degree of wage stickiness deriving from the main features of the collective bargaining system, where automatic extension of <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreements</b> extend their application to all firms and workers 19 and where the dual structure of the Spanish labor market may exacerbate this wage rigidity (Bentolila and Dolado, 1994). Recent reforms approved since 2010 as a reaction to the strong deterioration of the labor market have tried to raise wage bargaining decentralization along with reducing the protection gap between permanent and temporary contracts. In particular, the prevalence of firm-level agreements was ensured and the conditions for opting-out clauses from <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreements</b> were eased, while employment protection for permanent contracts was decreased.|$|R
30|$|Enterprise-level {{collective}} agreements {{always have}} been voluntary and are {{over and above the}} provisions of general and <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreements.</b> Thus, enterprises have flexibility to react to enterprise-specific economic circumstances, subject to meeting the norms set in the general and <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreements.</b> Enterprise-level agreements are more common in large firms. According to employers’ associations, about 75 – 80 percent of large enterprises, 20 – 50  percent of medium-sized enterprises and less than 10 percent of small enterprises are covered by enterprise-level collective agreements 9. The estimates of trade union confederations are lower. The two largest trade union confederations (ZSSS and KS[*]−[*] 90) estimate that 30 – 50  percent of large enterprises, 20 – 30  percent of medium-sized enterprises and 5  percent of small enterprises are covered by enterprise-level collective bargaining (see Table twelve in European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) 2007).

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} pointed to the {{association}} between declining collective bargaining coverage and rising overall wage inequality. This association holds more or less across-the-board, at least for broad swathes of recent history. That said, the exact contribution of deununionization {{is a matter of}} debate, perhaps no more so than in Germany, our case study. The present paper takes a less conventional approach to this particular source of rising inequality by examining intra-plant wage dispersion in the wake of establishments either exiting from or entering into collective agreements. Several measures of inequality are constructed for German establishments over the twelve-year period 1996 - 2008, an interval of continuously declining union representation. Using linked employer-employee data, our estimation strategy hinges upon the identification of comparable groups of establishments and on both instantaneous and medium- to long-term changes in the wage structure. A modest widening effect on dispersion of exiting from a <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreement</b> is detected in the data once we effect a comparison across observationally-equivalent individuals. The converse does not apply in respect of joiners. The scale of the former effect casts doubt on some of the more exaggerated claims of the importance of deunionization to wage inequality and the resurgence of Germany more generally...|$|E
30|$|During the {{recession}} central pay bargaining ended in Ireland (1987 – 2009), Greece (1990 – 2010) and Romania (2005 – 2010) {{and in these}} three countries enterprise-level bargaining now prevails. The cross-sectoral agreement in Slovenia, which applied to sectors and companies not covered by sectoral collective bargaining, was not renewed in 2009 when it expired. There are now fewer <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreements</b> and in two sectors, chemicals and construction, employers unilaterally cancelled the <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreements</b> in 2013.

In Finland, on the other hand, central pay bargaining resumed in 2011 after an interlude of four years of sectoral and company bargaining.

30|$|Countries {{with the}} same {{dominant}} level of bargaining do vary {{a great deal on}} these indicators (frequency or scope of additional enterprise bargaining; articulation; legal status of derogation; existence and use of general opening clauses) and thus in actual decentralisation (Fig.  3, right panel). In Scandinavia, local bargaining within the currency of the <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreement</b> is common (Calmfors 1990), is under union control and the enterprise has become the main location for pay-setting in the entire private sector. In Germany and France additional enterprise bargaining is common in large firms, controlled by works councils rather than the union, and shaped by specific and conditional opening clauses. Such opening clauses have also figured in Austrian bargaining over wages and working hours, though they were not widely used. Individual bargaining and choice menus have shaped derogation from sectoral standards in the Netherland and Switzerland (Mach and Oesch 2003; Visser 2013). In Belgium and recently in Finland this development has affected issues other than wages, which tend to be specified standard or maximum rates defined through central agreements. In France, Southern Europe and CEE actual decentralisation happened by means of regulatory intervention, before (France, Hungary) and during (Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Romania) the recession, and in some of these countries at the price of considerable disarticulation due to the legal recognition of non-union actors as counterparts in enterprise bargaining. One main reason for this difference is that in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Switzerland, as in the UK and Ireland, the hierarchy between agreements, and the favourability principle holding that in case of conflict the first established or most favourable agreement applies is a matter of agreement and not of the law.|$|E

30|$|As Table  2 shows, {{there were}} {{significant}} differences between firm-size groups and sectors in the application of different levels of collective agreement. Firm level wage agreements were applied most frequently by firms with 200 or more workers and by firms in the utilities sector. Firms in manufacturing and financial intermediation also reported incidence of firm-level wage agreements above the national average. The application of general level agreement was reported most frequently by firms employing less than 50  workers and by firms in market services. The patterns by firm-size and sectors were consistent with expectations and broadly in line with that observed in some western European countries (see Deutsche Bundesbank 2009; European Industrial Relations Observatory On-line (EIROnline) 2009 a; Montornès and Sauner-Leroy 2009). As noted earlier in Section 2, trade unions and employers’ associations also report that firm-level agreements are most common in large firms and minimal in small firms. Profit margins are generally higher for larger firms and firms in the utilities and financial intermediation sectors, which allow them greater flexibility in giving performance-based compensation above the wage increases negotiated in the general and <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreements.</b> Also, union density is likely to be lower in smaller firms and in the services sector, which reduces the scope for <b>sectoral</b> <b>agreements</b> being applied by them.|$|R
