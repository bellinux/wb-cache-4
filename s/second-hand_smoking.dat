Many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{literature}} {{on the relationship of}} food and happiness, but the role of <b>second-hand</b> <b>smoking</b> is less understood. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to examine if <b>second-hand</b> <b>smoking</b> might mediate the associations of food consumption and subjective happiness in a country-wide and population-based setting. Data was retrieved from the Scottish Health Survey, 2012. Information on demographics, frequency of consuming certain foods and subjective happiness was obtained by household interview. Chi-square test and survey-weighted logistic regression modelling were performed. Of the included Scottish adults aged 16 – 99 (n[*]=[*] 4815), 15. 4 % (n[*]=[*] 677) reported that they were unhappy. It was observed that eating lots of potatoes, some meat, some oily fish and some pastries were inversely associated with unhappiness. People who consumed vegetables and fruits on the day before the health interview were also found to be less unhappy, compared to their counterparts. However, the protective effect from fruits disappeared after additionally adjusting for indoor <b>second-hand</b> <b>smoking</b> while the protective effects from other foods mentioned above have also been lessened. In addition, cumulatively people who consumed more “happy foods” (mentioned above) were more likely to report subjective happiness, compared to those who did not consume any of those. For future research, longitudinally monitoring on the associations among food, household environment and psychological well-being and both the short-term and long-term effects would be suggested.

40|$|Background Smoking is {{the leading}} cause of {{preventable}} death with recent figures indicating that over 13, 000 deaths each year in Scotland are attributable to smoking (ScotPHO 2012). Cigarette smoke is a known carcinogen causing a multitude of diseases not just for the smoker themselves but for those around them. In 2006 the Scottish Government responded to the high mortality rate by implementing new laws that strictly prohibit smoking inside any public premises to reduce exposure to <b>second-hand</b> smoke (<b>Smoking,</b> health and social care (Scotland) Act 2005). Hospitals are required to have smoke-free policies in place and in Scotland this year these laws are set to extend to encompass the entire grounds in addition to buildings, further restricting smokers. No research has been conducted in Scotland on what impact being resistant to smoke-free policies has on the individual, during a period of hospital-generated smoking abstinence. Aims This study would be conducted to identify if individuals who are resistant to a period of compulsory abstinence are represented in a population accessing elective orthopaedic services. Furthermore, how the stress levels of those resistant compare to the accepting group will be assessed, with the intention of determining if a relationship can be inferred between resistance to a period of compulsory abstinence and stress levels. Methods This is a prospective correlational survey study. It would utilise accidental and quota sampling methods to attain an achieved sample from an elective orthopaedic population in a large Edinburgh hospital. Data collection would be conducted using a series of questionnaires, the results of which would be statistically analysed using descriptive statistics. Further analysis by inferential statistics would be conducted using Analysis of variance statistical test. This seminal research would provide findings on the topic that has thus far not been studied in Scotland. The findings will establish if a relationship between resistance towards compulsory smoking abstinence exists and will be a platform for experimental research into the nature of this relationship. This will help develop a knowledge base in this area to inform nursing practice and policy...|$|R

40|$|Background: Tobacco smoke has {{adverse health}} effects on women of the {{reproductive}} age group with serious health implications for the next generation. Objectives: This study assessed the prevalence of current active <b>smoking,</b> <b>second-hand</b> smoke (SHS) exposure and the factors influencing smoke exposure in females of the reproductive age group. Materials and Methods: Data from the nationally representative Global Adult Tobacco Survey-India (GATS 2009) was analyzed for socio demographic variables, tobacco-related variables and knowledge variables. Results: 50. 4 % {{of the women in}} the reproductive age group had been exposed to SHS at home, though only 2. 6 % of the women were current active smokers. This was more than the SHS exposure at work (21. 7 %) and elsewhere (32. 6 %). SHS exposure of the women at home did not vary significantly with knowledge of adverse effects of smoking but was affected by the place of dwelling as the smoke exposure was found to be more among rural women. Conclusion: SHS exposure is more prevalent than current active smoking in women of the reproductive age group and that too at home. Thus, policies need to be framed in order to curb this menace which is a vicious one as women don′t really have an alternative as far as this exposure is concerned...|$|R

The college environment offers an excellent setting for implementation of smoking abstinence interventions for young adults. Freshmen students at Valparaiso University were invited to join group sessions in the residence halls to evaluate anti-tobacco YouTube videos, print materials, and Quit Kit materials. Undergraduate nursing students functioned as group session facilitators. Participants (N = 39) included: 59 % males, 87 % non-smokers, and 92 % who chose to attend for CORE credit. YouTube videos {{were found to be}} effective if a dramatic, age appropriate, simple message was connected to tobacco use. Print materials were effective if they included bright colors, brief statistics, few words, humor, and were immediately relevant. Quit Kit materials were selected if they included humor, pictures, had few words, and were useful. Quit Kits items included cozies, chip clips, stress relievers, and cinnamon flavored gum. Ninety-two percent indicated that their opinions about <b>smoking,</b> <b>second-hand</b> smoke exposure, and decisions whether to smoke were affected by these sessions.

40|$|Abstract: Acrolein is a {{chemical}} {{used as an}} intermediate reactive aldehyde in chemical industry. It is used for synthesis of many organic substances, methionine production, and methyl chloride refrigerant. The general population is exposed to acrolein via <b>smoking,</b> <b>second-hand</b> smoke, expo-sure to wood and plastic smoke. Firefighters and population living or working in areas with heavy automotive traffic may expose to higher level of acrolein via inhalation of smoke or automotive exhaust. Degradation of acrolein in all environmental media occurs rapidly, therefore, environ-mental accumulation is not expected. Acrolein degrade in 6 days when applied to surface water, {{and it has not}} been found as a contaminant in municipal drinking water. Acrolein vapor may cause eye, nasal and respiratory tract irritations in low level exposure. A decrease in breathing rate was reported by volunteers acutely exposed to 0. 3 ppm of acrolein. At similar level, mild nasal epithelial dysplasia, necrosis, and focal basal cell metaplasia have been observed in rats. The acrolein effects on gastrointestinal mucosa in the animals include epithelial hyperplasia, ulceration, and hemorrhage. The severity of the effects is dose dependent. Acrolein induces the respiratory, ocular, and gastrointestinal irritations by inducing the release of peptides in nerve terminals inner-vating these systems. Levels of acrolein between 22 and 249 ppm for 10 min induced a dose-related decrease in substance P (a short-chain polypeptide that functions as a neurotransmitter or neuro-modulator).

Cancer incidence and mortality rates in Korea are the highest among all Asian countries, and smoking prevalence in Korean men is one of the highest in developed countries. The purpose of the current study was to perform a systematic review and provide an evidence-based assessment of the burden of tobacco smoking-related cancers in the Korean population. Sex- and cancer-specific population-attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using the prevalence of ever-smoking and <b>second-hand</b> <b>smoking</b> in 1989 among Korean adults, respectively, and the relative risks were estimated from the meta-analysis of studies performed in the Korean population for ever-smoking and in the Asian population for passive smoking. National cancer incidence data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry and national cancer mortality data from Statistics Korea for the year 2009 were used to estimate the cancer cases and deaths attributable to tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoking was responsible for 20, 239 (20. 9 %) cancer incident cases and 14, 377 (32. 9 %) cancer deaths among adult men and 1, 930 (2. 1 %) cancer incident cases and 1, 351 (5. 2 %) cancer deaths among adult women in 2009 in Korea. In men, 71 % of lung cancer deaths, 55 %- 72 % of upper aerodigestive tract (oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus and larynx) cancer deaths, 23 % of liver, 32 % of stomach, 27 % of pancreas, 7 % of kidney and 45 % of bladder cancer deaths were attributable to tobacco smoking.

40|$|The {{introduction}} in March 2006 {{of legislation}} banning smoking {{in public places}} in Scotland raised concerns that smokers would smoke more at home and so increase the exposure of those living with them to tobacco smoke. Drawing on interviews from two qualitative studies conducted after {{the implementation of the}} legislation, this article uses a gendered analysis to explore where and why smokers, who lived with non-smokers including children, continued to smoke in their homes. Although very few people attributed any increased home smoking to being a direct consequence of the legislation, many who already smoked there continued, and most women reported little or no disruption to their home smoking post-legislation. Also, because of the changing social environment of smoking, and other life circumstances, a minority of women had increased their levels of home smoking. Compared to the men in these studies, women, particularly those who didn't work outside the home, had restricted social lives and thus were less likely to have smoked in public places before the legislation and spent more time socialising in the homes of other people. In addition, women with children, including women who worked outside their homes, were more likely to spend sustained periods of time caring for children compared to fathers, who were more likely to leave the home to work or socialise. Although home smoking was linked to gendered caring responsibilities, other issues associated with being a smoker also meant that many women smokers chose to keep smoking in their homes.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the association between asthma and smoking among high school students and assess provider-patient communication with asthmatic adolescents regarding smoking and adolescents’ beliefs about the harms of smoking. Methods In fall 2014, data from high school students, ages 14 – 18 years, completing the 2009 - 2010 Virginia Youth Tobacco Survey (N[*]=[*] 1796) were used in descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for model-specific confounders as appropriate. Results Overall, an estimated 19  % of high school students in Virginia smoked and 16  % had asthma. Odds of smoking did not differ by asthma status; however, asthmatics had 1. 5 times higher odds of being asked if they smoke (95  % CI 1. 06 – 2. 13) and being advised not to smoke by a health professional (95  % CI 1. 10 – 2. 14) compared to non-asthmatics. Asthmatics who believed <b>second-hand</b> smoke or <b>smoking</b> 1 – 5 cigarettes/day was not harmful had respectively 4. 2 and 2. 8 times higher odds of smoking than those who thought each was harmful. Further, asthmatics who thought smoking 1 − 2 years is safe had 3. 4 times higher odds of smoking than those who did not (95  % CI 1. 57 – 10. 1).

40|$|Studies {{investigating}} smoking risk {{among children}} and adolescents have typically focused on social smoke exposure via parents, siblings, and peers. Recently, researchers found that second-hand smoke exposure measured with biomarkers among never-smokers uniquely predicted smoking initiation and greater endorsement of withdrawal sensations. Based on these findings, researchers posited a physiological pathway between second-hand smoke exposure and smoking behaviour may exist. The aim {{of the present study}} was to simultaneously investigate whether social smoke exposure and pharmacological exposure to nicotine both uniquely contribute to greater smoking risk among never-smoking youth. Participants included 338 never-smoking youth (53. 5 % females) aged 11 - 13 years (M = 12. 68, SD = 0. 67) attending 6 th or 7 th grade in French-speaking schools. Participants completed self-report questionnaires measuring their own smoking behaviours, social smoke exposure (parents, siblings, peers, school), and known risk factors for eventual smoking (smoking expectancies, smoking susceptibility, perceived nicotine dependence). Each participant also provided a saliva sample and an expired breath sample, from which cotinine and carbon monoxide biomarkers were derived, to objectively measure second-hand exposure. Structural equation modeling was used to test the research hypotheses. Pharmacological exposure was not associated with smoking risk. Social smoke exposure of parental and peer smoking were significantly associated with smoking risk. When considered simultaneously, despite having models with acceptable to good fit, pharmacological and social smoke exposure together largely explained only a small proportion of the variance in smoking risk (1. 4 - 4. 7 %), with the exception of peer smoking which explained considerable variance (58 %). These findings do not suggest that pharmacological and social smoke exposure are differential predictors of smoking risk. Further, they do not support the possibility of a physiological pathway from <b>second-hand</b> exposure to <b>smoking</b> behaviour. Rather, the results suggest biomarkers may actually be a good proxy for social smoke exposure. To better evaluate the possibility of a physiological pathway, future studies should aim to recruit participants with a wider range of smoke exposure (i. e., low, moderate, or high exposure) and to more precisely measure longer-term exposure to second-hand smoke (e. g., hair nicotine, DNA encoding for CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 B 6, and CYP 2 E 1 enzymes which metabolize nicotine) ...|$|R

RESULTS: Tobacco smoking was responsible for 20, 239 (20. 9 %) cancer incident cases and 14, 377 (32. 9 %) cancer deaths among adult men and 1, 930 (2. 1 %) cancer incident cases and 1, 351 (5. 2 %) cancer deaths among adult women in 2009 in Korea. In men, 71 % of lung cancer deaths, 55 %- 72 % of upper aerodigestive tract (oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus and larynx) cancer deaths, 23 % of liver, 32 % of stomach, 27 % of pancreas, 7 % of kidney and 45 % of bladder cancer deaths were attributable to tobacco smoking. In women the proportion of ever-smoking-attributable lung cancer was 8. 1 %, while that attributable to <b>second-hand</b> <b>smoking</b> among non-smoking women was 20. 5 %. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one in three cancer deaths would be potentially preventable through appropriate control of tobacco smoking in Korean men at the population level and individual level. For Korean women, more lung cancer cases and deaths were attributable to second-hand than ever-smoking. Effective control programs against tobacco smoking should be further developed and implemented in Korea to reduce the smoking-related cancer burden...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. This review {{examines}} whether {{electronic cigarettes}} (e-cigs) implementation or vulgarization in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) {{could be helpful}} in curtailing the toll of tobacco smoking in the region. Discussion. There are about 1. 3 billion smokers worldwide, with nearly 80 % of them living in developing countries where the burden of tobacco-related illnesses and deaths is the heaviest. Studies report that e-cigs may facilitate smoking cessation, reduction, or abstinence and may pose {{only a small fraction}} of the risks of traditional tobacco cigarettes; e-cigs may also considerably reduce <b>second-hand</b> <b>smoking.</b> Thereby, implementation of e-cig use could help to substantially reduce the burden driven by tobacco smoking in SSA, in a particular context of lack of regulations and control policies towards this threat. However, the evidence is not clear on whether e-cigs are risk-free, especially if used in the long term. Conclusions. On the whole, if e-cigs were to be introduced in SSA, they should be strictly recommended to current and/or ex-smokers as a method to quit smoking or prevent relapse and never-smokers should be strongly encouraged to avoid using these devices. Bans on sales of e-cigs to youngsters should be legislated, e-cig advertisements prohibited, and their usage continuously controlled and monitored...|$|E

Patients and methods: Data of 16, 486 subjects who had undergone spirometry with pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator lung function assessment were retrieved from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2007 – 2012 database. After excluding 2, 638 subjects with missing spirometry values, data of 13, 336 subjects were included for analysis. Factors associated with occupational inhalation, FeNO levels and COPD were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Results: COPD was associated with occupational exposures to mineral dusts, organic dusts, exhaust fumes, other fumes, and <b>second-hand</b> <b>smoking</b> (P 50 ppb (ORs 0. 058 and 0. 210, respectively). Conclusion: Occupational exposures to airborne pollutants carries higher risk of COPD than non-exposure and the risk is higher the longer the duration of exposure. Exposure–response relationships are inconsistent in subjects with suspected asthmatic airway inflammation (FeNO ≥ 50 ppb). More careful risk assessment is needed in occupational inhalation exposure, since COPD with asthmatic airway inflammation, or asthma-COPD overlapping syndrome, may have the distinguishing features of both COPD and asthma.

Methods: Li people above 40 years of age from Hainan were chosen by stratified random cluster sampling between 2012 and 2014. All participants were interviewed with a home-visiting questionnaire, and spirometry was performed on all eligible participants. Patients with airflow limitation (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] 20 cigarettes/day, smoking for 40 years or more, <b>second-hand</b> <b>smoking,</b> recurrent respiratory infections, and induced cough were risk factors for COPD, whereas high BMI, high education level, and presence of ventilated kitchen were protective factors. Subsequent multivariate logistic regression model further demonstrated that aging, low BMI, biomass smoke, > 20 cigarettes/day, and recurrent respiratory tract infections were high-risk factors for COPD in the Li population. Conclusion: The incidence of COPD has a strong correlation with age, BMI, biomass smoke, > 20 cigarettes/day, and recurrent respiratory infections, suggesting they were high-risk factors for COPD in Li population.

40|$|Tobacco use is {{the leading}} cause of {{preventable}} deaths worldwide. This habit is not only debilitating to individual users but also to those around them (<b>second-hand</b> <b>smoking).</b> Nicotine is the main addictive component of tobacco products and is a moderate stimulant and a mild reinforcer. Importantly, besides its unconditional effects, nicotine also has conditioned stimulus effects that may contribute to the tenacity of the smoking habit. Because the neurobiological substrates underlying these processes are virtually unexplored, the present study investigated functional involvement of dorsomedial caudate putamen (dmCPu) in the conditioning processes with nicotine as a conditioned stimulus. Rats were trained using the discriminated goal-tracking task where nicotine injections (0. 4 mg/kg; SC) were paired 100 % of a time with intermittent (36 per session) sucrose deliveries; sucrose was not available on alternative saline days. Pre-training excitotoxic or post-training transient lesions of anterior or posterior dmCPu were used to elucidate the role of these areas in acquisition or expression of associative learning with nicotine stimulus. Pre-training lesion of p-dmCPu inhibited acquisition while post-training lesions of p-dmCPu attenuated the expression of associative learning with the nicotine stimulus. On the other hand, post-training lesions of a-dmCPu evoked nicotine like responding following saline treatment indicating the role of this area in disinhibition of learned motor behaviors. These results for the first time show the role of a- and p-dmCPu in various stages of associative learning using nicotine stimulus and provide an initial account of neural plasticity underlying these learning processes. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNational {{biomonitoring}} {{program can}} offer solid scientific evidence on exposure profiles of environmental chemicals {{at a national}} level, and provide a snapshot of changing exposure level over time. Therefore, several countries have maintained such programs for developing environmental health policies. The Korean National Environmental Health Survey (KoNEHS) was designed to understand the level of human exposure to environmental chemicals by time and location, and to identify possible sources of such exposure. The 2 nd stage of KoNEHS, which was conducted between 2012 and 2014, examined a total of 6478 adult subjects over 19 years of age, and measured 21 environmental chemicals of major policy concern. Compared to {{the findings from the}} first stage monitoring (2009 – 2011), slightly higher levels of blood lead were observed, while those of mercury remained similar. Blood metal concentrations, however, were higher than those reported from national biomonitoring programs of United States, Germany and Canada. The urinary concentrations of phthalates metabolites were lower, but those of t,t-muconic acid and BPA were higher than those reported in the first stage survey. The urinary cotinine level decreased perhaps reflecting general declining patterns of first- and <b>second-hand</b> <b>smoking.</b> The results of the second stage survey were made available for public use since April 2016. Some policy efforts appear to be at least in part effective on mitigating chemical exposure among people, e. g., urinary phthalate metabolites and cotinine, while further confirmations are warranted. In-depth assessments will be conducted to identify vulnerable groups and important exposure pathways...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} {{the relation between}} <b>second-hand</b> <b>smoking</b> (SHS) and levels of 4 -aminobiphenyl (4 -ABP; in urine or blood) and SHS and bladder cancer risk in nonsmokers. Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched (search terms to represent SHS, bladder cancer, and 4 -ABP) to conduct two meta-analyses. Information about gender and age of participants, mean 4 -ABP level for each SHS category, number of subjects, relative risk or odds ratio and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) in each SHS category, and covariates for which adjustment was made was extracted based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Random-effects analyses were done using STATA (version 9). Results: A 118 studies were reviewed for information on SHS and 4 -ABP (31 studies) and SHS and bladder cancer risk (87 studies). Of those, seven case-control studies were included for analysis of SHS and 4 -ABP and eight articles (three cohort and five case-control studies) for SHS and bladder cancer risk. A random-effects model found a pooled standardized mean difference of 1. 47 (95 % CI, 0. 23 - 2. 71), indicating higher levels of 4 -ABP among nonsmokers exposed to SHS. A random-effects model showed no evidence for an association between SHS and bladder cancer risk (relative risk, 0. 99; 95 % CI, 0. 86 - 1. 14), comparing non-smokers with and without SHS exposure. Conclusion: Higher levels of 4 -ABP {{were significantly associated with}} SHS exposure, which is consistent with earlier findings for 4 -ABP levels in sidestream smoke. The current evidence indicates that there is no association between SHS and bladder cancer, but future studies that address methodologic limita-tions are needed to further clarify this importan...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Peripheral sensory {{neuropathy}} (PSN) is {{a common}} cause of ulceration and amputation in diabetes (DM) patients. The prevalence of PSN in DM patients is largely undetermined in sub-Saharan African population. We studied the burden of PSN in DM patients using a validated questionnaire and quantitative sensory test. Methods: In a case-control design, PSN was measured in 491 DM patients and 330 non-DM controls using Michigan neuropathy screening instrument (MNSI) and vibration perception threshold (VPT). PSN was defined as MNSI symptom score ≥ 7, MNSI examination score ≥ 2 or VPT ≥ 25 V. Results: The prevalence of PSN screened by MNSI symptom score, MNSI examination score and VPT was 7. 1 %, 51. 5 % and 24. 5 % in DM patients; and 1. 5 %, 24. 5 % and 8. 5 % in non-DM participants respectively. The major determinants of PSN screened by MNSI examination score were diabetes status [OR (95 % CI) : 4. 31 (2. 94 – 6. 31), p[*]<[*] 0. 001], age [1. 03 (1. 01 – 1. 05), p[*]<[*] 0. 001], previous [4. 55 (2. 11 – 9. 82), p[*]<[*] 0. 001] and current [8. 16 (3. 77 – 17. 68), p[*]<[*] 0. 001] smoking status. The major determinants of PSN screened by VPT were diabetes status [1. 04 (1. 02 – 1. 06), p[*]<[*] 0. 001], age [1. 02 (1. 01 – 1. 03), p[*]=[*] 0. 047], heart rate [1. 78 (1. 08 – 2. 92), p[*]=[*] 0. 023], <b>second-hand</b> <b>smoking</b> [3. 66 (2. 26 – 5. 95), p[*]<[*] 0. 001] and body height [3. 28 (1. 65 – 8. 42), p[*]=[*] 0. 015]. Conclusion: Our study has shown high burden of PSN in DM patients in Ghana using simple, accurate, and non-invasive screening tools like MNSI and neurothesiometer...|$|E
