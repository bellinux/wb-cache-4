5|$|The Compass Housing Authority, a {{homeless}} advocacy group, also proposed renovating the building into a downtown homeless <b>shelter</b> <b>and</b> services center in 2014, but were {{rejected by the}} United States Department of Health and Human Services over a lack of funding.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} the center point of their parcel, Hudson {{and his partners}} built a trail from that point to their boat on the Cuyahoga.

5|$|During the Second World War the {{basement}} was converted into an air-raid <b>shelter</b> <b>and</b> an extension {{built in the}} yard to provide more space in the control room. The fire services were nationalised in 1941, and London Road became the headquarters of Division C. In recognition of the fire fighters' efforts King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the fire station in 1942.|$|E

5|$|It prefers basins {{and desert}} areas vegetated with Chinese {{tamarisk}} (Tamarix chinensis), brush, or poplar (Populus), along the peripheries of rivers {{that surround the}} mountains in the Taklamakan Desert. This distribution of the Yarkand hare is ring shaped. It also uses reed vegetation along rivers for <b>shelter,</b> <b>and</b> tends to avoid agricultural fields. About 200,000 individuals are estimated to inhabit the Tarim Basin.|$|E

5|$|On Monday morning, {{the storm}} had moved {{northeast}} of London, Ontario, dragging lake effect blizzards in its wake. An additional 17inches (43cm) of snow were dumped on Cleveland, Ohio that day, filling the streets with snowdrifts 6feet (2m) high. Streetcar operators stayed with their stranded, powerless vehicles for two nights, eating whatever food was provided by local residents. Travelers were forced to take <b>shelter</b> <b>and</b> wait for things to clear.|$|E

5|$|The local legend {{suggests}} that the Cailleach and her family were given shelter in the glen by the locals and while they stayed there the glen was always fertile and prosperous. When they left they gave the stones to the locals with the promise {{that as long as}} the stones were put out to look over the glen at Bealltainn and put back into the <b>shelter</b> <b>and</b> made secure for the winter at Samhainn then the glen would continue to be fertile.|$|E
5|$|They {{developed}} into a hardy breed due to the harsh climate, limited <b>shelter,</b> <b>and</b> sparse food sources of their native country. At {{some point in their}} development, the Welsh breeds had some Arab blood added, although this did not take away the physical characteristics that make the breed unique.|$|E
5|$|After Mayor Quimby {{makes an}} {{offensive}} joke about France, {{and refuses to}} apologize, the French president launches a neutron bomb directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from Herman's military surplus store. After the blast, Homer emerges from the <b>shelter</b> <b>and</b> {{seems to be the}} only person in town to survive the blast, but he is soon confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants. Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge and the children kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding behind their backs and the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E

5|$|Chastain's {{final two}} {{roles of the}} year were in Wilde Salom√©, a {{documentary}} based on her 2006 production of Salome, and the critically panned crime-thriller Texas Killing Fields. The latter, co-starring Sam Worthington and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, was a partly fictionalized version of {{the events in the}} killing fields of Texas, in which she played a homicide detective. Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey praised Chastain's polished Texas drawl, but criticized the film. Chastain's work in 2011, especially in The Help, Take <b>Shelter</b> <b>and</b> The Tree of Life, gained her awards from several critics' organizations, including the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.|$|E
5|$|Despite segregationist {{and racist}} attitudes, St. Louis {{acted as a}} haven during the 1917 East St. Louis Riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to <b>shelter</b> <b>and</b> food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East St. Louis and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from the rural South to industrial cities, the black population of St. Louis increased more rapidly than the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated rats have {{a longer}} {{lifespan}} than that of wild rats. Because domesticated rats are protected from predators and have ready access to food, water, <b>shelter,</b> <b>and</b> medical care, their average lifespan is around two to three years, in contrast to wild R. norvegicus which average a lifespan of less than one year. However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, livers, kidneys, and adrenal glands than laboratory rats. The fancy rat and wild rat also both face a multitude of differing health concerns; the former is at risk of developing a pneumococcal infection from exposure to humans, while the latter may harbor tapeworms after coming in contact with carriers like cockroaches and fleas.|$|E
50|$|The NWI Debris Impact Facility {{performs}} {{tests on}} storm <b>shelters</b> <b>and</b> their various components {{to see if}} they meet established Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)l and International Code Council guidelines. The Debris Impact Facility houses a high-powered air cannon that shoots wooden two-by-fours at <b>shelter</b> walls <b>and</b> doors to simulate flying debris. The cannon is capable of producing simulated wind speeds of more than 250 mph and provides valuable impact resistance data. Such data is used to develop standards for safe above-ground <b>and</b> below-ground <b>shelters,</b> <b>and</b> continues to be in demand for testing new <b>shelter</b> materials <b>and</b> constructions.|$|R

5|$|Due to the threat, the {{government}} of Honduras evacuated some of the 45,000 citizens on the Bay Islands and prepared all air and naval resources. The government of Belize issued a purple alert and asked for citizens on offshore islands {{to leave for the}} mainland. Because the hurricane threatened to strike near Belize City as a Category4 hurricane, much of the city was evacuated in fear of a repeat of Hurricane Hattie 37years earlier. Guatemala issued a purple alert as well, recommending boats to stay in port, telling people to prepare or seek <b>shelter,</b> <b>and</b> warning of potential overflowing rivers. By the time hurricane Mitch made landfall, numerous people were evacuated along the western Caribbean coastline, including 100,000 in Honduras, 10,000 in Guatemala, and 20,000 in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.|$|E
5|$|Many years later, {{the abbey}} is visited by Monsignors Aguerra (God's Advocate) and Flaught (the Devil's Advocate), the Church's {{investigators}} {{in the case}} for Leibowitz's sainthood. Leibowitz is eventually canonized as Saint Leibowitz ‚Äì based partly on the evidence Francis discovered in the shelter ‚Äì and Brother Francis is sent to New Rome to represent the Order at the canonization Mass. He takes the documents found in the <b>shelter,</b> <b>and</b> an illumination {{of one of the}} documents on which he has spent years working, as a gift to the Pope.|$|E
5|$|She Has a Name was {{the first}} {{full-length}} play by Andrew Kooman, a playwright and author from Alberta in western Canada. He began work on it in 2008 and finished a one-act version by 2009, writing {{under the guidance of}} a dramaturge at a Scripts At Work workshop at Red Deer College. He drew on his experiences working with a Canadian film crew in Thailand in 2006. He intended to extend the script into a full-length play eventually. Kooman had previously written other literary works, including the young adult novel , and two plays, <b>Shelter</b> <b>and</b> Joseph, that had been selected for development at Scripts At Work workshops.|$|E
