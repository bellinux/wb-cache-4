60|$|As {{the boat}} {{approached}} the shore the fat little man got upon {{his feet and}} bowed {{several times in the}} direction of those who had assembled to greet him, and as he bowed he flourished his white cap in an energetic manner. His face was round as an apple and nearly as rosy. When he <b>stopped</b> <b>bowing</b> he smiled in such a sweet and happy way that Inga thought he must be a very jolly fellow.|$|R
50|$|Louré (French; Italian portato) - This bow stroke, used in slow tempos, {{separates}} slurred notes {{slightly to}} articulate them, without <b>stopping</b> the <b>bow.</b> It {{is used in}} passages of a cantabile character.|$|R

60|$|There was {{a slight}} {{emphasis}} on the word, which would have escaped every ear but one that was feverish with apprehension. It was, however, distinctly marked, and, combined with her whole tone and manner, plainly intimated, 'I will never think of Mr. Waverley as a more intimate connexion.' Edward <b>stopped,</b> <b>bowed,</b> and looked at Fergus, who bit his lip, a movement of anger which proved that he also had put a sinister interpretation on the reception which his sister had given his friend. 'This, then, is an end of my day-dream!' Such was Waverley's first thought, {{and it was so}} exquisitely painful as to banish from his cheek every drop of blood.|$|R
5000|$|Denman Maroney (born 1949) is a jazz {{musician}} who plays {{what he calls}} [...] "hyperpiano". Hyperpiano [...] "involves <b>stopping,</b> sliding, <b>bowing,</b> plucking, striking and strumming the strings with copper bars, aluminum bowls, rubber blocks, plastic boxes and other household objects." [...] This is sometimes done {{with one hand while}} the other hand is used to play the keys.|$|R
5000|$|Détaché - The term détaché {{simply means}} [...] "separated" [...] {{and it can}} be applied to any notes not linked by a slur. <b>Stopping</b> the <b>bow</b> on the string deadens the {{vibrations}} and thus creates a muted accent, elastic détaché which covered off-the-string strokes, and dragged détaché (détaché traîné) where smooth bow changes leave no audible gap between each note.|$|R

60|$|Suddenly there sprang {{out from}} the bushes two lions, and a lion cub with them. The fierce beasts bounded towards him, roaring loudly, and would fain have eaten him, but quickly Manus stooped and spread the cloth upon the ground. At that the lions <b>stopped,</b> and <b>bowing</b> their great heads, kissed {{the back of his}} wrist and went their ways. But the cub rolled itself up in the cloth; so Manus picked them both up, and carried them with him to Old Bergen.|$|R
50|$|Every day nearby villagers and {{travellers}} {{stop and}} pray to {{the bike and}} its late owner Om Singh Rathore. Those who pass by <b>stop</b> to <b>bow</b> their heads leave offerings in honour of the helpful spirit, and some drivers also offer small bottles of alcohol at the site. It is said {{that a person who}} does not stop to pray at the shrine is in for a dangerous journey. Devotees also apply the 'tilak' mark and tie a red thread on the motorbike. Local people sing folk songs in the name of Om Banna.|$|R
60|$|Darcy made no answer, {{and seemed}} desirous of {{changing}} the subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning {{to pass through the}} set {{to the other side of}} the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he <b>stopped</b> with a <b>bow</b> of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{reads the}} diploma out loud once {{to the first}} student in each class. The diploma is handed over full size in an open cover (not rolled-up). The principal rotates the diploma to face the student {{and hands it to}} them. The student receives the diploma by using their left hand first, and then their right hand before pulling it towards them. The student steps back and exchanges bows with the principal. The student then slowly closes the diploma and folds it under their left hand before turning and walking away. Returning to their seats, students <b>stop</b> and <b>bow</b> to the special guests.|$|R
5000|$|The ship ran aground on the Punta Hormigas, a reef off Hormigas Island, {{two and a}} half {{miles east}} of Cape Palos, Cartagena, Spain. According to an eyewitness, the captain of the French steamer Marie Louise, she was [...] "taking a {{dangerous}} course" [...] when he saw her <b>stop,</b> her <b>bow</b> lifting. The boilers exploded, and [...] "dead bodies began to float past the French steamer, and those on board could hear the shrieks of the drowning." [...] A boat was launched that saved 29 passengers, while the Marie Louise herself saved another 25. Three-hundred passengers, most of them Italian and Spanish, lost their lives.|$|R
60|$|While he was {{thinking}} of the sadness of it all, a little scene was acted: the side door of the house opened, a weeping woman came out, and with her was a tall Confederate Colonel of cavalry. Gallantly giving her his arm, he escorted her as far as the little gate, where she bade him good by with much feeling. With an impulsive movement he drew some money from his pocket, thrust it upon her, and started hurriedly away that he might not listen to her thanks. Such was his preoccupation that he actually brushed into Stephen, who was standing beside a tree. He <b>stopped</b> and <b>bowed.</b>|$|R

6000|$|Awful Justice <b>stops,</b> and, <b>bowing</b> gravely, {{listens to}} M. Hugo's verses, and, with true French politeness, says, [...] "Mon cher Monsieur, these verses are charming, ravissans, délicieux, and, coming {{from such a}} célébrité littéraire as yourself, shall meet with every {{possible}} attention--in fact, had I required anything to confirm my own previous opinions, this charming poem would have done so. Bon jour, mon cher Monsieur Hugo, au revoir!"--and they part:--Justice taking {{off his hat and}} bowing, and the author of [...] "Ruy Blas" [...] quite convinced that he has been treating with him d'égal en égal. I can hardly bring my mind to fancy that anything is serious in France--it seems to be all rant, tinsel, and stage-play. Sham liberty, sham monarchy, sham glory, sham justice,--où diable donc la vérité va-t-elle se nicher? ...|$|R

Why should my Lord Bishop be cringing to that lady? Look at him rubbing his fat hands together, and smiling into her face! It's not a {{handsome}} face any longer. It is all painted red and white like Scaramouch's in the pantomime. See, there comes another blue-riband, as I live. My Lord Bamborough. The descendant of the Hotspurs. The proudest man in England. He <b>stops,</b> he <b>bows,</b> he smiles; he is hat in hand, too. See, she taps him with her fan.

5000|$|Leon S. Kennedy sneaks {{into the}} Eastern Slav Republic (a fictional country that {{separated}} from the Soviet Union) to verify rumors that Bio-Organic Weapons (BOWs) are {{being used in the}} country's civil war, which the U.S. and Russia are preparing to intervene in. After his arrival, Ingrid Hunnigan, Leon's mission support, informs him the government has ordered an immediate retreat of all U.S. forces. Determined to <b>stop</b> the <b>BOWs,</b> Leon ignores the order. Leon comes across his contact, [...] "Scarecrow," [...] who has been attacked and is near death. A Licker finishes off Scarecrow as Leon is knocked out by an explosion; a shadowy figure orders the Licker not to kill Leon. Leon awakens, tied to a chair by rebel fighters J.D., Alexander Kozachenko (Buddy), and the elderly Ivan Judanovich, the group's Ataman.|$|R
25|$|Loy {{was born}} in Helena, Montana, the {{daughter}} of Adelle Mae (née Johnson) and rancher David Franklin Williams, and raised in Radersburg. She had a younger brother, David Williams (died 1982). Loy's paternal grandparents were Welsh, and her maternal grandparents were Scottish and Swedish. Her first name was derived from a whistle <b>stop</b> near Broken <b>Bow,</b> Nebraska, whose name her father liked. Her father was also a banker and real estate developer and the youngest man ever elected to the Montana state legislature. Her mother studied music at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago.|$|R
60|$|Before {{we reached}} Hackton Castle, {{we had to}} drive through ten miles of the Lyndon estates, where the people were out to visit us, the church bells set a-ringing, the parson and the farmers {{assembled}} in their best by the roadside, and the school children and the labouring people were loud in their hurrahs for her Ladyship. I flung money among these worthy characters, <b>stopped</b> to <b>bow</b> and chat with his reverence and the farmers, and if I found that the Devonshire girls were among the handsomest in the kingdom is it my fault? These remarks my Lady Lyndon especially would take in great dudgeon; and I do believe she was made more angry by my admiration of the red cheeks of Miss Betsy Quarringdon of Clumpton, than by any previous speech or act of mine in the journey. 'Ah, ah, my fine madam, you are jealous, are you?' thought I, and reflected, not without deep sorrow, how lightly she herself had acted in her husband's lifetime, and that those are most jealous who themselves give most cause for jealousy.|$|R
5000|$|Bugs {{is about}} to conduct [...] "The Warner Bros. Symphony Orchestra" [...] (supposedly in concert at the Hollywood Bowl) fancily. When he {{finishes}} his elaborate preparation, he starts to conduct, but is interrupted by someone in the audience coughing loudly. Bugs then holds out a sign saying [...] "Throw the bum out!", which the audience does. Other problems plague Bugs' conducting, notably a bothersome fly and some awkward cuffs that keep falling off. In {{the middle of the}} performance, Bugs acts an indigenous person being chased by American troops (to the music that is happening at the present time). The fly then returns {{at the end of the}} act, landing in Bugs' nose. Bugs then loses his sanity and attempts to kill the fly, crashing into the orchestra and the instruments as he does so. As the music comes to a <b>stop,</b> Bugs <b>bows</b> for the crowd and instead of applause,he hears only silence and crickets chirping. Bugs looks around and then sees that the seats are empty and the crowd has gone, though he does hear some faint clapping - coming from the fly. He bows to the fly, and the cartoon ends.|$|R
50|$|The {{submarine}} {{spotted a}} Japanese cruiser {{on the morning}} of 30 September and launched four torpedoes from her bow tubes. None hit, so she fired another two forward tubes shortly thereafter. These also went wide of the mark, and the cruiser escaped damage. One week later, the submarine was patrolling off Kavieng when she spotted smoke on the horizon. After a Japanese cargo ship sailed into view, Amberjack launched two torpedoes. One missed forward and the other hit the target's hull forward. The enemy ship was still able to continue under her own power and Amberjack took up pursuit. About one hour later, both sides opened fire with their deck guns but neither was within range of the other and they broke off fire. After two more hours of the chase, the submarine fired a slow speed torpedo which hit its target five minutes later. The cargo vessel, later identified as Senkai Maru, swung left and seemed to <b>stop.</b> Its <b>bow</b> swung up in the air, the ship took a vertical position, and sank from sight shortly thereafter. Lifeboats carrying the cargo ship's survivors were later spotted as the submarine headed for Kavieng.|$|R
60|$|The {{little man}} <b>stopped</b> with his <b>bow</b> raised; {{for a moment}} they all stared at me, transfixed. It was a little elf in blue {{indienne}} who jumped first {{and ran down the}} street, crying the news in a shrill voice, the others following, the fiddler gazing stupidly after them. Suddenly he scrambled up, moaning, as if the scourge itself had fastened on him, backed into the house, and slammed the door in my face. I returned with slow steps to shut myself in the darkened room again, and I recall feeling something of triumph over the consternation I had caused. No sounds came from the bedroom, and after that the street was quiet as death save for an occasional frightened, hurrying footfall. I was tired.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Elmore {{remained}} speechless {{for some}} moments. Then {{she drew a}} long breath, and said firmly: [...] "If you won't interrupt me with gratuitous insults, Owen, I will {{tell you all about}} it, and then perhaps you will be ready to do me justice. I ask nothing more." [...] She waited for his contrition, but proceeded without it, in a somewhat meeker strain: [...] "Lily couldn't get her things at Pazienti's, and we {{had to go to the}} Merceria for them. Then of course the nearest way home was through St. Mark's Square. I made Lily go on the Florian side, so as to avoid the officers who were sitting at the Quadri, and we had got through the square and past San Moïsè, as far as the Stadt Gratz. I had never thought of how the officers frequented the Stadt Gratz, but there we met a most magnificent creature, and I had just said, 'What a splendid officer!' when she gave a sort of stop and he gave a sort of <b>stop,</b> and <b>bowed</b> very low, and she whispered, 'It's my officer.' I didn't dream of his joining us, and I don't think he did, at first; but after he took a second look at Lily, it really seemed as if he couldn't help it. He asked if he might join us, and I didn't say anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{do not see}} {{my garden}} in its glory," [...] said Mr. Beckendorff, <b>stopping</b> before the <b>bow</b> window of the library. [...] "This spot is my strong point; had you been here earlier in the year, you might have admired with me my {{invaluable}} crescents of tulips; such colours! such brilliancy! so defined! And last year I had three king-tulips; their elegantly-formed, creamy cups I have never seen equalled. And then my double variegated ranunculuses; my hyacinths of fifty bells, in every tint, single and double; and my favourite stands of auriculas, so large and powdered that the colour of the velvet leaves was scarcely discoverable! The blue passion-flower is, however, now beautiful. You see that summer-house, sir," [...] continued he, turning to Vivian; [...] "the top is my observatory. You will sleep in that pavilion to-night, so you had better take notice how the walk winds." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lord Carson {{lived at}} Cleve Court, a Queen Anne house near Minster in the Isle of Thanet, Kent, bought in 1921. It {{was here that}} Carson died peacefully on 22 October 1935. Britain gave him a state funeral, {{which took place in}} Belfast at St Anne's Cathedral; he is still the only person to have been buried there. From a silver bowl, soil from each of the six {{counties}} of Northern Ireland was scattered on to his coffin, which had earlier been covered by the Union Flag,which however was removed during the service. At his funeral service the choir sang his own favourite hymn, [...] "I Vow to Thee, My Country". A warship had brought his body to Belfast and the funeral took place on Saturday 26 October 1935. Thousands of shipworkers <b>stopped</b> work and <b>bowed</b> their heads as HMS Broke steamed slowly up Belfast Lough, with Carson's flag-draped coffin sat on the quarterdeck.|$|R
5000|$|Around that time, Prat {{faced an}} unusual situation. On May 24, 1875, the Esmeralda {{was in the}} port of Valparaíso while Prat was on sick leave. The {{commander}} of the ship, Luis Alfredo Lynch, was also on leave so Lieutenant Constantino Bannen was left in charge. A storm began in the bay and the Valdivia broke its ties and went right towards the Esmeralda, which then impacted with the Maipo. It appeared that {{the destruction of the}} Esmeralda would be unavoidable. When Prat and Lynch returned, they managed to get transported back to the ship by boat, but the violent waves kept them from embarking. Arturo Prat threw himself into the water and swam to the ship to climb a rope (as Lynch had done just before him). He worked feverishly with a rope tied from his waist to the mast to accomplish rescue maneuvers resulting in the ship <b>stopping</b> with its <b>bow</b> against the beach and securing it there with riggings. Luis Alfredo Lynch would later remember Prat's [...] "unflappable calm in the face of danger".|$|R
50|$|The {{supporters}} {{were members of}} the House of Lords of the same rank of peerage as the new peer. (In other words, Dukes would support Dukes, Marquesses would support Marquesses, and so forth.) The new peer and his/her supporters would wear parliamentary robes and bicorn hats if men or caps if women. The procession would enter the Chamber, proceed towards the Lord Chancellor (the peer and his/her supporters <b>stopping</b> thrice to <b>bow</b> towards the Cloth of Estate before reaching the Lord Chancellor), and the Garter Principal King of Arms would present the peer's letters patent, which are issued by the sovereign to create a new peerage, and the new peer would kneel before the Lord Chancellor (or remain standing if a member of the Royal Family) and present his writ of summons, which is issued by the sovereign to command the peer's attendance in Parliament. The Reading Clerk of the House of Lords would then read aloud the letters patent and the writ. The peer would take the Oath of Allegiance or the Solemn Affirmation, and would sign the Test Roll, at the top of which the same Oath is written.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thus you see," [...] {{continued}} Mr. George, [...] "that {{the essential}} {{thing at a}} Catholic service like this, as they regard it, is the eating {{of the body and}} the drinking of the blood of Jesus Christ, as a new sacrifice for the sins {{of the people who are}} present and consenting in heart to the ceremony. There are a great many subordinate operations and rites. The assistant goes back and forth a great many times from one side of the altar to the other, <b>stopping</b> to <b>bow</b> and kneel every time he passes the crucifix. The priest makes a great deal of ceremony of wiping out the cup before he receives the wine. Then there is a long service, which he reads in a low voice, and there are many prayers which he offers, and he turns to various passages of the Scriptures, and reads portions here and there. The people do not hear any thing that he says and does, nor is it necessary, according to their ideas of the service, that they should do so; for they know very well that the priest is consecrating the bread or the wine, and changing it into the body and the blood of Christ, in order that it may be ready for the sacrifice. Then, when the wine is changed, the priest drinks it in a very solemn manner, raising it to his lips three several times, so as to take it in three portions. Then he holds the cup out to his assistant again, who pours a little water into it from his other vessel; and the priest then, after moving the cup round and round, to be sure that the water mixes itself well with the wine which was left on the inner service of the cup, drinks that too. He does this in order to make sure that no portion of the precious blood remains in the cup. He then wipes it out carefully with his napkin, and puts it away." ...|$|R
