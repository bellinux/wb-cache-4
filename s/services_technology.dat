25|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{refers to}} the free movement of goods, capital, <b>services,</b> <b>technology</b> and information. It is the increasing economic integration and interdependence of national, regional, and local economies across the world through an intensification of cross-border movement of goods, services, technologies and capital. Whereas globalization is a broad set of processes concerning multiple networks of economic, political, and cultural interchange, contemporary economic globalization is propelled by the rapid growing significance of information in all types of productive activities and marketization, and by developments in science and technology.|$|E

In order for a self <b>service</b> <b>technology</b> to succeed in making customers happy, companies must learn and know what drives customer satisfaction. This paper examines what a firm should consider {{in order to encourage}} customers to at least try, and eventually adopt, the self <b>service</b> <b>technology</b> offered by a firm into the customer's regular routine.

25|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{is the increasing}} economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-border movement of goods, <b>services,</b> <b>technology,</b> and capital. Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic {{globalization is}} the process of increasing economic integration between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market. Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality.Likewise, it also comprises of globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace.Economic globalization also includes competition, technology, and corporations and industries.|$|E

2500|$|The global workforce, or {{international}} labor pool, reflects {{a new international}} division of labor that has been emerging since the late 1970s {{in the wake of}} other forces of globalization.

[...] With roots in the social processes surrounding the shift to standardization and industrialization, post-industrial society in the Western world has been accompanied by industrialization {{in other parts of the}} world, particularly in Asia. As industrialization takes hold worldwide and more cultures move away from traditional practices in respect to work and labor, the ways in which employers think about and utilize labor are changing.

As people learn how to access their full potential more consistently, HR adherents say, they get better results with less effort and less stress in less time.|$|E

Online {{retailers}} are increasingly providing <b>service</b> <b>technologies,</b> such as technology-based and human-based services, to assist customers with their shopping. Despite the prevalence of these <b>service</b> <b>technologies</b> and the scholarly recognition of their importance, surprisingly little empirical research has examined the fundamental differences among them. Consequently, {{little is known about}} the factors that may favor the use of one type of <b>service</b> <b>technology</b> over another. In this paper, we propose the Model of Online <b>Service</b> <b>Technologies</b> (MOST) to theorize that the capacity of a service provider to accommodate the variability of customer inputs into the service process is the key difference among various types of <b>service</b> <b>technologies.</b> We posit two types of input variability: Service Provider-Elicited Variability (SPEV), where variability is determined in advance by the service provider; and User-Initiated Variability (UIV), where customers determine variability in the service process. We also theorize about the role of task complexity in changing the effectiveness of <b>service</b> <b>technologies.</b> We then empirically investigate the impact of <b>service</b> <b>technologies</b> that possess different capacities to accommodate input variability on efficiency and personalization, the two competing goals of service adoption. Our empirical approach attempts to capture both the perspective of the vendor who may deploy such technologies, as well as the perspective of customers who might choose among <b>service</b> <b>technology</b> alternatives. Our findings reveal that SPEV technologies (i. e., technologies that can accommodate SPEV) are more efficient, but less personalized, than SPEUIV technologies (i. e., technologies that can accommodate both SPEV and UIV). However, when task complexity is high (vs. low), the superior efficiency of SPEV technologies is less prominent, while both SPEV and SPEUIV technologies have higher personalization. We also find that when given a choice, a majority of customers tend to choose to use both types of technologies. The results of this study further our understanding of the differences in efficiency and personalization experienced by customers when using various types of online <b>service</b> <b>technologies.</b> The results also inform practitioners when and how to implement these technologies in the online shopping environment to improve efficiency and personalization for customers...|$|R
