60|$|Foster {{knew what}} he meant and was tempted to agree, though he felt this was weak. It was {{pleasant}} to lounge, enjoying careless talk, and {{the society of the}} two ladies had its charm. They added a touch of domesticity and gave the place a homelike look, while the girl made an attractive picture as she handed Lawrence his matches and cigarettes. Foster thought it was worth being ill to be waited on like that. Then his chair was comfortable and he could see the <b>sunset</b> <b>fading</b> on the snow.|$|E
6000|$|Newman {{returned}} to Paris {{the second day}} after his interview with Mrs. Bread. The morrow he had spent at Poitiers, reading {{over and over again}} the little document which he had lodged in his pocket-book, and thinking what he would do in the circumstances and how he would do it. He would not have said that Poitiers was an amusing place; yet the day seemed very short. Domiciled once more in the Boulevard Haussmann, {{he walked over to the}} Rue de l'Universite and inquired of Madame de Bellegarde's portress whether the marquise had come back. The portress told him that she had arrived, with M. le Marquis, on the preceding day, and further informed him that if he desired to enter, Madame de Bellegarde and her son were both at home. As she said these words the little white-faced old woman who peered out of the dusky gate-house of the Hotel de Bellegarde gave a small wicked smile--a smile which seemed to Newman to mean, [...] "Go in if you dare!" [...] She was evidently versed in the current domestic history; she was placed where she could feel the pulse of the house. Newman stood a moment, twisting his mustache and looking at her; then he abruptly turned away. But this was not because he was afraid to go in--though he doubted whether, if he did so, he should be able to make his way, unchallenged, into the presence of Madame de Cintre's relatives. Confidence--excessive confidence, perhaps--quite as much as timidity prompted his retreat. He was nursing his thunder-bolt; he loved it; he was unwilling to part with it. He seemed to be holding it aloft in the rumbling, vaguely-flashing air, directly over the heads of his victims, and he fancied he could see their pale, upturned faces. Few specimens of the human countenance had ever given him such pleasure as these, lighted in the lurid fashion I have hinted at, and he was disposed to sip the cup of contemplative revenge in a leisurely fashion. It must be added, too, that he was at a loss to see exactly how he could arrange to witness the operation of his thunder. To send in his card to Madame de Bellegarde would be a waste of ceremony; she would certainly decline to receive him. On the other hand he could not force his way into her presence. It annoyed him keenly to think that he might be reduced to the blind satisfaction of writing her a letter; but he consoled himself in a measure with the reflection that a letter might lead to an interview. He went home, and feeling rather tired--nursing a vengeance was, it must be confessed, a rather fatiguing process; it took a good deal out of one--flung himself into one of his brocaded fauteuils, stretched his legs, thrust his hands into his pockets, and, while he watched the reflected <b>sunset</b> <b>fading</b> from the ornate house-tops on the opposite side of the Boulevard, began mentally to compose a cool epistle to Madame de Bellegarde. While he was so occupied his servant threw open the door and announced ceremoniously, [...] "Madame Brett!" ...|$|E

60|$|In the meanwhile, {{the grain}} was {{ripening}} fast, {{and when the}} riotous Northwest wind began to die away the oats turned lemon and silver, and the wheat burnished gold. The mornings were now sharply cold, and as the green <b>sunset</b> <b>faded</b> the air grew wonderfully bracing.|$|R
60|$|The {{glow of the}} <b>sunset</b> <b>faded,</b> the {{twilight}} deepened into night. The fires burnt the brighter, and some Irishmen away across the meer started singing. But Barnet's men were too weary {{for that sort of}} thing, and soon the bank and the barge were heaped with sleeping forms.|$|R
60|$|The <b>sunset</b> <b>faded</b> to {{twilight}} {{before anything}} further happened. The crowd far {{away on the}} left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.|$|R
60|$|It was a calm {{evening and}} Thirlwell and Scott sat outside the shack, {{watching}} the river while the <b>sunset</b> <b>faded</b> across the woods. A few Metis freighters {{had gone to}} the settlements for supplies and mining tools, and although much depended on the condition of the portages, Scott expected them that night.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the second}} quatrain, Shakespeare {{focuses on the}} [...] "twilight of such day" [...] as death {{approaches}} throughout the nighttime. Barbara Estermann states that, [...] "he {{is concerned with the}} change of light, from twilight to sunset to black night, revealing the last hours of life". Thus he believes that as the <b>sunset</b> <b>fades,</b> the dark night [...] "doth take away" [...] his life, which he {{will not be able to}} regain, after the [...] "black night". As a result, as the night approaches the individual's youth begins to fade away and his old age leads him to the path of death.|$|R
60|$|There {{were days}} when he would not admit that all was lost, and {{harnessing}} his team in the early morning, drove the gang-plow through the soil until the red <b>sunset</b> <b>faded</b> off the plain. In his heart, he knew the fight was hopeless; Festing, for example, in his place, might perhaps make good, {{but he had not}} the stamina for the long struggle. All the same, he worked with savage energy until his mood changed and he went off to hunt sandhill cranes. He would sooner have gone to the poolroom, but there was a risk of his meeting Sadie at the settlement.|$|R

60|$|Robert {{went across}} the yard {{and sat down on}} the rustic bench in the angle of the front porch. It was a fine December evening, as mild as autumn; there had been no snow, and the long fields, sloping down from the homestead, were brown and mellow. A weird, dreamy stillness had fallen upon the purple earth, the windless woods, the rain of the valleys, the sere meadows. Nature seemed to have folded {{satisfied}} hands to rest, knowing that her long, wintry slumber was coming upon her. Out to sea, a dull, red <b>sunset</b> <b>faded</b> out into somber clouds, and the ceaseless voice of many waters came up from the tawny shore.|$|R
60|$|They {{sat down}} to rest under a tree, the {{mountains}} before them with heavy dark clouds hanging on their sides, and the white crowns clear against the blue sky, a perfect stillness on all around, and the red glow of an Italian <b>sunset</b> just <b>fading</b> away.|$|R

60|$|And the {{darkness}} of late afternoon in November, when the fog from the Bristol Channel has laid its pall upon moor and valley and hill: the last grey glimmer of a wintry <b>sunset</b> has <b>faded</b> in the west: earth and sky are wrapped in the gloomy veils of oncoming night. Some little way ahead a tiny light flickers feebly.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a clear}} {{evening in}} March, full of promise of spring, and Ethel was {{standing}} in the church porch at Cocksmoor, after making some visits in the parish, waiting for Richard, while the bell was ringing for the Wednesday evening service, and the pearly tints of a cloudless <b>sunset</b> were <b>fading</b> into the western sky.|$|R
60|$|The whole {{extent of}} the South Seas is a desert of ships; more {{especially}} that part where we were now to sail. No post runs in these islands; communication is by accident; where you may have designed to go is one thing, where you shall be able to arrive another. It was my hope, for instance, to have reached the Carolines, {{and returned to the}} light of day by way of Manila and the China ports; and it was in Samoa that we were destined to re- appear and be once more refreshed with the sight of mountains. Since the <b>sunset</b> <b>faded</b> from the peaks of Oahu six months had intervened, and we had seen no spot of earth so high as an ordinary cottage. Our path had been still on the flat sea, our dwellings upon unerected coral, our diet from the pickle-tub or out of tins; I had learned to welcome shark's flesh for a variety; and a mountain, an onion, an Irish potato or a beef-steak, had been long lost to sense and dear to aspiration.|$|R
60|$|Horses were grazing out in {{the long}} grass and there were deer grazing with them. Roy led round {{a corner of the}} fringed, {{bordering}} woodland, and there, under lofty trees, shone a camp-fire. Huge gray rocks loomed beyond, and then cliffs rose step by step to a notch in the mountain wall, over which poured a thin, lacy waterfall. As Helen gazed in rapture the <b>sunset</b> gold <b>faded</b> to white and all the western slope of the amphitheater darkened.|$|R
60|$|They hauled it down; but the Tyee, being loaded deep {{with heavy}} machinery, was not appreciably drier afterward, {{and by the}} time the angry, saffron <b>sunset</b> <b>faded</b> off the foam-crested sea, she put her bows in {{somewhat}} frequently. Then there was a thud as she charged a big comber, and the frothy cataract that seethed in over her weather rail swirled aft a foot deep, while the spray blew all over her. Jimmy, buttoned to the throat in oilskins, stood at her wheel dripping, through four hours of darkness; and then, crawling down into the little cabin, which was intolerably foul, flung himself into his bunk and incontinently fell asleep, with the thud and swish of falling water going on above him. When he awakened, his first proceeding was to grope for the button that would summon a steward boy to bring him his morning coffee, but as he could not find it he looked around and saw his wet oilskins, which had shaken off the hook, sliding amidst the water up and down the Tyee's cabin floor. Then he remembered suddenly, and, dropping from his bunk, put on the oilskins and went up on deck.|$|R
60|$|A long ride, and {{a hearty}} though frugal supper, {{disposed}} both master and man for rest that night. When the last gleam of <b>sunset</b> had <b>faded</b> {{from the western}} sky, and the last scraps of mare's flesh had vanished from their respective bones; when the stars were twinkling with nocturnal splendour, and all nature was sinking to repose, Lawrence and Quashy {{lay down on the}} grass, spread their ponchos above them, pillowed their weary heads upon their saddles, and slept profoundly.|$|R
60|$|The air {{had been}} warm and {{transparent}} {{through the whole}} of the bright day. Shining metal spires and church-roofs, distant and rarely seen, had sparkled in the view; and the snowy mountain-tops had been so clear that unaccustomed eyes, cancelling the intervening country, and slighting their rugged heights for something fabulous, would have measured them as within a few hours easy reach. Mountain-peaks of great celebrity in the valleys, whence no trace of their existence was visible sometimes for months together, had been since morning plain and near in the blue sky. And now, when it was dark below, though they seemed solemnly to recede, like spectres who were going to vanish, as the red dye of the <b>sunset</b> <b>faded</b> out of them and left them coldly white, they were yet distinctly defined in their loneliness above the mists and shadows. Seen from these solitudes, and from the Pass of the Great Saint Bernard, which was one of them, the ascending Night came up the mountain like a rising water. When it at last rose to the walls of the convent of the Great Saint Bernard, it was as if that weather-beaten structure were another Ark, and floated on the shadowy waves.|$|R
60|$|The rosiness {{died out}} of the <b>sunset</b> as embers <b>fade</b> into thick ash. In herself, too, the ruddy glow sank and went out. The earth was a cold dead heap, {{coloured}} drearily, the sky was dark with flocculent grey ash, and she herself an upright mass of soft ash.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes {{we worked}} until the cold yellow <b>sunsets</b> <b>faded</b> {{out over the}} darkening distances, and the hunter's moon looked down on us through the {{sparkling}} air. The constellations of autumn scintillated above us. Peter and the Story Girl knew all about them, and imparted their knowledge to us generously. I recall Peter standing on the Pulpit Stone, one night ere moonrise, and pointing them out to us, occasionally having {{a difference of opinion}} with the Story Girl over the name of some particular star. Job's Coffin and the Northern Cross were to the west of us; south of us flamed Fomalhaut. The Great Square of Pegasus was over our heads. Cassiopeia sat enthroned in her beautiful chair in the north-east; and north of us the Dippers swung untiringly around the Pole Star. Cecily and Felix were the only ones who could distinguish the double star in the handle of the Big Dipper, and greatly did they plume themselves thereon. The Story Girl told us the myths and legends woven around these immemorial clusters, her very voice taking on a clear, remote, starry sound as she talked of them. When she ceased, we came back to earth, feeling as if we had been millions of miles away in the blue ether, and that all our old familiar surroundings were momentarily forgotten and strange.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} that the horses had eaten their forage and Mouti had forced the bits into their {{reluctant}} mouths, the angry splendour of the <b>sunset</b> <b>faded,</b> and the quiet night was falling over the glowing veldt like the pall on one scarce dead. Fortunately for the travellers, there was a bright half moon, and by its light John managed to direct the cart over many a weary mile. On he went for hour after hour, keeping his tired horses to the collar as best he could, till at last, about eleven o'clock, he saw the lights of Heidelberg before him, and knew that {{the question of whether or}} no his journey was at an end would speedily be decided for him. However, there was nothing for it but to go on and take his chance of slipping through. Presently he crossed a little stream, and distinguished the shape of a cart just ahead, around which men and a couple of lanterns were moving. No doubt, John thought to himself, it was the Bishop, who had been stopped by the Boers. He was quite close to the cart when it moved on, and in another second he was greeted by the rough challenge of a sentry, and caught sight of the cold gleam of a rifle barrel.|$|R
60|$|When it {{was getting}} dark, Kit and Adam went to the bridge and the former noted that his uncle breathed rather hard and seized the rails firmly as he climbed the ladder. The red glow of <b>sunset</b> had <b>faded</b> behind the high land and a gray haze spread across the swampy shore, but the water shone with pale reflections. On one side, a long, dingy smear floated across the sky. It did not move and Kit thought it {{had come from the}} funnel of a steamer whose {{engineer}} had afterwards cleaned his fires. Captain Mayne studied the fleecy trail with his glasses.|$|R

It slowly <b>faded</b> out, the way they do.|$|R

60|$|The sun {{was setting}} golden and red over the broken battlements of the canyons to the west. The {{heat of the day}} blew away on a breeze that bent the tips of the sage-brush. A wild song drifted back from the riders to the fore. And the {{procession}} of Indians moved along, their gay trappings and bright colors beautiful in the <b>fading</b> <b>sunset</b> light.|$|R
60|$|One by one {{the faint}} <b>sunset</b> tints <b>faded</b> from the sky; the far-off crests of the Orange hills grew darker; the nearer files of pines on the Whatnong Mountain became a mere black background; and, with the coming-on of night, came too an icy silence that seemed to stiffen and arrest the very wind itself. The crisp leaves no longer rustled; the waving whips of alder and willow snapped no longer; the icicles no longer dropped a cold fruitage from barren branch and spray; and the {{roadside}} trees relapsed into stony quiet, so that the sound of horse's hoofs breaking through the thin, dull, lustreless films of ice that patched the furrowed road, might have been heard by the nearest Continental picket a mile away.|$|R
60|$|Emily {{stood at}} the gate for some time after Jameson's waggon had disappeared. When the brief burst of <b>sunset</b> splendour had <b>faded</b> out she turned {{and went into the}} garden where late asters and {{chrysanthemums}} still bloomed. She gathered some of the more perfect ones here and there. She loved flowers, but to-night the asters seemed to hurt her, for she presently dropped those she had gathered and deliberately set her foot on them.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of his {{international}} experiences, Frieden visited dozens of countries, and what began as short stories, diaries and poems, many written during his travels, soon emerged as ingredients for future novels. Mysteries and thrillers soon became his passion. His first manuscript, Canvas <b>Sunsets</b> Never <b>Fade,</b> a mystery based on nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, was written in 2000 and published in 2004. His second novel Tranquility Denied is set in post-Cold War Moscow, Stockholm and Southern Louisiana, and is {{the first in a series}} featuring hotshot maritime lawyer Jonathan Brooks. The book was launched in Russia and in the U.S. in late 2006, followed by the sequel, The Serpent's Game, in 2013. His publisher recently announced the upcoming release of two more Jonathan Brooks thrillers, The Pyongyang Option and Letter From Istanbul.|$|R
60|$|The ruddy glow of <b>sunset</b> {{was already}} <b>fading</b> into the sombre shadows of night, when two {{travellers}} {{might have been}} observed swiftly--at a pace of six miles in the hour--descending the rugged side of a mountain; the younger bounding from crag to crag with the agility of a fawn, while his companion, whose aged limbs seemed ill at ease in the heavy chain armour habitually worn by tourists in that district, toiled on painfully at his side.|$|R
60|$|Their journey lasted {{altogether}} a month. Never {{once did}} they come upon any human being save themselves, though in one place they passed the poles--for the most part overthrown--of an old Indian encampment. But this desolation {{was by no means}} lifeless. They saw great quantities of waterbirds, geese, divers, Arctic partridge and the like, they became familiar with the banshee cry of the loon. They lived very largely on geese and partridge. Then for a time about a string of lakes, the country was alive with migrating deer going south, and the men found traces of a wolf. They killed six caribou, and stayed to skin and cut them up and dry the meat to replace the bacon they had consumed, caught, fried and ate great quantities of trout, and became accustomed to the mysterious dance of the northern lights as the <b>sunset</b> afterglow <b>faded.</b>|$|R
60|$|His {{train was}} rather late, and the <b>sunset</b> was <b>fading</b> from the French sky beyond the Italian shore {{when he got}} out of his car and looked round for a porter to take his valise. His roving eye lighted on the anxious figure, which as fully as the anxious face, of a short, stout, elderly man {{expressed}} a sort of distraction, as he stood loaded down with umbrellas, bags, bundles, and wraps, and seemed unable to arrest the movements of a tall young girl, with a travelling-shawl trailing from her arm, who had the effect of escaping from him towards a bench beside the door of the waiting-room. When she reached it, in spite of his appeals, she sat down with an absent air, and looked as far withdrawn from the bustle of the platform and from the snuffling train as if on some quiet garden seat along with her own thoughts.|$|R
