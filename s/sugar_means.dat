Eszencia is the juice of aszú berries which runs off naturally from the vats in which they are collected during harvesting. The sugar concentration of eszencia is typically between 500 g and 700 g per litre, although the year 2000 vintage produced eszencia exceeding 900 g per liter. Eszencia is traditionally added to aszú wines, but may be allowed to ferment (a process that takes at least 4 years to complete) and then bottled pure. The resulting wine has a concentration and intensity of flavor that is unequaled, but is so sweet that it can only be drunk in small quantities. Unlike virtually all other wines, Eszencia maintains its quality and drinkability when stored for 200 years or more.|$|E

50|$|Although fruits {{provide a}} source of {{carbohydrates}}, they have very little protein, and because protein cannot be stored in the body as fat and carbohydrates can, fruitarians {{need to be careful}} that they consume enough protein each day. When the body does not take in enough protein, it misses out on amino acids, which are essential to making body proteins which support the growth and maintenance of body tissues. Consuming high levels of fruit also poses a risk to those who are diabetic or pre-diabetic, due to the negative effect that the large amounts of sugar in fruits has on blood sugar levels. These high levels of <b>sugar</b> <b>means</b> that fruitarians are at high risk for tooth decay. Another concern that fruitarianism presents is that because fruit is easily digested, the body burns through meals quickly, and is hungry again soon after eating. A side effect of the digestibility is that the body will defecate more frequently.Additionally, the Health Promotion Program at Columbia reports that food restrictions in general may lead to hunger, cravings, food obsessions, social disruptions, and social isolation. The severe dietary restrictions inherent in a fruitarian regime also carries the serious risk of triggering orthorexia nervosa.|$|E
40|$|Crucial {{for export}} {{earnings}} and employment, the sugar industries of Fiji, Guyana, and Jamaica are facing hard times. Nevertheless, {{there is life}} still in the old soul of sugar, but it needs investment. As in Fiji and Guyana, sugar (total production 186, 000 t) {{plays an important role}} in the Jamaican economy. While each country produces less than 1 % of world production, their foreign exchange earnings from sugar are crucial, accounting for more than half the agricultural exports. JamaicaÕs sugar, like Guyana's and Fiji's, is exported mainly to the United Kingdom and the United States, under preferential market access and price arrangements. Jamaica's sugar exports to the European Union are subject to a regular annual quota of 126, 000 t (filled every year) plus a supplementary quota of 37, 000 t (sometimes unfilled). Jamaica's sugar industry dates back 600 years. More lately, the country has become a major producer and exporter. But annual output levels are not stable; they declined from an all-time high of 514, 000 t in 1965 to the current level of about 230, 000 t. Eight factories operate on the island with a combined annual capacity for 325, 000 t. Fiji's sugar industry, on the other hand, developed much later, dating back to the 19 th century. It has four mills and produces 500, 000 t. Unlike Jamaica and Guyana, it can take advantage of the structural sugar deficit in Asia as almost half its exports go to regional buyers like Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Malaysia. <b>Sugar</b> <b>means</b> jobs. As in Fiji and Guyana, the Jamaican sugar industry is a major employer. It provides direct employment to 40, 000 persons, including 16, 000 self-employed small farmers and 4, 000 factory workers. This accounts for 4. 2 % of the active working population. The industry also indirectly supports another 100, 000 persons. This compares with direct employment of 30, 000 workers in Guyana and 35, 000 in Fiji, and indirect employment for twice as many people. While Jamaican sugar has declined over the past 20 years, that of Fiji and, recently, of Guyana has exhibited growth. Jamaica's decline can be attributed to several factors: reduction in area under cane cultivation, decline in yields, incidence of smut and rust diseases, poor agronomic practices, scarcity and high cost of inputs due to foreign exchange constraints, poor factory performance, unreliable transportation, and generally weak management in both field and factory. The industry has also gone through various ownership changes. In the early 1970 s, following the withdrawal of foreign operators, ownership of the estates shifted from the private sector to the government. An experiment with cooperative management of field operations at the three largest publicly owned estates ended in 1981. In 1994, publicly owned factories were sold to private companies. The lands were leased partly to the new owners and the rest to cane farmers. At the same time, government regulation and control of the industry, particularly marketing, were relaxed. Sugar output showed some improvement, but the new owners could not finance factory modernisation and to service accumulated debts. Once again, the government was forced to take control of the industry. In Guyana, the factories are government-owned, but they have been managed by the British firm Booker Tate since 1990. The major problem facing Fiji's sugar industry is the expiry of more than 1, 000 cane land leases. As a result, essential investments have been postponed, and yields could remain low in the coming years. Sugar plays a pivotal role in the economy of several countries and any disruption will have a tremendous impact on their entire economies. In Jamaica, the replacement of sugar by tourism, for example, has been advocated, but no other industry could provide the same level of employment to the large semiliterate and unskilled labour force. Operating with low skills, low productivity, and poorly maintained and managed factories, the industry is partly seen as a social necessity. The challenge is to modernise production, and to increase efficiency and productivity. Otherwise the industry will die, as it will not be able to compete under the changing conditions expected early in the new millennium. Modernisation will lower production costs and improve field practices. The former requires re-tooling and the latter, re-training. The changing world market carries many implications: the World Trade Organisation, post-Lomé arrangements between the ACP countries and the EU, and the need to be more competitive in a world dominated by market forces. The choice is to die soon or to invest in a slimmer, more productive future. But invest with what?Crucial for export earnings and employment, the sugar industries of Fiji, Guyana, and Jamaica are facing hard times.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that consumption of refined carbohydrate foods (notably sugar and white flour) increases bile cholesterol saturation and hence the risk of cholesterol gall stone formation. To test this hypothesis, 13 subjects with probable cholesterol gall stones ate refined and unrefined carbohydrate diets, each for six weeks in random order. On the refined carbohydrate diet, subjects ate more refined <b>sugar</b> (<b>mean</b> = SEM: 106 +/- 7 vs 6 +/- 1 g/day, p less than 0. 001), less dietary fibre (13 +/- 1 vs 27 +/- 3 g/day, p less than 0. 001), and had a higher energy intake (9. 17 +/- 0. 66 vs 7. 16 +/- 0. 64 MJ/day, p less than 0. 001). After each diet, the lipid composition of duodenal bile and bile acid kinetics was determined. The cholesterol saturation index of bile was higher on the refined carbohydrate diet in all but one subject, with a mean value of 1. 50 +/- 0. 10 compared with 1. 20 +/- 0. 12 on the unrefined diet (p less than 0. 005). On the refined carbohydrate diet, bile contained relatively less cholic acid and slightly more deoxycholic acid. There were, however, no significant differences in total or individual bile acid pool sizes.

We surveyed persons with sub-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes to evaluate potential relationships between interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments, current self-care practices, motivation to improve self-care practices and satisfaction with current health care for diabetes. Methods 321 patients from a large integrated healthcare system with type 2 diabetes, who were not using insulin and had hemoglobin A 1 c values between 7. 5 - 9. 5 %, were telephoned between 2009 - 2010 and asked about their self-care behaviors, motivation to change, satisfaction with current health care and interest in trying naturopathic (ND) care for their diabetes. Responses from patients most interested in trying ND care were compared with those from patients with less interest. Results 219 (68. 5 %) patients completed the survey. Nearly half (48 %) stated they would be very likely to try ND care for their diabetes if covered by their insurance. Interest in trying ND care was not related to patient demographics, health history, clinical status, or self-care behaviors. Patients with greater interest in trying ND care rated their current healthcare as less effective for controlling their blood <b>sugar</b> (<b>mean</b> response 5. 9 +/- 1. 9 vs. 6. 6 +/- 1. 5, p = 0. 003), and were more determined to succeed in self-care (p = 0. 007).
