40|$|Response of {{pultruded}} Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) beam-to-column joints {{with steel}} bolted web cleats is studied through physical testing. Two joint configurations are considered with either three or two bolts per cleat leg, as per drawings in a pultruder’s Design Manual. Moment-rotation curves, failure modes and potential performance gains from <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>action</b> are determined from two batches, each having six nominally identical joints. Results show that initial joint properties for stiffness and moment can possess, at 19 to 62 %, an extremely high coefficient of variation. All joints failed by fracturing within the FRP column’s flange outstands. Because this failure mode {{has not been}} reported previously {{there is a need}} to establish how its existence influences joint design. As joint properties for the three- and two-bolted configurations are not significantly different, the middle (third) bolt is found to be redundant. Damage is shown to initiate within the column flange outstands when the mid-span deflection of a 5. 08 m span beam, subjected to a uniformly distributed load, is span/ 500. This is half the serviceability vertical deflection limit recommended in the EUROCOMP Design Code and Handbook. The mean joint moment resistance for design is established to be 2. 9 kNm and this is 1. 5 times the moment for damage onset...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the experimental appraisal {{of a series}} of 10 'non-sway' steel column subassemblages, each comprising a 6 m long column with up to three 1. 5 m long beams, together with two full-scale 3 storey, 2 bay, single span, non-sway steel frames (typical overall dimensions 9 m x 10 m x 3. 5 m). The subassemblages tests were conducted in the Department of Civil and Structural Engineering at the University of Sheffield whilst the much larger frame tests were carried out at the Building Research Establishment. In all cases, the beam and column elements were connected using 'simple' bolted steelwork connections. The aim was to investigate the effect of the inherent rotational stiffness (semi-rigid characteristics) of such connections on the behaviour of steel frames in which the columns were loaded biaxially and were not restricted to in-plane deformation. The appraisal of the results from these experiments clearly shows that the stiffness of even the most modest connection can have a significant influence on the distribution of bending moments, the ultimate column capacity and deflection of frame members. The experimental data were subsequently used to validate the predictions of a sophisticated finite-element computer program which was developed specifically to analyse 3 -dimensional column subassemblages employing semi-rigid connections. This thesis documents this validation and reports the findings of an extensive parametric study which was then conducted to investigate the influence of semi-rigid connection behaviour {{on a wide range of}} subassemblage configurations. Comparisons with the experimentally observed and analytically predicted ultimate capacities of the subassemblage and frame tests showed that 'commonly used' methods of frame design are unduly conservative. The author has therefore proposed a number of design approaches for both ultimate and serviceability limit state loading conditions which take into account the inherent benefits of <b>semi-rigid</b> joint <b>action...</b>|$|R
40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} are the results from two {{distinct}} investigations on the behaviour of lightweight framing systems for buildings. One investigation concerns the characterisation of cold-formed steel sections of novel shape {{for the design of}} columns in modular construction, and this is reported {{in the first part of}} thesis. The second new investigation is for a theoretical analysis to determine the elastic critical buckling load for shear-flexible frames of fibre reinforced polymer sections. This work is detailed in the second part to the thesis. Modular 2000 Ltd. fabricated the column specimens that were characterized for the research on lightweight steel modular construction. To determine the reSistance of nine different column types a series of nominal concentric strength tests were conducted on specimens of 2. 7 m length having a new E-section shape. The novelty to the shape is that it has no flat elements and is continuously curved in plan. Open E-sections are of S 350 structural grade steel, are nominally 100 x 43 mm in plan, and have wall thicknesses of either 1. 5 or 2 mm. Various bracket and enclosure combinations were the variables in the nine column types tested. These were connected to the E-sections by MIG plug-welding. Except for the 100 x 40 x 1. 5 mm C-enclosure of S 350, the other attachment components were of steel grade CR 4, at 1. 5 mm thickness. There were five column types with E-sections of 2. 0 mm thickness and four with 1. 5 mm thickness. Reported are the salient results from 54 strength tests, where the mode of failure was global buckling about the minor-axis of the E-column. To also determine the local buckling strength, and the effective area, a small series of stud column tests were performed on 200 mm long specimens of the 1. 5 mm open E-section only. To support the understanding gained from the series of full-sized physical tests on E-columns, a programme of theoretical work is presented which is used to determine the design strengths of the column types and to predict the elastic and inelastic critical loads of a curved panel. Theory is also used to find a plasticity reduction factor for the E-section, which is required to "establish the effective area for local buckling. BS 5950 - 5 : 1998 gives a code of practice for the design of cold-formed thin gauge sections. This current guidance is specific to steel sections comprising Simple shaped members that are of flat elements bounded either by free edges or by bends. The new results from the combined theoretical and eXperimental studies to characterise E-columns are evaluated and used to make recommendations on how SS 5950 - 5 : 1998, and, in particular, Section 6 for members in compression, can be used with E-sections to design modular units. In the second part of the thesis the author shows how a static analysis for plane frames of shear-flexible members, written by a previous Warwick University PhD student, can be modified to calculate the elastic critical buckling load for overall instability. The modified sframe programme provides a practical analysis tool that, importantly, includes non-linearity by way of second-order P-L 1 effects with shear-flexible functions and <b>semi-rigid</b> joint <b>action.</b> In conventional frame analysis shear-flexibility is ignored when members are of isotropic material (steel), and by way of a preliminary parametric study the author shows why the influence of shear deformation on reducing the buckling load of shear-flexible frames should not be neglected when the material is of fibre reinforced polymer. By studying the change in critical load in simple frame problems it is found that there is an interaction between shear-flexibility and the torsional stiffness given to the beam-to column joints. Moreover, the study on the instability of shear-flexible frames provides evidence to suggest that the relative stiffness values for joint classification boundaries are likely to be lower than those for steel frames by Eurocode 3 (BS EN 1993 - 1 : 2005). This is an important finding for when a structural Eurocode or other code of practice is drafted for lightweight framed structures of fibre-reinforced polymer materials. Although the work presented {{in this thesis}} is from two distinct investigations the deliverables are important to the sustainable development of lightweight framing systems for buildings...|$|R
