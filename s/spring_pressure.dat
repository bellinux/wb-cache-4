5|$|The P90 uses {{a unique}} {{horizontally}} mounted feeding system—patented in the United States—that {{contributes to the}} weapon's compact profile and unusual appearance. U.S. Patent 4,905,394 ("Top mounted longitudinal magazine") was awarded in 1990, naming René Predazzer as the sole inventor. The detachable box magazine is mounted parallel to the P90's barrel, fitting flush with {{the top of the}} weapon's frame, and it contains 50 rounds of ammunition which lie in two rows facing left, offset 90° from the bore axis. As the cartridges are pushed back by <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> and arrive at the rear end of the magazine, they are fed as a single row into a spiral feed ramp and rotated 90 degrees, aligning them with the chamber. The magazine body is composed of polymer, and it is semi-transparent to allow the shooter to see the amount of ammunition remaining at any time.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of most {{clarinets}} is divided into the upper joint, the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the lower joint with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both a tone hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key {{on the back of}} the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> to close the hole securely.|$|E
25|$|In another damper technique—half pedaling—the player {{depresses}} {{the pedal}} {{just enough to}} remove the <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> from the bars, {{but not enough to}} make the pad lose contact with the bars. This lets the bars ring slightly longer than with the pad fully up and can make a medium-fast passage sound more legato without pedaling every note.|$|E

50|$|Ballonet air valves were {{originally}} a butterfly type, actuated by <b>springs.</b> If <b>pressure</b> {{rose in the}} ballonet, a <b>spring</b> would <b>pressure</b> the spindle of the butterfly valve to turn, relieving the pressure. In more recent implementations, the valves are actuated electrically either by a linear actuator (driven open/closed) or a linear solenoid (spring return), the latter being the favoured fail-to-safe arrangement.|$|R

25|$|Metals {{and other}} solid {{materials}} expand upon heating and contract upon cooling. This is an undesirable occurrence in electrical systems. Copper {{has a low}} {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} for an electrical conducting material. Aluminium, an alternate common conductor, expands nearly one third more than copper under increasing temperatures. This higher degree of expansion, along with aluminium’s lower ductility, can cause electrical problems when bolted connections are improperly installed. By using proper hardware, such as <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> connections and cupped or split washers at the joint, {{it may be possible to}} create aluminium joints that compare in quality to copper joints.|$|E
25|$|In an {{overcurrent}} condition, a {{value of}} current will be reached that overcomes the control <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> on the spindle and the braking magnet, causing the metal disc to rotate towards the fixed contact. This initial movement of the disc is also held off to a critical positive value of current by small slots that are often cut {{into the side of}} the disc. The time taken for rotation to make the contacts is not only dependent on current but also the spindle backstop position, known as the time multiplier (tm). The time multiplier is divided into 10 linear divisions of the full rotation time.|$|E
25|$|To change up a gear, {{the lever}} is pushed forward (against a <b>spring</b> <b>pressure)</b> towards the +, {{and to change}} down, the lever is pulled {{rearward}} towards the −. The DSG transmission can now be operated with the gear changes being (primarily) determined by the driver. This method of operation is commonly called tiptronic. In the interests of engine preservation, when accelerating in Manual/tiptronic mode, the DSG will still automatically change up just before the redline, and when decelerating, it will change down automatically at very low revs, just before the engine idle speed (tickover). Furthermore, if the driver calls for a gear {{when it is not}} appropriate (e.g., requesting a downshift when engine speed is near the redline) the DSG will not change to the driver's requested gear.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the packet}} loading system {{proved to be}} a design shortcoming, it is not {{uncommon}} to encounter a Gewehr 88 today which still retains it. Some of them were modified to use the stripper clips used with the Gewehr 98 by milling a slot into the left side of the action and adding stripper clip guides on the top of the receiver. Through this slot projects a bar which retains the cartridges in place against the magazine <b>spring's</b> <b>pressure.</b> The hole in the bottom of the rifle is often covered with a small piece of sheet metal.|$|R

25|$|Juddering, shuddering and moaning: This {{is caused}} by an {{irregular}} and unstable flow from the second stage, It {{may be caused by}} a slight positive feedback between flow rate in the second stage body and diaphragm deflection opening the valve, which is not sufficient to cause free-flow, but enough to cause the system to hunt. It is more common on high-performance regulators which are tuned for maximum flow and minimum work of breathing, particularly out of the water, and often reduces or resolves when the regulator is immersed and the ambient water damps the movement of the diaphragm and other moving parts. Desensitising the second stage by closing venturi assists or increasing the valve <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> often stops this problem. Juddering may also be caused by excessive but irregular friction of valve moving parts.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with London Transport from 1937 Leyland developed the Tiger FEC, the initials stood for flat-engined coach. The Leyland 8.6-litre engine (with revised sump) was mounted horizontally in mid wheel-base driving through a Wilson fluid-flywheel and an air-actuated AEC mechanical pre-selector gearbox. The gearbox was {{basically the same}} as used in the STL but it was fitted with an externally mounted air cylinder which actuated the bus bar to engage and disengage the gears. It worked in the opposite way from that in the slightly later RT type double decker in that air pressure was used to disengage the gears instead of being used to keep them engaged. When the gear change pedal was released it allowed the selected gear to engage by means of <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> in that {{same way as the}} gearbox in the STL. The system caused problems in that if a vehicle was left with a gear engaged and the air pressure leaked off {{it was not possible to}} disengage that gear until air pressure had been built up again. Because of this, there were a number of garage incidents caused by vehicles being left overnight with a gear still engaged. 88 of this type were built and 12 were destroyed during World War Two, the rest serving until 1954-5 as Green Line coaches.|$|E
25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E

2500|$|It may be {{desirable}} for the diver {{to have some}} control over the flow characteristics of the demand valve. The usual adjustable aspects are cracking pressure and the feedback from flow rate to internal pressure of the second stage housing. The inter-stage pressure of surface supplied demand breathing apparatus is controlled manually at the control panel, and does not automatically adjust to the ambient pressure {{in the way that}} most scuba first stages do, as this feature is controlled by feedback to the first stage from ambient pressure. This has the effect that the cracking pressure of a surface supplied demand valve will vary slightly with depth, so some manufacturers provide a manual adjustment knob {{on the side of the}} demand valve housing to adjust <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> on the downstream valve, which controls the cracking pressure. The knob is known to commercial divers as [...] "dial-a-breath". A similar adjustment is provided on some high-end scuba demand valves, to allow the user to manually tune the breathing effort at depth ...|$|E

50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse unit ring gear was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached rear unit ring gear to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the rear unit ring gear band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by <b>spring</b> <b>pressure,</b> but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on the rear unit ring gear had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the rear unit ring gear with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse unit ring gear were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|E

This paper presents a statistical performance evaluation of soft seat <b>spring</b> operated <b>pressure</b> relief valves. These pressure relief valves are typically smaller and of lower cost than hard seat (metal to metal) pressure relief valves and can provide substantial cost savings in fluid service applications (air, gas, liquid, and steam) providing that probability of failure on demand (the probability that the pressure relief valve fails to perform its intended safety function during a potentially dangerous over pressurization) {{is at least as}} good as that for hard seat valves. The research in this paper shows that the proportion of soft seat <b>spring</b> operated <b>pressure</b> relief valves failing is the same or less than that of hard seat valves, and that for failed valves, soft seat valves typically have failure ratios of proof test pressure to set pressure less than that of hard seat valves...|$|R
