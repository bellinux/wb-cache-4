And yet, he can be compassionate; he takes Neville Longbottom off {{for a cup of}} tea and a talk after Neville is badly shaken by the demonstration of the Cruciatus Curse.|$|E

500|$|This broad-shouldered {{antelope}} has a muscular, front-heavy appearance, with {{a distinctive}} robust muzzle. Young blue wildebeest are born tawny brown, {{and begin to}} take on their adult colouration {{at the age of}} two months. The adults' hues range from a deep slate or bluish gray to light gray or even grayish brown. The back and flanks are slightly lighter than the ventral surface and underparts. Dark brown vertical stripes mark the area between the neck and the back of the ribcage, thus giving it the name [...] "brindled gnu". The manes of both sexes appear long, stiff, thick and jet black, the same colour as the tail and face as well. While the manes of the western and eastern white-bearded wildebeest are lank, those of the Nyassaland wildebeest and common wildebeest <b>stick</b> <b>up.</b> Scent glands, which secrete a clear oil, are present in the forefeet and are larger in males than females.|$|E
500|$|Depp wears a dreadlock wig in a rock-and-roll {{approach}} to a pirate aesthetic. He wears a red bandanna and numerous objects in his hair, influenced by Keith Richards' habit of collecting souvenirs from his travels; Sparrow's decorations include his [...] "piece of eight". Sparrow wears kohl around his eyes, which was inspired by Depp's study of nomads, whom he compared to pirates, and he wore contacts that acted as sunglasses. Sparrow has several gold teeth, two of which belong to Depp, although they were applied during filming. Depp initially forgot to have them removed after shooting The Curse of the Black Pearl, and wore them throughout the shooting of the sequels. Like all aspects of Depp's performance, Disney initially expressed great concern over Depp's teeth. Sparrow wears his goatee in two braids. Initially wire was used in them, but the wires were abandoned because they made the braids <b>stick</b> <b>up</b> when Depp lay down. Sparrow has numerous tattoos, and has been branded a pirate on his right arm by Cutler Beckett, underneath a tattoo of a sparrow.|$|E

2500|$|Competitors {{in a hurry}} {{sometime}} use thinning shears to {{trim the}} mane and {{give the appearance of}} having been pulled. However, the effect only lasts a couple of weeks at most before the cut hairs begin to grow out and <b>stick</b> <b>up</b> straight into the air. Thus, this method is not advised. [...] Pulled manes also grow out, but take longer, and when the hair begins to grow, it is less stiff and tends to blend more easily with the existing mane.|$|E

[...] PETA also used nudity in its [...] "Veggie Love" [...] ad which it prepared for the Super Bowl only to have it banned by the network. PETA's work has drawn the ire of some feminists who argue that the organization sacrifices women's rights to press its agenda. Lindsay Beyerstein criticized PETA saying [...] "They're the ones drawing disturbing analogies between pornography, misogyny and animal cruelty." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show {{aired on}} Canadian airwaves {{for the first}} time on September 2, 1997 to CHOM in Montreal and CILQ in Toronto. Stern's {{comments}} about French people and their language caused a rift with some listeners. [...] "There is something about the language that turns you into a pussy-assed jack off. Anybody who speaks French is a scum bag. It turns you into a coward. Just like in World War II, they would not <b>stick</b> <b>up</b> for us. Screw your culture and we're invading you all." [...] Ratings for the two stations increased nonetheless by 62% and 47% respectively. Following listener complaints and censorship enforced by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the show was cancelled in Montreal in 1998 and in Toronto in 2001.|$|E

[...] Flustered, Pasternak denied that there was any discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an [...] "eager fumbling manner" [...] Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin finally said, in a mocking tone of voice: [...] "I see, you just aren't able to <b>stick</b> <b>up</b> for a comrade," [...] and put down the receiver.|$|E
