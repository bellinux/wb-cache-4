5|$|MIGA offers {{insurance}} to cover five types of non-commercial risks: currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction; government expropriation; war, terrorism, and civil disturbance; breaches of contract; and the non-honoring of financial obligations. MIGA will cover investments such as equity, loans, shareholder loans, and shareholder loan guarantees. The agency may also insure investments such as management contracts, asset <b>securitization,</b> bonds, leasing activities, franchise agreements, and license agreements. The agency generally offers insurance coverage lasting up to 15 {{years with a}} possible five-year extension depending on a given project's nature and circumstances. When an event occurs that is protected by the insurance, MIGA can exercise the investor's rights against the host country through subrogation to recover expenses associated with covering the claim. However, the agency's convention does not require member governments to treat foreign investments in any special way. As a multilateral institution, MIGA is also {{in a position to}} attempt to sort out potential disputes before they ever turn into insurance claims.|$|E
5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing <b>securitization</b> of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The {{global financial}} crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} off-balance sheet versus on-balance sheet <b>securitizations</b> on the originator's credit risk in the default swap (CDS) market across the recent business cycle from 2002 to 2009. I find that on-balance sheet <b>securitizations</b> demonstrate greater effects on the originator's CDS premium than off-balance sheet <b>securitizations</b> in the business cycle. While off-balance sheet securitizations’ effects on the originator's CDS premium become significantly stronger after 2007 when the economy declines, on-balance sheet securitizations’ effects on the originator's CDS premium do not experience a significant change {{with the onset of}} the recession. The results suggest that the CDS market views originators as having greater probabilities not to honour their implicit guarantees for off-balance sheet <b>securitizations</b> during the economic downturn. The results also indicate that on balance sheet and off-balance sheet <b>securitizations</b> have distinctly different risk properties. It would be beneficial to investors if regulations take into considerations the changing credit risks of off-balance sheet <b>securitizations</b> and the different structures of asset <b>securitizations...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{investigate}} whether banks use loan sales and <b>securitizations</b> (loan transfers) to manage regulatory capital and earnings. My analysis suggests that banks use gains from loan transfers to influence both reported earnings and regulatory capital {{after controlling for}} other economic motivations. The gains can be attributed both to cherry-picking of loans whose market values exceed their book values and also to overvaluation of the retained interests that are carried at fair market value {{in the case of}} <b>securitizations.</b> In addition, the use of <b>securitizations</b> for financial statement management is positively associated with the degree of financial reporting discretion available to managers. Finally, regulatory capital considerations seem to {{play a significant role in}} the decision to transfer loans, while earnings management considerations are more important in the calculation of reported gains conditional on performing a transfer, particularly in the case of <b>securitizations...</b>|$|R
25|$|Modern <b>securitization</b> {{took off}} in the late 1990s or early 2000s, thanks to the {{innovative}} structures implemented across the asset classes, such as UK Mortgage Master Trusts (concept imported from the US Credit Cards), Insurance-backed transaction (such as those implemented by the insurance <b>securitization</b> guru Emmanuel Issanchou) or even more esoteric asset classes (for example <b>securitization</b> of lottery receivables).|$|E
25|$|However, {{the credit}} crisis of 2007–2008 has exposed a {{potential}} {{flaw in the}} <b>securitization</b> process – loan originators retain no residual risk for the loans they make, but collect substantial fees on loan issuance and <b>securitization,</b> which doesn't encourage improvement of underwriting standards.|$|E
25|$|There are main {{players in}} <b>securitization,</b> they include investors, securiters and corporates.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{off-balance}} sheet treatment for <b>securitizations</b> coupled with guarantees from the issuer can hide {{the extent of}} leverage of the securitizing firm, thereby facilitating risky capital structures and leading to an under-pricing of credit risk. Off-balance sheet <b>securitizations</b> also played {{a large role in}} the high leverage level of U.S. financial institutions before the financial crisis, and the need for bailouts.|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} whether asset <b>securitizations</b> {{are really}} asset sales or {{a form of}} secured borrowing, by estimating cross-sectional equity valuation regressions to assess whether the stock market treats securitized assets and liabilities held by a special purpose entity (SPE) as assets and liabilities of the sponsor-originator (S-O). Overall, {{we find that the}} market views the SPE assets and liabilities as belonging to the S-O, i. e., the risk and rewards of ownership of the transferred assets reside with the S-O and not the SPE. Results from a boot-strapping simulation that controls for scale by randomly assigning SPE assets and liabilities from one S-O to another provide evidence that scale bias is an unlikely explanation for finding the market views SPE assets and liabilities as belonging to the S-O. Findings from specifications in which we permit coefficients to differ for S-O firms with high and low relative levels of retained interest indicate that whereas the market views asset <b>securitizations</b> by low retained interest S-O firms as sales, i. e., risk transfer has taken place, it views asset <b>securitizations</b> by high retained interest S-O firms as secured borrowings, i. e., risk transfer is incomplete. We also show that although the market views <b>securitizations</b> by regulated and unregulated S-Os as secured borrowing, there i...|$|R
40|$|The {{mortgage}} {{remains one}} of the most common and successful techniques to finance real estate transactions. In the last 25 years, mortgage loans have also been sold in the secondary market and included in mortgage-backed <b>securitizations.</b> The amazing growth of mortgage <b>securitizations</b> has also led to the development of novel financing techniques, including mezzanine financing and preferred equity investments. This article discusses the historical development of real estate financing from the early beginning of mortgage law and the equity of redemption through the modern advent of mortgage-backed <b>securitizations</b> (MBS) and other non-traditional financings. It argues that the phenomenal success of real estate <b>securitizations</b> along with the growth and power of the national credit rating agencies gave birth to two new popular non-traditional financing techniques - mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments. Employing a detailed explanation of the legal structure and basic underpinnings of mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments, this article argues that lawyers carefully structure mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments to avoid many of the borrower protections associated with junior mortgages, and that these new financing techniques are simply modern day mortgage substitutes. The article concludes that courts should apply traditional property law and recharacterize these financings, thereby treating junior mortgages, mezzanine loans, and preferred equity financings similarly...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the level and}} cyclicality of regulatory bank capital for asset portfolio <b>securitizations</b> {{in relation to the}} cyclicality of capital requirements for the underlying loan portfolio as under Basel II/III. We find that the cyclicality of capital requirements is higher for (i) asset portfolio <b>securitizations</b> relative to primary loan portfolios, (ii) Ratings Based Approach (RBA) relative to the Supervisory Formula Approach, (iii) given the RBA for a point-in-time rating methodology relative to a rate-and-forget rating methodology, and (iv) under the passive reinvestment rule relative to alternative rules. Capital requirements of the individual tranches reveal that the volatility of aggregated capital charges for the securitized portfolio is triggered by the most senior tranches. This {{is due to the fact}} that senior tranches are more sensitive to the macroeconomy. An empirical analysis provides evidence that current credit ratings are time-constant and that economic losses for <b>securitizations</b> have exceeded the required capital in the recent financial crisis...|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{corporate}} bonds, most <b>securitizations</b> are amortized, {{meaning that}} the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan, rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan. Fully amortizing <b>securitizations</b> are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets, such as home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans. Prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing ABS. The possible rate of prepayment varies widely {{with the type of}} underlying asset pool, so many prepayment models have been developed to try to define common prepayment activity. The PSA prepayment model is a well-known example.|$|R

25|$|To {{facilitate}} the <b>securitization</b> of non-mortgage assets, businesses substituted private credit enhancements.
