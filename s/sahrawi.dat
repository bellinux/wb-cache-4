25|$|There {{are also}} {{persistent}} allegations {{of violence against}} <b>Sahrawi</b> pro-independence and pro-Polisario demonstrators in Western Sahara, considered by Morocco as its Southern Provinces, and Morocco {{has been accused of}} detaining <b>Sahrawi</b> independentists as prisoners of conscience.|$|E
25|$|The Polisario Front was {{formally}} constituted on 10 May 1973 at Ain Bentili by several <b>Sahrawi</b> university students, {{survivors of the}} 1968 massacres at Zouerate and some <b>Sahrawi</b> men who {{had served in the}} Spanish Army. They called themselves the Constituent Congress of the Polisario Front.|$|E
25|$|Thousands of <b>Sahrawi</b> nomads were fleeing east to Algeria.|$|E
25|$|Algeria {{provided}} {{a haven for}} Polisario and for <b>Sahrawi</b> refugees in the Tindouf area.|$|E
25|$|Tifariti was {{the place}} of several battles during the Western Sahara War (1975–1991) {{and served as a}} {{military}} base and stronghold for both sides at various points of the war. It was also used as a stopping place for <b>Sahrawi</b> refugees en route to Tindouf (Algeria) during the invasion phase (1975–76). Some sources claim that in January 1976 there were 15,000 <b>Sahrawi</b> refugees around the town.|$|E
25|$|On the 2012 edition, ARTifariti {{moved its}} {{activities}} to the <b>Sahrawi</b> {{refugee camps in}} Tindouf, Algeria.|$|E
25|$|According to Moroccan sources, about 1,200 {{men were}} {{involved}} in the battle including Algerian soldiers and <b>Sahrawi</b> militia men.|$|E

25|$|It is {{also the}} name of a Daïra of the Wilaya of Smara, in the <b>Sahrawi</b> refugee camps.|$|E
25|$|The Sahara International Film Festival, held {{annually}} in the <b>Sahrawi</b> refugee camps in western Algeria near the border of Western Sahara, is notable as the only film festival {{in the world to}} take place in a refugee camp. The festival has the two-fold aim of providing cultural entertainment and educational opportunities to refugees, and of raising awareness of the plight of the <b>Sahrawi</b> people, who have been exiled from their native Western Sahara for more than three decades.|$|E
25|$|Spain officially {{withdrew from}} the {{territory}} on 27 February 1976, and that day Polisario formally proclaimed the <b>Sahrawi</b> Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).|$|E
25|$|It {{was mainly}} {{inhabited}} by the <b>Sahrawi</b> people, a nomadic people of mixed Arab and Berber origin who practice Sunni Islam.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations {{considers}} the Polisario Front {{to be the}} legitimate representative of the <b>Sahrawi</b> people, and maintains that the Sahrawis {{have a right to}} self-determination.|$|E
25|$|A {{comprehensive}} peace treaty was signed on 5 August 1979, {{in which the}} new government recognized <b>Sahrawi</b> rights to Western Sahara and relinquished its own claims. Mauritania withdrew all its forces and would later proceed to formally recognize the <b>Sahrawi</b> Arab Democratic Republic, causing a massive rupture in relations with Morocco. King Hassan II of Morocco immediately claimed the area of Western Sahara evacuated by Mauritania (Tiris al-Gharbiya, roughly corresponding to the southern half of Río de Oro), which was unilaterally annexed by Morocco in August 1979.|$|E
25|$|The Polisario kept up {{the guerrilla}} war while they {{simultaneously}} had to help guard the columns of <b>Sahrawi</b> refugees fleeing, but after the air bombings by the Royal Moroccan Air Force on improvised <b>Sahrawi</b> refugee camps in Umm Dreiga, Tifariti, Guelta Zemmur and Amgala, the Front had to relocate the refugees to Tindouf (western region of Algeria). For {{the next two years}} the movement grew tremendously as <b>Sahrawi</b> refugees continued flocking to the camps and Algeria and Libya supplied arms and funding. Within months, its army had expanded to several thousand armed fighters, camels were replaced by modern jeeps (most of them were Spanish Land Rover Santana jeeps, captured from Moroccan soldiers), and 19th-century muskets were replaced by assault rifles. The reorganized army was able to inflict severe damage through guerrilla-style hit-and-run attacks against opposing forces in Western Sahara and in Morocco and Mauritania proper.|$|E
25|$|From 1974, {{refugees}} from the contested Spanish Sahara started arriving to the Tindouf area, following an earlier wave from the 1958 unrest. This turned into a major exodus from 1975 onwards, when Morocco and Mauritania seized control of what was then called Western Sahara, and Algeria retaliated by allowing the Polisario Front, a nationalist <b>Sahrawi</b> movement, to use the area as its main base. <b>Sahrawi</b> refugee camps were established in 1975-6 here. The Polisario remains in the province, running the large refugee camps located south of Tindouf city.|$|E
25|$|The Polisario Front is outlawed in {{the parts}} of Western Sahara under Moroccan control, and {{it is illegal to}} raise its party flag (often called the <b>Sahrawi</b> flag) there.|$|E
25|$|Afro-Cubans are descended {{primarily}} from the Yoruba people, Bantu people from the Congo basin, Carabali people and Arará from the Dahomey {{as well as several}} thousand North African refugees, most notably the <b>Sahrawi</b> Arabs of Western Sahara.|$|E
25|$|Morocco {{had been}} {{fighting}} Spain for the liberation of this territory since 1957 after the Ifni war while Polisario Front, an organization of the local <b>Sahrawi</b> people, {{had been fighting}} for independence since its foundation on 1973.|$|E
25|$|In {{the former}} Spanish {{province}} of Western Sahara, Spanish is de facto official (however, in the <b>Sahrawi</b> Arab Democratic Republic, {{one of the}} claimants to the territory, it is de jure co-official). Most Arabic speakers speak Spanish as second language.|$|E
25|$|The {{posture of}} Iran about the Western Sahara dispute had been heavily {{influenced}} by its diplomatic relations with the neighbouring countries, Morocco and Algeria. Since late January 1979, the deposed Shah of Persia, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, had been granted asylum in Morocco by Hassan II, who refused to repatriate him back to Iran to be judged, causing finally the break of relations between Iran and Morocco in 1981. Previously, on 27 February 1980, Iran gave formal diplomatic recognition to the <b>Sahrawi</b> Arab Democratic Republic as the legitimate government of the territory of Western Sahara. The support to the Polisario Front continued during the 1980s, allowing the <b>Sahrawi</b> national liberation movement to open a diplomatic representation in Tehran.|$|E
25|$|Col. Mustafa Ould Salek's CMRN junta proved {{incapable}} of either establishing a strong base of power or extracting {{the country from}} its destabilizing conflict with the <b>Sahrawi</b> resistance movement, the Polisario Front. It quickly fell, {{to be replaced by}} another military government, the CMSN.|$|E
25|$|In October 2003, the Polisario Front {{held its}} XI General Popular Congress here, electing {{officials}} to its executive National Secretariat, the exile parliament of the <b>Sahrawi</b> National Council, {{as well as}} reelecting (92%) Mohamed Abdelaziz as Secretary General, {{as has been the}} case since 1976.|$|E
25|$|The Polisario {{has stated}} that it will, when <b>Sahrawi</b> {{self-determination}} has been achieved, either function as a party {{within the context of}} a multi-party system, or be completely disbanded. This is to be decided by a Polisario Front congress upon the achievement of Western Sahara's independence.|$|E
25|$|Cascavel Mk II: Popularly nicknamed Cascavel Gordo (fat rattlesnake) for {{its wide}} turret ring, this was Engesa's first export model and entered service with Qatar, Bolivia, the <b>Sahrawi</b> Arab Democratic Republic, and Libya. It was {{equipped}} with an H-90 turret adopted from the Panhard AML-90 and an automatic transmission.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 edition, {{a teenage}} <b>Sahrawi</b> refugee named Ibrahim Hussein Leibeit lost {{half of his}} right leg in a {{landmine}} explosion. The incident happened when Ibrahim and dozens of young Sahrawis crossed the line into a minefield while aiming to throw stones {{to the other side}} of the wall.|$|E
25|$|MINURSO is {{the only}} UN {{peacekeeping}} mission established since 1978 to be operating without the capacity to monitor human rights. Although Resolution 1979 of the UN Security Council recommends the establishment of one, this has not yet happened. In 1995, MINURSO's inability or unwillingness to act against perceived Moroccan manipulation of the process, and abuse of <b>Sahrawi</b> civilians, caused its former deputy chairman Frank Ruddy to deliver a strong attack on the organization; he has since kept up his critique of what he argues is an economically costly and politically corrupt process. Growing criticism has been voiced against the UN Security Council for not establishing a program of human rights (as MINURSO {{is the only}} UN mission {{in the world who}} has no mandate on them) monitoring for Western Sahara and the <b>Sahrawi</b> population, despite serious reports of numerous abuses.|$|E
25|$|Primarily a nomadic encampment {{located near}} an oasis, {{it was always}} a kind of {{seasonal}} town for the Sahrawis, an Arabic-speaking Bedouin people controlling the area since medieval times. In 1912, a French Foreign Legion expedition commanded by Captain Gerard, who was trying to link with their troops in Morocco, was exterminated by <b>Sahrawi</b> rebel nomads near Tifariti.|$|E
25|$|The Tropas Nómadas (Nomad Troops) were an {{auxiliary}} regiment of <b>Sahrawi</b> tribesmen {{serving in the}} colonial army in Spanish Sahara (today Western Sahara). Operational from the 1930s {{until the end of}} the Spanish presence in the territory in 1975, the Tropas Nómadas were equipped with small arms and led by Spanish officers. The unit guarded outposts and sometimes conducted patrols on camelback.|$|E
25|$|Born in 1940 in the Nouadhibou region (either in then-Spanish Sahara or colonial Mauritania), into {{a family}} of the <b>Sahrawi</b> Laaroussien tribe, he passed to {{secondary}} education in Rosso near the border to French-administered Senegal. He earned a baccalaureat in science in Dakar, Senegal, in 1961. After joining the Mauritanian army in 1962, he studied in French military colleges, notably Saint-Cyr.|$|E
25|$|Haidallah's main {{achievement}} {{was to make}} peace with the Western Sahara-based Polisario Front, which had been fighting Mauritania since it annexed part of the former Spanish colony in 1975. The CMSN opted for complete withdrawal from the conflict, evacuating southern Rio de Oro (which had been annexed as Tiris El Gharbiya) and recognizing the POLISARIO as the representative of the <b>Sahrawi</b> people. This led to a crisis in relations with the country's until-then ally Morocco, which had similarly annexed the remainder of Western Sahara, with Haidallah's government facing an attempted coup, troop clashes and military tension. Relations were completely severed between 1981 and 1985, when they were restored by Haidalla's successor. However, relations improved with POLISARIO's main regional backer, Algeria, with the Algerian government sending arms and supplies to bolster his regime. Haidalla's 1984 recognition of the <b>Sahrawi</b> Arab Democratic Republic (SADR, the POLISARIO's government-in-exile) as a sovereign nation appears to {{have been one of the}} triggering causes for Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya's coup in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Hospitals and {{administrative}} buildings were built here between 1989 and 1991 by foreign aid agencies {{in preparation for}} a <b>Sahrawi</b> refugee return to Western Sahara, for the holding of a UN-backed referendum on either independence or integration with Morocco. That infrastructures were destroyed by the Royal Moroccan Air Force in August 1991, {{a few days before the}} proclamation of the cease-fire.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the end of}} the 1980s, {{several members}} of the Polisario have decided to {{discontinue}} their military or political activities for the Polisario Front. Most of them returned from the <b>Sahrawi</b> refugee camps in Algeria to Morocco, among them a few founder members and senior officials. Some of them are now actively promoting Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, which Morocco considers its Southern Provinces.|$|E
25|$|Spain {{captured}} present-day Western Sahara after 1874, although Rio del Oro {{remained largely}} under <b>Sahrawi</b> influence. In 1912, Italy captured parts {{of what was}} to be named Libya from the Ottomans. To promote the Roman Catholic religion in the desert, Pope Pius IX appointed a delegate Apostolic of the Sahara and the Sudan in 1868; later in the 19th century his jurisdiction was reorganized into the Vicariate Apostolic of Sahara.|$|E
25|$|The SPLA {{traditionally}} employed ghazzi tactics, i.e., motorized surprise raids over great distances, {{which were}} inspired by the traditional camel-back war parties of the <b>Sahrawi</b> tribes. However, after {{the construction of the}} Moroccan Wall this changed into tactics more resembling conventional warfare, with a focus on artillery, snipers and other long-range attacks. In both phases of the war, SPLA units relied on superior knowledge of the terrain, speed and surprise, and on the ability to retain experienced fighters.|$|E
25|$|No EU {{member state}} has embassy in the {{countries}} of Bahamas, Bhutan (Denmark Liaison office), Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Liberia (EU delegation), Liechtenstein, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Samoa (EU office), Somalia, Swaziland (EU office), Tonga, Tuvalu, the sovereign entity Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the partially recognised countries <b>Sahrawi</b> Arab Democratic Republic and Republic of China (Taiwan) (17 non-diplomatic offices). The European Commission also has no delegations or offices to most of them (exceptions mentioned in brackets).|$|E
