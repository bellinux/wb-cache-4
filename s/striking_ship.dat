40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} collision scenario random variables {{on the extent of}} predicted damage in ship collisions. Struck and <b>striking</b> <b>ship</b> speed, collision angle, <b>striking</b> <b>ship</b> type and <b>striking</b> <b>ship</b> displacement are treated as independent random variables. Other <b>striking</b> <b>ship</b> characteristics are treated as dependent variables derived from the independent variables based on relationships developed from worldwide ship data. A simplified collision model (SIMCOL) is used to assess the sensitivity of probabilistic damage extent to these variables. SIMCOL applies the scenario variables directly in a time-stepping simultaneous solution of internal (structural) and external (ship) problems vice an uncoupled solution of these problems. During the simultaneous solution SIMCOL also calculates struck ship absorbed energy in the longitudinal and transverse directions. These results are compared to absorbed energy estimated based on uncoupled external dynamics only. The necessity and effectiveness of this approach is examined...|$|E

One part of this study is investigation of the consequences of ship-to-ship collisions. This paper describes two sets of finite element analyses performed to assess the structural response of a small freighter and the loading imparted to radioactive material (RAM) packages during several postulated collision scenarios with another ship. The first series of analyses was performed to evaluate the amount of penetration of the freighter hull by a <b>striking</b> <b>ship</b> of various masses and initial velocities. Although these analyses included a representation of a single RAM package, the package was not impacted during the collision so forces on the package could not be computed. Therefore, a second series of analyses incorporating a representation of a row of seven packages was performed to ensure direct package impact by the <b>striking</b> <b>ship.</b> Average forces on a package were evaluated for several initial velocities and masses of the <b>striking</b> <b>ship.</b> In addition to. providing insight to ship and package response during a few postulated ship collisions scenarios, these analyses will be used to benchmark simpler ship collision models used in probabilistic risk assessment analyses...|$|E

The work {{presented in this paper}} aimed to understand both the crushing behavior and the nacelle dynamics of a predefined monopile {{offshore wind}} turbine when impacted by a ship. Another objective was to deeply investigate the influence of various parameters like ship impact velocity and location, wind direction, soil stiffness and deformability of the <b>striking</b> <b>ship.</b> First, nonlinear numerical simulations of ship - Offshore Wind Turbine (OWT) collisions have been carried out with a rigid <b>striking</b> <b>ship</b> for {{a better understanding of the}} OWT’s structural behaviour during collision.

In ship collisions, short-period load is distributed during impact process from <b>striking</b> <b>ship</b> into struck ship.

These scenarios are calculated by finite element approach to obtain characteristic on damage, energy as well as load during and after impact processes. The results indicate that the damages on impact to longitudinal components such as main and car decks are smaller than impact to transverse structure components. The damage and deformation are widely distributed to almost side structures including inner structure. The width between outer and inner shells is very affecting the damage mode where the width below the two meters will make inner shell experience damage beyond plastic deformation.

40|$|Recent {{intercontinental}} {{radioactive material}} shipping campaigns have focused public and regulatory {{attention on the}} safety of transport of this material by ocean-going vessels. One major concern is {{the response of the}} vessel and onboard radioactive material (RAM) packages during a severe ship-to-ship collision. These collisions occur at velocities less than the velocity obtained in the Type B package regulatory impact event and the bow of the <b>striking</b> <b>ship</b> is less rigid than the unyielding target used in those tests (Ammerman and Daidola, 1996). This implies that ship impact is not a credible scenario for damaging the radioactive material packages during ship collisions. It is possible, however, for these collisions to generate significant amounts of crush force by the bow of the impacting ship overrunning the package. It is the aim of this paper to determine an upper bound on the magnitude of this crush force taking into account the strength of the radioactive material carrying vessel and any other cargo that may be stowed in the same hold as the radioactive material...|$|E

It is directly connected to the well-known super-elements method, which is a simplified procedure allowing for a quick estimation of the damages caused to both the striking and struck vessels during such events. In this article, a new analytical formulation is presented for estimating the impact resistance provided by inclined ship side panels. Two different scenarios are treated.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the design of lock gates submitted to ship impacts. In this paper, a simplified analytical method is presented to evaluate the resistance of such structures under collision. The basic idea is to assume that the resistance is first provided through a local deforming mode, corresponding to a localized crushing of some impacted structural elements. For consecutive larger deformations, the resistance is then mostly provided through a global deforming mode, corresponding to an overall movement of the entire gate. For assessing the resistance {{in the case of the}} local deforming mode, the structure is divided into a given number of large structural entities called "superelements. " For each of them, a relation between the resistance of the gate and the penetration of the <b>striking</b> <b>ship</b> is established. However, as some results are already available in the literature, this subject is not treated extensively in this paper. On the contrary, the calculation of the resistance of the gate provided through the global mode is detailed and the strategy to switch from local to global deformation is highlighted. Finally, we propose to validate our developments by making a comparison between results obtained numerically and those predicted by the present analytical approach...|$|E

The geometry of {{the bow of the}} <b>striking</b> <b>ship</b> is idealised such that it can be described by only few parameters, still covering with sufficient accuracy almost all existing ship bows with and without bulbs. The model for the internal mechanics of the struck ship side is based on a set of so-called super-elements. Each super-element represents an assembly of structural components and contains solutions for the structural behaviour of this assembly under deep collapse. By summing up the crushing force of each super-element, it is possible to determine the total contact load between the two involved ships. A number of parameter studies are presented where the sensitivity of the damage to the loading conditions and striking positions are illustrated. Furthermore, the difference between longitudinal and transverse bow stiffening has been examined. Transversely stiffened bows are shown to be significantly softer than longitudinally stiffened bows. Thirty collision events with five different striking vessels and six different struck vessels have been examined. The examples illustrate that the usual assumption of a rigid bow only holds true for certain categories of struck and striking vessels. 2...|$|E

The International Maritime Organization strives towards a more risk-based view on addressing the damage stability of ships. The current study addresses the survivability following a ship collision by the use of a sequential (de-coupled) computational methodology. The methodology is comprised of structural analysis of a collision scenario followed by dynamic damage stability simulations of the struck ship in order to establish the time to capsize of the struck ship. The emphasis of the current investigation is on the structural computations of the collision event; explicit finite element analyses are presented for a case study of a collision scenario. In particular, uncertainties of input parameters in the finite element simulations and their impact on the shape and size of the damage opening area, and time to capsize of the struck ship, are addressed.

Such models have been used to assess the performance of the struck ship in case she is involved in a collision. Further it was and it is still highly desirable to develop design tools which could provide guidance for the construction of ship hulls which will minimize as far as possible the risk in case of a collision. In order to assess the collision behaviour of a ship, {{there is a need to}} test her under specific collision incidents, which are described by a number of parameters, such as the particulars of the <b>striking</b> <b>ship</b> including the stiffness of her bow, the speeds and relative orientation of the two vessels, sea conditions, etc. The assessment methodologies are deterministic, i. e. they are based on one or a few severe collision scenarios, or probabilistic, i. e. they consider distribution functions of one or more collision parameters. The paper presents and discusses existing codes concerning collision scenarios for floating and fixed marine structures, presents data that can be used for the determination of the level of the loading that a ship may experience if she is involved in a collision and gives examples of relevant calculations. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.
