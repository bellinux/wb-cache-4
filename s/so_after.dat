Anthony suspected that he was not receiving full payment from his record label for his recordings. Mercado would not allow Anthony to leave the record label because his contract committed Anthony to record four more albums for RMM.|$|E

The first, and greatest, was Alexandria in Egypt, which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities. The cities' {{locations}} reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. At first, the cities must have been inhospitable, little more than defensive garrisons. Following Alexander's death, many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece.
