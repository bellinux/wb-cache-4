50|$|Early {{engine oil}} filters were of {{cartridge}} (or replaceable element) construction, {{in which a}} permanent housing contains a replaceable filter element or cartridge. The housing is mounted either directly on the engine or remotely with supply and return pipes connecting it to the engine. In the mid-1950s, the <b>spin-on</b> <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> design was introduced: a self-contained housing and element assembly {{which was to be}} unscrewed from its mount, discarded, and replaced with a new one. This made filter changes more convenient and potentially less messy, and quickly came to be the dominant type of oil filter installed by the world's automakers. Conversion kits were offered for vehicles originally equipped with cartridge-type filters. In the 1990s, European and Asian automakers in particular began to shift back in favor of replaceable-element filter construction, because it generates less waste with each filter change. American automakers have likewise begun to shift to replaceable-cartridge filters, and retrofit kits to convert from spin-on to cartridge-type filters are offered for popular applications. Commercially available automotive oil filters vary in their design, materials, and construction details. Ones that are made from completely synthetic material excepting the metal drain cylinders contained within are far superior and longer lasting than the traditional cardboard/cellulose/paper type that still predominate. These variables affect the efficacy, durability, and cost of the filter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a modern unit, with a {{water-cooled}} inline design with forged crankshaft, alloy cross-flow head and five main bearings. An unusual feature on early models was {{the absence of}} a <b>spin-on</b> paper <b>oil</b> <b>filter.</b> Instead, the engine featured a form of centrifugal <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> in the hollow rear crankshaft pulley, although all later versions used the more traditional disposable cartridge filters. One of its major innovations was the use of a swirl vortex on the intake valve port which gave very good combustion, and thus both power and economy for this time. This engine proved cheap to build, and several models of different sizes and market segments used this displacement, which survived until 1982, as the ever-present entry level for the Simca 1100.|$|R
25|$|When introduced, the block-mounted <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> {{check valve}} was {{eliminated}} on the 4.0 (along with the 2.5 and 4.2s manufactured after September 1986) when AMC engineers standardized their <b>oil</b> <b>filters.</b> The pre-1987 engines had an <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> adapter with 3/4 (cylinder block end) and 13/16 threads (which used a GM <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac V8 engines) while the 1987-06 engines were originally {{fitted with a}} 20mm metric thread filter (later revised in 1991 for the common 3/4 threaded Mopar and Ford V8 oil filter; the <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> adapter was redesigned where the <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> is positioned 90 degrees offset adjacent to the starter motor - a Ford V8 <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> {{can be used in}} place of the short <b>filter</b> increasing <b>oiling</b> capacity).|$|R

50|$|Mexican {{production}} {{began in}} 1955 because of agreements with {{companies such as}} Chrysler in Mexico and the Studebaker-Packard Corporation which assembled cars imported in CKD form. In 1964, they began to be locally produced. These models have the larger windshield, rear window, door and quarter glass starting in 1972; and the rear window from 1965 to 1971 German built models was used on the Mexican models from 1972 to 1985, when it was replaced with the larger rear window used on 1972 and later German built Beetles. This version, after the mid-1970s, saw little change with the incorporation of electronic ignition in 1988, an anti-theft alarm system in 1990, a catalytic converter in 1991 (as required by law), as well as electronic Digifant fuel injection, hydraulic valve lifters, and a <b>spin-on</b> <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> in 1993. The front turn signals were located in the bumper instead of the Beetle's traditional placement {{on top of the}} front fenders from the 1977 model year on, as they had been on German Beetles sold in Europe from 1975 onwards. Starting in 1995, the Mexican Beetle included front disc brakes, an alternator instead of a generator, and front automatic seat belts. During the 1995 model year, the chrome moldings disappeared leaving body colored bumpers and black moldings instead on some models. By the start of the 1996 model year, exterior chrome or matt moldings were dropped altogether and Volkswagen de Mexico (VWdM) dropped the Sedan's flow-through ventilation system with all its fittings, notably the exterior crescent-shaped vents behind the rear side windows the same year.|$|E

25|$|Land Rover's radically updated {{product line}} was {{launched}} in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a <b>spin-on</b> cartridge <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{automobile}} engines {{did not use}} <b>oil</b> <b>filters.</b> For this reason, {{along with}} the generally low quality of oil available, very frequent oil changes were required. The first <b>oil</b> <b>filters</b> were simple, generally consisting of a screen placed at the oil pump intake. On November 27, 1923, American inventors George Greenhalgh and Ernest Sweetland filed U.S. Patent #1721250 for an automotive <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> and called it the Purolator, a portmanteau of [...] "pure oil later". The Purolator <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> was the first <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> invented for the automobile and revolutionized the filtration industry. The Purolator <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> is still in production today. This original invention was a bypass filter: most of the oil flowed directly from the oil pan to the engine's working parts, and a smaller proportion of the oil was sent through the filter via a second flow path in parallel with the first. The <b>oil</b> was thus <b>filtered</b> over time. Modern bypass <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> systems for diesel engines are becoming popular in consumer applications, but have been in commercial use for some time due to potential reduction in maintenance costs.Oil filters are generally located near the middle or bottom of the engine.|$|R
