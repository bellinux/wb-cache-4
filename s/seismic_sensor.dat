This group released three albums: Travelling (1994), Xenophon (1998), and Bone Man (2002). The latter two albums feature another McMahon innovation: the mouth-held use of a geologist's <b>seismic</b> <b>sensor</b> to amplify the growling subsonic didgeridoo dynamics. This gave McMahon a new audience: the trance, dance crowd. Xenophon was nominated at the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 for 'Best Indigenous Release'.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} multiple sensor modalities in order to perform traffic analysis for health monitoring of transportation infrastructure. In particular, testbeds containing video and <b>seismic</b> <b>sensors</b> giving complementary information about vehicles are described. Computer vision algorithms are used to detect and track the vehicles and extract their properties. This information is combined with the data from <b>seismic</b> <b>sensors</b> for robust classification of vehicles. Experimental results obtained with our testbeds are described. I.

40|$|An {{intrusion}} {{monitoring system}} includes {{an array of}} <b>seismic</b> <b>sensors,</b> such as geophones, arranged along a perimeter to be monitored for unauthorized intrusion as by surface movement or tunneling. Two wires lead from each sensor to a central monitoring station. The central monitoring station has three modes of operation. In a first mode of operation, the output {{of all of the}} <b>seismic</b> <b>sensors</b> is summed into a receiver for amplification and detection. When the amplitude of the summed signals exceeds a certain predetermined threshold value an alarm is sounded. In a second mode of operation, the individual output signals from the sensors are multiplexed into the receiver for sequentially interrogating each of the sensors...|$|R
50|$|The MASSur <b>Seismic</b> <b>Sensor,</b> {{developed}} by the University of Calgary will provide depth profiles of the Martian surface. Specifically, a seismometer will conduct tests to determine the rigidity and elasticity of the Martian topsoil {{as well as its}} rock properties. Sediments, permafrost, and water may all have distinct signatures. This seismic system will use a vibrational source and elastic-wave receivers (accelerometers) on both the lander and on the Beaver Rover. The redundancy of lander and rover appartus, ensures that some primary science objectives can be met without rover deployment.|$|E

First the mine detonates a clearing charge, which removes any earth {{that may have been}} laid over the mine, then it triggers the Misznay Schardin effect charge, which projects a slug of metal upwards. In testing the mine penetrated up to 100 millimeters of armour, although it can official penetrate only 70 millimeters.|$|E

40|$|Questions {{have arisen}} {{regarding}} {{the applicability of}} <b>seismic</b> <b>sensors</b> to detect mining (re-entry) with a tunnel boring machine (TBM). Unlike cut and blast techniques of mining which produce impulsive seismic signals, the TBM produces seismic signals which are of long duration. (There are well established techniques available for detecting and locating {{the sources of the}} impulsive signals.) The Yucca Mountain repository offered an opportunity to perform field evaluations of the capabilities of <b>seismic</b> <b>sensors</b> because during much of 1996, mining there was progressing {{with the use of a}} TBM. During the mining of the repository`s southern branch, an effort was designed to evaluate whether the TBM could be detected, identified and located using <b>seismic</b> <b>sensors.</b> Three data acquisition stations were established in the Yucca Mountain area to monitor the TBM activity. A ratio of short term average to long term average algorithm was developed for use in detection based on the characteristics shown in the time series. For location of the source of detected signals, FK analysis was used on the array data to estimate back azimuths. The back azimuth from the 3 component system was estimated from the horizontal components. Unique features in the timing of the seismic signal were used to identify the source as the TBM...|$|R

50|$|The mine uses a copper-lined shaped {{charge to}} attack the {{underside}} of vehicles as they pass over the mine.

The mine uses a battery-powered electronic fuzing which uses a combination of a <b>seismic</b> <b>sensor</b> and a magnetic influence sensor to trigger the mine at the optimal point. It is fitted with a tilt-based anti-handling device: once armed the mine will trigger if it is tilted more than 20 degrees.
