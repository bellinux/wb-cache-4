40|$|Abstract. —Pink heelsplitter mussels Potamilus alatus {{were held}} at two bottom {{locations}} and suspended in <b>pocket</b> <b>nets</b> in a pond at the Freshwater Mollusk Conservation Center, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, for 1 year to evaluate survival in captivity. Survival after 1 year differed significantly; the poorest survival (30. 0 %) {{was at the bottom}} of the deep end (2. 5 m), and there was no difference in survival) at the shallow end (83. 3 %; 0. 6 m) and in <b>pocket</b> <b>nets</b> (63. 3 %; 1 – 1. 5 m). Monthly survival was inversely related to water temperature (R 0. 72); the lowest monthly survival occurred in summer, resulting in a significant difference among the three locations. Differences in the mean glycogen content of mussels among the three containment locations and wild-sampled pink heelsplitter mussels were significant (P 0. 001); the highest value was in mussels at the shallow end and the lowest value was in mussels at the deep end. We used <b>pocket</b> <b>nets</b> to hold surgically implanted mussels and measured glycogen reserves to monitor body condition and assess the potential of the pink heelsplitter mussel to produce nonnucleated and image pearls. Results of the pearl culture experiment in two ponds showed that nonnucleated pearls and image pearls with purple or purplish luster were successfully produced. There was no significant difference in pearl weight in mussels held in the two experimental ponds under different environmental conditions. Similarly, no differences in monthly survival rates of mussels were observed in either pond or among mussels with surgical implants an...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Trawls {{are used}} {{extensively}} during fisheries abundance surveys to derive estimates of fish density and, {{in the case}} of acoustic-based surveys, to identify acoustically sampled fish populations. However, trawls are selective in what fish they retain, resulting in biased estimates of density, species, and size compositions. Selectivity of the midwater trawl used in acoustic-based surveys of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) was evaluated using multiple methods. The effects of trawl selectivity on the acoustic-based survey abundance estimates and the stock assessment were evaluated for the Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock population. Selectivity was quantified using recapture, or <b>pocket,</b> <b>nets</b> attached to the outside of the trawl. <b>Pocket</b> <b>net</b> catches were modeled using a hierarchical Bayesian model to provide uncertainty in selectivity parameter estimates. Significant under-sampling of juvenile pollock by the midwater trawl was found, with lengths at 50 % retention ranging from 14 - 26 cm over three experiments. Escapement was found to be light dependent, with more fish escaping in dark conditions. Highest escapement rates were observed in the aft of the trawl near to the codend though the bottom panel of the trawl. The behavioral mechanisms involved in the process of herding and escapement were evaluated using stereo-cameras, a DIDSON high frequency imaging sonar, and <b>pocket</b> <b>nets.</b> Fish maintained greater distances from the trawl panel during daylight, suggesting trawl modifications such as increased visibility of netting materials may evoke stronger herding responses and increased retention of fish. Selectivity and catchability of pollock by the midwater trawl was also investigated using acoustic density as an independent estimate of fish abundance to compare with trawl catches. A modeling framework was developed to evaluate potential explanatory factors for selectivity and catchability. Selectivity estimates were dependent on which vessel was used for the survey, and the condition factor of the fish caught. Ambient water temperature, time of day, and the proportion of fish in spawning condition influenced model-derived estimates of catchability. Finally, the effect of trawl selectivity on the acoustic-based survey abundance estimate and Gulf of Alaska pollock assessment was evaluated. Survey biomass estimates were overestimated by up to 40 % as abundance of juvenile fish increased and adult abundance decreased. The increase in uncertainty in survey abundance estimates due to trawl selectivity had a measurable impact on the stock assessment, changing model estimates of fishing mortality, spawning biomass and recruitment by more than 10 %. The studies provide new methods for assessing selectivity, catchability and for observing fish behavior in midwater trawls, which can be used to evaluate midwater trawls used in other surveys...|$|R
40|$|Two {{groups of}} 96 winged pearl oysters, Pteria sterna, with mean (± S. D.) dorso-ventral shell height (DVM) of 75. 0 ± 6. 0 mm, {{were used to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of two culture methods (<b>pocket</b> <b>nets</b> and plastic cages) on the quality of half-pearls (mabé) produced from them over a period of 9 months. Prior to implantation, oysters were anaesthetized using benzocaine and two plastic nuclei were implanted on the left valve and one on the right valve of each pearl oyster. Oysters were returned to culture conditions and were sampled to determine nacre secretion and pearl quality 5, 7, 9 and 11 months after nucleus implantation. There was no significant difference (P > 0. 05) between growth rates of oysters cultured in plastic cages and those held in <b>pocket</b> <b>nets.</b> However, a greater yield of commercial quality pearls was produced by oysters grown in plastic cages. Nacre thickness {{at the top of the}} resulting half-pearl blisters showed no significant difference between oysters held in the different culture apparatus (P > 0. 05) or between different months (P > 0. 05). Highest mabé quality was recorded 9 months after nucleus implantation when water temperatures were low. Growth of pearl oysters during this study resulted in enlargement of adductor muscle, which in some cases grew to cover the mabé. This result indicates that P. sterna with a dorso-ventral shell height greater than 75 mm should be used for the production of mabé. Furthermore, the results suggest that a culture period of 9 months is required to optimize the quality of mabé produced from P. sterna cultured in plastic cages. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Mantle {{tissue in}} pearl oysters (Pteriidae) is {{responsible}} for secreting the mother-of-pearl or nacre lining the shell. When grafted into another oyster, excised mantle tissue, commonly called ‘saibo’, {{is responsible for}} cultured pearl production. This study was undertaken to assess the process of mantle regeneration in the Akoya pearl oyster Pinctada fucata and the blacklip pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera following mantle excision. Prior to saibo excision, oysters were anaesthetized with 2 mL L^− 1 propylene phenoxetol. Saibo tissue was excised from 50 P. fucata and 10 P. margaritifera. After excision, all oysters were returned to culture conditions. All oysters were maintained in panel (<b>pocket)</b> <b>nets</b> on a long-line at Magnetic Island, north Queensland, Australia. Oysters were anaesthetized and sacrificed 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60 and 90 days after saibo excision to assess mantle regeneration using histological and histochemical techniques. Survival over the 90 -day study was 100 % and 70 % for P. fucata and P. margaritifera, respectively. After excision, the mantle tissue healed within {{the first three days}} and began growing as connective tissue. Muscular development was seen between days 60 and 90 after excision. Shell formation abilities were recovered by day 15 when secretory cells and conchiolin secretions were first observed. Both P. fucata and P. margaritifera regenerated mantle to its original extent within the 90 -day study. This is the first description of in vivo mantle regeneration in pearl oysters and the results have major implications for the lucrative cultured pearl industry. Our results indicate that mantle tissue donors need not be killed for pearl production. Those producing saibo that results in good quality pearls could be used as future parent-stock in breeding programs or for subsequent saibo donation and pearl production...|$|R

Since the greatest obstacle to this kind of activity is related to the man-hour cost far the information collection, researchers of the University of Ferrara and the Cento hospital have setup an electronic system of automatic acquisition of the field data using computer technologies of different types (RFID-Radio Frequency IDentification sensor, PC <b>pocket,</b> <b>net</b> computer and programs). The management of continuous relief of the pollution level established in the operating rooms during every intervention, the automatic acquisitions of the main environmental parameters (temperature, relative humidity, instant air flow rate of climatization plant, state of the doors, level of pressurization of the room, level of stoppage of the absolute filters etc.) and of the clinical overview of the patient allow detailed knowledge of the conditions in which every surgical intervention is developed. Particular attention is paid to the state of hypothermia of the patient that is monitored in continuously before, during and after the operation, since according to some authors this determines an increase in the probability of contamination of the wound. The surgical wound is controlled daily in the hospital up to the moment of patient release and every three months for one year from the intervention, so as to record possible complication. This adopted strategy allows to verification in the respect of the behavioral protocols of the medical and nursing personnel...|$|R
