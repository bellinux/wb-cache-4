40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 67 - 72). Texture is {{an important}} visual cue in both human and computer <b>vision.</b> <b>Segmenting</b> images into regions of constant texture is used in many applications. This work surveys {{a wide range of}} texture descriptors and segmentation methods to determine {{the state of the art}} in texture segmentation. Two types of texture descriptors are investigated: filter bank based methods and local descriptors. Filter banks deconstruct an image into several bands, each of which emphasises areas of the image with different properties. Textons are an adaptive histogram method which describes the distribution of typical feature vectors. Local descriptors calculate features from smaller neighbourhoods than filter banks. Some local descriptors calculate a scale for their local neighbourhood to achieve scale invariance. Both local and global segmentation methods are investigated. Local segmentation methods consider each pixel in isolation. Global segmentation methods penalise jagged borders or fragmented regions in the segmentation. Pixel labelling and border detection methods are investigated. Methods for measuring the accuracy of segmentation are discussed. Two data sets are used to test the texture segmentation algorithms. The Brodatz Album mosaics are composed of grayscale texture images from the Brodatz Album. The Berkeley Natural Images data set has 300 colour images of natural scenes. The tests show that, of the descriptors tested, filter bank based textons are the best texture descriptors for grayscale images. Local image patch textons are best for colour images. Graph cut segmentation is best for pixel labelling problems and edge detection with regular borders. Non-maxima suppression is best for edge detection with irregular borders. Factors affecting the performance of the algorithms are investigated...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the care for adults with gender dysphoria from the last decades of 1900 until recently, with a <b>short</b> <b>vision</b> for the future. The view on the care of individuals with gender issues has changed tremendously. This evolution is described here: from a psychotic illness, through a rather strict definition of "transsexualism", towards a broader description of gender-variant individuals. Also, the treatment has evolved simultaneously: from antipsychotic drugs, through medical treatment (hormones and surgery) of the "true transsexual" and the psychotherapeutic approach with the adult with "secondary transsexualism", towards a variety of possible treatments and transitions (social and/or physical), determined by the preference of the individual in consultation with the mental healthcare provider. In most recent years, the focus has been on de-pathologization of gender-variance; on the human rights of gender-variant people; on the effect of stigmatization, discrimination, and victimization; and on ways to prevent these negative social experiences. Although the care of individuals with gender dysphoria has improved significantly over the past 50 years, more work needs to be done. Twenty-first-century gender care described in this volume should also be more readily available in the Southern Hemisphere and the Asian-Pacific Region. In the meantime, research evaluating treatment with the continuous aim of improving the care for individuals with gender dysphoria remains an important focus,status: publishe...|$|R
