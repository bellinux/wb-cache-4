25|$|About 1562 Bulmer {{founded the}} lead and {{calamine}} mines in the Mendip Hills near Chewton, Somerset. The Mendip ores (calamine and galena) were used by Christopher Schutz from 1565–86 at the smelter newly constructed by the Company of Mineral and Battery Works at Tintern. According to Baldwin, Bulmer was also 'on the fringes' of the <b>smelting</b> <b>operations</b> at Dartford in which Schutz refined tons of worthless ore brought from Baffin Island in 1576-8 by Martin Frobisher.|$|E

Glencore denied it used child labour, {{and said it}} has strict policy of not using child labour. The company claimed it has a strict policy whereby all copper was mined correctly, placed in bags with {{numbered}} seals and then sent to the smelter. Glencore mentioned being aware of child miners {{who were part of}} a group of artisanal miners who had without authorisation raided the concession awarded to the company since 2010; Glencore has been pleading with the government to remove the artisanal miners from the concession.|$|E

2500|$|Franklin, {{known as}} the [...] "Fluorescent Mineral Capital of the World," [...] is located over a rich ore body {{containing}} more than 150 minerals, many of them fluorescent and 25 of which are found nowhere else on earth. Settled in the 17th century, the village known as Franklin Furnace after Benjamin Franklin, developed near iron mines and iron <b>smelting</b> <b>operations</b> located along the Wallkill River. In the early 19th century, zinc deposits in the area began to be developed commercially. For most of the century many small companies mined zinc and iron in the Franklin area. In 1897 all zinc mining efforts merged into the New Jersey Zinc Company, which was a major controlling factor {{in the development of}} Franklin. Immigrants from Russia, Britain, Hungary and Poland joined the work force at the mine. The population, 500 in 1897, had swelled to 3,000 by 1913. On March 18, 1913, the Borough of Franklin was incorporated from portions of Hardyston Township, {{based on the results of}} a referendum held on April 23, 1913.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} Pittsburgh Reduction Company {{changed its name}} to the Aluminum Company of America in 1907, the company began {{investigating}} the possibility of establishing a large <b>smelting</b> <b>operation</b> in East Tennessee. The hydroelectric potential of the Little Tennessee River, which exits the mountains about 20 mi southwest of Alcoa, was one of the primary incentives, as the company's aluminum <b>smelting</b> <b>operation</b> would require massive amounts of electricity. In 1910, the company established a base camp at what is now known as Calderwood, but was initially known as [...] "Alcoa", and would be known as such until the name was reapplied to the company's operations in North Maryville a few years later.|$|R

50|$|The Mount Elliott Mining Complex is an {{aggregation}} of {{the remnants}} of copper mining and <b>smelting</b> <b>operations</b> from the early 20th century and the associated former mining township of Selwyn. The earliest copper mining at Mount Elliott was in 1906 with <b>smelting</b> <b>operations</b> commencing shortly after. Significant upgrades to the mining and <b>smelting</b> <b>operations</b> occurred under the management of W.H. Corbould during 1909-1910. Following these upgrades and increases in production, the Selwyn Township grew quickly and had 1500 residents by 1918. The Mount Elliott Company took over other companies on the Cloncurry field in the 1920s, including the Mount Cuthbert and Kuridala/Hampden smelters. Mount Elliott operations were taken over by Mount Isa Mines in 1943 to ensure the supply of copper during World War Two. The Mount Elliott Company was eventually liquidated in 1953.|$|E

50|$|Corbould was a {{metallurgist}} and geologist {{as well as}} mine/smelter manager. He foresaw a need {{to obtain}} control and thereby ensure a reliable supply of ore from a cross-section of mines in the region. He also saw a need to implement an effective strategy to manage the economies of smelting low-grade ore. <b>Smelting</b> <b>operations</b> in the region were made difficult by the technical and economic problems posed by the deterioration in the grade of ore. Corbould resolved the issue by a process of blending ores with different chemical properties, increasing the throughput capacity of the smelter and by championing the unification of <b>smelting</b> <b>operations</b> in the region. In 1912, Corbould acquired Hampden Consols Mine at Kuridala for Mount Elliott Limited, followed with the purchases of other small mines in the district.|$|E
