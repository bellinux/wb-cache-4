40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the technical feasibility and ecological advantage of using <b>sinter</b> <b>feed</b> tailings from iron ore mining as an aggregate {{in the production}} of concrete, initially to manufacture precast concrete pavers, but with the possibility of extending its use to other applications. To achieve this goal, the physical, chemical and environmental characteristics of the tailings were analyzed. The other aggregates used here were also characterized, and the tailings were quality tested when used as fine aggregate {{in the production of}} mortars, based on a comparison of their compressive strength. The interlocking concrete pavers were manufactured by a precast concrete plant, after which they were sampled and sub-jected to compressive strength, water absorption and abrasive wear tests, according to Brazilian technical standards NBR 9780 [33], NBR 12118 [34] and NBR 12042 [35]. The results of these tests indicated that, compared to the reference values, the compressive strength at 28 days varied from- 2. 5 % to- 11 %; water absorption ranged from- 14 % to + 3. 8 %; and abrasive wear varied from- 80 % to- 62 %. The main purpose of using <b>sinter</b> <b>feed</b> tailings as aggregate in concrete production is to ensure the sustainable development of the construction industry. For the iron ore mining industry, the productive disposal of these tailings represents a major advantage in cost-effectiveness, due to the elimination of stockpiles and of the costs involved in their operationalization...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Al(OH) 3 {{ultrafine}} powder was {{extracted from}} fly ash with {{the method of}} dispersing agent-carbonizating. Fly ash is activated by the method of sintering with limestone, so the inert mullite can be convert into C 12 A 7 which can be dissolved in Na 2 CO 3 liquor. The conversion of β-C 2 S to γ-C 2 S is accompanied {{by an increase in}} volume and results in the self-pulverization of the <b>sintering</b> <b>feed,</b> and the diameter of the self-pulverized powder is below 1 μm. Na 2 CO 3 liquor was used to leach Al 2 O 3 in the form of NaAlO 2 from the self-pulverized powder. High performance dispersing agent is added in the carbonation process to control the crystal and aggregation of Al(OH) 3, and the ultrafine powder of Al(OH) 3 is prepared, which diameter is less than 0. 4 μm...|$|R

In addition to base mix, coke fines, flux fines, sinter fines, iron dust (collected from plant de-dusting system & ESP) and plant waste are mixed in proportion (by weight) in a rotary drum, often called mixing and nodulizing drum. Calcined lime is used as binder of the mixed material along with water (all in particular proportion by weight) to form feed-sinter of about 5 to 7 mm in size.

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{for measuring the}} voidage of a packed bed of wet deformable granules is described. Rather than attempt to measure voidage in situ, the voidage is calculated from accurate measurements of bed bulk density and separate measurement of granule apparent density by kerosene displacement. The technique is reproducible to ± 0. 005 void fraction. This technique is used to study in detail the factors which determine the voidage of packed beds of granulated ferrous <b>sinter</b> <b>feed.</b> 10 <b>sinter</b> <b>feed</b> blends are used varying the type of ore (7 ores), feed size distribution and moisture content (3. 5 % to 8 %). As moisture content increases, bed voidage passes through a maximum. At low moisture contents, added water reduces {{the spread of the}} granule size distribution and increases the voidage. At higher moisture contents, granule deformation becomes important. Granules become more deformable as moisture content increases and the bed voidage drops. The key parameter which affects granule deformation is the granule layer mass to nuclei mass ratio (R). All blends show the same relationship between R and voidage. Voidage decreases with increasing R before approaching an asymptotic value for large values of R. The effect of feed particle size distribution, moisture holding capacity and moisture content on voidage can be explained by their effect on the layer mass to nuclei mass ratio during granulation. Hence, {{with the aid of a}} suitable granulation model, the effect of feed blend properties and granulation conditions on bed voidage can be predicted...|$|E
40|$|O minério de ferro produzido no complexo de Carajás traz consigo características mineralógicas que conferem um elevadíssimo teor de Fe em todas as suas frações granulométricas. Dessa forma, ao final da cadeia produtiva, tanto os produtos comerciais mais grosseiros quanto os finos contem cerca de 62 % de Fe contido na sua composição. Importante destacar que em Carajás as fases no processamento desse minério são apenas para cominuição e classificação por tamanho. Não existem etapas de concentração e os produtos são diferenciados por suas respectivas curvas granulométricas: o “granulado” - mais grosseiro (> 13 mm), o “Sinter-Feed” (0, 5 mm) e o “pellet feed” (13 mm), the "Sinter-Feed" (0. 5 mm) and the "pellet feed" (< 0. 15 mm). Ensure proper {{particle}} size distribution of the raw material is a market premise. The last step of classification is made using hydrocyclones and generates an overflow ultrafine high specific surface area greater than 6. 500 Blaine and with 45 % to 95 % < 7 μm. And has a high Fe content - about 62 %. The overall objectives of this research sought {{the solution to this}} opportunity to recover and sell these “tailings”. The study suggested by testing with technologies capable of flowing into the ultrathin generated to 9. 00 % of moisture, which is the value that allows movement and handling these wastes, and allows their incorporation into the blending of thicker products. Thus, experiments were carried out in several external laboratories and pilot-scale plant in the Carajás with samples of both ultrafine “tailings” of the two phases of hydrocycloning: the natural and the ground. It was evident that the equipment must necessarily match and two efficiently factors essences to dewatering: very high pressure and high temperature operation of these “tailings”.

40|$|Mintek {{together}} with Middelburg Steel & Alloys, developed the DC arc furnace {{process for the}} production of ferroalloys with the expressed objective of smelting ore fines (< 1 mm) without the need for agglomeration. In the case of ferrochrome production, the DC arc furnace, being a semi-open bath operation, loses radiant energy directly from the bath to the furnace roof and sidewalls above the melt. This energy loss is reflected in a higher electrical energy usage per ton of alloy than for a submerged-arc operation smelting lumpy ores or sintered pellets. The difference increases still further when pre-heated <b>sintered</b> pellet <b>feed</b> is used in a submerged-arc operation. This shortcoming of the DC arc furnace can however be overcome by preheating the feed to the furnace in a fluidized bed or flash reactor fuelled by cold furnace off-gas. In addition to fluidization and preheating testwork, various preheating flowsheets with associated mass and energy balances have been developed and compared from a techno-economic viewpoint. The three major advantages identified were: a) fluidized beds can preheat ores and fluxes up to 950 °C without sticking and defluidizing, b) the open bath DC arc furnace does not require expensive coke or char to maintain the burden porosity and, c) the capital cost associated with the milling, pelletising and sintering plant falls away since ore fines are used directly...|$|R
40|$|Production of Ferro-alloys through {{submerged}} {{electric arc}} furnace involves use of electric power {{as one of the}} major inputs. Hence the production by this power intensive process can be made economically more com-petitive if the specific power requirement for smelting each ton of the product is brought down. This becomes all the more necessary where the power cost is comparatively high, like in India. Since the day FACOR started production of Ferro Chrome in 1968, briquetted chromite fines along with lumpy ores were used as feed. Subsequently the increase in the proportion of briquettes and reduction in lumpy ore helped in increasing the use of chromite fines and also brought down the specific power require-ment. Meantime FACOR had been closely watching the technical development of use of sintered pellets in Outo-kumpu and SRC Processes which need still lower specific power. But the high capital requirement for a pel-letisation plant kept FACOR from introducing pellets feed to their Ferro chrome furnaces. So this was postponed to be adopted in future. In February 2004 in the “ 1 st Ferro-Alloys India”, a paper [1] was presented by Dr. Amit Chatterjee. In the questions period after the presentation of the paper there came up a discussion in which it was revealed that with the Indian high grade chrome ores {{it was not possible to}} make sufficiently strong pellets, unless a larger percentage of bentonite is used as binder. This is because the Indian high grade Chrome ores have different mineralogy of gangue content compared to low grade ores in Finland and South Africa. Higher usage of ben-tonite gives rise to higher slag volume and this would result in increased specific power. Since FACOR had plans to go in future for <b>sintered</b> pellets <b>feed,</b> this gave rise to a doubt on success of pelletisation for Indian high-grade chrome ores. This prompted FACOR to take up experimental production of sintered chromite pel-lets and use of the same in one of their existing furnaces for production of high carbon Ferro chrome. The results are encouraging and are summarized in the paper. 1...|$|R
40|$|MSc (Chemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC) in South Africa holds {{approximately}} {{three quarters of}} the world’s viable chromite ore deposits. Most chromite is used for the production of ferrochromium (FeCr), which is a relatively crude alloy. Several chromite seams exist in the BIC. The most economically viable seams are the lower group 6 (LG 6), the middle group 1 and 2 (MG 1 and 2) and the upper group 2 (UG 2) seams. The LG and MG seams are exploited specifically for their chromium content, whereas the UG 2 seam is mainly exploited for platinum group minerals (PGM). However, the upgraded UG 2 chromite in the PGM tailing is increasingly being used as a feedstock for FeCr production. Many different process variations exist for FeCr production. However, the process option applied in most green and brown field FeCr expansion projects during the last two decades in South Africa has been the oxidative sintered process (also referred to as the Outotec or Outokumpu process). Notwithstanding the common application of the oxidative <b>sintered</b> pelletised <b>feed</b> technology in the South African FeCr industry, and the increased utilisation of beneficiated UG 2 ore, a direct comparison of the physical properties of oxidative sintered pellets produced from UG 2 with the physical properties of that produced with conventional metallurgical grade chromite ore is currently lacking in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Therefore, the physical properties of oxidative sintered pellets produced from a typical beneficiated South African UG 2 ore were compared with the physical properties of that produced with conventional South African metallurgical grade chromite ore in this study. The results indicated that the case study metallurgical grade chromite ore required 13 kWh/t more energy to mill than the case study UG 2 ore prior to pelletisation, which can lead to substantial cost savings. The compressive strength of the oxidative sintered pellets of both case study ores statistically showed that oxidative sintered pellets made from UG 2 ore Abstract were the same or better than those prepared from metallurgical grade chromite ore. A comparison of the abrasion strengths of the oxidative sintered pellets of both case study ores indicated that the pellets prepared from UG 2 ore were superior compared to the metallurgical grade pellets. The reasons for the superior UG 2 pellet strength were investigated with backscatter-, secondary electron- and elemental X-ray mapping scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which indicated that differences in crystalline structures at least partially contributed to the differences observed. Results presented here can be utilised by FeCr producers to better quantify the advantages and disadvantages {{associated with the use of}} UG 2 ore for FeCr production. Master...|$|R
