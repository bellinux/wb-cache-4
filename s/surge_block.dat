40|$|The {{ability of}} luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) neurons {{to express the}} {{oncogene}} c-fos was examined during the estrous cycle in rats. The immunocytochemical localization of the c-fos-encoded antigen, Fos, was coupled with the immunocytochemical localization of LHRH. LHRH neurons showed no Fos immunoreactivity during diestrus- 1, diestrus- 2, estrus, or the morning of proestrus. However, Fos was expressed in LHRH neurons from 1600 to 2200 hours during proestrus. The timing of onset of Fos expression in LHRH neurons during proestrus suggests a strong correlation with increased LH secretion. Pentobarbital, which blocks the preovulatory LH <b>surge,</b> <b>blocked</b> Fos expression in LHRH neurons, but the LHRH neurons expressed Fos on the following afternoon {{at the time of}} the expected delayed LH surge. Not all LHRH neurons expressed Fos during the LHRH surge. Approximately half of the LHRH neurons were activated in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus; more anteriorly positioned LHRH neurons did not express Fos, resulting in an overall stimulation of 40 % of the LHRH neurons. These data provide direct evidence that stimulation of LHRH neurons during proestrus takes place at the LHRH cell bodies, and identify the specific population of LHRH neurons which are activated...|$|R

40|$|ONE OF THE {{important}} questions confronting neuroendocrinology {{is the relationship}} between steroids produced by peripheral steroidogenic organs (e. g. adrenals and gonads) and steroids produced by the central nervous system, neurosteroids (1). We have demonstrated that systemic estrogen treatment of ovariectomized and adrenalectomized (OVX-ADX) rats increases hypothalamic progesterone (PROG) levels (2). The estrogen-induced increase of neuro-PROG precedes the LH surge, and the LH <b>surge</b> is <b>blocked</b> by an inhibitor of 3 �-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/� 5 -� 4 isomerase (3 �-HSD), the enzyme that converts pregnenolone to PROG (2). These data suggest that de novo synthesis of PROG from cholesterol in the hypothalamus is a critical part of the estrogen positive-feedback mechanism that stimulates the LH surge. All cell types in the nervous system, particularly macroglia, have steroidogenic potential (3, 4). Astrocytes have hig...|$|R
40|$|THE BIOLOGICAL {{actions of}} PRL are {{extremely}} diverse. One of its principal functions is luteotropic, maintaining progesterone secretion from the corpora lutea that is indispensable for gestation in the rat (1). During {{the first half}} of pregnancy, PRL shows a unique daily secretory pattern. A nocturnal surge occurs in the early morning and is sustained until day 10, whereas a diurnal surge occurs in the late afternoon and is terminated on day 8 of pregnancy (2, 3). However, only the nocturnal surge is fully capable of maintaining pseudopregnancy. When the diurnal <b>surge</b> was <b>blocked,</b> the nocturnal <b>surge</b> was extended so that the amount of PRL released was nearly equivalent to the amount of both surges (4). After termination of PRL surges at midpregnancy, PRL remains at very low levels until just before parturition (3, 5, 6). The neuronal mechanisms that regulate PRL surges durin...|$|R
40|$|Master of Science in Engineering - EngineeringAn {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the failures of 88 kV line surge arrestors at an Eskom Distribution substation. The surge arrestor failed when one phase of the transmission line was open circuited and all three phases were not isolated by the protection relays. The transformer was lightly loaded and a <b>surge</b> arrestor <b>blocked</b> the neutral path to the ground. The investigation used a modified version of an equivalent circuit proposed by Marti [1]. Transformer magnetising losses, the non-linear resistance of the neutral surge arrestor and the transformer magnetising reactance of the closed-circuit phases were all included. The investigation revealed that the failure of the arrestor was due to the combined volt drops across the open circuited phase of the transformer magnetising reactance and the neutral surge arrestor. A resonance condition lowered the magnetising reactance of the open circuited phase of the transformer and forced the transformer into saturation. This resonance is characteristic of the fundamental frequency ferroresonance condition [2]...|$|R
40|$|Induction of {{multiple}} follicular {{development is a}} common practice in IVF programmes. Nevertheless, such an approach is not without implications. Apart from the high multiple pregnancy rate, marked changes in the secretion of pituitary and ovarian hormones take place. Estradiol and inhibin are produced in high amounts during the follicular phase {{and as a result}} the negative feedback mechanism is potentiated leading to the marked suppression of gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary. The secretion of LH is also reduced in down-regulated cycles as well as in women receiving a GnRH antagonist, while LH levels are maintained stable when a GnRH agonist is used in a short protocol. The suppression of LH secretion is also evident at midcycle with the endogenous LH <b>surge</b> being <b>blocked</b> or markedly attenuated due to the production of gonadotropin surge attenuating factor (GnSAF). Under these conditions, the LH surge is usually premature in relation {{to the size of the}} leading follicle resulting in premature luteinization, but can be prevented by the use of GnRH analogs. In IVF cycles, the luteal phase is disrupted due to the suppression of LH levels. Mild protocols might provide a better approach to the ovarian stimulation than conventional protocols resulting in a reasonable success rate of IVF treatment. © 2011 Middle East Fertility Society...|$|R
40|$|Colchicine is {{a potent}} {{chemical}} that disrupts the assembly of microtubulin and affects the integrity of cytoskeleton. It is commonly used to block the axonal transport in neurons.

40|$|Glacier surges occur {{regularly}} in the Karakoram, but the driving mechanisms, their frequency {{and its relation to}} a changing climate remain unclear. In this study, we use digital elevation models and Landsat imagery in combination with high-resolution imagery from the Planet satellite constellation to quantify surface elevation changes and flow velocities during a glacier surge of the Khurdopin Glacier in 2017. Results reveal that an accumulation of ice volume above a clearly defined steep section of the glacier tongue since the last surge in 1999 eventually led to a rapid surge in May 2017 peaking with velocities above 5000  m a − 1, which were among the fastest rates globally for a mountain glacier. Our data reveal that velocities on the lower tongue increase steadily during a 4 -year build-up phase prior to the actual surge only to then rapidly peak and decrease again within a few months, which confirms earlier observations with a higher frequency of available velocity data. The surge return period between the reported surges remains relatively constant at ca. 20 years. We show the potential of a combination of repeat Planet and ASTER imagery to (a) capture peak surge velocities that are easily missed by less frequent Landsat imagery, (b) observe surface changes that indicate potential drivers of a surge and (c) monitor hazards associated with a surge. At Khurdopin specifically, we observe that the <b>surging</b> glacier <b>blocks</b> the river in the valley and causes a lake to form, which may grow in subsequent years and could pose threats to downstream settlements and infrastructure {{in the case of a}} sudden breach...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} serum {{concentration of}} follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; follitropin) between proestrus and estrus in the rat has been hypothesized to recruit the follicles destined to ovulate {{in the next}} cycle. Injection of porcine follicular fluid (PFF) late in proestrus suppresses the secondary FSH surge; injection early in proestrus suppresses the primary FSH surge without affecting the secondary FSH surge. Thus, {{it is possible to}} use PFF to test the FSH/follicular recruitment hypothesis and to distinguish between the contributions of the primary and secondary FSH surges to this recruitment. The normal recruitment of follicles occurs in the diameter range 350 - 499 microns between the day of proestrus and the day of estrus. When the secondary FSH surge was suppressed by injection of PFF late in proestrus, PFF, but not porcine serum (PS), blocked follicular recruitmenet into size groups of 350 - 499 microns on the morning of estrus. The number of ova ovulated did not differ between PFF- and PS-treated animals. When we suppressed only the primary FSH surge, by injecting PFF early in proestrus, there were no differences between PFF- and PS-treated animals in the number of ova ovulated, follicle size distribution, or hormones. In the last experiment, the secondary FSH <b>surge</b> was <b>blocked</b> with PFF but was replaced with exogenous ovine FSH which caused a dose-related increase in follicular recruitment, substantiating the interpretation that the follicular fluid suppressed recruitment by suppressing FSH secretion. Thus, in mammals with short reproductive cycles, the gonadotropin surges provide a "fail-safe" mechanism whereby luteinizing hormone triggers ovulation, thus ending one cycle, and the secondary increase in FSH levels recruits follicles for the next cycle...|$|R

40|$|Summary. An antibody, {{raised in}} ewes against {{synthetic}} GnRH, was injected intra-venously (a) before the expected synchronous surges of LH and FSH or (b) {{before the second}} FSH surge, i. e. at 0 or 20 h after the onset of behavioural oestrus. Control ewes were given normal sheep plasma at the same times. One of the 4 ewes given antibody at 0 h showed blockade of the LH surge, whereas in the other 3 ewes there was an average delay of 16 h in {{the appearance of the}} LH peak and in 1 of the 3 there was a surge of FSH coincident with the delayed LH surge; no other surges of FSH were detected in any of the ewes between 0 and 48 h after the onset of oestrus. Endoscopic examination at 48 =n- 2 h showed follicles of 6 =n-mm diameter with a papilla in all the 4 ewes but 2 ewes showed an abnormal luteal phase (32 and 34 days), indicated by plasma progesterone values. The magnitude and the time of appearance of the second FSH surge was unaffected in all the 4 ewes treated with antibody 20 h after the onset of oestrus: 2 of the ewes had 6 =n-mm follicles at the time of endoscopy, while the other 2 ewes and the controls had fresh corpora lutea haemorrhagica. Apart from 1 ewe with a long luteal phase all the other 5 treated and control ewes had a fertile oestrus 19 =. =+-=. days after the experiment. Administration of antibody 2 h after a 4 -h infusion of oestradiol (3 =m/h) to 3 anoestrous ewes completely <b>blocked</b> the LH <b>surge</b> in one and produced a 6 and 3 h delay of an LH surge of decreased magnitude in the other 2 ewes.

40|$|A n ~ t o r n y, ~ Physiology, and Obstetrics and Gynecology 6 A single {{injection}} of estradiol valerate (E V) produces anovulatory acyclicity and polycystic ovaries (PCO) in the rat. Basal serum luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations are attenuated whereas serum follicle stimulating-hormone (FSH) concentrations {{are in the}} high normal range in these animals. Subsequent unilateral ovariectomy restores ovulato ry cycles and normal bistology in the remaining ovary without correcting the aberrant basal serum gonadotropin concentrations. This suggests that although the <b>blocked</b> <b>surge</b> mechanism is correctable, a second relatively intractable, ovary-independent impairment compromises basal gonadotropin production. To identify and characterize this second component, we have examined hypothalamic-pituitary function in PCO rats after bilateral ovariectomy.

40|$|Immune/inflammatory challenges, such as {{bacterial}} endotoxin, disrupt gonadotropin secretion and ovarian cyclicity. We previously {{determined that}} endotoxin can block the estradiol-induced LH {{surge in the}} ewe. Here, we investigated mechanisms underlying this suppression. First, we tested the hypothesis that endotoxin blocks the estradiol-induced LH surge centrally, by preventing the GnRH surge. Artificial follicular phases were created in ovariectomized ewes, and either endotoxin or vehicle was administered together with a surge-inducing estradiol stimulus. In each ewe in which endotoxin <b>blocked</b> the LH <b>surge,</b> the GnRH <b>surge</b> was also <b>blocked.</b> Given this evidence that endotoxin blocks the estradiol-induced LH surge at the hypothalamic level, we began to assess underlying central mechanisms. Specifically, {{in view of the}} prior demonstration that prostaglandins mediate endotoxin-induced suppression of pulsatile GnRH secretion in ewes, we tested the hypothesis that prostaglandins also mediate endotoxin-induced blockade of the surge. The prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor flurbiprofen was delivered together with endotoxin and the estradiol stimulus. Although flurbiprofen abolished endotoxin-induced fever, which is a centrally generated, prostaglandin-mediated response, it failed to reverse blockade of the LH surge. Collectively, these results indicate endotoxin <b>blocks</b> the LH <b>surge</b> centrally, suppressing GnRH secretion via a mechanism not requiring prostaglandins. This contrasts with the suppressive effect of endotoxin on GnRH pulses, which requires prostaglandins as intermediates...|$|R
40|$|Certain {{results of}} {{investigating}} dangerous phenomena and potential natural disasters in the Azov–Black Sea basin are represented. The decrease of storm {{activity in the}} Black Sea observed {{in the end of}} the XX century is due to diminution of total amount and intensity of the passing cyclones. According to long-term tendencies of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the East Atlantic Oscillation atmosphere indices, future increase of the storm amount in the Black Sea would be expected. The effective sources of storm surges in the Sea of Azov are the atmospheric cyclones spreading with the 20 – 40 km/h velocity.

40|$|A new {{protocol}} for superovulating cattle {{which allows for}} control of the timing of ovulation after superstimulation with FSH was developed. The preovulatory LH <b>surge</b> was <b>blocked</b> with the GnRH agonist deslorelin, and ovulation was induced by injection of LH. In Experiment 1, heifers (3 yr-old) were assigned to a control group (Group 1 A, n = 4) or a group with deslorelin implants (Group 1 B, n = 5). On Day - 7, heifers in Group 1 A received a progestagen CIDR-B® device, while heifers in Group 1 B received a CIDR-B® device + deslorelin implants. Both groups were superstimulated with twice daily injections of FSH (Folltropin® -V) : Day 0, 40 mg (80 mg total dose on Day 0); Day 1, 30 mg; Day 2, 20 mg; Day 3, 10 mg. On Day 2, heifers were given PGF (a. m.) and CIDR-B® devices were removed (p. m.). Three heifers in Group 1 A had a LH surge and ovulated, whereas neither of these events occurred in Group 1 B (with deslorelin implants) heifers. In Experiment 2, heifers (3 -yr-old) were assigned to 1 of 4 equal groups (n = 6). On Day - 7, heifers in Group 2 A received a norgestomet implant, while heifers in Groups 2 B, 2 C and 2 D received norgestomet + deslorelin implants. Heifers were superstimulated with FSH starting on Day 0 as in Experiment 1. On Day 2, heifers were given PGF (a. m.) and norgestomet implants were removed (p. m.). Heifers in Groups 2 B to 2 D were given 25 mg LH (Lutropin®) : Group 2 B, Day 4 (a. m.); Group 2 C, Day 4 (p. m.); Group 2 D, Day 5 (a. m.). Heifers in Group 2 A were inseminated at estrus and 12 and 24 h later, while heifers in Groups 2 B to 2 D were inseminated at the time of respective LH injection and 12 and 24 h later. Injection of LH induced ovulation in heifers in Groups 2 B to 2 D. Heifers in Group 2 C had similar total ova and embryos (15. 2 ± 1. 4) as heifers in Group 2 A (11. 0 ± 2. 8) but greater (P < 0. 05) numbers than heifers in Group 2 B (7. 0 ± 2. 3) and Group 2 D (6. 3 ± 2. 0).
