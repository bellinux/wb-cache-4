The diet of the uplands often included cabbage, <b>string</b> <b>beans,</b> white potatoes, while most affluent whites in the uplands avoided crops imported from Africa because they were associated with, and reflected the social inferiority of, black slaves.

40|$|Introduction: Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus is deficiency of insulin and caused by decreases of insulin receptor or bad quality of insulin. As a result, insulin hormone {{does not work}} effectively in blood glucose regulation. <b>String</b> <b>bean</b> juice contains thiamin and fiber may regulate blood glucose level. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the effect of <b>string</b> <b>bean</b> juice to decrease blood glucose level of patients with type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}}. Method: This study employed a quasy-experimental pre-post test control group design and purposive sampling.   The population were all type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Puskesmas Pacar Keling Surabaya. Sample were 12 patients who met inclusion criteria. The independent variable was <b>string</b> <b>bean</b> juice and dependent variable was blood glucose level. Data were analyzed by using Paired T-test with significance level of α≤ 0. 05 and Independent T-test with significant level of α≤ 0. 05. Result: The results showed that <b>string</b> <b>bean</b> juice has an effect on decreasing blood glucose between pre test and post test for blood glucose with independent T-test is p= 0. 003. Analysis: In conclusion, <b>string</b> <b>bean</b> juice has an effect on blood glucose level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Discussion: The possible explanation for this findings is <b>string</b> <b>bean</b> juice contains two ingredients: thiamine and fiber. Thiamine helps support insulin receptors and glucose transporter in cells hence GLUT- 4 could translocated to the cell membrane brought glucouse enter to the  intracellular compartment, that leads to blood glucouse level well regulated.  Dietary fiber reduces food transit time so slowing the glucose absorption. Therefore blood glucose level will be decreased...|$|R

2500|$|The {{design for}} the first outdoor OSF Elizabethan Theatre was sketched by Angus L.

Ashland, Oregon obtained WPA funds in 1935 to build it in the roofless shell of the abandoned Chautauqua theatre, the [...] circular walls which remained after the dome had been removed. Bowmer extended the walls to reduce the stage width to fifty-five feet, and painted the extensions to resemble half-timbered buildings. He designed a thrust stage—one projecting toward the audience—with a balcony. Two columns helped divide the main stage into forestage, middle stage, and inner stage areas. Illustrating the improvised nature of it all, actors doubled as stage hands, stage lighting was housed in coffee cans, and <b>string</b> <b>beans</b> were planted along the walls to improve sound quality! Fifty cent general admission seating was on benches just behind the one dollar reserved seating on folding chairs. This theatre was torn down during World War II.|$|E

The first experiment investigated combinations of four tine adjustments and two treatment intensities (one or two passes) of a spring-tine harrow. The second experiment compared four different hoeing systems: (1) a PTO-powered rotary tiller, (2) a precision hoe with sweep and goose-foot shares, (3) a precision hoe (as before) + torsion weeder, and (4) a precision hoe (as before) + torsion weeder operated with the tines crossed. Both experiments also included a weedy check and a post-emergence herbicide treatment as references. Various mechanical work parameters, weed density by species, weed biomass, and <b>string</b> <b>bean</b> yield were determined for all treatments. 	The machines used in these experiments clearly showed different working characteristics, and their behaviour changed according to soil conditions. In the harrowing experiment, differences among treatments in weed density and biomass {{as well as in}} yield were usually negligible, and probably due to low initial weed presence. In contrast, hoeing was always beneficial in terms of weed control and crop yield. Data from these experiments are not conclusive to allow ranking of the mechanical weeding treatments based on their overall efficacy...|$|R
