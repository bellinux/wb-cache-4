40|$|To {{study the}} food {{habits of the}} <b>Spanish</b> <b>lynx</b> were {{analysed}} 1537 droppings collected throughout two periods of one year in Donana, S. W. Spain. A food test which was carried out on a captive lynx; allowed us to relate the number of occurrences of each kind of prey in the samples with the actual numbers of individual preys and the biomass devoured. The main prey is the rabbit which amounts to 79 % of the prey captured and 85 % of the biomass consumed. The next in importance are the ducks (9 % and 7 % respectively) and the ungulates (3 % and 5 %). Seasonal variations in the diet are not very pronounced. The importance of rabbits is at its maximum between July and October, that of the ducks between March and June {{and that of the}} cervids between November and February. The prey is selected for the facility in which they may be caught rather than for their abundance. It is estimated that an individual lynx consumes about 74 gr of food per kilo of body weight daily. The impact of the predation on the prey populations is difficult to evaluate, but it seems to be very important on the fallow deer population, relatively important on these of rabbits and red deer and very slight on that of ducks. Predation on ungulates in the study area may be a kind of starvation-related mortality...|$|E
50|$|The Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW) is a multi-volume series {{produced}} by the <b>Spanish</b> publishing house <b>Lynx</b> Edicions in partnership with BirdLife International. It is the first handbook to cover every known living species of bird. The series is edited by Josep del Hoyo, Andrew Elliott, Jordi Sargatal and David A Christie.|$|R
50|$|Wilson {{published}} {{more than}} 200 scientific publications, including the book Mammals of New Mexico and three monographs on bats. In 1997, the book Bats in Question - The Smithsonian Answer Book was published. In 2005, he was co-editor (along with DeeAnn M. Reeder) of the reference work Mammal Species of the World. Since 2009, he is co-editor (with Russell Mittermeier) of the book series Handbook of the Mammals of the World, from the <b>Spanish</b> publishing house <b>Lynx</b> Edicions. In addition, he published the books Animal, Human, Smithsonian Handbook of Mammals and Mammal for the publisher Dorling Kindersley.

40|$|Although {{on a local}} scale Iberian lynx {{distribution}} {{is determined by the}} availability of prey rabbits, recent modelling analyses have uncovered broad-scale disagreements between these two species’ distribution trends. These analyses showed also that the lynx had become restricted to {{only a fraction of the}} rabbit’s genetic diversity, and that this could be jeopardising its survival in the face of environmental hazards and uncertainty. In the present paper, a follow-up was carried out through the building of lynx and rabbit distribution models based on the most recent Spanish mammal atlas. Environmental favourability values for lynx and rabbit were positively correlated within the lynx’s current distribution area, but they were negatively correlated within the total <b>Spanish</b> area where <b>lynx</b> used to occur in the 1980 ’s. Environmental favourability for rabbits was significantly higher where lynx maintains reproductive populations than where it recently disappeared, indicating that rabbit favourability plays an important role and can be a good predictor of lynx persistence. The lynx and rabbit models were extrapolated to predict favourable areas for both species in Spain as well as in Portugal, on the original scale of the distribution data (10 x 10 km) and on a 100 times finer spatial resolution (1 x 1 km). The lynx and rabbit models were also combined through fuzzy logic to forecast the potential for lynx occurrence incorporating information on favourable areas for its main prey. Several areas are proposed as favourable for lynx expansion or re-introduction...|$|R
