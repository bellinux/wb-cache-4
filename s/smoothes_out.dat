He saw them together in what Mrs. Lander called her well days; {{but there were other}} days when he saw Clementina alone, and then she brought him word from Mrs. Lander, and reported his talk to her after he went away. On one of these she sent him a cheerfuller message than usual, and charged the girl to explain that she was ever so much better, but had not got up because she felt that every minute in bed was doing her good. Clementina carried back his regrets and congratulation, and then told Mrs. Lander that he had asked her to go out with him to see a church, which he was sorry Mrs. Lander could not see too. He professed to be very particular about his churches, for he said he had noticed that they neither of them had any great gift for sights, and he had it on his conscience to get the best for them. He told Clementina that the church he had for them now could not be better if it had been built expressly for them, instead of having been used as a place of worship for eight or ten generations of Venetians before they came. She gave his invitation to Mrs. Lander, who could not always be trusted with his jokes, and she received it in the best part.|$|R
40|$|Pedestrians implicitly {{cooperate}} {{by forming}} lanes inside dense crowd {{in order to}} facilitate flow and prevent complete passage blocking. Our aim is to re-enforce this self-organization phenomenon in dense crowd for the purpose of virtual crowd animation and navigation simplification. The mechanism of a flow grid is introduced to measure flow over an area. The flow grid is a perception mechanism of the surrounding area and favors dynamic lane formation (streams). It provides feedback to the navigation algorithm of the avatars, to enable them to choose a route that both meets their goal (wanted direction) and a trajectory that assists in self-organization of the crowd. A very simplified yet fairly effective navigation method suitable for dense crowds is also presented. It demonstrates that self-organization of the avatars can help in simplifying local navigation. The method produces short distance, intermediate positions ahead in time and, as a post-processing step, <b>smoothes</b> them <b>out</b> before the avatar needs to use them...|$|R

Emma Hart does not make art that tries {{to make sense of}} the world. Rejecting the contemplative environment of the gallery space, she makes work that captures the confusion, stress and nausea of everyday experience. For Hart, there is a divide between the overwhelming chaos of reality and the way visual culture <b>smoothes</b> it <b>out.</b> Central to her work is a determined frustration with the limits and restrictions of the lens. Through sculpture, she corrupts digital images and spatially infects videos, ‘dirtying’ the images and squeezing more life out of them. Hart’s practice often draws on her own embarrassment. Reflecting on her experience of working in a call centre in her early twenties, Dirty Looks serves up a cacophony of noise, imagery and ceramic objects. Chipboard cupboards with lopsided drawers, agitated service industry supplies and a homemade water cooler litter the space. Discomfort manifests itself in crudely made ceramic tongues, pulling open doors, escaping from furniture. This unexpected meshing of materials results in work that is raw, detailed and fractured...|$|R

5000|$|Fluency shaping therapy {{focuses on}} {{changing}} all {{the speech of}} the person who stutters, and not just the portions of speech in which he or she stutters. This type of therapy involves teaching the stutterer to use a speaking style that requires careful and prominent self-monitoring; examples of such therapy include one in which the stutterer slows his speech down and <b>smoothes</b> <b>out</b> all his words, and one in which the physical mechanisms used in the speech production are retrained. Fluency shaping therapies do not address attitudes, feelings, and self-concept issues under the assumption that eliminating the stuttering will eliminate these issues. Proponents of this type of therapy believe that the outcome of any therapy depends directly on its focus: [...] "if clinician and client focus on changing stuttering, they'll get stuttering; if they focus on changing fluency, they'll get fluency". This type of approach can reduce stuttering, although in children its effectiveness decreases if stuttering persists after eight years of age; Woody Starkweather, as at 1998 a Professor of Communication Sciences, asserted that in his experience this type of therapy improves speech only when used with other techniques.|$|E

40|$|At the {{cellular}} level, plant growth {{results from the}} competition between the so-called turgor pressure and mechanical resistance from the cell walls. The turgor pressure itself results from a difference of osmotic pressure between the interior and {{the exterior of the}} cell: the plasmic membrane is semi-permeable, so that a higher solute (sugars, ions) concentration inside the cell leads to a water flux towards the cell and to a pressure rise; if the pressure exceeds a given threshold, the cell walls extend and the cell grows. Recently, different models of plant growth have attempted to incorporate mechanics of cell walls in tissue development [Boudon et al. 2015], but all of them make the assumption that turgor pressure is constant with time. In this work, we go one step further and include a model of the regulation of turgor pressure in a multicellular framework. The cell wall material is modeled as a continuous visco-elasto-plastic material characterized by an elastic modulus, a yield deformation, and a rate of synthesis of matter as in [Boudon et al. 2015]. Flows between cells occur through their membranes according to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as a result from a difference in turgor and osmotic pressures. The value of pressure is not prescribed but emerges from the coupling of all these phenomena. Numerical simulations exhibit a highly non linear behaviour with respect to the governing parameters. We have identified two clearly distinct growth regimes: one regime that allows large growth heterogeneities by amplifying the effect of differences between cells, and conversely another regime that <b>smoothes</b> differences <b>out</b> and yields a homogeneous growth. On the biological level, the first regime is well adapted to morphogenesis, whereas the second one is well adapted to homothetic growth after the differentiated tissues have been created...|$|R
