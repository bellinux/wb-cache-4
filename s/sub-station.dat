5|$|After its closure in 1917, the bay {{platform}} {{was converted}} into rooms for use, at various times, as offices, air-raid shelters, store rooms, an electrical <b>sub-station</b> and a war-time hostel. Since 1994, the branch's remaining platform at Holborn {{has been used}} to test mock-up designs for new platform signage and advertising systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{demolished}} in 1986 {{to make way}} for the MetroCentre, which became Europe's largest shopping and leisure centre. The land on which the MetroCentre was built was bought for only £100,000, because the site was water-logged and had been used for dumping ash produced by the power station. American warehouse club chain Costco have since built a store on the actual site of the power station. The power station's large indoor <b>sub-station</b> still stands alongside it, as the only trace of the site's former use.|$|E
5|$|A former hearse {{house at}} the {{southeast}} corner of the churchyard dates from about 1833, and has been converted for use as an electricity <b>sub-station.</b> It is a rectangular single-story building of red sandstone with a quarry tile roof. The door opening at the front has a wide semicircular arch with a keystone and springing blocks, above which is a string course and a cornice with moulded eaves. On the west side and at the rear are small vents with semicircular heads and keystones. The hearse house is listed at GradeII.|$|E
50|$|As of 2011, the {{electricity}} transmission networks consist of approximately 247 primary high voltage <b>sub-stations.</b> The network is coupled with 10500 low and medium voltage <b>sub-stations</b> (11 kV). Its voltage <b>sub-stations</b> {{are supported by}} a total 4000 km of overhead lines and 8500 km of underground cables running across the country. The National Control Center manages all network demand and data acquisition from generation plants and primary <b>sub-stations.</b>|$|R

50|$|Electricity was fed to the EMUs {{under the}} third rail, {{as opposed to}} above the rail in Southern England. The third rail was fed by {{fourteen}} <b>sub-stations</b> themselves fed by 15000 V and 1500 V by power stations at Nanterre and Issy-les-Moulineaux. the <b>sub-stations</b> was partially automated in the early 1930s.|$|R
5|$|For the 1903 {{parliamentary}} session, the UERL announced {{bills for}} the BS and its other tube railways, seeking permission to merge the three companies by transferring the BS's and CCE's powers to the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The BS bill also included requests {{for a further}} extension of time and for powers to compulsorily purchase land for an electrical <b>sub-station</b> at Lambeth. The merger was rejected by Parliament, but the land purchase and extension of time were permitted separately in the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1903 and the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (Extension of Time) Act, 1903, both given royal assent on 11 August 1903.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{electricity}} in the station ceased in 1919, ushered in by the completion of an extension to generating equipment at Newburn Steelworks. The building was retained and continued {{to be used to}} supply power to the tram route by housing a <b>sub-station,</b> which used rotary converters. The station also provided a service for local residents who wanted their wireless accumulators recharged. The station continued to operate in this way until 1946, when the tram route was closed. The station's chimney was demolished in 1949, along with remaining structures of the Tyne Iron Works, which had stood next to the power station throughout its operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1903 {{with a total}} {{generating}} capacity of 970 kilowatts, the electricity generated being used to power a tram system, and provide local households and streets with electric lighting. The station ceased generating electricity in 1919, however the structure was retained {{for use as a}} <b>sub-station</b> until 1946 when the tram line closed. The station was partially demolished in 1949, but has since been made a locally listed building and is now owned by construction company Nortland Construction. In March 2012 Norland applied to Newcastle City Council for permission to demolish the building on the grounds of it being at risk of collapse.|$|E
50|$|The two {{regions are}} divided into three districts each, each {{comprising}} several states. These are subdivided into Recruiting Stations (RS) located in large metropolitan areas, with smaller Recruiting <b>Sub-Stations</b> (RSS) covering smaller cities and rural areas. Some Recruiting <b>Sub-Stations</b> (RSS) have even smaller satellite offices called Permanent Contact Stations (PCS) often manned by a single Recruiter.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the <b>sub-station,</b> creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E

50|$|The use {{of mixed}} {{electric}} and diesel-electric power is necessitated {{by the huge}} voltage drops which can occur {{as a result of}} the long distance between some of the <b>sub-stations</b> along the route, with a supply voltage which can vary between 55 and 25 kV AC and with the lower value voltage sometimes occurring between <b>sub-stations.</b> Electric-only trains would therefore reduce the maximum possible traffic frequency.|$|R

25|$|In 1990, Orić was {{deployed}} to Kosovo {{as a member}} of a Special Police unit of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Serbia. Thereafter, he returned to Belgrade, where he became a bodyguard to Slobodan Milošević. He worked in quelling the civil unrest during the March 1991 mass anti-war protests, arresting Vuk Drašković. During that time he also worked as a bouncer at the famous Belgrade nightclub Metro (formerly Zvezda) in Knez Mihailova Street. In August 1991, Orić was transferred to a police station in Ilidža, outside Sarajevo. He was moved to the police station in Srebrenica in late 1991. In April 1992 he became the police chief of the Potočari police <b>sub-station.</b>|$|E

Construction of the power station was halted twice, from 1975 to 1983 due to the civil war, then again from 1986 to 2001 also due to fighting. The dam was partially destroyed by dynamite in 1990. Along with the power station, <b>sub-stations</b> at Caála, Dango, and Benfica (in Huambo) were inaugurated {{at the time of}} completion.

25|$|Located {{east of the}} Marshalling Yards is the Lady Forster Building, {{originally}} a creche erected in 1928 in Costin Street and moved in 1939 to its present position. It is a rectangular, high-set, timber framed, gable-roofed building with transverse gables at the southeast end. The roof is clad with corrugated iron and the exterior walls with fibrous-cement sheeting, cover-strips and weatherboards. There is a row of timber hopper windows high in the southwest, northwest and southeast walls. Because of {{the slope of the}} land, the northeast side of the building is at ground level and has a number of sliding aluminium doors and a skillion-roofed extension over cement paving. There is a small yard to the northeast of the building, with three mature Moreton Bay fig trees shading the whole of the yard.

500|$|Wind {{gusts of}} 91km/h (56mph) damaged Saipan's {{electrical}} system. On Guam, Andersen Air Force Base recorded sustained winds of 80km/h (49mph), with gusts to 93km/h (58mph). The storm's slow movement enabled heavy rain {{to fall over}} Guam, totaling [...] at the National Weather Service office {{near the center of}} the island; this was enough rainfall to cause flooding, particularly on the western side of Guam. The concurrence of heavy rainfall and gusty winds caused isolated power outages on the island, with floods temporarily shutting down the Tumon power <b>sub-station.</b> Increased water flow along the Ugum River shut down the Ugum Water Treatment Plant, leaving some residents without water access.|$|E
