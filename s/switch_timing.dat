40|$|This work studies an {{application}} of the discontinuous control approach {{to the design of}} the current control loop in switching power converters and electrical drives. The role of the current control loop is to generate the switching patterns that will determine the sequence and the duration ON and OFF states of the switches. The reduction of the Instantaneous Total Harmonic Distortion of the currents for 3 ~Phase Switching Power Converters and 3 ~Phase Electrical machines is being selected as additional requirement determining the switching matrix operation. The approach is based on the Direct Sliding Mode principle and the unified approach for control of a PWM 3 -phase switching matrix with six switches, common for 3 -phase inverters, rectifiers as well as 3 -phase machines. Conventional tracking control algorithms may provide the proper selection of switching vector but not the proper <b>timing</b> since <b>switching</b> <b>timing</b> occurs only when the control error is contacted pre-set hysteresis bounds. However this generates significant harmonic distortion especially low order harmonic distortion compared with carrier based algorithms. The quality of the switching control algorithm is determined by both the proper selection of switching vector and the proper <b>switching</b> <b>timing.</b> The presented algorithm evaluates harmonic distortion in real time with instantaneous THD definition and sequentially selects two switching vectors in one control period in order to minimize the tracking error and timing is determined according to the THD minimization theorem. The simulation of the approach is performed on both Boost Rectifier and Buck Inverter, and comparative simulation results with Relay Control approach are given...|$|R

40|$|Current powered {{prosthetic}} legs require {{switching control}} modes {{according to the}} task the user is performing (e. g. level-ground walking, stair climbing, walking on slopes, etc.). To allow prosthesis users safely and seamlessly transition between tasks, {{it is critical to}} deter-mine when to switch the prosthesis control mode during task transitions. Our previous study defined critical timings for different types of task transitions in ambulation; however, it is unknown whether it is the unique timing that allows safe and seamless transitions. The goals of this study were to (1) systematically investigate the effects of mode <b>switch</b> <b>timing</b> on the prosthesis user’s performance in task transitions, and (2) identify appropriate timing to switch the prosthesis control mode so that the users can seamlessly transition between different locomotion tasks. Five able-bodied (AB) and two transfemoral (TF) amputee sub-jects were tested as they wore a powered knee prosthesis. The prosthesis control mode was switched manually at various times while the subjects performed different types of task transitions. The subjects ’ task transition performances were evaluated by their walking bal-ance and success in performing seamless task transitions. The results demonstrated that there existed a time window within which switching the prosthesis control mode neither interrupted the subjects ’ task transitions nor disturbed their walking balance. Therefore, the results suggested the control mode switching of a lower limb prosthesis can be triggered within an appropriate time window instead of a specific timing or an individual phase. In addition, a generalized criterion to determine the appropriate mode <b>switch</b> <b>timing</b> was pro-posed. The outcomes of this study could provide important guidance for future designs of neurally controlled powered knee prostheses that are safe and reliable to use...|$|E

The interaction between RTN/WDF and aging is of importance and not fully understood. Some researchers reported aging increasing RTN/WDF, while others showed RTN/WDF being hardly affected by aging. The objective of this work is to investigate the impact of hot carrier aging (HCA) on the RTN/WDF of nMOSFETs. For devices of average RTN/WDF, it is found that the effect of HCA is generally modest. For devices of abnormally high RTN/WDF, however, for the first time, we report HCA reducing RTN/WDF substantially (> 50 %).

40|$|Abstract: Many {{small scale}} {{telecommunication}} networks {{operate in a}} slotted mode with constant data packet sizes. Some of these systems have only modest hardware and hence, queuing performance is an important issue. Performance analysis of slotted systems requires more than simply obtaining the performance figures of discrete-time Markov chains. This paper elucidates the importance of characterizing the timing and synchronization details required to correctly formulate the Markov chain and evaluate corresponding performance figures. Two distinct Markov chains are identified in such analysis of any slotted system. The events causing different transitions between the system states are systematically developed for both Markov chains. Relationships between time-averaged performance figures and corresponding expectations of both the Markov chains are developed. The approach is demonstrated by providing easier solutions to some slotted systems found in the literature. A few other apparently different modes of operation and corresponding models are shown {{to fall into the}} two model categories studied here.

40|$|SummaryPersistent {{free-running}} circannual (approximately year-long) rhythms {{have evolved}} in animals to regulate hormone cycles, drive metabolic rhythms (including hibernation), and time annual reproduction. Recent studies have defined the photoperiodic input to this rhythm, wherein melatonin acts on thyrotroph {{cells of the}} pituitary pars tuberalis (PT), leading to seasonal changes in the control of thyroid hormone metabolism in the hypothalamus. However, seasonal rhythms persist in constant conditions in many species {{in the absence of}} a changing photoperiod signal, leading to the generation of circannual cycles. It is not known which cells, tissues, and pathways generate these remarkable long-term rhythmic processes. We show that individual PT thyrotrophs can be in one of two binary states reflecting either a long (EYA 3 +) or short (CHGA+) photoperiod, with the relative proportion in each state defining the phase of the circannual cycle. We also show that a morphogenic cycle driven by the PT leads to extensive re-modeling of the PT and hypothalamus over the circannual cycle. We propose that the PT may employ a recapitulated developmental pathway to drive changes in morphology of tissues and cells. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the circannual timer may reside within the PT thyrotroph and is encoded by a binary <b>switch</b> <b>timing</b> mechanism, which may regulate the generation of circannual neuroendocrine rhythms, leading to dynamic re-modeling of the hypothalamic interface. In summary, the PT-ventral hypothalamus now appears to be a prime structure involved in long-term rhythm generation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Since {{centralized}} control of urban networks with detailed modeling approaches is computationally complex, devel-oping efficient hierarchical control strategies based on aggregate modeling {{is of great}} importance. The dynamics of a heteroge-neous large-scale urban network is modeled as R homogeneous regions with the macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFDs) representation. The MFD provides for homogeneous network regions a unimodal, low-scatter relationship between network vehicle density and network space-mean flow. In this paper, the optimal hybrid control problem for an R-region MFD network is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem, where two types of controllers are introduced: 1) perimeter controllers and 2) <b>switching</b> signal <b>timing</b> plans controllers. The perimeter controllers are located {{on the border between}} the regions, as they manipulate the transfer flows between them, while the switching controllers influence the dynamics of the urban regions, as they define the shape of the MFDs and as a result affect the internal flows within each region. Moreover, to decrease the computational complexity due to the nonlinear and nonconvex nature of the optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem utilizing piecewise affine approximation techniques. Two different approaches for transformation of the original model and building up MILP problems are presented, and the performances of the approximated methods along with the original problem formulation are evaluated and compared for different traffic scenarios of a two-region urban case study.

40|$|We propose an {{optimization}} {{method for}} power distribution network that explicitly deals with timing.

To resolve the above facts, we devised an efficient sensitivity calculation of timing to decap size and power wire width for guiding optimization. The proposed method, which is based on statistical noise modeling and timing analysis, accelerates sensitivity calculation with an approximation and adjoint sensitivity analysis. Experimental results show that decap allocation based on the sensitivity analysis efficiently minimizes the worst-case circuit delay within a given decap budget. Compared to the maximum decap placement, the delay improvement due to decap increases by 3. 13 % even while the total amount of decaps is reduced to 40 %.

40|$|High-speed high-accuracy digital-to-analog {{converters}} (DACs) are {{the crucial}} {{building blocks for}} many signal processing and telecommunication systems. The current-steering architecture is extensively used for these applications. With different decoding schemes [...] binary-weighted, unary-coded, and segment-coded, current-steering DACs are realized by groups of matched current sources. Their performance is limited by many nonlinear mechanisms such as random mismatch errors, gradient effect, code and voltage dependence of finite output impedance, nonlinear settling time, charge injection, and <b>switch</b> <b>timing</b> errors. In this thesis, two nonlinearity compensation techniques are presented to improve the overall performance of the current-steering DACs. The first design technique is a novel digital calibration technique [...] complete-folding, which effectively compensates the random mismatch errors by selectively regrouping current sources into a fully binary-weighted array based on current comparisons after chip fabrication. The implementation only requires an analog current comparator and some digital circuitry. The minimum requirement of analog circuits makes complete-folding calibration suitable for DAC design in the low-voltage process. Statistical results with a behavioral model of a 14 -bit segmented DAC in MATLAB show that complete-folding calibration can reduce the total gate area of current sources {{by a factor of}} almost 1200 compared to the DAC without using any calibration. Additional results also show that this new calibration technique has the superior performance in compensating random mismatch errors as compared to state-of-the-art.

40|$|With {{regard to}} socio-psychology, the {{complexity}} of a human’s neuronal function develops from initial primitive function to multimodal networking gradually through interaction between innate biological mechanisms and the surrounding environment. To study these developmental systems, we attempted to find a comparative-behavioral model among non-human primate species, common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). In this research, we explored {{the correlation between the}} timing of change from involuntary- to voluntary-like movement in early stage and later the socio-emotional behavior, comparatively with the probable psychological development disabilities defined by our social behavior test (SBT). Using the ‘Infant Antigravity Task (IAT) ’ and multivariate analysis, we quantitatively observed the neurological development from simple to complex behavior through interaction between motor and gravity environment. At the same time, we recorded the physiological and psychological development of two marmoset siblings (a male and a female) from their neonate stages to adult stages with their parents. In their lives, the male marmoset spontaneously showed his developmental delay in terms of body weight, blood glucose and socio-emotional difficulties under their own parental care. Based from the SBT results, the male demonstrated less social interaction with other family members compared to his sibling in the juvenile stage. Between these siblings, we looked for any predictable information in the earlier stage for future developmental issues particularly focusing on their behavioral expression during IAT from the 10 th postnatal day until the 36 th day. Consequently, we found that both subjects expressed climbing-up behavior in the initial early period, but only the female who developed typically later, switched to jumping-down behavior with pre-facing to ‘down’ direction. Meanwhile, the male who would have developmental delay later, clearly did not show the switching pattern. The results suggest that the <b>switch</b> <b>timing</b> from involuntary to voluntary movement may be a possible predictor of juvenile and adolescent physiological and psychological retardation.

If the resonant frequencies of such a system are known, it is possible to determine a switching command that delivers comparable actuation without exciting these natural modes of vibration.
