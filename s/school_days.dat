Partnering with American distributor JAST USA, <b>School</b> <b>Days</b> HQ, uncensored in English, was announced for a North American release on March 11, 2011.

The company announced weeks later on June 1 that <b>School</b> <b>Days</b> HQ had gone gold. Following news on June 26 that the company would exhibit the game at Anime Expo 2012, JAST made an update to the June 1 announcement that <b>School</b> <b>Days</b> HQ had begun shipping. The downloadable version of the game was later released on August 6.|$|E
5|$|<b>School</b> <b>Days</b> was 0verflow's tenth game to develop. News of <b>School</b> <b>Days</b> first {{surfaced}} on October 5, 2004 when 0verflow {{posted a}} link to the game's then-live website and development log on their official site. In the blog, 0verflow revealed that <b>School</b> <b>Days</b> had been in pre-production for roughly two years and would be a fully animated game. Updates {{on the development of the}} game were scheduled for Tuesdays and Fridays, and the company encouraged fans to attend Dream Party 2004, an upcoming anime convention at Tokyo Big Sight in Ariake, on October 11, where it would make its first public showcase of the game and characters. A follow-up of the venue was made on October 15. Toward the end of the month on October 26, 0verflow posted that new information about <b>School</b> <b>Days</b> would be circulated in the November issue of Tech Gian, an adult magazine published by Enterbrain.|$|E

5|$|As {{a visual}} novel, <b>School</b> <b>Days</b> {{contains}} extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation {{is composed of}} scenes that are viewed from a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game pauses, and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress {{up to that point}} in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character to blossom, plateau, or diminish, thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. Being an erotic title, relationships between characters may become sexual; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing, masturbation, oral sex and intercourse. Genitalia are pixelated in the original Japanese releases, but the Western release of <b>School</b> <b>Days</b> HQ is uncensored. Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the story}} of the {{original}} game, <b>School</b> <b>Days</b> was reimagined as a manga, illustrated by Homare Sakazuki and serialized in the Kadokawa Shoten magazine Comp Ace from May 26, 2006 to September 26, 2007. On July 12, 2007, 0verflow announced that the manga had been collected into its first volume, comprising five chapters set to be released on July 26. Later that year, the second and final volume, comprising the remaining seven chapters, was released on November 26.|$|E

5|$|Following the game's release, <b>School</b> <b>Days</b> {{made several}} {{transitions}} into other media. The original story was adapted into a manga and serialized in the Kadokawa Shoten magazine Comp Ace; {{it was later}} published into two volumes. Comic anthologies, light novels and art books were also published, as were audio dramas and several albums of music. An animated television series, two direct-to-video (OVA) single releases, and a concert film were also produced, {{the first of which}} became a precursor for an internet meme when its finale was pulled from broadcast.|$|E

5|$|Unlike in Summer Days, {{the story}} in Cross Days is not rewritten as a {{spin-off}} of the original story, but occurs during the events of it, making the game a parallel series to <b>School</b> <b>Days.</b> As such, the undisclosed location of the story remains the same with focus being around the school. All signature characters and their established relationships appear in the game, with six new cast members.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} for <b>School</b> <b>Days</b> and Summer Days, the {{original}} soundtrack of Cross Days was reproduced for distribution alongside the game, initially scheduled for February 27, 2009. As this {{was the first of the}} later six postponements, however, the album was republished and deferred to June 26. Following the second delay, the soundtrack was held indefinitely until 0verflow announced on April 16, 2010 that it would be released April 21. The album contains all of the game's background music, all of which was composed by HIKO of KIRIKO/HIKO Sound, and theme songs performed by Yozuca*, iyuna, Ceui, Kotaro Odaka and Riryka, totaling 25 tracks.|$|E
5|$|Compulsory {{education}} or grunnskóli (lit. “basic school”), is {{the period of}} education which is compulsory for all. The legislation concerning compulsory education was passed in 2007, and in 1996 municipalities took over the running of compulsory education. It comprises primary and lower secondary education, which often {{takes place at the}} same institution. The law states that education is mandatory for children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 16. The school year lasts nine months, and begins between August 21 and September 1, ending between May 31 and June 10. The minimum number of <b>school</b> <b>days</b> is 170, but after a new teachers’ wage contract, this will increase to 180. Lessons take place five days a week.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, {{students}} went {{on strike}} to protest a proposal by the city's board of education to extend {{the end of the}} <b>school</b> <b>day</b> from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, with striking students arguing that the longer <b>school</b> <b>day</b> would interfere with their part-time jobs.|$|R
5000|$|Each <b>school</b> <b>day</b> {{is either}} an [...] "A Day" [...] or a [...] "B Day". If one <b>school</b> <b>day</b> is an A <b>Day,</b> the next <b>school</b> <b>day</b> {{will be a}} B Day, and so on. The purpose of these names are to switch special classes, like a musical class, which are Band, Orchestra, Chorus, and General Music, and a Physical Education class. On A Days, a student will either have a music class or a P.E. class, and the next day, he/she will have the other one.|$|R

5|$|In December 1996, former classmate Tuomas Holopainen invited Turunen to {{join his}} new {{acoustic}} mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their <b>school</b> <b>days.</b> At the following band practices, Emppu Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice. Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually {{came to the conclusion}} that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a metal band.|$|E
5|$|Lennie {{started on}} the family's player piano {{at the age of}} two or three. He had {{classical}} piano lessons when he was eight, but indicated later that they had hindered, rather than helped, his development. He was born with weak eyesight, possibly as a consequence of his mother being affected by the 1918–19 flu pandemic during pregnancy. A bout of measles when aged six may have exacerbated his condition, and by the age of nine or ten he was totally blind as a result of glaucoma. He initially went to standard state schools, but attended the Illinois School for the Blind in Jacksonville for a decade from around 1928. During his <b>school</b> <b>days</b> he played several instruments, including saxophones, trumpet, guitar, and drums. At the age of eleven he had his first gigs, playing clarinet in a brothel.|$|E
5|$|María del Carmen, nicknamed Lita, {{was born}} in 1838. She had met Betances when she was 10, and Betances became {{instantly}} fond of her.

Their marriage was supposed to occur on May 5, 1859 in Paris, but Lita fell sick with typhus and died at the Mennecy house of Dr. Pierre Lamire, a friend from Betances' medical <b>school</b> <b>days,</b> on April 22, 1859 (the Good Friday of that year).|$|E
