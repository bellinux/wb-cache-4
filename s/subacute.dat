5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is managed}} with {{replacement}} of the hormone thyroxine. This is usually given daily as an oral supplement, and may take {{a few weeks to}} become effective. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as Postpartum thyroiditis and <b>Subacute</b> thyroiditis may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as iodine deficiency may be able to be rectified with dietary supplementation.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{clinical presentation}} of RRMS is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack {{of a single}} symptom. During a CIS, there is a <b>subacute</b> attack suggestive of demyelination but the patient does not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Treatment with interferons or glatiramer acetate after an initial attack decreases {{the risk of developing}} clinical definite MS.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of {{the thyroid}} is called thyroiditis. Inflamed thyroids may cause {{symptoms}} of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes {{followed by a}} period of hypothyroidism – Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. There are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid, and these include <b>subacute</b> thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis and traumatic injury, including palpation thyroiditis.|$|E
5|$|Transient {{increased}} bowel frequency, diarrhoea, constipation or minor rectal bleeding, {{may also}} occur. Acute and <b>subacute</b> side effects usually resolve over {{a matter of}} days or a few weeks. In the case of permanent (seed) brachytherapy for prostate cancer, there is a small chance that some seeds may migrate out of the treatment region into the bladder or urethra and be passed in the urine.|$|E
5|$|Hyponatremia, {{an unusually}} {{low level of}} sodium in the blood that may cause {{confusion}} and seizures, is found in 40% of cases. This {{may be caused by}} low cortisol levels or by inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the <b>subacute</b> phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands. This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle, infertility and decreased libido.|$|E
5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. <b>Subacute</b> pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Historically, infective {{endocarditis}} {{has been}} clinically divided into acute and <b>subacute</b> presentations (because untreated patients tended {{to live longer}} with the <b>subacute</b> {{as opposed to the}} acute form). This classifies both the rate of progression and severity of disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subacute</b> Fasciolosis: {{infectious}} dose is 800-1000 ingested metacercariae. Sheep are lethargic, anemic and may die. Weight loss is dominant feature.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} presentation of CST can be varied. Both acute, fulminant disease and indolent, <b>subacute</b> presentations {{have been reported}} in the literature.|$|E
25|$|In <b>subacute</b> endocarditis, where patient's hemodynamic {{status is}} usually stable, {{antibiotic}} treatment can be delayed till the causative microorganism can be identified.|$|E
25|$|Infection. Some {{infectious}} diseases can cause weight loss. Fungal illnesses, endocarditis, many parasitic diseases, AIDS, {{and some other}} <b>subacute</b> or occult infections may cause weight loss.|$|E
25|$|As many as 70% {{of people}} with lupus have some skin symptoms. The three main {{categories}} of lesions are chronic cutaneous (discoid) lupus, <b>subacute</b> cutaneous lupus, and acute cutaneous lupus. People with discoid lupus may exhibit thick, red scaly patches on the skin. Similarly, <b>subacute</b> cutaneous lupus manifests as red, scaly patches of skin but with distinct edges. Acute cutaneous lupus manifests as a rash. Some have the classic malar rash (or butterfly rash) associated with the disease. This rash occurs in 30 to 60% {{of people with}} SLE.|$|E
25|$|In brain MRI, {{there is}} often an {{increased}} T2 signalling at the posterior columns of the spinal cord in patients with myelopathy caused by copper deficiency. T2 signalling is often an indicator {{of some kind of}} neurodegeneration. There are some changes in the spinal cord MRI involving the thoracic cord, the cervical cord or sometimes both. Copper deficiency myelopathy is often compared to <b>subacute</b> combined degeneration (SCD). <b>Subacute</b> combined degeneration is also a degeneration of the spinal cord, but instead vitamin B12 deficiency is the cause of the spinal degeneration. SCD also has the same high T2 signalling intensities in the posterior column as copper deficient patient in MRI imaging.|$|E
25|$|A <b>subacute</b> rodent NOAEL of 43 μg/kg {{body weight}} {{as well as}} {{genotoxicity}} studies were primarily the cause for setting limits for patulin exposure, although a range {{of other types of}} toxicity also exist.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subacute</b> {{bacterial}} endocarditis (SBE) is often due to streptococci of low virulence (mainly viridans streptococci) and {{mild to moderate}} illness which progresses slowly over weeks and months (>2 weeks) and has low propensity to hematogenously seed extracardiac sites.|$|E
25|$|Osler's nodes {{are raised}} tender nodules on the pulps of {{fingertips}} or toes, an autoimmune vasculitis that is suggestive of <b>subacute</b> bacterial endocarditis. They are usually painful, {{as opposed to}} Janeway lesions which are due to emboli and are painless.|$|E
25|$|Rylstone's newly renovated and {{extended}} small rural hospital {{known as a}} Multipurpose Service provides emergency services, acute and <b>subacute</b> medical inpatient services and low and high care residential aged care services. HealthOne Rylstone is collocated with the Multipurpose Service providing General Practitioner services.|$|E
25|$|Subdural hematomas {{are divided}} into acute, <b>subacute,</b> and chronic, {{depending}} on the speed of their onset. Acute subdural hematomas that are due to trauma are the most lethal of all head injuries and have a high mortality rate {{if they are not}} rapidly treated with surgical decompression.|$|E
25|$|The ICSD-R also {{described}} three {{different types of}} sleep bruxism according to the duration the condition is present, namely acute, which lasts for less than one week; <b>subacute,</b> which lasts {{for more than a}} week and less than one month; and chronic which lasts for over a month.|$|E
25|$|Systemic infections {{can result}} in neurodevelopmental consequences, when they occur in infancy and {{childhood}} of humans, but would not be called a primary neurodevelopmental disorder per se, as for example HIV Infections {{of the head and}} brain, like brain abscesses, meningitis or encephalitis have a high risk of causing neurodevelopmental problems and eventually a disorder. For example, measles can progress to <b>subacute</b> sclerosing panencephalitis.|$|E
25|$|Myoclonic jerks {{may occur}} {{alone or in}} sequence, in a pattern or without pattern. They may occur {{infrequently}} or many times each minute. Most often, myoclonus {{is one of several}} signs {{in a wide variety of}} nervous system disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Dystonia, Alzheimer's disease, Gaucher's disease, <b>subacute</b> sclerosing panencephalitis, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), serotonin toxicity, some cases of Huntington's disease, some forms of epilepsy, and occasionally in intracranial hypotension. Some researchers indicate that jerks persistently may even cause early tremors.|$|E
25|$|Acute liver {{failure is}} the {{appearance}} of severe complications rapidly after {{the first signs of}} liver disease (such as jaundice), and indicates that the liver has sustained severe damage (loss of function of 80–90% of liver cells). The complications are hepatic encephalopathy and impaired protein synthesis (as measured by the levels of serum albumin and the prothrombin time in the blood). The 1993 classification defines hyperacute as within 1 week, acute as 8–28 days, and <b>subacute</b> as 4–12 weeks. It reflects the fact that the pace of disease evolution strongly influences prognosis. Underlying cause is the other significant determinant of outcome.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 10% of {{patients}} will experience notable protracted withdrawal symptoms, which can include panic disorder, after discontinuation of benzodiazepines. Protracted withdrawal symptoms tend to resemble those seen {{during the first}} couple of months of withdrawal but usually are of a <b>subacute</b> level of severity compared to the symptoms seen during the first 2 or 3 months of withdrawal. It is not known definitively whether such symptoms persisting long after withdrawal are related to true pharmacological withdrawal or whether they are due to structural neuronal damage as result of chronic use of benzodiazepines or withdrawal. Nevertheless, such symptoms do typically lessen as the months and years go by eventually disappearing altogether.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} SLE is not clear. It {{is thought to}} involve {{genetics}} together with environmental factors. Among identical twins, if one is affected there is a 24% chance the other one will be as well. Female sex hormones, sunlight, smoking, vitamin D deficiency, and certain infections, are also believed to increase the risk. The mechanism involves an immune response by autoantibodies against a person's own tissues. These are most commonly anti-nuclear antibodies and they result in inflammation. Diagnosis can be difficult {{and is based on}} a combination of symptoms and laboratory tests. There {{are a number of other}} kinds of lupus erythematosus including discoid lupus erythematosus, neonatal lupus, and <b>subacute</b> cutaneous lupus erythematosus.|$|E
25|$|Germ-cell {{tumors are}} {{typically}} discovered {{when they become}} large, palpable masses. However, like sex cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual precocious puberty. They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes. The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is <b>subacute</b> abdominal pain caused by the tumor bleeding, necrotizing, or stretching the ovarian capsule. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause acute abdominal pain, which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the menstrual cycle. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a routine examination and does not cause symptoms.|$|E
25|$|In blood, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and {{eosinophilia}} may {{be observed}} in all types of fasciolosis. Elevation of liver enzyme activities, such a glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is detected in <b>subacute</b> or chronic fasciolosis from 12 to 15 weeks after ingestion of metacercariae. Economical effect of fasciolosis in sheep consists in sudden deaths of animals {{as well as in}} reduction of weight gain and wool production. In goats and cattle, the clinical manifestation is similar to sheep. However, acquired resistance to F. hepatica infection is well known in adult cattle. Calves are susceptible to disease but in excess of 1000 metacercariae are usually required to cause clinical fasciolosis. In this case the disease is similar to sheep and is characterized by weight loss, anemia, hypoalbuminemia and (after infection with 10,000 metacercariae) death. Importance of cattle fasciolosis consist in economic losses caused by condemnation of livers at slaughter and production losses especially due to reduced weight gain.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} myelin damage {{resulting from}} B12 deficiency, {{even in the}} presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem. It has been connected to B12 most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal fatty acid synthesis, or it will be incorporated into fatty acids itself rather than normal malonic acid. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is <b>subacute</b> combined degeneration of the central nervous system and spinal cord. Whatever the cause, it is known that B12 deficiency causes neuropathies, even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.|$|E
25|$|Whiplash {{and other}} neck pain. There is no {{consensus}} {{on the effectiveness of}} manual therapies for neck pain. A 2013 systematic review found that the data suggests that there are minimal short- and long-term treatment differences when comparing manipulation or mobilization of the cervical spine to physical therapy or exercise for neck pain improvement. A 2013 systematic review found that although there is insufficient evidence that thoracic SM is more effective than other treatments, it is a suitable intervention to treat some patients with non-specific neck pain. A 2011 systematic review found that thoracic SM may offer short-term improvement for the treatment of acute or <b>subacute</b> mechanical neck pain; although the body of literature is still weak. A 2010 Cochrane review found low quality evidence that suggests cervical manipulation may offer better short-term pain relief than a control for neck pain, and moderate evidence that cervical manipulation and mobilization produced similar effects on pain, function and patient satisfaction. A 2010 systematic review found low level evidence that suggests chiropractic care improves cervical range of motion and pain in the management of whiplash.|$|E
25|$|The main {{occupational}} risks {{posed by}} this acid are skin contact leading to burns (see above) and the inhalation of aerosols. Exposure to aerosols at high concentrations leads to immediate and severe irritation of the eyes, respiratory tract and mucous membranes: this ceases rapidly after exposure, {{although there is}} a risk of subsequent pulmonary edema if tissue damage has been more severe. At lower concentrations, the most commonly reported symptom of chronic exposure to sulfuric acid aerosols is erosion of the teeth, found in virtually all studies: indications of possible chronic damage to the respiratory tract are inconclusive as of 1997. Repeated occupational exposure to sulfuric acid mists may increase the chance of lung cancer by up to 64 percent. In the United States, the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for sulfuric acid is fixed at 1mg/m3: limits in other countries are similar. There have been reports of sulfuric acid ingestion leading to vitamin B12 deficiency with <b>subacute</b> combined degeneration. The spinal cord is most often affected in such cases, but the optic nerves may show demyelination, loss of axons and gliosis.|$|E

500|$|It is {{important}} to begin emergency treatment within the so-called [...] "golden hour" [...] following the injury. People with moderate to severe injuries are likely to receive treatment in an intensive care unit followed by a neurosurgical ward. Treatment depends on the recovery stage of the patient. In the acute stage the primary aim of the medical personnel is to stabilize the patient and focus on preventing further injury because little {{can be done to}} reverse the initial damage caused by trauma. Rehabilitation is the main treatment for the <b>subacute</b> and chronic stages of recovery. International clinical guidelines have been proposed with the aim of guiding decisions in TBI treatment, as defined by an authoritative examination of current evidence.|$|E
500|$|Once {{medically}} stable, {{people may}} be transferred to a <b>subacute</b> rehabilitation unit of the medical center or to an independent rehabilitation hospital. Rehabilitation aims to improve independent function {{at home and in}} society and to help adapt to disabilities [...] and has demonstrated its general effectiveness, when conducted by a team of health professionals who specialise in head trauma. As for any person with neurologic deficits, a multidisciplinary approach is key to optimising outcome. Physiatrists or neurologists are likely to be the key medical staff involved, but depending on the person, doctors of other medical specialties may also be helpful. Allied health professions such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, cognitive rehabilitation therapy, and occupational therapy will be essential to assess function and design the rehabilitation activities for each person. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional distress and clinical depression may involve mental health professionals such as therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists, while neuropsychologists can help to evaluate and manage cognitive deficits.|$|E
