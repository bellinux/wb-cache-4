For absorption, as with large foam wedges seen in anechoic chambers, the loss occurs ultimately through turbulence, as colliding air molecules convert some of their kinetic energy into heat.

Previous state-of-the-art accelarated fast solver (FastHenry) uses a formu-lation based upon magneto-quasi-static (MQS) assumption and hence could not consider capacitive effect. In addition, the frequency-dependent volume filaments used in FastHenry renders the computational cost prohibitive at high frequencies due to skin-effect. In this the-sis, a surface integral formulation {{combined with a}} pre-corrected FFT algorithm is used to compute the impedance matrix in nearly order n time and memory, where n {{is the number of}} <b>surface</b> <b>panels.</b> Computational results are given to demonstrate that the new algorithm can perform MQS, electro-magneto-quasi-static and fullwave analysis of realistic integrated circuit interconnect and packaging problems using a fixed set of <b>surface</b> <b>panels</b> across wid...|$|R

A geometric parallelism is used for both the data distribution and the algorithm. A flexible geometry definition allows complex three-dimensional surfaces and multiple body problems to be solved.

40|$|The {{performance}} of large reflector antennas {{can be improved}} by identifying the location and amount of their surface distortions and correcting them. To determine {{the accuracy of the}} constructed surface profiles, simulation studies are used to incorporate both the effects of systematic and random distortions, particularly the effects of the displaced <b>surface</b> <b>panels.</b> In this paper, different simulation models are investigated, emphasizing a model based on the vector diffraction analysis of a curved reflector with displaced panels. The simulated far-field patterns are then used to reconstruct the location and amount of displacement of the <b>surface</b> <b>panels</b> by employing a fast Fourier transform/iterative procedure. The sensitivity of the microwave holography technique {{based on the number of}} far-field sampled points, level of distortions, polarizations, illumination tapers, etc., is also examined...|$|R

The results at subsonic speeds indicate similar improvements for the methods investigated over the low order source method. At supersonic speeds, stable and accurate results were obtained with the <b>surface</b> <b>panel</b> methods. Significant differences between tangential mass flux and tangential velocity boundary conditions occurred, especially at low fineness ratios and higher Mach numbers.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the underwater appendages and hull of the Reflex 28 yacht have been analysed using a <b>surface</b> <b>panel</b> code. The objective of the work {{was to assess the}} ease with which such a code could be used as part of the design process using computational resources already available to the yacht designer. The flexible geometry creation process allowed the complete hull, keel-bulb and rudder configuration to be defined both for upright and heeled configurations and tested for a range of hull drift and rudder angles. The <b>surface</b> <b>panel</b> solution was obtained using an iterative process whereby each underwater component was solved independently and then {{in the presence of the}} velocity field induced by all the other components. This Interaction Velocity Field approach allows high panel density on each component and reduces the numerical difficulties associated with body-wake intersection. The results of the analysis confirmed performance features observed in the actual behaviour of the Reflex 28, allowed greater insight into the mechanisms of flow interaction and allowed the relative side force contributions to be determined. It was concluded that, used with care, <b>surface</b> <b>panel</b> codes can provide the yacht designer with adetailed understanding of underwater appendage performance. The ability to rapidly change the geometric definition offers teh possibility of cost-effective design optimisation even on a modest budge...|$|E

40|$|TranAir is a {{computer}} code which solves the full-potential equation for transonic flow about very general and complex configurations. Piecewise flat <b>surface</b> <b>panels</b> are {{used to describe the}} <b>surface</b> geometry. This <b>paneled</b> definition is then embedded in an unstructured cartesian flow field grid. Finite elements are used in the discretization of the flow field grid in a manner which is fully conservative and second-order accurate. Since geometries may be defined with relative ease, and since the user is not involved in the generation of the flow field grid, computational results may be generated rather quickly {{for a wide range of}} geometries. For transonic cases in the cruise angle-of-attack range, TranAir has generated results which are in generally good agreement with both Euler results and wind tunnel data. A typical transonic case runs in 1 to 2 CPU hours on a Cray X-MP. For subcritical cases, the code runs in 15 to 30 CPU minutes, even for geometries in which several thousand <b>surface</b> <b>panels</b> are used in the definition. This ability to rapidly and accurately provide both subsonic and transonic predictions about very complex aircraft configurations gives TranAir the potential of being a very powerful and widely used design tool...|$|R

A baseline TPS concept, selected {{at the beginning of}} the program, consisted of a Haynes 25 corrugation-stiffened beaded skin <b>surface</b> <b>panel,</b> a specially designed support system, and an insulation system.
