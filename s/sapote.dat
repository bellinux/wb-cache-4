50|$|In {{the past}} 40 years, {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out on the white <b>sapote's</b> seeds that have yielded the identity of many pharmacologically active compounds, including: N-methylhistamine, N,N-dimethylhistamine and histamine. It also contains 2′,5,6-Trimethoxyflavone, 2′,5,6,7-tetramethoxyflavone (zapotin) and 5-hydroxy-2′,6,7-trimethoxyflavone (zapotinin).|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} elevations are Piedra Redonda, Chivaguia Grande, Chivaguia Chica, Guinise Grande, Loma del Cuche, La Peñas and Guibetes. The Atoyac and Valiente Rivers pass through here. The municipality has a temperate climate with winds {{mostly from the}} north. Agriculture employ about 19% of the population growing vegetables such as corn, beans and squash blossom, as well as decorative flowers such as daisies, Mexican marigolds and poinsettias. Orchards here produce oranges, mangos, mamey <b>sapotes,</b> black <b>sapotes,</b> guavas and other tropical fruit. Livestock includes domestic fowl, pigs, cattle and sheep. About 33% are involved in mining and industry, with most of this population dedicated to the making of barro negro pottery. The rest of the population, about 45% is employed in commerce.|$|R
25|$|Most of the municipality’s {{territory}} {{is dedicated to}} agriculture. Major crops include barley, corn, sorghum, wheat, maguey, and various vegetables. Orchards also exist there producing capulins, peaches, pears, figs, plums, white <b>sapote,</b> tejocotes and apricots. Livestock includes cattle, pigs, goats and domestic fowl. The second most important economic activity is industry, producing processed foods, drinks, tobacco products and leather goods. Mining is limited to gravel, sand and other construction materials. There are small deposits of gold, silver, copper, quartz and mercury, {{but they have not}} been exploited. Most mines are located near the communities of San Pedro Tepetitlan and Xometla. Commerce is mostly limited to serving local needs.|$|E

2500|$|Just over 54% of {{the working}} {{population}} is dedicated to agriculture, livestock and forestry. Agriculture is not a principal economic activity {{due to the lack}} of arable land. Most land is used for livestock and forestry. The agriculture that is practiced is traditional and in small plots. Around 3,400 hectares are farmed during the rainy season, principally in Landa, Encino Solo, Palo Verde, La Reforma, La Lagunita, Otates, Tres Lagunas, Acatitlán de Zaragoza, Tilaco, and Valle de Guadalupe.

Crops raised include corn, beans, wheat, oats, avocados, pears, apples, peaches, choke cherries, Mexican hawthorns, nuts and white <b>sapotes.</b> Most agriculture takes place on small plots on the edges of the municipality. Similarly livestock such as cattle, pigs, sheep and horses are raised.|$|R
50|$|The {{unrelated}} fruits, mamey <b>sapote</b> (Sapotaceae) and {{the white}} <b>sapote</b> (Rutaceae).|$|E
5000|$|Casimiroa tetrameria [...] - [...] woolly-leaf white <b>sapote,</b> yellow <b>sapote,</b> matasano ...|$|E
50|$|The mamey <b>sapote</b> {{is related}} to other sapotes such as {{sapodilla}} (Manilkara zapota), abiu (P. caimito) and canistel (P. campechiana), but unrelated to the black <b>sapote</b> (Diospyros digyna) and white <b>sapote</b> (Casimiroa edulis).|$|E
5000|$|The tree grows best in {{tropical}} areas and {{in places that}} have a warm moist climate all year long, and is slightly less hardy than related <b>sapotes</b> such as the canistel and sapodilla (nispero). Within the United States, it grows well in South Florida {{as far north as}} Palm Beach County, and has survived brief freezes. [...] It prefers wet, slightly acidic soil with high organic content and may suffer from iron deficiency (chlorosis) in alkaline soils. A tree that has just been planted will be fragile and needs protection from wind and cold weather. Only light pruning is necessary and feeding should be frequent, but light.|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit of}} the abiu tree is edible and {{considered}} one of the best of the <b>sapotes</b> due to having the sweet caramel-like taste of sapodilla with a smoother texture. It is commonly eaten out of hand and, although in Colombia those eating the fruit this way are advised to grease their lips to keep the gummy latex from sticking, this hazard can be avoided by selecting fully ripe fruits and scooping out the flesh with a utensil. The tartness of a bit of added lime juice may enhance the flavor, especially when chilled. The melting sweet pulp of the abiu is also used to flavor ice cream and cut into yogurt for a light and delicious breakfast. The subtlety of the flavor limits its utility in more complex confections and salads. Abiu fruit is a significant source of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin A, and vitamin C.|$|R
50|$|Presa del bosqueis an {{important}} dam built between 1951 and 1954 by the Commission Federal de Electricidad. The Presa del Bosque is {{supplied by the}} Zitácuaro River (or San Juan Viejo), the San Isidro and {{a tributary of the}} Tuxpan River. It is located 1,742 meters above sea level. The dam has a capacity of 248 million cubic meters and belongs to the Miguel Alemán hydroelectric system. Its water is conducted to the regulatory dam of Colorines in the State of México. The water is used in hydroelectric plants in Ixtapatongo, Santa Barbara and Tingambato. It is located 5 kilometers from the south of the Zitácuaro beside the Zitácuaro-Huetamo Road. The main entrance is from the pueblo colonia linda vista and the dam is surrounded by the towns of La Y Griega, La Encarnacion, La Palma, Los <b>Sapotes</b> and other smaller communities. It is a tourist destination, and fishing, camping and other activities are permitted. The area is especially popular in Holy Week when the municipal authorities organize various activities.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the mamey <b>sapote,</b> white <b>sapote</b> is {{a member}} of the family Rutaceae, to which citrus belongs. The black <b>sapote</b> is also {{unrelated}} and is actually a species of persimmon. This confusion may be because [...] "sapote" [...] comes from the Nahuatl (Aztec) word tzapotl, used to describe all soft, sweet fruit. Commonly grown in Northern New South Wales, Australia, and often mistaken for a persimmon, although these two fruits are unrelated.|$|E
50|$|A general {{common name}} for plants {{of the genus}} is <b>sapote.</b> Not all sapotes are members of this genus or even family, however; many sapotes are in the family Sapotaceae, {{especially}} the genus Pouteria, and the black <b>sapote</b> {{is part of the}} Ebenaceae.|$|E

5000|$|Forestry {{and wood}} {{products}} {{are an important}} part of the economy for both the city and the rest of the municipality. However, deforestation has become a problem. According to municipal president Jose Luis Avila Franco, the development of tourism is important for the entity to take advantage of as is its natural resources as to lead it away from an overdependence on forestry. However, tourism only accounts for three percent of the economy currently. Industry accounts for about thirty percent of the economy and include the production of processed foods, metals, furniture and textiles. About twenty percent of the economy is based on agriculture and livestock. Crops include corn, wheat, tomatoes, fava beans, garlic, peaches, apples, quinces, capulins, maguey for pulque, avocado, apricots and <b>sapotes.</b> Livestock includes domestic fowl, cows, pigs, goats, horses, donkeys, mules, and bees. There are deposits of non-metallic minerals such as lime, clay, kaolin, sulfur and others. Most of the rest is accounted for by commerce. Ninety percent of commercial establishments are small and family owned. [...] However, in 2009 and 2010, the poor economy forced the closing of dozens of small businesses in the city center alone.|$|R
