A 1 K Zwick / Roell, used compression forces were 3, 3. 5 and 4 kN, in the case of mixtures of drugs 4 kN. The tablets made from the substance Prosolv EASYtab possessed a lower mechanical strength than those from Prosolv SMCC 90 and physical mixtures of Prosolv SMCC 90 with Explotab and Pruv. The disintegration time of tablets was markedly shorter {{in the case of the}} substance Prosolv EASYtab than in Prosolv SMCC 90, the shortest being in the tablets made from physical mixtures of substances.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a new fast-disintegrating tablet {{formulation}} containing 1 mg tacrolimus for sublingual application. First, solid dispersions containing tacrolimus (2. 5 %, 5 % and 10 % w/w) incorporated in Ac-Di-Sol®and carriers (inulin 1. 8 kDa and 4 kDa, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K 30) were prepared by freeze drying. Subsequently, a tablet formulation composed of a mixture of the solid dispersions, Ac-Di-Sol®, mannitol, Avicel®PH- 101 and <b>sodium</b> <b>stearyl</b> <b>fumarate</b> was optimized concerning drug load in the solid dispersions and the type of carrier. Tablet weight was kept constant at 75 mg by adjusting the amount of Avicel®PH- 101. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) results indicated the absence of the drug in the crystalline state, which was confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These results suggest that tacrolimus incorporated in all of the solid dispersions was fully amorphous. Dissolution of the tablets containing solid dispersions with a low drug load highly depends on the type of carrier and increased in the order: PVP K 30 <inulin 4 kDa <inulin 1. 8 kDa. Solid dispersions with a drug load of 10 % w/w incorporated in the carriers yielded optimal formulations. In addition, the physicochemical characteristics and the dissolution behavior of the tablet formulation containing inulin 1. 8 kDa-based solid dispersions with a drug load of 10 % w/w did not change after storage at 20 °C/ 45 %RH for 6 months indicating excellent storage stability. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc...|$|E

The optimized formula was compared to a ready ODTs system (PharmburstTM) and to marketed conventional tablet product (Tussilar®). The effect of storage under accelerated conditions (Temp: 40 ± 2 °C and relative humidity: 75 ± 5 %) and long term conditions (Temp: 25 ± 2 °C and relative humidity: 60 ± 5 %) were carried out for three months for some selected ODTs formulations. The obtained results revealed that disintegration time of the optimized ODTs formula (12. 5 sec. ± 1. 22 sec) was significantly (p-value < 0. 05) lower than disintegration time of the Pharmburst TM formula (14. 17 sec. ± 0. 75 sec). However, PharmburstTM based formula gave a higher dissolution rate than the optimized one. On the other hand, hardness of both two formulas wasn’t significantly different. Also, {{it was found that}} optimized formula had significantly (p-value < 0. 05) lower hardness and disintegration time with a higher dissolution rate than Tussilar® as well. Disintegration time of optimized formula was observed to be not significantly changed upon storage under long term and accelerated storage conditions up to three months. However, hardness was significantly (p-value < 0. 05) decreased from 4. 92 ± 0. 28 kp to 2. 37 ± 0. 54 kp under accelerated conditions and was stable under long term conditions for three months. ODTs formulations composed of dextrates and sorbitol showed softening when stored under accelerated conditions. However, dextrates based formula was stable when stored under long term conditions. Furthermore, sorbitol based formula was significantly affected (p-value < 0. 05) in regard to hardness (from 5. 55 ± 0. 32 kp to 2. 87 kp) and disintegration time (from 49. 33 ± 5. 85 sec to 15. 67 ± 1. 96 sec). Additionally, the formula containing mannitol was stable only when stored in long term conditions but a significant increase (p value < 0. 05) in hardness from 3. 91 ± 0. 32 kp to 5. 58 ± 0. 73 kp occurred when they were stored in accelerated conditions. Finally, it was concluded that dextromethorphan hydrobromide oral disintegrating tablets were developed using microcrystalline cellulose and croscarmellose sodium. These tablets provided low disintegration time, T 50 and high hardness that are acceptable for ODTs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate a mechanical dry powder coating approach to improve flow and fluidization of cohesive powder for producing direct compaction tablets. A fine cohesive ibuprofen powder (D₅₀= 25 µm) with a low-melting point (~ 76 °C) was coated with varying coating materials (magnesium stearate (MgSt), l-leucine, <b>sodium</b> <b>stearyl</b> <b>fumarate</b> (SSF) and silica-R 972) {{in order to examine}} the effects on flow and tabletability of the processed powders. Firstly, ibuprofen powder was dry coated via mechanofusion with between 0. 1 to 5 % (w/w) MgSt. ToF-SIMS demonstrated high degrees of coating coverage of MgSt on the particle surfaces. Robust tablets could be produced from the mechanofused powders and surprisingly the release rate of drug was not retarded. This is the first study to demonstrate such a single-step dry coating of ibuprofen with MgSt, with promising flow improvement and non-inhibited dissolution rate. Secondly, ibuprofen powder was dry coated with 1 % (w/w) of several materials including MgSt, l-leucine, SSF and silica-R 972 to screen potential coating materials and develop directly-compacted tablets of high-dose drug. FT 4 powder characterisation indicated coating of MgSt, l-leucine and silica-R 972 produced improvement in powder flow. ToF-SIMS demonstrated a near-complete layer on the drug particle surface after coating with MgSt and silica-R 972. The dissolution rates of all mechanofused powders were enhanced even with a hydrophobic material such as MgSt and silica. Such enhanced dissolution rate was attributed to the lesser agglomeration resulting from the reduced cohesion between the drug particles after mechanofusion. Thirdly, ibuprofen powders with various coating materials (MgSt, l-leucine and silica-R 972), PVP and superdisintegrant were co-processed using mechanofusion and then directly compacted into tablets to achieve a single-step tablet production. FT 4 indicated substantial improvement in powder flow. Robust tablets were produced from the co-processed ibuprofen and all excipient powders and the dissolution rates of these tablets were enhanced compared to control batch. However, the tablets made with silica-R 972 -mechanofused powders could not dinsitegrate and release under the same conditions. Finally, l-leucine has been found to have promising capacity of improving flowability of ibuprofen powder via mechanofusion. Such processed powder was able to be compacted into tablets directly. Therefore, a study was proposed to evaluate the influence of particle size of l-leucine (D₅₀ of 10 – 260 µm) on the flowability and tabletability of mechanofused ibuprofen powder. ToF-SIMS demonstrated an increasing trend of coverage level of l-leucine on the drug particle surface with reducing l-leucine particle size. Dissolution data of processed powders were fitted with multi-exponential equation models, representing dissolution from dispersed and agglomerated particle distributions. In conclusion, improvements in ibuprofen powder flowability via mechanofusion can result in a promising trend allowing tablets to be formed by direct compaction and enhanced dissolution rate of both powders and tablets. Surprisingly, coating of hydrophobic guest particles did promote dissolution of powders or corresponding tablets rather than retardance of dissolution rates. Multi-exponential modelling indicated that such improvements in the dissolution performance were attributed to the reduction in agglomerate strength caused by decreasing powder intrinsic cohesion after surface modification...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharm.)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{most widely}} used {{lubricant}} in the pharmaceutical industry is probably magnesium stearate. Magnesium stearate exhibits its lubricating properties by forming a film of low shear strength between the die wall and the compact, thus reducing the friction (Banker & Anderson, 1986 : 306). It also exhibits anti-adhesive and flow enhancement properties by preventing tablets from sticking to the die wall and punch faces and ensuring uniformity of tablets. Besides these advantageous properties, the lubricant forms a hydrophobic film around the carrier particles which can negatively affect the tablet properties such as crushing strength, disintegration time, friability and dissolution (Bolhuis et al., 1975 : 324; Levy & Gumtow, 1963 : 1142). Due to the deleterious effects on the tablet properties, lubricant concentrations must be restricted to an absolute minimum. These effects are known to increase with prolonged mixing, and in practice one tries to keep the lubricant mixing time as short as possible (Ragnarsson et al., 1979 : 130). It {{has been shown that}} the die wall film of magnesium stearate is resistant to wearing off and the lubricating effect remains for several compactions when an unlubricated granulation is added to a lubricated die (Holzer & Sjogren, 1981 b: 276). The lubricant film around the particles is formed during the final mixing, while the film at the die wall is formed during the compaction. This implicates that the lubricant is mixed for shorter (mixing) times with the other excipients in the formulation. <b>Sodium</b> <b>stearyl</b> <b>fumarate</b> (Pruv®) has been suggested as a suitable lubricant in tableting (Mendell, 2002 : 5) and it is claimed not to have the disadvantages of magnesium stearate in respect of tablet strength, disintegration and dissolution (Lindberg, 1972 : 213). These properties could prove advantageous regarding tablet strength as well as drug release properties (especially for immediate release tablet formulations). Since the primary function of lubricants is the reduction of friction, it was this property that provided the challenge that was circumvented in this study. The addition of the sparingly water-soluble, hydrophobic drug, furosemide, perplexed the formulation of tablets, however, provided a mode of evaluation of the effects of formulation variables on tracer substance dissolution behaviour. Systematic evaluations of various commercially available excipients were investigated to determine their effects on the physical tablet properties as well as on tracer dissolution. Magnesium stearate or Pruv® was incorporated into Avicel® PH- 200, Emcompress® and Tablettose® fillers/binders. Mixing time was varied between 1 and 16 minutes and mixing speed between 33 and 97 rpm under certain specified testing environments in a Turbula® mixer. Compression was done with a Manesty® F 3 single station tablet press with biconcave punches (10 mm). Evaluation on the powder and the compressed formulation was done. The aim was to evaluate and compare the lubricant, glidant and antiadherent properties of magnesium stearate and Pruv®, as well as the effect both had on tablet properties (crushing strength, friability and disintegration) and drug release. It was found that magnesium stearate had superior glidant properties compared to its counterpart {{as a result of its}} flatter particle shape and larger specific surface area. Lubricant concentrations below 0. 5 % w/w gave optimum glidancy for both lubricants and mixing times between 4 and 8 minutes was sufficient to optimize this glidant effect. Tablet strength decreased when lubricant concentration increased, due to less interparticulate binding surface between the carrier particles. This decrease subsided when lubrication surpassed the 1. 5 % w/w concentration level. Mixing, however, had the opposite effect on Pruv® than on magnesium stearate, since Pruv® increased the tablet strength with continuous mixing. Disintegration and dissolution deteriorated with the addition of magnesium stearate and Pruv®. This was due to the hydrophobic nature of magnesium stearate and increase in tablet strength observed with Pruv®. The evaluation of the extent of drug release (AUC) and rate of release (DR|) indicated of an average increase of 50 % in drug release in formulations with Pruv® compared to magnesium stearate as lubricant. Magnesium stearate had superior lubricant and antiadherent properties as opposed to Pruv® and optimum lubricant efficiency was experienced at low concentrations (< 1 % w/w) and low mixing times (< 4 minutes). The apparatus and methods for lubricant evaluation were newly developed and gave accurate, repeatable measurements. Master...|$|E
