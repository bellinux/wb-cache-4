5|$|Initially, {{the death}} of Kirchner caused a power vacuum, as Cristina Kirchner had ruled so far as a figurehead, while Néstor Kirchner still managed the {{government}}. <b>She</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> style of the government making it more authoritarian, and more critical of the U.S.. She broke with allies of her husband, such as the union leader Hugo Moyano, and increased the political clout of the youth wing La Cámpora instead. She also relied on her public image more than her husband had. The popularity of the Kirchners {{had been in a}} decline at the time of Néstor's death, but after being widowed, Cristina Kirchner's popularity increased greatly. As a result, she won the reelection in the 2011 general elections by a landslide.|$|E

5|$|Mauricio Macri, {{mayor of}} Buenos Aires, was elected {{president}} in the 2015 presidential elections, defeating the Kirchnerite candidate Daniel Scioli in a ballotage. During the transition period, Macri reported that Kirchner was creating obstacles and problems {{in an attempt to}} undermine his government. <b>She</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> 2016 budget, increasing spending in several areas (even the broadcasting of soccer matches), despite the huge fiscal deficit. A number of Kirchnerite officials refused to resign their offices to allow Macri to appoint his own people. Even the handover ceremony became controversial, as Kirchner refused to attend it. It was {{the first time since the}} end of military rule in 1983 that the outgoing president did not hand over power to the incoming one.|$|E
5|$|Ten months later, {{she became}} editor of US Vogue. Under Mirabella, {{it had become}} more focused on lifestyles {{as a whole and}} less on fashion. Industry {{insiders}} worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of Elle. After making sweeping changes in staff, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit).|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the money}} she gave up, her family stayed poor because her salary was only 207 RMB, which was equal to 20 dollars a month. And her {{research}} and work place was very poor. However, she never gave up. After coming back to China, she began working as soon as possible. In 1957, her workplace-Institute of Semiconductor CAS—finished making the first mono-crystalline germanium in China. By virtue of the working experience in Sylvania Company, she knew all the processes in making the mono-crystalline silicon. However she could not get any equipment because of embargoes from other countries. So <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> process and made the first mono-crystalline silicon in China in 1958. China became the third country to make mono-crystalline silicon by itself. In 1962, she designed the mono-crystal furnace. This furnace had been merchandized to many countries. In the same year, she made the first mono-crystalline gallium arsenide in China. Lanying Lin’s gallium arsenide reached the highest mobility {{at that time in}} the whole world.|$|E

The video alternated between tomboy shots and those of a sexier Madonna with a more toned and muscular body, cropped platinum blonde hair, and figure-revealing clothing, consisting of a 1960s-style black bustier top and capri pants.|$|E
500|$|Energized by {{the success}} of The Tale of Peter Rabbit in 1902, Potter {{considered}} expanding the frog tale and bought back her drawings and the publisher's printer's blocks. She wrote her editor Norman Warne, [...] "I should like to do Mr. Jeremy Fisher... I think I can make something of him". The tale was set aside while Potter and Warne developed other projects, but in 1905 he approved the frog tale. As Potter biographer Daphne Kutzner writes of Potter's [...] illustrations for Jeremy: [...] "When she finally did the illustrations for the book, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> original background from the River Tay in Scotland to Eswaithe Water in the Lakes.

500|$|According to {{spokesperson}} Liz Rosenberg, Madonna considered titling {{the album}} Mantra, which {{she thought was}} a [...] "really cool title". However, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> title to Ray of Light, as her albums were always titled {{after one of the}} songs from that album. The artwork was shot by Peruvian photographer Mario Testino on November 28, 1997 in a studio in Golden Beach, Florida. They had previously collaborated for a Versace brand collection in 1995. Madonna was impressed with the natural look Testino had captured, so she booked him again for the album's photoshoot. He recalled, [...] "At 2pm she said, 'OK, I'm tired. We're done'. And I said, 'But I don't have the pictures yet'. She said, 'You're working for me and I say we're done'. I said, 'No, we carry on'. The picture she used on the cover came after that".|$|E
500|$|Burger's Daughter took Gordimer {{four years}} to write, {{starting}} {{from a handful of}} what she called [...] "very scrappy notes", [...] "half sentences" [...] and [...] "little snatches of dialogue". Collecting information for the novel was difficult because at the time little was known about South African communists. Gordimer relied on clandestine books and documents given to her by confidants, and her own experiences of living in South Africa. Once she got going, she said, writing the book became an [...] "organic process". The Soweto riots in 1976 happened while she was working on the book, and <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> plot to incorporate the uprising. Gordimer explained that [...] "Rosa would have come back to South Africa; that was inevitable", but [...] "here would have been a different ending". During those four years she also wrote two non-fiction articles to take breaks from working on the novel.|$|E
500|$|The novel's {{tone and}} {{structure}} place {{it within the}} serious literary tradition for which Kostova was aiming. For example, the alternating timelines are suggestive of A. S.

Although many reviewers compared The Historian to Dan Brown's historical thriller The Da Vinci Code (2003), Kostova has said her book [...] "is part of a tradition where literary craft and experiments in form are all as important as action...the only overlap is this idea of people searching for something in history. I'm still surprised when people make this comparison, I'm very grateful my publisher has never pushed it." [...] Moreover, the only real historical personage in her novel is Vlad Țepeș and <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> name of some locations [...] "fearing some readers might confuse fantasy and reality, as they have with Brown's novels".|$|E

500|$|Angelou has {{recognized}} {{that there are}} fictional aspects to her books, and that she tends to [...] "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth". [...] Angelou discussed her writing process with Plimpton, and when asked if <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> truth to improve her story, she admitted that she had. [...] She stated, [...] "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite {{of three or four}} people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about." [...] Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she has used these facts to make an impact with the reader. As Hagen states, [...] "One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work". Hagen also states that Angelou [...] "fictionalizes, to enhance interest". [...] For example, Angelou uses the first-person narrative voice customary with autobiographies, told {{from the perspective of a}} child that is [...] "artfully recreated by an adult narrator".|$|E
500|$|Ellsworth Monkton Toohey is Roark's antagonist. He is Rand's {{personification}} of evilthe most active and self-aware villain {{in any of}} her novels. Toohey is a socialist, and represents the spirit of collectivism more generally. He styles himself as representative of {{the will of the}} masses, but his actual desire is for power over others. He controls individual victims by destroying their sense of self-worth, and seeks broader power (over [...] "the world", as he declares to Keating in a moment of candor) by promoting the ideals of ethical altruism and a rigorous egalitarianism that treats all people and achievements as equally valuable. Rand used her memory of the British democratic socialist Harold Laski to help her imagine what Toohey would do in a given situation. She attended a New York lecture by Laski as part of gathering material for the novel, following which <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> physical appearance of the character to be similar to that of Laski. New York intellectuals Lewis Mumford and Clifton Fadiman also helped inspire the character.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{recognizes that}} there are fictional aspects to all her books, {{although}} there is less fictionalization in Traveling Shoes than in her previous autobiographies. [...] Her approach parallels the conventions of many African-American autobiographies written during the abolitionist period in the US, when truth was often censored for purposes of self-protection. [...] Hagen places Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but insists that Angelou has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form. [...] Journalist George Plimpton asked her in a 1998 interview if <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> truth to improve her story; she stated, [...] "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite {{of three or four}} people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about". [...] Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she fictionalizes them to make an impact and to enhance her readers' interest. [...] Angelou's long-time editor, Robert Loomis stated that she could have rewritten any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader.|$|E
