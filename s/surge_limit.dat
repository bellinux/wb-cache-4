40|$|An {{investigation}} {{to increase the}} compressor surge-limit pressure ratio of the XJ 40 -WE- 6 turbojet engine at high equivalent speeds was conducted at the NACA Lewis altitude wind tunnel. This report evaluates the compressor modifications which were restricted to (1) twisting rotor blades (in place) to change blade section angles and (2) inserting new stator diaphragms with different blade angles. Such configuration changes could be incorporated quickly and easily in existing engines at overhaul depots. It was found that slight improvements in the compressor <b>surge</b> <b>limit</b> were possible by compressor blade adjustment. However, some of the modifications also reduced the engine air flow and hence penalized the thrust. The use of a mixer assembly at the compressor outlet improved the <b>surge</b> <b>limit</b> with no appreciable thrust penalty...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{is to develop a}} method for {{modelling}} centrifugal compressor surge in the presence of pressure pulsations in gas transmission lines, and examine the effects of pulsation amplitude and frequency on centrifugal compressor operating stability. Anecdotal field evidence suggests that it is possible for a centrifugal compressor to enter surge when pressure pulsations are present, even in the case where the centrifugal compressor would otherwise operate at a stable point. In such a situation it has been concluded that the instability results from the pulsations. The method used for the model of the piping system is a finite element model of the pipe acoustics, with a reciprocating compressor model and a centrifugal compressor model as boundary conditions. The details of these models and the methods for coupling them are a large portion of this work. The combined centrifugal compressor and piping acoustic model are used in a variety of numerical experiments investigating the effect of pulsation amplitude and frequency on the operating point of the centrifugal compressor. The results of the numerical experiments show that piping system acoustic properties have a strong effect on pulsation amplitude, and pulsations have a strong effect on compressor operating point. The pulsations cause an oscillation in operating point away from the compressor?s steady state operating point. The effect is stronger as pulsation amplitude increases and as pulsation frequency approaches the natural frequency of the piping system. If the pulsations are strong enough, they can force the centrifugal compressor operating point over the <b>surge</b> <b>limit,</b> and then back into the stable operating region before the compressor enters a surge cycle. Numerical experiments show that the pulsations must push the centrifugal compressor over the <b>surge</b> <b>limit</b> and remain there long enough, if a surge cycle is to develop. Therefore, it is concluded that pulsations can cause a centrifugal compressor to cross the <b>surge</b> <b>limit,</b> and that larger pulsations will indeed cause surge when the operating point is across the <b>surge</b> <b>limit</b> for long enough...|$|E

40|$|Surge {{is a limit}} cycle {{oscillation}} in {{the pressure}} rise acid mass flow across an axial flow compressor. The generation of surge oscillations in axial flow compressors is investigated by a bifurcation analysis of the Moore-Greitzer model. The work reported in this paper {{is an extension of}} previous work by McCaughan which distinguished between deep surge and classic surge. In the present study, both deep surge and classic <b>surge</b> <b>limit</b> cycles are computed by using a continuation algorithm. The bifurcation mechanisms for the onset and termination of deep surge and classic surge: oscillations are discovered. It is found that the generation of deep surge is independent of the presence of classic surge. Classic <b>surge</b> <b>limit</b> cycles originate at a Hopf bifurcation and are found to terminate at a saddle loop. The occurrence of stable classic surge oscillations depends on the relative locations of the Hopf bifurcation point and the saddle loop. By modeling the effect of rotational disturbances at the compressor inlet as a perturbation to the compressor characteristic, it is shown that the rotational disturbance introduced by preswirl, inlet guide vanes, or air injection, can be used to manipulate the location of the bifurcation points so as to avoid stable classic surge...|$|E

A centrifugal compressor has been modified in order to add a swirl generator device upstream the impeller. The incidence values of blades can vary from 0 ° (no pre‐swirl) to ± 90 °. The variation of the stator blades incidence has several main consequences: to allow a flow rate adjustment with a good efficiency conservation, to increase the angular velocity with a constant shaft power, to produce a displacement of the <b>surge</b> line <b>limit.</b> In this paper, the results of experimental studies are presented to analyze the surge line {{and the intensity of}} unsteady phenomena when the compressor works in its surge area...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTurbo {{charging}} {{is a way}} for car {{manufacturers to}} meet the major challenge of fuel economyand reduction of the CO 2 emissions. The aim is to replace current engines with a downsized engine in order to improve its fuel consumption. This requires higher specific power and torque especially at very low engine speed. The wide functioning area required for this technique leads to an operation of compressors at low air flow rate and high compression ratio characterised by the occurrence of surge phenomenon. On the engine, it can be intensified by the fuel flow rate pulses consecutive to air flow rate pulses leading to torque oscillations. In fact, surge is an aerodynamic instability that affects both the compressor and its associated network which results in strong pressure and mass flow rate oscillations describing a surge cycle in the compressor map. The <b>surge</b> <b>limit</b> of a centrifugal compressor and its frequency are highly dependant on the geometrical configuration of its associated network.

The over-all {{performance of}} this configuration was compared with that of the compressor with the original blade angles. The peak efficiency was increased at all speeds below design and the weight flow was higher at speeds below 80 percent of design, the same at 80 percent of design, and lower at speeds abovce 80 percent of design. The maximum reduction in weight flow occurred at design speed. The <b>surge</b> <b>limit</b> line was higher at speeds between 75 and 90 percent of design when presented on a pressure ratio against weight flow basis. The second configuration was the same as the first with the exception that the second-, third-, and fourth-stage stator blade angles were the same as in the compressor with the original blade angles. A comparison of the performance of this configuration with that of the compressor with the original blade angles showed the same general trends of changes in performance as the first configuration. Comparisons were made of compressor configurations to show the effects upon the performance of decreased loading in the inlet stages. Below 75 percent of design speed, decreased loading results in increased weight flow and peak efficiency; above 80 percent of design speed, decreased loading in the inlet stages results in decreased weight flow and small changes in peak efficiencies. Between 75 and 90 percent of design the changes in surge weight flow and pressure ratio were such that the <b>surge</b> <b>limit</b> line was raised with decreased loading in the inlet stages when presented as pressure ratio against weight flow...|$|E

Employing compressible Large Eddy Simulations (LES), their generation mechanisms are exposed. Toward low mass-flow rate operating conditions, flow reversal over the blade tips (generated {{by the back}} pressure) causes an inflection point of the inlet flow profile. There, a shear-layer induces vortical structures circulating at the compressor inlet. Traces of these flow structures are observed until far downstream in the radial diffuser. The tip leakage flow exhibits angular momentum imparted by the impeller, which deteriorates the incidence angles at the blade tips through an over imposed swirling component to the incoming flow. We show that the impeller is incapable to maintain constant efficiency at surge operating conditions due to the extreme alteration of the incidence angle. This induces unsteady flow momentum transfer downstream, which is reflected as compression wave at the compressor outlet traveling toward the impeller. There, the pressure oscillations govern the tip leakage flow and hence, the incidence angles at the impeller.
