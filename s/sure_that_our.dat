Edwards served as the director, his first such credit for the series. In developing Fringe, the co-creators {{did not want to}} make the series too serialized, as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams' television series Alias. They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content, and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and [...] for inspiration. Kurztman explained, [...] "While we make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> episodes are self-contained – have a beginning, a middle, and an end – the character stories can be serialized. They don't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show." [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] was Fringes first regular episode, and some journalists viewed it {{as an example of how}} the series would be structured.|$|E

2500|$|On September 17, Allen and Webb {{appeared}} on NBC's Meet the Press for a debate. Part of the program's debate {{series on the}} midterm elections, the debate heavily discussed both the original Gulf War and the present war in Iraq. Host Tim Russert questioned Webb about his initial support for Allen's 2000 U.S. Senate run, {{as well as what}} led him to later oppose Allen. Russert also questioned Allen about a remark Webb made concerning his interactions with Allen {{at the start of the}} Iraq conflict. Webb asserted that he approached Allen regarding U.S. involvement in the region and cautioned against military action. Webb also claimed that Allen responded to this by saying [...] "You’re asking me to be disloyal to the president." [...] After being questioned on this by Russert, Allen clarified by saying [...] "No, it’s loyalty to this country, and making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> country is unified in, in this, in this effort to disarm Saddam Hussein. That was the point." [...] Allen also addressed what he saw as a weakness in Webb, claiming his opponent wanted to withdraw from Iraq. Webb clarified his belief that the U.S. has a commitment to ensure Iraq is stable before withdrawing, but also reasserted that a permanent U.S. presence in Iraq is not an option.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply in the same kind of position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important for us to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that we need to have a secure source of food. So I believe in supports that will allow us to do that." ...|$|E

It shows up as a tendency for correlations to go negative, and such standardizations are best avoided if possible.
