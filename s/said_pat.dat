500|$|Pat Nixon {{held the}} record as the most-{{traveled}} First Lady until her record was surpassed by Hillary Clinton. In President Nixon's first term, Pat traveled to 39 of 50 states, {{and in the}} first year alone, she shook hands with {{a quarter of a million}} people. She undertook many missions of goodwill to foreign nations as well. Her first foreign trip took in Guam, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Romania, and England. On such trips, Pat refused to be serviced by an entourage, feeling that they were an unnecessary barrier and a burden for taxpayers. Soon after, during a trip to South Vietnam, Pat became the first First Lady to enter a combat zone. She had tea with the wife of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu in a palace, visited an orphanage, and lifted off in an open-door helicopter—armed by military guards with machine guns—to witness U.S. troops fighting in a jungle below. She would later admit to experiencing a [...] "moment of fear going into a battle zone", because, as author and historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted, [...] "Pat Nixon was literally in a line of fire." [...] She later visited an army hospital, where, for two hours, she walked through the wards and spoke with each wounded patient. The First Lady of South Vietnam, Madame Thieu, <b>said</b> <b>Pat</b> Nixon's trip [...] "intensified our morale".|$|E

6000|$|... "And that's thrue for you, Captain," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Pat,</b> {{grinning}} in his perplexity, for he didn't {{know whether}} to take what Ussher said for a joke or not.|$|E
6000|$|... "That wouldn't be {{any place}} for you, young man," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>patting</b> the dog's head. [...] "We'll sleep {{out of doors}} rather than have you scared half to death!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you really}} {{thought we had}} {{forgotten}} you because we were insane enough to stop writing at that villain's request?" [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>patting</b> Kate's pale cheeks tenderly and kissing her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} a good feed at Saint Amboise," [...] Pierre <b>said,</b> <b>patting</b> its neck; [...] "and beyond that, {{there will be no}} occasion, I hope, for such another day's work." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{very likely}} would unless your leg was pretty well protected. A bear's bones {{are not so}} brittle and do not break easily, but once that thing has got a grip it's there to stay," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Pat.</b>|$|E
