5|$|According to Constantine VII, the Slavs rose {{up again}} in the early 840s, but were {{defeated}} by strategos Theoktistos Bryennios. In the south, the two tribes of the Ezeritai and Melingoi held out longer. They were eventually <b>subdued</b> and forced to pay heavy tribute, but retained their autonomy. These two tribes rose up again a century later, in 921. Again they were quickly <b>subdued,</b> this time by the strategos Krenites Arotras, but managed to remain autonomous and retain their distinct identity until well into Frankish times.|$|E

We {{are attempting}} to create two other methods to use <b>Subdue.</b> The Web interface allows users to access programs of <b>Subdue</b> as a service, where they can submit their jobs.

The <b>Subdue</b> GUI is an easy-to-use program that allows users to use <b>Subdue</b> programs through a graphical user interface created with Java Swing. This paper describes these systems. This is a basic version, and enhancements can be done as the GUI or <b>Subdue</b> evolves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{an approach to}} learning patterns in relational data represented as a graph. The approach, implemented in the <b>Subdue</b> system, searches for patterns that maximally compress the input graph. <b>Subdue</b> {{can be used for}} supervised learning, as well as unsupervised pattern discovery and clustering. We apply <b>Subdue</b> in domains related to homeland security and social network analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} interesting and repetitive substructures is an essential component to discovering knowledge in structural data. We describe {{a new version of}} our <b>Subdue</b> substructure discovery system based on the minimum description length principle. The <b>Subdue</b> system discovers substructures that compress the original data and represent structural concepts in the data. By replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of <b>Subdue</b> produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the data. <b>Subdue</b> uses a computationally-bounded inexact graph match that identi es similar, but not identical, instances of a substructure and nds an approximate measure of closeness of two substructures when under computational constraints. In addition to the minimum description length principle, other background knowledge can be used by <b>Subdue</b> to guide the search towards more appropriate substructures. Experiments in avariety of domains demonstrate <b>Subdue's</b> ability to nd substructures capable of compressing the original data and to discover structural concepts important to the domain. 1...|$|R

40|$|Because many {{databases}} contain {{or can be}} {{embellished with}} structural information, a method for identifying interesting and repetitive substructures is an essential component to discovering knowledge in such databases. This paper describes the <b>Subdue</b> system, which uses the minimum description length (MDL) principle to discover substructures that compress the database and represent structural concepts in the data. By replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of <b>Subdue</b> produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the data. Inclusion of background knowledge guides <b>Subdue</b> toward appropriate substructures for a particular domain or discovery goal, {{and the use of}} an inexact graph match allows a controlled amount of deviations in the instance of a substructure concept. We describe the application of <b>Subdue</b> to a variety of domains. We also discuss approaches to combining <b>Subdue</b> with non-structural discovery systems...|$|R

5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The <b>subdued</b> morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E
5|$|Few parasites and predators are {{effective}} for biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp {{to deliver a}} second sting into the cockroach's brain. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow, where an egg is laid on it. The wasp larva feeds on the <b>subdued</b> living cockroach.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{generate}} insights about the dif-ferences between graph-based and logic-based approaches to multi-relational data mining by performing a case study of graph-based system, <b>Subdue</b> and the inductive logic pro-gramming system, CProgol. We identify three key factors for comparing graph-based and logic-based multi-relational data mining; namely, the ability to discover structurally large concepts, the ability to discover semantically compli-cated concepts and the ability to eectively utilize back-ground knowledge. We perform an experimental comparison of <b>Subdue</b> and CProgol on the Mutagenesis domain and var-ious articially generated Bongard problems. Experimental results indicate that <b>Subdue</b> can signicantly outperform CProgol while discovering structurally large multi-relational concepts. It is also observed that CProgol is better at learn-ing semantically complicated concepts and it tends to use background knowledge more eectively than <b>Subdue.</b> 1...|$|R
