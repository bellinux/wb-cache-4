Greatly outnumbered, both battalions {{suffered}} heavy casualties but with the addition of reinforcements from the Royal Irish Regiment, from the divisional reserve and fire support from the divisional artillery, they managed to hold the bridges. The Germans expanded their attack, assaulting the British defences along the <b>straight</b> <b>reach</b> of the canal {{to the west of the}} salient. The Germans used the cover of fir plantations that lined the northern side of the canal and advanced to within a few hundred yards of the canal, to rake the British with machine-gun and rifle fire. The German attack fell particularly heavily on the 1st Battalion, Royal West Kent Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers, which despite many casualties, repulsed the Germans throughout the day.|$|E

There have been two distinct approaches to the study and prediction of bank erosion rates in natural streams.

This thesis aims to determine if river segments can be divided into <b>straight</b> <b>reaches</b> and curved reaches with different bank erosion prediction approaches applied to each as well as investigating the role of bank roughness element size and spacing in bank erosion.

We pass a considerable church on the left, St. Pietro, and a little square opposite to it with a few acacia trees, and then find our boat suddenly seized by a strong green eddy, and whirled into the tide-way of one of the main channels of the lagoon, which divides the town of Murano into two parts by a deep stream some fifty yards over, crossed only by one wooden bridge. We let ourselves drift some way down the current, looking at the low line of cottages on the other side of it, hardly knowing if there be more cheerfulness or melancholy in the way the sunshine glows on their ruinous but whitewashed walls, and sparkles on the rushing of the green water by the grass-grown quay. It needs a strong stroke of the oar to bring us into the mouth of another quiet canal on the farther side of the tide-way, and we are still somewhat giddy when we run the head of the gondola into the sand on the left-hand side of this more sluggish stream, and land under the east end of the Church of San Donato, the [...] "Matrice" [...] or [...] "Mother" [...] Church of Murano.|$|E

The river here opened into a broad and <b>straight</b> <b>reach</b> of great length, which we bounded merrily over before a smacking breeze, with a devil-may-care look in our faces, and our boat a white bone in its mouth, and a speed which greatly astonished some scow boatmen whom we met. The wind in the horizon rolled like a flood over valley and plain, and every tree bent to the blast, and the mountains like school-boys turned their cheeks to it. They were great and current motions, the flowing sail, the running stream, the waving tree, the roving wind. The north-wind stepped readily into the harness which we had provided, and pulled us along with good will. Sometimes we sailed as gently and steadily as the clouds overhead, watching the receding shores and the motions of our sail; the play of its pulse so like our own lives, so thin and yet so full of life, so noiseless when it labored hardest, so noisy and impatient when least effective; now bending to some generous impulse of the breeze, and then fluttering and flapping with a kind of human suspense. It was the scale on which the varying temperature of distant atmospheres was graduated, and it was some attraction for us that the breeze it played with had been out of doors so long. Thus we sailed, not being able to fly, but as next best, making a long furrow in the fields of the Merrimack toward our home, with our wings spread, but never lifting our heel from the watery trench; gracefully ploughing homeward with our brisk and willing team, wind and stream, pulling together, the former yet a wild steer, yoked to his more sedate fellow.

Sixty-nine participants (16 males and 53 females) participated in the experiment. Participants observed either a social or anti-social word, to enhance or suppress social attitudes respectively. Then they viewed a film of a model perform either an exaggerated or <b>straight</b> <b>reach</b> towards a target. After observing the action, participants executed a straight reach-to-grasp action towards their own target. Participants also completed the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI). It was hypothesised that the participants’ reach will be more similar to the models reach after observing a curved reach {{as opposed to a}} <b>straight</b> <b>reach.</b> Furthermore, when participants were primed with pro-social attitudes and observed an exaggerated reach their reach height would be greater compared to when they were primed with anti-social words. In relation to personality, it was hypothesised that participants who scored high on the EQ would imitate the models reach more compared to those who scored low on the EQ. Those who scored high on the NPI were expected to imitate the models reach less than those who scored low on the NPI. Results show that participants reach was higher after observing an exaggerated reach compared to a <b>straight</b> <b>reach.</b> However this was only evident in participants who scored high on the EQ. Social attitudes did not produce the hypothesised results; however when low EQ scorers were primed with anti-social words their reach was higher compared to when they were primed with pro-social words.

After the model completed her movement participants were instructed to execute a <b>straight</b> <b>reach</b> to grasp the target object. Prior to the video of the model participants’ social attitudes were primed using either non-social or pro-social images.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pools {{have been}} defined as {{topographic}} lows along a longitudinal stream profile and riffles are topographic highs. Past research has shown pools and riffles are the fundamental bed forms in meandering streams and that channel cross sections in meandering channels exhibit varying degrees of asymmetry that coincide with these bed form features. Two indices that identify pool and riffle bed forms are the bed differencing technique (bdt) developed by O'Neill and Abrahams (1984) and the areal difference asymmetry index (A') (Knighton. 1981). The purpose {{of this research was}} to use these indices to objectively identify pools and riffles in three reaches of a human-modified stream. Geomorphological data were collected in two meandering reaches and one <b>straight</b> <b>reach</b> of the East Branch ofCazenovia Creek, NY. Between 16 and 19 cross sections were surveyed in each reach during summer low flow conditions. The bdt identified more bed forms in the meandering reaches versus the straight channelized reach (six and two bed forms, respectively). Results from the asymmetry ' analysis indicated that more cross sections in the two meandering reaches were asymmetrical (71 and 73 % of the cross sections) versus 47 % of the cross sections being asymmetrical in the <b>straight</b> <b>reach.</b> Moreover, asymmetrical cross sections generally corresponded with pool bed forms identified by the bdt and symmetrical cross sections corresponded with riffle bed forms identified hy the bdt.
