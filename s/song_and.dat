5|$|Han Chinese power {{during the}} tumultuous post-Tang era was {{represented}} by the Song dynasty (9601279), which completed its unification of the Chinese states with the conquest of Wuyue in 971. Turning to the north after this victory, in 979 the Song eliminated the Northern Han, ultimate successors to the Later Jin, but were unable to take the Sixteen Prefectures from the Liao dynasty. As a result of Song's military aggression, relations between the <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> Liao remained tense and hostile. One of the battlegrounds in the Song–Liao War was the Great Wall Gap (長城口), so named because the southern Yan wall of the Warring States period crossed the Juma River here into Liao territory. The Great Wall Gap saw action in 979, 988989, and 1004, and a Song fortress was built there in 980. Intermittent wars between the <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> the Liao lasted until January 1005, when a truce was called {{and led to the}} Treaty of Chanyuan. This agreement, among other things, required the Song to pay tribute to the Liao, recognized the <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> Liao as equals, and demarcated the Song–Liao border, the course of which became more clearly defined in a series of subsequent bilateral agreements. Several stretches of the old Great Walls, including the Northern Qi Inner Wall near the Hengshan mountain range, became the border between the <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> the Liao.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> <b>song</b> lyrics in the EFL {{classroom}} in Norway. The thesis is a qualitative research project, discussing six semi-structured interviews with teachers from three different schools; a Steiner school, an international school and a public lower secondary school. The research question {{is divided into three}} main sub- questions. The first concern is whether <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> <b>song</b> lyrics are used in the EFL classroom at all. The second deals with the way in which <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> <b>song</b> lyrics are being used. This sub- question has been investigated with a focus on methods the teachers use in their EFL classrooms, what topics they teach with {{the use of}} <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> <b>song</b> lyrics in the English curriculum, and what kind of actual classroom exercises the teachers use in their EFL classroom linked to <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> <b>song</b> lyrics. The discussion on how <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> <b>song</b> lyrics can be used in the three main areas of the English curriculum in Norway focus on the different the ways of using <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> <b>song</b> lyrics within the three fields of grammar, culture and literature. The third and final part of the research question is why <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> <b>song</b> lyrics should be used in the classroom. This question will not be objectively answered, but previous research and the results of the data gathered in this research will help support the idea that <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> <b>song</b> lyrics should be used. This includes the general theoretical benefits of using such tools in discussion with the justifications that the participants offer. Disadvantages of the use of <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> <b>song</b> lyrics is discussed with a special focus on how teachers who are inexperienced with the use of them sometimes find <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> <b>song</b> lyrics to be a deviation from the curriculum and a distraction from other forms of education. The main findings in the research show differences between the three pairs of teachers from the three different schools, but the reasons for the differences between the schools might lie deeper than just the school type. The focus in the different types of schools make this research different from other research within the field...|$|R
