High autoclaving temperature (145 °C) and long <b>storing</b> <b>time</b> (72 h) showed beneficial impacts on RS formation. Significant decreases {{were observed in}} all RVA viscosities of RS preparations as the autoclaving temperature increased. There was significant effect of storage time on all RVA parameters of RS preparations within each autoclaving temperature. The water binding values of RS preparations autoclaved at 145 °C were {{higher than those of}} the samples autoclaved at 140 °C. RS preparations had approximately 2 -fold higher emulsion capacity values than the native starch. Thermal enthalpy (ΔH) values of RS preparations were lower than those of native starch.

30|$|Timing {{information}} between {{network nodes}} can be exchanged either using time-stamped packets at the MAC layer or by estimating arrival times of neighboring nodes' physical layer pulse signals.

In each iteration of the SO-DCTS algorithm, each node processes and decodes the time-stamped message from its neighbors or estimates the arrival time of its neighbors' pulse signals. Each node then updates its local clock using the weighted average of the current time differences between itself and its neighboring nodes as well as <b>stored</b> <b>time</b> differences from the previous iteration of the algorithm. It should be noted that in the SO-DCTS algorithm, each node needs to store time information from its neighbor nodes for both the previous and current iterations; this is in contrast to the FO-DCTS approach where only the current time information is processed in the current iteration.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this empirical simulation study was {{to evaluate the use}} of a combination of semen and embryos in the creation of gene banks for reconstruction of an extinct breed. Such an approach was compared for banks with varying proportions of embryos {{on the basis of the}} amount of the material to be <b>stored,</b> <b>time</b> for reconstruction, maintenance of genetic variability, and probability of failure during reconstruction. Four types of populations were simulated, based on reproductive rate: single offspring, twinning, enhanced reproduction, and litter bearing. Reconstruction was simulated for banks consisting of different combinations of semen and reduced numbers of embryos (expressed as a percentage of the material needed for a bank containing exclusively embryos and ranging from 10 to 90 %). The use of a combination of semen and embryos increased the number of insemination cycles needed for reconstruction and the level of genetic relatedness in the reconstructed population. The risk for extinction was unacceptably high when a very low proportion of embryos ($<$[*] 20 %) was used. However, combining semen with embryos could decrease costs, allowing for the conservation of more breeds, and specific strategies for semen use could decrease the level of relationships in the reconstructed breed...|$|E
40|$|Aim. : This {{paper is}} a report of {{a study of the}} meaning of living alone from the {{perspective}} of older people with dementia. Background. : Risks and problems experienced by older women living alone have been investigated mostly through quantitative research. Balancing their safety and autonomy is a serious international community care dilemma. Older people 2 ̆ 7 s perspectives have been muted in qualitative research on living alone with dementia. Method. : Using an interpretive phenomenological approach and van Manen 2 ̆ 7 s method, 14 interviews were conducted in Ontario, Canada from January 2004 to April 2005 with eight older women diagnosed with Alzheimer disease or a related dementia. Findings. : The theme holding back time expressed the temporal meaning of living alone. Pharmacological treatments represented <b>stored</b> <b>time,</b> offering the opportunity to hold back future dreaded time. Past experience with others with dementia was a context for holding on to now and facing some risks of living alone with memory loss. The women acknowledged the limited time remaining for, and identified endpoints to, living alone. Conclusion. : Insight into the impact of past experience with others with dementia could inform nursing assessment and advocacy for health/social services that are sensitive to the potential emotional impact of mixing people with varied levels of dementia in the same programme. © 2010 The Authors.

40|$|Loess soils cover vast {{areas in}} the arid and {{semi-arid}} regions of northern China. Due {{to the lack of}} reliable surface water and ground-water, rainwater harvesting has played a prominent role in farmers' domestic usage and agricultural irrigation. An economical arid valid type of water storage cistern with optimum design of components has been introduced to rural {{areas in the}} Loess Plateau. Different collection alternatives showed apparent variations in rainwater quality. By using different catchments, such as mortar roofs and cement-paved courtyards, compacted land or road surfaces, rainwater can be effectively collected for storage in cisterns. This study focused mainly on the quality of rainwater harvested from the different catchment systems and stored for different periods of time. By analysis of the water samples stored in these cisterns, it was evident that rainwater quality could be improved significantly by self-purification during the storage. With emphasis on rainwater quality affected by the different catchment systems, {{it was found that the}} measured inorganic compounds in the rainwater harvested from roof-yard catchment systems generally matched the WHO standards for drinking water, while the concentrations of some inorganic compounds in the rainwater collected from land and road surfaces appeared to be higher than the guideline values for drinking water, but generally not beyond the maximum permissible concentrations. However, Fecal Coliform, which is an important bacteriological parameter for the three catchment systems, exceeded the limits of drinking water to a greater extend. Trace amounts of 55 organic pollutants were identified, including aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds and phthalate esters, etc. The analytical results indicated that roof-yard catchments that included the "first flush" usually provided safe drinking water with low organic contents, even for rainwater collected immediately after rainfall. In contrast, rainwater harvested from road surfaces had poor quality with respect to the organic constituents, regardless of <b>stored</b> <b>time...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} of empirical combustion models {{to predict the}} mean reaction rate for supersonic mixing layer is evaluated by using the <b>stored</b> <b>time</b> series data of direct numerical simulations (DNS). The confined supersonic $H_ 2 /$air mixing layer-the prototype representation of the scramjet combustor flow field-is taken as the test case. The reaction rate profiles of various species obtained from the DNS results are compared with the reaction rate profiles obtained from these combustion models. The combustion models based on fast chemistry approximation are seen to predict the peak mean reaction rate much higher (about two orders of magnitude) compared to DNS data, particularly in the mixing layer region where the reaction is taking place. The Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) based combustion models for finite rate chemistry suggested by Magnussen and coworkers predict the mean reaction rate of all the major and minor species extremely well. The EDC model with detailed full chemistry (FC) and finite rate single-step chemistry (SSC) captures all essential features of reaction rate profile distribution with similar order of magnitude peak values, although a thinner reaction zone is predicted. The comparisons of mean reaction rates with different hydrogen and air stream temperatures reveal that the model can predict the mean reaction rate for practical scramjet combustor flow field. The model is also seen to predict the mean reaction rate well at a location close to the occurrence of ignition. A modification of this model allowing a nonunity Schmidt number, a feature {{very important for the}} flow involving hydrogen, shows little improvement in the prediction of the reaction rates. It is inferred that for hypervelocity reactive flows for which heat release due to chemistry is counteracted by significant enthalpy change due to gas dynamics, the finite rate EDC model with fine tuning for reaction zone width may be adequate to describe full chemistry effect...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic clubfoot (talipes equinovarus) is a {{congenital}} deformity of the foot. The common treatment consists of serial manipulation and casting, {{known as the}} Ponseti method, which is started {{in the first week}} after birth. After an average of five cast changes and often a percutaneous Achilles tenotomy the deformity is corrected [1]. An abduction orthosis is worn for several years to prevent relapse. The application of plaster cast includes soaking the roll in lukewarm water which starts the exothermic curing reaction. After the plaster has cured the surplus water evaporates, which is an endothermic process. Heat is drawn from the surrounding but also from the patient. One case study describes observed hypothermia after the application of a plaster jacket for immobilization of the cervical spine [2]. In a survey among parents (unreported, 49 respondents) a number of parents mentioned that their child seemed to feel cold the first hours after a new cast had been applied. The aim of current study is to investigate the temperature changes underneath the cast in the treatment of clubfoot with the Ponseti method. METHODS: A 1 -wire DS 1825 digital thermometer (Maxim Integrated, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to measure the temperature underneath the cast. The sensor was placed underneath the sole of the foot and attached to a custom made data logger which <b>stored</b> <b>time</b> and temperature data every 10 minutes for a full week. Dip duration was calculated as the time from the moment the first maximum was reached until the temperature reached the mean value of the last 6 days. T-Tests were used to test the temperature difference for statistical significance. According to the Medical ethical evaluation committee of the UMCG the study does not fall under the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects act. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Preliminary results of the first seven measurements in four subjects (age 2 - 30 d, all boys, 2 bilateral) are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1 : Typical measurement of the temperature underneath the cast during the first 24 hours after casting. After an initial temperature increase after the application of the plaster cast, a decrease was visible in all measurements (p < 0. 000). This dip reached a minimum of 23 - 33 °C and lasted 5. 9 - 16 h before reaching a relatively stable 34 - 37 °C. During the ISB 2017 the additional results of the remaining scheduled measurements will be presented. CONCLUSIONSA considerable decrease in skin temperature was observed after the application of long leg casts in the treatment of clubfoot. Especially in bilateral cases this might cause discomfort or even hypothermia. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: This study has been supported by the Dutch Technology Foundation...|$|E
