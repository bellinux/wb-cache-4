25|$|Over 75% of Red Army {{divisions}} {{were listed}} rifle divisions, as infantry divisions were {{known in the}} Red Army. In the Imperial Russian Army, the strelkovye (rifle) divisions were considered more prestigious than pekhotnye (infantry) divisions, and in the Red Army, all infantry divisions were labeled strelkovye divisions. The Soviet riflemen were known as a peshkom ("on foot") or more frequently as a frontovik (front fighter). The term frontovik was not equivalent to the German term Landser, the American G.I Joe or the British Tommy Atkins, all of which referred to soldiers in general, as the term frontovik was used only to describe those infantrymen who fought at the front. All able-bodied males in the Soviet Union were eligible for conscription {{at the age of}} 19 and those attending university or a technical school were able to escape conscription, and even then could defer military service for a period ranging from 3 months to a year. Deferments could be only offered three times. The Soviet Union was divided into 20 military districts, which corresponded with the borders of the oblasts, and were further divided into raions (counties). It was from the raions that quotas were assigned to the number of men that had been produced for the Red Army every year. The vast majority of the frontoviks had been born in the 1920s and grown up knowing nothing other than the Soviet system. Every year, men received draft notices in the mail informing to report at a collection, usually a local school, and customarily reported to duty with a bag or suitcase carrying some spare clothes, underwear, and tobacco. The conscripts then boarded a train to take to a military reception center where they were issued uniforms, underwent a physical test, had their heads shaven and were given a <b>steam</b> <b>bath</b> to rid them of lice. A typical soldier was given ammo pouches, shelter-cape, ration bag, cooking pot, water bottle and an identity tube containing papers listing pertinent personal information.|$|E
