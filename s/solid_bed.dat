40|$|This work {{involved}} {{an investigation into}} the mechanisms governing the reduction of material in the <b>solids</b> <b>bed</b> of the Ifcon® process. Thermo gravimetric analyses were done to investigate the influence of various operational parameters on the rate of solid state reduction. The experiments were modeled, and model predictions were compared to experimental results. Kinetic data was analised and the reduction rate constants were calculated. The rate constants were used as inputs to a model, which describes the reduction behaviour and temperature profile in a composite <b>solids</b> <b>bed</b> (similar to that in the Ifcon® process). High temperature reduction- and melting tests were done in an 150 kW induction furnace, to simulate final reduction in a <b>solids</b> <b>bed.</b> The temperature profile through the <b>solids</b> <b>bed</b> was measured and results were compared to model predictions. Finally the extent to which solid state reduction occurs in the <b>solids</b> <b>bed</b> was estimated as a function of production rate.

The numerical model is first validated by comparing the bed pressure drop and solids velocity with experimental data.

A stable, <b>solids</b> <b>bed</b> is achieved for {{the entire range of}} gas flow rates tested (0. 1 – 0. 6 Nm 3 /s). No particle entrainment is observed when varying the solid density (1800 – 450 kg/m 3) or the particle diameter (2 – 0. 5 mm). A shift to bubbling fluidization regime is observed for small particle diameters (0. 5 mm).

60|$|The {{thickness}} of the beds in each salt deposit of course depends entirely upon {{the area of the}} original sea or salt-lake, and the length of time during which the evaporation went on. Sometimes we may get a mere film of salt; sometimes a <b>solid</b> <b>bed</b> six hundred feet thick. Perfectly pure rock-salt is colourless and transparent; but one doesn't often find it pure. Alas for a degenerate world! even in its original site, Nature herself has taken the trouble to adulterate it beforehand. (If she hadn't done so, one may be perfectly sure that commercial enterprise would have proved equal to the occasion in the long run.) But the adulteration hasn't spoilt the beauty of the salt; on the contrary, it serves, like rouge, to give a fine fresh colour where none existed. When iron is the chief colouring matter, rock-salt assumes a beautiful clear red tint; in other cases it is emerald green or pale blue. As a rule, salt is prepared from it for table by a regular process; but it has become a fad of late with a few people to put crystals of native rock-salt on their tables; and they decidedly look very pretty, and have a certain distinctive flavour of their own that is not unpleasant.|$|E

Because flue gas contains trace impurities that degrade sorbents, solid sorbents may prove to be prohibitively expensive. Significant engineering challenges must be overcome.

Additionally, heat transfer through a <b>solid</b> <b>bed</b> is slow and inefficient, making it difficult and expensive to cool the sorbent during adsorption and heat it during desorption. Lastly, many promising solid adsorbents have been measured only under ideal conditions, which ignores the potentially significant effects H2O can have on working capacity and regeneration energy.|$|E

40|$|Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) {{is used as}} an {{alternative}} feedstock in electric arc furnaces, making up 50 % {{or more of the}} total iron charge. DRI produced with coal based reductants (for example in rotary kilns) make up roughly 25 % of DRI produced in the world. It was found that SL/RN DRI samples from a kiln cooler had high nitrogen contents (50 - 250 ppm, depending on particle size), higher than DRI from gas-based reduction. The higher nitrogen content of SL/RN DRI would increase the levels of nitrogen of liquid steel produced in the EAFs. The problem is exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} SL/RN DRI contains virtually no carbon (which would aid in preventing nitrogen pickup). The proposed mechanism of nitrogen pick-up by the SL/RN DRI is one where nitrogen present within the atmosphere of the rotary cooler (where hot DRI, discharged at 1000 °C from the rotary kiln, is cooled to approximately 100 °C in ca. two hours) penetrates the <b>solids</b> <b>bed</b> and nitrides DRI particles. Possible rate-determining steps for nitriding in the cooler have been evaluated. Nitriding of DRI particles is predicted to be rapid: the most plausible location for rapid nitrogen pickup is the first 5 meters of the rotary cooler, where the high temperature, nitrogen-rich gas atmosphere and rapid <b>solids</b> <b>bed</b> mixing are conducive to nitriding; solid-state and pore diffusion of nitrogen into DRI particles are predicted to be rapid too. The most plausible rate determining step for nitriding of DRI particles is that of nitrogen dissociation on the DRI surface, which can be further retarded by the presence of sulphur. A strong correlation was found between the amount of “melt-in” carbon in the liquid steel and the final tap nitrogen content, with 0. 3 % C resulting in nitrogen levels as low as 50 ppm (80 ppm or less is desired on the plant in question) at tap, even with DRI material that is high in nitrogen and contains virtually no carbon.
