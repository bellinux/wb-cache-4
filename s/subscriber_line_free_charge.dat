2500|$|Later {{stepping}} switches {{were arranged}} in banks, {{the first stage}} of which was a linefinder. If one of up to a hundred <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines</b> had the receiver lifted [...] "off hook", a linefinder connected the <b>subscriber's</b> <b>line</b> to a <b>free</b> first selector, which returned the subscriber a dial tone to show that it was ready to receive dialed digits. The subscriber's dial pulsed at about 10 pulses per second, although the speed depended on the standard of the particular telephone administration.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSince the mid 1990 s, Internet is revolutionizing the way business is conducted around the globe. Bandwidthintensive graphics, {{video and audio}} applications are becoming more popular {{and the desire for}} fast access to information places a huge demand on high bandwidth in metro networks. The primary bottleneck in the quest for delivering high bandwidth to the customers is the last mile. The last-mile of today primarily relies on infrastructures that were not designed for the transport of digital data. The current infrastructure of twisted pair is very close to its upper limits. As a result, consumers are unable to enjoy the full potential of the Internet and generally {{do not have access to}} enhanced services such as enriched multimedia services, converged voice, video, and data services and high-speed Web browsing. This thesis assesses a broad spectrum of wired and wireless last mile technologies available - Optical Fiber Technology, Digital <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Lines,</b> <b>Free</b> Space Optics, Wireless Local Loop, Wireless LAN and Cellular Technology. Besides discussing the basic concepts and principles, it highlights the current limitations of these technologies for last mile implementation. An innovative and state-of-the-art methodology for linking building with optical fiber to achieve high bandwidth through sewer systems is presented.

50|$|DigNet of New York City & Long Island, {{formerly}} known as the New York City & Long Island One Call Center, is a non-profit organization that acts as a communications link between utility companies and individuals planning any mechanized digging activity in the five boroughs of New York City and Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island. By lawhttp://www3.dps.ny.gov/N/nycrr16.nsf/Parts/6E423DA6B51F8E0E85256FC80073C32B?OpenDocument, excavators and contractors working in the five boroughs of New York City and Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island must contact DigNet, 1-800-272-4480 or 811, at least 48 hours but no more than 10 working days (excluding weekends and legal holidays) prior to beginning any mechanized digging or excavation work to ensure underground lines are marked. Excavators and contractors can also submit locate requests online, through ITIChttp://ny.itic.occinc.com/iMenu/ny. DigNet will then relay the notice of proposed excavation work to its member companies that own and operate underground facilities, including the vital utilities used to power neighborhoods and communities throughout New York City and Long Island. Representatives from these member companies will then come out and mark their <b>lines,</b> <b>free</b> of <b>charge.</b>|$|R

A portion of the fare was automatically deducted for passengers travelling to or from stations beyond the new link.|$|R
50|$|Fairskys staff {{provided}} frequent {{entertainment for}} the passengers, details {{of which were}} widely displayed throughout the ship on the daily activities program. Dinner dances and variety shows were periodically staged (one of the guest bands which played on the ship was The Seekers {{on their way to}} the UK to begin a career which would bring their music into homes all over the world), along with the obligatory mock ceremony (performed by the ships Italian crew, with the help of passenger volunteers) when the vessel crossed the equator. Fairskys own popular musicians usually played requests in the public rooms before dinner, also in the dining rooms on gala nights such as the Captains welcome and farewell and fancy dress theme evenings. Travelogues and recently released films were screened daily in the dedicated cinema. Children were also thoughtfully catered for with their own meal sittings at lunch and tea times, entertainment shows, cartoon screenings and occasional lessons provided, for example about the geography of their destination country. At the end of the voyage, each child would also receive at random a quality toy provided by the <b>Line</b> <b>free</b> of <b>charge.</b>|$|R

500|$|At {{the top of}} {{the incline}} the line ran along the Brendon ridge in both directions, eastward to Raleigh's Cross and westward to a {{heathland}} terminus named after the nearby village of Gupworthy. Considerable numbers of miners lived in these remote areas. For some time the Company had permitted them and their families to travel on the <b>line</b> <b>free</b> of <b>charge</b> and at their own risk. It was decided to operate a formal passenger service between Comberow and Watchet, which started with great celebration on 4 September 1865. In the full year 1866 13,000 passengers were carried; by 1872 this had risen to 19,000 and peaked at 19,680 in 1874. Four passenger trains ran each way daily at first, but this was later reduced to two, and then to one. Passenger trains took half an hour to travel from Comberow to Watchet. Proper stations were provided at Watchet, Washford, [...] and [...] , at {{the top of the}} incline, sometimes referred to as Raleigh's Cross and referred to internally by the railway as [...] "Top of Incline", was also considered to be a station, but the Board decided against spending the monies needed to bring the incline, track and [...] station up to the standard required for fare paying passengers.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} switching networks {{consisting of}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines</b> and crosswires connected by switches. A connection between two subscribers is made along one crosswire via two switches. We determine the {{minimum number of}} switches necessary for such a switching network to be rearrangeably nonblocking and construct a switching arrangement which achieves this minimum for any (even) number of <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines.</b> Two procedures for assignment of crosswires to <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> pairs are described. One makes correct choice of connection route without backtracking provided all connections are known beforehand; the other determines a rearrangement of existing assignments when a new connection is required.

50|$|Consumer-oriented ADSL was {{designed}} to operate on existing lines already conditioned for Basic Rate Interface ISDN services, which itself is a digital circuit switching service (non-IP), though most incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) provision rate-adaptive digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (RADSL) to work on virtually any available copper pair facility, whether conditioned for BRI or not.Engineers developed high speed DSL facilities such as high bit rate digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (HDSL) and symmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL) to provision traditional Digital Signal 1 (DS1) services over standard copper pair facilities.|$|R
50|$|Asymmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (ADSL) {{is a type}} {{of digital}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) technology, a data {{communications}} technology that enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines than a conventional voiceband modem can provide. ADSL differs from the less common symmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL). In ADSL, Bandwidth and bit rate are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer premises (downstream) than the reverse (upstream). Providers usually market ADSL as a service for consumers for Internet access for primarily downloading content from the Internet, but not serving content accessed by others.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, pair gain is the {{transmitting}} {{of multiple}} POTS signals over the twisted pairs traditionally {{used for a}} single traditional <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> in telephone systems. Pair gain {{has the effect of}} creating additional <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines.</b> This is typically used as an expedient way to solve <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> shortage problems by using existing wiring, instead of installing new wires from the central office to the customer premises. The term was invented in the middle 20th century by analogy with earlier use of gain to extend telephone local loops far from the telephone exchange.|$|R

50|$|A {{symmetric}} digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL) is {{a digital}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) that transmits digital data over the copper wires {{of the telephone}} network, where the bandwidth in the downstream direction, from the network to the subscriber, {{is identical to the}} bandwidth in the upstream direction, from the subscriber to the network. This symmetric bandwidth can be considered to be the opposite of the asymmetric bandwidth offered by asymmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (ADSL) technologies, where the upstream bandwidth is lower than the downstream bandwidth.
