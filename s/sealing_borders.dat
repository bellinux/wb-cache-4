5000|$|In {{response}} to the increasing terrorism, Russia tightened its grip on Chechnya and expanded its anti-terrorist operations throughout the region. Russia installed a pro-Russian Chechen regime. In 2003, a referendum was held on a constitution that reintegrated Chechnya within Russia, but provided limited autonomy. According to the Chechen government, the referendum passed with 95.5% of the votes and almost 80% turnout. The Economist was skeptical of the results, arguing that [...] "few outside the Kremlin regard the referendum as fair". After the 2004 school siege, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced sweeping security and political reforms, <b>sealing</b> <b>borders</b> in the Caucasus region and revealing plans to give the central government more power. He also vowed to take tougher action against domestic terrorism, including preemptive strikes against Chechen separatists. In 2005 and 2006, prominent separatist leaders Aslan Maskhadov and Shamil Basayev were killed.|$|E
40|$|This talk {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} transboundary conservation initiatives; specifically, initiatives in the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta and northern Montana. This {{is the home of}} the world's first Peace Park, the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. This remarkable park, part of the so-called "Crown of the Continent", is now the epicenter of a far larger transboundary initiative, the Yellowstone to Yukon (Y 2 Y) conservation project. The Waterton-Glacier Park and Y 2 Y are examples of an ecosystem approach to managing a portion of the northern border of the US; they stand in sharp contrast to other American initiatives that seek to promote national security on its southern frontier by <b>sealing</b> <b>borders,</b> and as a result, dividing ecosystems. While the Waterton-Glacier Peace Park stood in the past as a symbol to the world of peaceful coexistence, its future utility as a conservation management model that promotes collaboration may diminish given the heightened concern for perimeter security after the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks on the US...|$|E

These coordinates indicated he was on the Kosovo-Albania border, which was a <b>sealed</b> <b>border</b> at the time. The prosecution also used some new maps and topographical cross sections indicating Ashdown's location, but their accuracy was challenged by Delić, as the location of a village was different from other maps of the area.|$|R
40|$|CHDS State/LocalSince the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001, an increase in the publics awareness concerning border security has resulted in an outcry to secure this nations borders. Congress, the Department of Homeland Security, border states, and local governments have all defined what constitutes a secure border differently, which makes the measurement of success or failure virtually impossible. By utilizing a case study methodology, this thesis seeks to answer the question: can the project management process be applied to the border security effort to generate an accepted definition of a secure border? Findings indicate that the absence of empirical data that can demonstrate a secure border has generated a tremendous amount of debate in regards to the exact level of border security but the project management process could be utilized to bring stakeholders together and create a definition of secure border that can be more widely accepted. However, various issues with the definition remain that will not be resolved, which stems from the social-psychological aspect of separating a secure <b>border</b> from a <b>sealed</b> <b>border</b> and some citizens in the United States will never accept anything other than a completely <b>sealed</b> <b>border.</b> This area can and should be studied in detail in the future.

50|$|During World War II Friedrichshain {{was one of}} {{the most}} badly damaged parts of Berlin, as Allied {{strategic}} bombers specifically targeted its industries. As late as the nineties, some buildings still displayed bullet holes from the intense house to house fighting during the Battle of Berlin. After the war ended, the boundary between the US and Soviet occupation sectors ran between Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg, with Friedrichshain in the east and Kreuzberg in the west. This became a <b>sealed</b> <b>border</b> between East and West Berlin when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961.|$|R

50|$|In 1794, {{after the}} Battle of Raclawice, Tadeusz Kosciuszko {{designed}} Skala as a fortified camp, protecting northern {{approaches to the}} city of Krakow. On May 18, 1794, Prussian Army attacked and captured Skala. After the Partitions of Poland, the town briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815 - 1915, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. As a result, the town was cut off from Krakow, which remained part of Austrian Galicia. Due to the proximity of the <b>sealed</b> <b>border,</b> the development of Skala was stopped for more than 100 years, as both Russian and Austrian governments did not promote mutual trade.|$|R

Gradually the male head and body was replaced with that of a female, {{and by the end of}} 16th century the tail was also changed from that of a dragon to that of a fish.

5000|$|Literary theorist Gérard Genette defines {{paratext}} {{as those}} things in a published work that accompany the text, things such as the author's name, the title, preface or introduction, or illustrations.Genette states [...] "More than a boundary or a <b>sealed</b> <b>border,</b> the paratext is, rather, a threshold." [...] It is [...] "a zone between text and off-text, a zone not only of transition but also of transaction: a privileged place of pragmatics and a strategy, of an influence on the public, an influence that ... is {{at the service of}} a better reception for the text and a more pertinent reading of it". Then quoting Philippe Lejeune, Genette further describes paratext as [...] "a fringe of the printed text which in reality controls one's whole reading of the text".|$|R

The German rider, Walter Stolle, lost his home and living in the Sudetenland in the aftermath of World War II, settled in Britain and set off from Essex on 25 January 1959, to cycle round the world. He rode through 159 countries in 18 years, denied only those with <b>sealed</b> <b>borders.</b> He paid his way by giving slide shows in seven languages. He gave 2,500 at US$100 each.
