40|$|This work investigates two new Anger-logic {{detector}} {{models to}} improve the performance of PET scanners. The first model investigates using a slotted front surface in a position-sensitive NaI(Tl) detector. The sensitivity of an unslotted detector increases with crystal thickness, but the spatial resolution worsens due to increased spreading of light. A slotted detector reduces the light spreading {{which leads to a}} reduction of pulse-pileup, thereby extending the count-rate capability of the PET scanner. Experimental measurements were performed with a 12 ̆ 6 inches; thick, slotted Nal(TI) detector to validate the model developed through simulations, and optimize the tradeoff of the slot depth and spatial resolution. ^ The count-rate performance of NaI(TI) detectors is also limited by the long decay time of NaI(T 1) signal. A pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>circuit</b> was developed which narrows the NaI(T 1) signal and improves the energy resolution at short integration times and high count-rate. A high count-rate simulation program predicts a doubling of the peak performance rate of the current whole-body scanner (CPET), using the slotted detector together with the pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>circuit.</b> ^ For the second detector model, a new scintillator (GSO) with a high attenuation coefficient, good energy resolution, and short signal decay time was chosen. Detector simulations and measurements helped in designing a lightguide which optimizes the discrimination of 4 x 4 x 10 mm 3 crystals. The pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>circuit</b> was modified for the GSO signal to achieve good signal sampling with the digitizers used in the electronics. High count-rate simulations show that a GSO-based brain scanner using this detector will result in a five fold increase in the peak performance rate over the current Nal(Tl) -based brain scanner (HPET). ^ A brain scanner based upon the GSO Anger-logic detector has been almost completed. Initial results show that the image resolution is 3. 5 mm with very little pulse pileup in the energy spectrum at high activity levels. These results are consistent with the simulation results for the scanner. ...|$|E

This modem is mainly composed of an AT 89 C 51 microcontroller, a simple two order passive low-pass filter, and a <b>shaping</b> <b>circuit.</b> Modulation is achieved {{on the basis of}} the principle of pulse width modulation (PWM).

40|$|In the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer, Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) {{chambers}} and sMDT chambers {{with half of}} the tube diameter of the MDTs are used for precision muon track reconstruction. The sMDT chambers are designed for operation at high counting rates due to neutron and gamma background irradiation expected for the HL-LHC and future hadron colliders. The existing MDT read-out electronics uses bipolar signal shaping which causes an undershoot of opposite polarity and same charge after a signal pulse. At high counting rates and short electronics dead time used for the sMDTs, signal pulses pile up on the undershoot of preceding background pulses leading to a reduction of the signal amplitude and a jitter in the drift time measurement and, therefore, to a degradation of drift tube efficiency and spatial resolution. In order to further increase the rate capability of sMDT tubes, baseline restoration can be used in the read-out electronics to suppress the pile-up effects.
