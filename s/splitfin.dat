50|$|The redtail <b>splitfin,</b> or redtail goodeid, (Xenotoca eiseni) is {{a species}} of goodeid fish from the family Goodeidae and {{subfamily}} Goodeinae. Like other members of Goodeinae, the redtail <b>splitfin</b> is a livebearer. However, the goodeid mating system differs in several ways from the more common livebearing fish from the family Poeciliidae that includes guppies and swordtails. While no goodeid species is a very popular aquarium fish, the redtail <b>splitfin</b> {{is one of the}} most popular.|$|E

50|$|<b>Splitfins</b> are a family, Goodeidae, of teleost fish {{endemic to}} Mexico and {{some areas of}} the United States. This family {{contains}} 40 species within 18 genera. The family is named after ichthyologist George Brown Goode.|$|R
50|$|In the wild, {{both male}} and female redtail <b>splitfins</b> prefer to mate with fish of similar size. This limits the sexual {{advantage}} to males that grow especially large. This minimizes the sexual dimorphism {{in the size of the}} fish between males and females.|$|R

5000|$|Hemotrophic (blood eating) {{viviparity}} means embryos {{develop in}} the female’s (or male's) oviduct and nutrients are provided directly by the parent, typically via a structure similar to, or analogous to the placenta seen in mammals.

50|$|Goodeinae is a {{subfamily}} of <b>splitfins.</b> They {{are small}} fish which mostly lives in fresh water in Mexico, especially around Mesa Central, west of Mexico City.

50|$|Most of the Poeciliidae are ovoviviparous, that is, {{while the}} eggs are {{retained}} inside {{the body of the}} female for protection, {{the eggs are}} essentially independent of the mother and she does not provide them with any nutrients. In contrast, fish such as <b>splitfins</b> and halfbeaks are viviparous, with the eggs receiving food from the maternal blood supply through structures analogous to the placenta of placental mammals.|$|R
5000|$|Empetrichthys latos is a {{rare species}} of fish in the family Goodeidae, the <b>splitfins.</b> It is known by the common names Pahrump poolfish and Pahrump killifish, the former being more correct today. It is endemic to Nevada in the United States, where it {{was limited to the}} Pahrump Valley near the California border.

5000|$|Butterfly <b>splitfins</b> are voracious, and eat most {{forms of}} {{commercial}} fish food. They take live prey {{up to the}} size of week-old guppy fry, but need plant material, ideally green algae, to thrive. They are ideal algae eaters for tanks with small, hard-water cichlids. If not enough algae are available, vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, or green peas are recommended additions to the diet. Fry do not need [...] "baby" [...] food such as brine shrimp or nauplia, though as in adults, plant food increase growth and vitality.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{ability of}} fish to {{perceive}} subjective (or illusory) contours, ie contours that lack a physical Counterpart {{in terms of}} luminance contrast gradients, was investigated. In the first experiment, redtail <b>splitfins</b> (Xenotoca eiseni), family Goodeidae, were trained to discriminate between a geometric figure (a triangle or a square) oil various backgrounds and a background without any Figure. Thereafter, the fish performed test trials in which illusory squares or triangles were obtained by (i) interruptions of a background of diagonal lines, (ii) phase-shifting of a background of diagonal lines, and (iii) pacmen spatially arranged to induce perception of Kanizsa subjective surfaces. In all three conditions, fish seemed to generalise their responses to Stimuli perceived as subjective contours by humans. Fish chose, correctly, squares or triangles made of interrupted or phase-shifted diagonal lines from uniform backgrounds of diagonal lines, as well as illusory square or triangle Kanizsa figures from figures in which the inducing pacmen were scrambled. In the second experiment, fish were trained to discriminate between a vertical and a horizontal bar with luminance contrast gradients, and then tested with vertically and horizontally oriented illusory bars, created either through interruption or spatial phase-shift of inducing diagonal lines. Fish appeared {{to be able to}} generalise the orientation discrimination to illusory contours. These results demonstrate that redtail <b>splitfins</b> are capable of perceiving illusory contours...|$|R
5|$|Some {{species of}} fish are {{viviparous}}. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood supply {{with that of the}} embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, <b>splitfins,</b> and lemon shark. Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. Intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "splitfin" [...] {{comes from}} the fact that, in the male fish, the {{anterior}} rays of the anal fin are partly separated from rest of the fin. <b>Splitfins</b> can be up to 20 cm in length, though most species are much smaller, around 5 cm. Goodeid fish have internal fertilisation, with males positioning themselves with a flexible part of the front anal fin, separated by a notch, which makes up the andropodium. Embryos hatch out of the egg within the ovarian follicle, and possess trophotaeniae, ribbon-like structures that emerge from the cloaca in front of the anal fin, on the ventral surface of the juvenile. These allow the absorption of nutrients within the ovary (matrotrophy), and are shed by juveniles shortly after birth. Female goodeids do not store sperm, and so a copulation event must precede each pregnancy.|$|R
