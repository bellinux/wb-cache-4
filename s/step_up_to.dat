5|$|During his loan spell at Millwall, Doyle had {{suggested}} {{he might want}} to stay with the club on a permanent basis, despite the offer of a new contract from his parent club. However, {{at the end of the}} season he signed a two-year deal with Birmingham. Because Vaesen's contract had expired, there was an expectation that Doyle would <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> second-choice goalkeeper behind Maik Taylor. Doyle played his first competitive match for Birmingham in their League Cup first-round match against Shrewsbury Town on 22 August 2006, in which he kept a clean sheet as his club won 1–0. With Taylor injured, Doyle made his first league appearance for Birmingham four days later in a 2–0 defeat away to Cardiff City. Doyle played in the second and third rounds of the League Cup, against Wrexham and Sheffield United, before losing his place in the cup team to Taylor for the quarter-final defeat to Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} held in 2013, Galván said that Nuevo Laredo, {{aside from the}} violence generated by organized crime, was plagued with extortions, armed robberies, car hijackings, and regular thefts. He recognized that restoring public safety was possible, but reiterated {{that it was a}} difficult and long process for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that would keep the younger generations and those suffering from poverty away from the lure of organized crime. Galván admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that the military had a role to play, but that he wanted to see civilian forces <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the job in the future.|$|E
5|$|Kulwicki raced in fourNASCAR Busch Grand National Series (now Xfinity Series) {{races in}} 1984. At the time, the Busch Grand National Series was {{considered}} NASCAR's feeder circuit, a proving ground for drivers {{who wished to}} <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the organization's premiere circuit, the Winston Cup. Kulwicki qualified second fastest and finished in second place at his first career NASCAR race, which {{took place at the}} Milwaukee Mile, several city blocks from where he grew up. Later that year, he finished seventh at Charlotte and fifth at Bristol. The following year, Kulwicki placed sixteenth in the season-opening Busch Series race at Daytona. Although he won the pole position at that year's event in Milwaukee, he finished fourteenth because of engine problems. Kulwicki's Busch Series successes caught car owner Bill Terry's eye and he offered Kulwicki a chance to race for him in several Winston Cup events.|$|E

5|$|Robinson started {{competing}} in the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series (now Xfinity Series) in 1991, driving the No. 77 Huffman Racing Buick. At the time, the Busch Grand National Series was considered NASCAR's feeder circuit, a proving ground for drivers who wished to <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the organization's premiere circuit, the Winston Cup. Early on, she struggled to find sponsorship and ran the season without a sponsor. Robinson qualified 26th fastest and finished 15th at her first Busch Series race, which took place at Orange County Speedway. Later that year, she finished 21st at Motor Mile Speedway, and 18th at the season's second race held at Orange County Speedway. The final race Robinson qualified for was at Charlotte Motor Speedway driving the No. 49 Ferree Racing car, where she finished 41st after an accident. Robinson failed {{to qualify for the}} race at Martinsville Speedway. She finished 54th in the Busch Series points standings.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Gugelmin, {{like many}} Brazilian drivers of his generation, {{moved to the}} United Kingdom to further his racing career. He was a {{longtime}} friend of future Formula One world champion Ayrton Senna, who was already racing in the UK, and the two shared a house from 1982 to 1987. Senna, having previously been a Formula Ford driver with the Van Diemen team, used his influence within the organisation to secure Gugelmin a race seat with them for 1982. By the end of the year, Gugelmin was British Formula Ford 1600cc champion. He followed this up by finishing as runner-up in the British Formula Ford 2000cc series the following year. He moved to the European Formula Ford series in 1984, and won the title at his first attempt. A <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Formula Three followed in 1985 with West Surrey Racing, winning the British championship and the prestigious Macau Grand Prix. Gugelmin then spent two years in Formula 3000, the final step before Formula One. Gugelmin took one victory in Formula 3000, at Silverstone in 1987 while driving for the Ralt factory team.|$|E
5|$|McAllister {{made the}} <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Football League by signing for newly {{promoted}} League Two club Exeter City {{in the summer}} of 2008. He debuted in the League Cup first round against Southampton on 12 August 2008, which finished as a 3–1 defeat. His first goal came with the equaliser against Lincoln City on 6 December, which finished as a 2–1 victory, and this was followed up with two goals in a 4–1 win at home to Rochdale on 20 December. McAllister scored twice against Dagenham & Redbridge on 20 January 2009 to give Exeter a 2–1 victory. He finished his first season at Exeter with seven goals from 32 appearances, as they finished second in League Two and therefore won promotion into League One. After only making five appearances for Exeter in 2009–10, McAllister joined Barnet on loan in November 2009. He debuted in a 1–1 draw at home to Bournemouth on 1 December 2009 and completed the loan spell with five appearances. McAllister returned to Exeter in January 2010, but was unable to force his way into the first-team, and signed a one-month emergency loan deal with Rotherham United on 11 March 2010. He made his debut for Rotherham two days later in their 1–0 win away to Dagenham & Redbridge and completed the loan spell with eight appearances. Upon his return to Exeter, McAllister was one of nine players released by the club {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|McAllister {{started his}} career with Eastleigh as a youth player. He moved to Basingstoke Town {{towards the end of}} 2001–02, making his debut in March 2002. McAllister spent three seasons there, making 113 appearances, scoring 66 goals before moving up the {{national}} league system to Conference National club Stevenage Borough where he made 10 appearances, having loan spells at Gravesend & Northfleet and Eastleigh in 2004–05. He joined Woking in 2005, spending two full seasons there, and making over 100 appearances. He had a short spell with Grays Athletic, being sent out on loan to Rushden & Diamonds and then another short spell at Oxford United, all during 2007–08. After leaving Oxford in 2008, he took a <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Football League {{for the first time in}} his career, signing for Exeter City. He went on to score seven goals in his first season, but was loaned out to Barnet and Rotherham United in his second and was eventually released by the club in May 2010. McAllister then dropped back down to non-League football, joining Crawley Town where he played at Old Trafford; his team was defeated 1–0 by Manchester United in their FA Cup fifth round tie.

25|$|The ICC {{occasionally}} granted {{associate members}} permanent ODI status without granting them full membership and Test status.

Bangladesh have since made the <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Test status and full membership; {{but as a result}} of poor performances, Kenya's ODI status was reduced to temporary, meaning that they had to perform well at World Cup Qualifiers to keep its ODI status.

25|$|An unmoved pawn {{can move}} one <b>step,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the middle of}} the board (in the case of the 16×16 board, the eighth rank), or {{anything}} in between. Thus, 1.i8 is a legal opening move, and so are 1.i3, 1.i4, 1.i5, 1.i6, and 1.i7. Once it has moved for the first time, it can only make one step at a time. (In the case of an 8×8 board, this is exactly the same as in standard chess). Such a long initial pawn move allows the moving pawn to be captured en passant by an enemy pawn as if it had stopped on any one of the squares it had passed through.|$|E

This is what he had Abraham do in Fear and Trembling. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about guilt and innocence. His book, The Concept of Anxiety, makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.|$|E
