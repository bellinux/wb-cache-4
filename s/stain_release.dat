40|$|During {{the last}} few years the use of fluorochemicals to provide stain {{repellency}} and/or <b>stain</b> <b>release</b> properties to apparel goods has rapidly grown. The use of fluorochemicals as well as durable press resins, however, has a detrimental effect on the fabric softness. Providing premium softness is key to satisfy the highly demanding aesthetic requirements of many of today’s apparel products. Although softeners based on conventional aminofunctional silicones are well known to provide excellent hand, they significantly impair both the stain repellency and the <b>stain</b> <b>release</b> properties of fluorochemical treated fabrics. This paper presents the results from a recent study where current and new selected organo-modified silicones provide very good softness with minimum–to–no impact on the fluorochemical properties...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} {{related to}} perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) {{led to a}} re-examination of the methods for imparting stain resistance and stain repellency to textiles. Non-PFOA fluoropolymer finishes have been formed on cotton knits by admicellar polymerization, a surface analogue of emulsion polymerization. Fabric samples were characterized by a drop test, contact angle measurements, SEM, elemental analysis and durability studies. Stain resistance and <b>stain</b> <b>release</b> properties were assessed by reflectance and AATCC tests with results comparing favorably with swatches from commercially available garments. Admicellar polymerization enabled the formation of durable finishes that exhibited high performance in stain resistance and stain repellency...|$|E
40|$|The fibres {{cleanability}} depends, {{among other}} characteristics, on their hydrophilicity. Hydrophilic fibres are easy-wash materials but hydrophobic fibres {{are difficult to}} clean due to their higher water-repellent surfaces. This type of surfaces, like polyester (PET), produce an accumulation of electrostatic charges, which favors adsorption and retention of dirt. Thus, the polyester soil-release properties can be increased by finishing processes that improve fiber hydrophilicity. In present study, PET fabric modification was described by using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and N,N´-dimethylol- 4, 5 -dihydroxyethylene urea (DMDHEU) chemically modified resin. Briefly, the modification process {{was carried out in}} two steps, one to hydrolyse the polyester and create hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on the surface and other to crosslink the PEG chains. The resulting materials were characterized by contact angle, DSC and FTIR-ATR methods. Additionally, the soil release behavior and the mechanical properties of modified PET were evaluated. For the best process conditions, the treated PET presented 0 º contact angle, grade 5 <b>stain</b> <b>release</b> and acceptable mechanical performance.

30|$|Three {{types of}} {{appearance}} retention properties were measured—stain removal, color change, and fabric smoothness. AATCC Test Method 130 - 2010 : Soil Release: Oily <b>Stain</b> <b>Release</b> Method {{was used as}} a guideline to conduct the test for stain removal. Six types of stains (i.e., vegetable oil, mustard, spaghetti sauce, lipstick, nail polish, and white paint) were used to represent the common stains found in home laundering. The staining procedure for vegetable oil, mustard, and spaghetti sauce followed AATCC Test Method 130 - 2010. For lipstick, nail polish, and white paint, to increase the consistency of the stains on the specimens, a stained specimen was established as a standard for each type of stain, and one person was responsible for staining one type of stain for all test specimens based on the standard. As in the study by Schlag and Ordonez (2010), the Gray Scale for Color Change was used to evaluate the color change after washing from the color of the stained, unwashed standard specimen. On this scale, “ 5 ” indicates no color change (i.e., the stain has not been removed at all) and “ 1 ” indicates a severe color change (i.e., the stain has been completely removed).|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in perfluoropolyether (PFPE) resin technology for high solids, weather resistant polyurethanes for automotive (OEM) and heavy duty coatings are presented. In the former case, polyfunctional OH-terminated PFPE resins can be successfully blended with commercially available blocked iso- cyanates leading to high solids (70 – 80 wt. %) monocomponent polyurethanes with high density of cross-linking. Formulations containing PFPE resins and mixed hexamethylene diisocyanate/isophorone diisocyanate (HDI/IPDI) blocked isocyanates were prepared and char- acterized according to OEM specifications; {{the performances of}} fluorinated coatings were {{compared with those of}} reference acrylic solvent-borne coatings. Clearcoats were applied over conventional OEM basecoats (car body painting) and polyester powder coatings (wheels painting). The remarkable improvement of anticorrosion performances, acid and mar resistance and durability of painting system was reached maintaining its good aesthetic aspect. Fluorinated films showed excellent <b>stain</b> <b>release</b> properties conferring to final painting system, the self-cleaning behaviour typical for PFPE coatings. In the latter case, the use of dihydroxy terminated PFPE oligomers having properly selected molecular weights and bimodal molecular weight distribution allowed the preparation of really high solid (80 – 90 wt. % dry) low viscosity formulations with aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrogenated polyisocyanates. The compositions were able to cross-link rapidly even at temperatures below 20 ◦C giving fully transparent, chemically resistant and easy-cleanable coatings. The coating physical properties like hardness, glass transition temperature (Tg) and elongation can be optimized by tuning the hardener composition (HDI/IPDI ratio) as well as the molecular weight of the PFPE. White pigmented, high gloss finishes were also prepared and evaluated as protective barrier coating for heavy duty paints working in highly corrosive environments...|$|E

Persistently infected MA- 111 cells could not be superinfected with homologous wild-type Japanese encephalitis virus but could be superinfected with two heterologous viruses. Transfer of cell culture medium from persistently infected MA- 111 cells to a line of African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) resulted in similar persistent infections in the latter cells. Temperature sensitivity and host-cell interferon production were not involved in establishment or maintenance of persistence. Determination of ratios of physical particles to infectious particles revealed that many defective, noninfectious viruses were present, suggesting that defective interfering particles may be responsible for persistency...|$|R

The present study examined the effect of KIOM- 4, a mixture of four plant extracts, on streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in rat pancreatic β-cells (RINm 5 F). KIOM- 4 was found to inhibit STZ-induced apoptotic cell death, confirmed by formation of apoptotic bodies and DNA fragmentation.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{study the}} effect of 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and the {{superficial}} zone (SFZ) on cell death and proteoglycan degradation in articular cartilage after a single injurious compression in vitro. MethodCartilage explants from the femoropatellar groove of 2 year old cows {{with or without the}} SFZ were cultured serum-free with physiological concentrations of E 2 and injured by an unconfined single load compression (strain 50 %, velocity 2  mm/s). After 96  h cell death was measured histomorphometrically (nuclear blebbing (NB) and TUNEL <b>staining)</b> and <b>release</b> of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) by DMMB assay. ResultsInjurious compression increased significantly the number of cells with NB and TUNEL <b>staining</b> and <b>release</b> of GAG.

40|$|Bacterial endophthalmitis, a vision-threatening {{complication}} of ocular surgery or trauma, {{is characterized by}} increased intraocular inflammation and retinal tissue damage. Although significant vision loss in endophthalmitis {{has been linked to}} retinal cell death, the underlying mechanisms of cell death remain elusive. In this study, using a mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus endophthalmitis and cultured human retinal Müller glia (MIO-M 1 cell line), we demonstrate that S. aureus caused significant apoptotic cell death in the mouse retina and Müller glia, as evidenced by increased number of terminal dUTP nick end labeling and Annexin V and propidium iodide-positive cells. Immunohistochemistry and western blot studies revealed the reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (JC- 1 <b>staining),</b> <b>release</b> of cytochrome c into the cytosol, translocation of Bax to the mitochondria and the activation of caspase- 9 and - 3 in S. aureus-infected retina/retinal cells. In addition, the activation of PARP- 1 and the release of apoptosis inducing factor from mitochondria was also observed in S. aureus-infected retinal cells. Inhibition studies using pan-caspase (Q-VD-OPH) and PARP- 1 (DPQ) inhibitors showed significant reduction in S. aureus-induced retinal cell death both in vivo and in vitro. Together, our findings demonstrate that in bacterial endophthalmitis, retinal cells undergo apoptosis in the both caspase-dependent and independent manners, and mitochondria have a central role in this process. Hence, targeting the identified signaling pathways may provide the rationale to design therapeutic interventions to prevent bystander retinal tissue damage in bacterial endophthalmitis...|$|R
