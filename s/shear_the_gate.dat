30|$|Almost 10  years {{after the}} first fatal burst, the seventh {{longwall}} panel was being retreated at Mine A under almost 840  m of cover (MSHA 2006). Bounces were common along the longwall face, ranging from thumps in the roof or floor to coal being blown from the face. These events occurred all along the longwall face, but were most common near the headgate and tailgate entries. “Bounce procedures” were in place to protect the workers by limiting access to the face when <b>the</b> <b>shearer</b> was near <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> entries and specifying that shearer operators should position themselves behind the 8  m long deflector shields mounted above <b>the</b> <b>shearer.</b> <b>The</b> deflector shields were hinged off <b>the</b> <b>shearer</b> frame to be lowered or raised to accommodate mining clearance. In addition, expanded metal guards were attached to the armored face conveyor periodically along the walkway, and sheets of conveyor belting were suspended {{from the bottom of}} shield canopies along the walkway.|$|R
50|$|A TVS can be {{measured}} by intense gate to gate wind <b>shear,</b> which is <b>the</b> change of wind speed and/or direction across <b>the</b> two <b>gates</b> of inbound and outbound velocities. <b>Gates</b> are <b>the</b> individual pixels on the radar display. For example, if the inbound velocity is -48 kn knots and the outbound is 39 kn, then there is 87 kn of <b>gate</b> to <b>gate</b> <b>shear.</b> <b>The</b> impressiveness of a TVS not only {{has to do with}} the strength of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> to <b>gate</b> <b>shear,</b> but it also incorporates the size and depth of the TVS, and the strength of any surrounding mesocyclone, among other factors.|$|R

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} {{a reduction in}} <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> leakage current of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs by suppressing gate edge silicidation. We found that the silicidation of Ni in <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> edge during formation of the SiN passivation film caused a lower work function and increased <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> leakage current. A NiOx barrier layer inserted between <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> electrode and passivation film prevented silicidation of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> metal and drastically reduced <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> leakage current. We also determined that silicidation was prevented by a higher oxidation rate of NiOx. <b>The</b> <b>gate</b> leakage current was attributed to both <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> edge and Schottky junction.

40|$|We {{generate}} {{and study}} electroosmotic shear flow in microchannels.

Chemical modification is obtained by treating the channel wall with a cationic polymer. In case of electric modification, we used gate electrodes embedded in the channel wall. By applying a voltage to <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> electrode, <b>the</b> zeta potential can be varied and a controllable, uniform shear stress {{can be applied to the}} liquid in the channel. The strength of <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> stress depends on both <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> voltage and <b>the</b> applied field which drives <b>the</b> electroosmotic <b>shear</b> flow.

40|$|In this paper, the principles, {{measurement}} techniques, {{and analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> delay of high-electron-mobility-transistors (HEMTs) mainly based on an InP material system are discussed. In the measurement techniques, de-embedding of the pad parasitics is also described. The intrinsic part of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> delay of HEMTs is the transit time for electrons to travel in <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> depletion region. When <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> length is large enough, <b>the</b> intrinsic <b>gate</b> delay is dominant in <b>the</b> total <b>gate</b> delay. However, as <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> length becomes less than 100 nm, the delay analysis reveals that <b>the</b> intrinsic <b>gate</b> delay is now no longer dominant but <b>the</b> parasitic <b>gate</b> delay ascribed to the resistance and capacitance out of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> region.
