This study presents experimental investigation for strengthening RC slabs under impact loads using shear reinforcement. Slabs were strengthened against punching shear with two methods: using <b>shear</b> <b>studs</b> as <b>shear</b> reinforcement and using steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) instead of plain concrete. Eight RC slabs with dimensions of 2150 x 2150 x 150 mm were tested. Four of the specimens, two identical pairs, were cast with <b>shear</b> <b>studs</b> around the point of impact. Remaining four specimens, again two identical pairs, were cast with 1 % steel fibers. Pairs in each group contained two different levels of longitudinal reinforcement. For each pair, one specimen was tested under static loading, whereas its identical twin was tested under impact loads. Specimens were tested with a test setup that provides simply supported conditions. Support loads, displacements, accelerations, and strains on bars were measured during the tests. The study revealed that using <b>shear</b> <b>studs</b> and SFRC prevents brittle punching shear failure for both static and impact loading.

The most common shear connector is the headed <b>shear</b> <b>stud.</b> In the current AASHTO LRFD Bridge Specifications on composite design, <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> fatigue often governs over static strength, {{and a large number}} of shear connectors often result. This dissertation investigates headed <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> fatigue capacities and demands, and provides insight into conservancies in existing design specifications through examination of existing high-traffic bridge performance. To investigate stud capacity, a total of six high-cycle fatigue tests are conducted on stud pushout specimens at low stress ranges and combined with existing experimental data to develop probabilistic S-N fatigue capacity curves. Results from composite push-out specimens tested at stress ranges between 4. 4 and 8. 7 ksi suggest a fatigue limit of 6. 5 ksi, which is near the existing limit of 7 ksi. Recommendations for modification of the existing AASHTO finite-life <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> S-N fatigue capacity curve are proposed. In addition to experimental testing, a finite element parametric study considers the effects of stud pitch, girder depth, and girder span on shear flow demands. Results from the parametric study indicate that the shear forces within stud clusters are not captured by current AASHTO shear flow demand estimations. A new design method and updated formulation for predicting stud demands are presented. To examine high-traffic bridge performance, residual fatigue life is investigated by further fatigue testing, as well as magnetic particle inspection and dye penetrant testing on two existing bridges. The lack of discovered fatigue cracks within the studs of the bridges investigated suggests that the shear stress range estimation in AASHTO specification is higher than what is actually experienced. This discrepancy is likely due to shear transfer through adhesion and friction, which are not considered in AASHTO design calculations. Fatigue tests from sections of the decommissioned bridge exceeded the design life expectancy of approximately 850, 000 cycles (at 11. 6 ksi) by over 2, 500, 000 cycles.

40|$|Cast-in-place bridge decks {{are known}} to have {{transverse}} cracking early {{in the life of the}} bridge due to shrinkage and temperature effects.

For steel bridges, this bond is caused by <b>shear</b> <b>studs</b> welded to the steel beams and embedded in the cast-in-place deck. Prevention or closure of these cracks could greatly increase the durability of the bridge. The following research focuses on introducing a system that will have delayed composite action, allowing strain in the concrete before it becomes composite with the girder. The system is meant to reduce or eliminate transverse cracks before behaving as a fully composite section. Additionally, post-tensioning is used to put compressive strain on the concrete deck before bonding to the <b>shear</b> <b>studs</b> in order to prevent cracking once composite behavior is achieved. The results of this research prove to be promising.

40|$|Extensive {{research}} {{dating back}} to 1965 has been conducted on the fatigue performance of headed <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> connectors in steel and cast-in-place composite girders. However, {{little research has been}} conducted specifically on the fatigue performance of headed <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> connectors clustered into pockets. It seems that design provisions for pocketed shear connectors have been established assuming their performance is no different than that of continuous connectors, based on limited tests, terminated before failure, primarily on direct shear specimens that do not precisely model the loading that a shear connector is subjected to in a bridge girder. This research study investigates the fatigue behaviour of continuous and grouped <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> connectors for cast-in-place and precast deck applications, respectively. A total of six cast-in-place and six precast composite beams have been fabricated, instrumented, fatigued to failure, and monitored in order to generate new, valuable fatigue data. This data will improve the understanding of the fatigue behaviour of headed studs in composite beam specimens subjected to static and variable amplitude loading. An autopsy program is implemented to further investigate the fatigue cracking behaviour of the shear connectors. The findings provide clear evidence that studs in precast application perform differently compared to cast-in-place as different fatigue cracking patterns were observed. Two non-linear finite element models have also been assembled in ABAQUS and compared to the results collected from the physical experiments. Additionally, a concrete shrinkage simulation is completed on the cast-in-place model to investigate its effect on the fatigue cracking behaviour. The results from this simulation are found to agree with the observed cracking patterns. S-N regression analyses are completed to determine the mean regression curve corresponding to a 50 % survival probability. In this analysis, the stress ranges assigned to the studs were determined utilizing three methods that introduced three levels of conservatism. In every case, the precast specimens were found to outperform the cast-in-place in terms of fatigue performance. The findings in this study propose that the cast-in-place and precast specimens have a greater conformity with a fatigue resistance curve defined by a Category D and Category C detail, respectively.

40|$|Experimental {{studies on}} the newly {{proposed}} design of plate-reinforced composite (PRC) coupling beams have been carried out. Previous results have demonstrated the useful application of this design in coupling beams of medium span-to-depth ratios (l/h) under both inelastic seismic and elastic wind loading. This paper presents further experimental studies on five PRC coupling beams, which investigated the importance of shear connectors on plate/reinforced concrete composite action. Three medium-length (l/h= 2. 5) and two short (l/h= 1. 17) PRC coupling beams, each containing a vertically embedded steel plate, were tested under reversed cyclic loading. While one short beam was welded with expanded metal meshes on the plate surfaces, others were welded with <b>shear</b> <b>studs</b> on the plates in the wall regions and/or the beam spans. Results showed that the expanded metal meshes did not work effectively, and while the <b>shear</b> <b>studs</b> in the beam span only slightly increased the beam capacity, those in the wall regions contributed considerably in improving inelastic beam performance. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
