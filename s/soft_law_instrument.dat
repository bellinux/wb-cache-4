In the Netherlands, the constitutional dialogue between the legislator and the Dutch Supreme Court revolving around the principle of equality demonstrates a fair amount of subtle details. As a result, constitutional review can hardly be called an all or nothing affair. Secondly, retroactive tax legislation is dealt with. The legislator does seem to take the principle of legal certainty, another fundamental legal principle, quite seriously, although no testing of statutory legislation is possible by the courts. With regard to retroactive tax legislation the Government has committed itself in a memorandum, requested by Parliament, to adhere to rules of conduct with regard to different situations where it deems retroactive tax legislation to be justified.

That is why some refer to IML as “substance without architecture” or describe it as a “giant unassembled juridical jigsaw puzzle, [in which] the number of pieces is still uncertain and the grand design is still emerging”.

40|$|On January 11, 2007, the People’s Republic of China {{conducted}} a successful test of an anti-satellite weapon {{against one of}} its own aging weather satellites that produced a massive cloud of long-lasting orbital debris in space. The test highlighted both the growing possibility that orbital debris may ultimately render space unusable for all activities there and the reality of an increasingly militarized, contested and insecure geopolitical space environment. Largely in response to this incident, and in an effort to enhance the safety, security and sustainability of space activities, the European Union developed a draft “International Code of Conduct for Activities in Outer Space” (the ICoC or the Code) in 2008. The proposed Code, which continues to be debated by the international community, {{is an example of a}} legally non-binding 2 ̆ 2 soft law 2 ̆ 2 instrument which also contains broad, imprecise statements of principles. While soft law has made important contributions to the legal and administrative framework that governs space, the Code does not hold such promise. Instead, this article argues that the Code is a case study in the limitations of soft law, particularly when employed as a mechanism to regulate military activities and weapons in a highly insecure environment. Moreover, it is notably ill-suited in this context and in its design to successfully address the critical problem of orbital space debris. As a <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>instrument</b> with both soft law’s general limitations and its own particular shortcomings, the Code is an ineffective measure that distracts attention from more meaningful initiatives to reduce orbital debris while at the same time risking increasing tensions in space, diminishing the existing legal framework governing space activities, and negatively affecting the future development of space law...|$|E
40|$|Corruption is {{a global}} problem that {{undermines}} the rule of law, democratic governance and sustainable development. Widespread corruption also leads to systemic human rights violations. The current legal framework dealing with corruption, as represented by the UNCAC, focuses on the criminalization of corrupt acts. The reason for such a narrow legal regime {{can be found in}} the impetus of the anti-corruption movement in the 1990 s which was focused on the international economy rather than on social issues. Therefore, it is the argument herein that the law does not fully encompass the magnitude of the corruption problem due to the fact that it lacks any consideration for third parties whose human rights are violated by such acts. This paper demonstrates the inadequacy of the law by applying it to the situation of grand corruption plaguing the logging industry in Papua New Guinea. Current law in place to combat corruption does not adequately address the human rights implications involved in corruption, both in causing it and as a result of it. A change in the perception of corruption must occur in the international community whereby human rights is an integral part of the overall understanding of corruption. Then may the existing gap in international corruption law be bridged so as to include a human rights component. The law should not only address the victims whose human rights have been violated but provide them an effective remedy as well. Two alternatives are proposed for how the corruption legal regime can be expanded to provide for human rights protection, the use of a <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>instrument</b> and a binding protocol to the UNCAC. A more holistic corruption legal regime which includes human rights would be better able to prevent and control corruption...|$|E

40|$|Cet article explore l’efficacité de la Déclaration {{relative}} aux principes et droits fondamentaux au travail en tant que réponse aux défis posés par une mondialisation considérée essentiellement sur le plan économique. La Déclaration a été adoptée en 1998 par l’Organisation internationale du Travail (OIT) et visait à arrimer le développement économique au progrès social en établissant un corps universel de droits socio-économiques. Au regard des sources traditionnelles du droit international public, la Déclaration soulève pourtant un certain nombre de difficultés. Premièrement, elle s’apparente à un instrument de soft law, c’est-à-dire à un instrument incitatif dénué {{de force}} obligatoire. Deuxièmement, la Déclaration ne s’adresse pas directement aux acteurs réels de la mondialisation contemporaine, les entreprises mondialisées, mais aux États. À partir de ces critiques, la conjoncture ayant mené à l’adoption de la Déclaration fera l’objet d’une attention particulière et permettra de mieux mesurer les effets juridiques de cet instrument normatif au sein et à l’extérieur de l’OIT. This {{article examines the}} efficiency of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up {{as a response to the}} challenges brought forth by a globalization which, until now, has been mainly understood in economic terms. The International Labour Organization adopted in June 1998 the ILO Declaration to ensure that social progress goes hand in hand with economic growth. In order to maintain the link between the two, the ILO Declaration sets forth the obligation to all members, even if they have not ratified the Conventions recognized as fundamental both outside and inside the ILO Organization, to respect, promote and to implement the principles which are the subject of those Conventions. These include: the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to bargain collectively; the elimination of all forms of forced labour; the effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. In accordance with the Constitution, this obligation to all Members arises from the very fact of membership in the Organization. Thus the Declaration seeks to ensure a minimal universal social basis to certain international rules, independently of differences between States. However, the Declaration presents certain problems with regard to the traditional sources of public international law. First, it resembles a <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>instrument,</b> meaning an instrument that may influence and encourage but which has no obligatory force. Furthermore, this instrument stems from an international organization, which is a secondary subject of public international law in comparison with the sovereign State. Second, the Declaration does not directly address itself to the actors of contemporary globalization such as multinational firms and companies, but also the States. In this respect, how could such an instrument really tackle the inequitable effects of contemporary economic globalization? Did the 1998 ILO declaration give birth to a mouse?In the light of these criticisms, this article describes the circumstances of the negotiations which led to the adoption of the Declaration. The specific context of the time shows how there was a climate of internal ideological tension between the ILO Members regarding what kind of strategy to follow. There was also an institutional necessity for the Organization to act in order to reposition itself on the international chessboard at the end of the XXth century. The adoption of the Declaration constituted the smallest common denominator between the Members. In order to convince its Members, the ILO made use of its constitutional resources – as it has done so in the past. Finally, the legal effects of the Declaration, inside as well as outside the ILO, are examined. Ironically, even though the ILO Declaration is a <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>instrument</b> and was presented to Members as such, it is able to achieve the same results as a hard law instrument would have done in terms of the ratification of fundamental conventions. Moreover, in thinking about the impact beyond the ILO, in setting minimal social standards for all, multinational firms and alike, the ILO Declaration is building a strong public opinion around those rights at work. This, in turn, is surely a way to implement them efficiently. Este artículo explora la eficacia de la Declaración relativa a los principios y derechos fundamentales del trabajo como respuesta a los desafíos planteados por una mundialización consideradas esencialmente en el plano economico. La Declaración fue adoptada en 1998 por la Organización Internacional de Trabajo (OIT) y buscaba vincular el desarrollo económico al progreso social estableciendo un cuerpo universal de derechos socio-económicos. En cuanto a las fuentes tradicionales de derecho público internacional, la Declaración suscita sin embargo un cierto número de dificultades. En primer lugar, ella se aparenta a un instrumento de « sof law », es decir, un instrumento incitativo desprovisto de fuerza obligatoria. En segundo lugar, la Declaración no se dirige directamente a los actores reales de la mundialización contemporánea, las empresas mundializadas, sino mas bien a los Estados. A partir de estas criticas, la coyuntura que ha llevado a la adopción de la Declaración será el objeto de una atención particular y permitirá de medir mejor los efectos jurídicos de este instrumento normativo al interior y al exterior de la OIT...|$|E

This paper addresses this question through a survey of companies’ policies and practices as expressed in their CSR statements and responses to questionnaires of publicly listed companies as published by The Times (London) in the Industrials, Telecoms and Technology sectors...|$|R
40|$|The European Employment Strategy (EES) aims {{to promote}} {{convergence}} of domestic {{labour market policies}} by <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>instruments.</b> Previous studies {{on the impact of}} the EES are mainly focused on active labour market policies. The present study aims at explaining cross national variation in national passive labour market policies and unemployment benefit levels. Building on the most recent measures and pooled time series data, the empirical findings reveal the presence of a convergence process among the most advanced economies regarding passive labour market policy efforts, with the EES fostering this trend even further. Furthermore, our findings support the argument that the EES creates pressure on governments to reform domestic labour market policies, but this pressure varies across countries and over time. The results suggest that the recommendations from the European Council have contributed to unemployment benefit reform processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of establishing legal order sui generis {{that on the}} EU level will, due to its flexibility and differentiation, be able to effectively respond to dynamic movements of internal market {{as well as to}} globalization challenges in general, {{in the last two decades}} lead to extensive transformations of the EU legal order. One of them is growing importance of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>instruments</b> and subsequent differentiation of legal regulation – to traditional regulation new modes of regulation have been added (as a result of so called “new legislative culture”). Although at first when adopting the decision, the Court of the European Union denied the recognition of existence and function of <b>soft</b> <b>law,</b> later the Court gradually adapted to differentiating trend in the EU legal order and is thus nowadays recognizing the normative value of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> in the EU. When deriving the decision the Court is considering <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> as part of legal framework (in this case <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> is used as a ground for interpretation of hard law provision or as an instrument of confi rmation of interpretation of binding law) or it recognizes self-binding and binding effect of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> (in this case soft instrument is a substantive rule on which the decision is grounded). With such approach, to <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> normative status is conferred; the latter – despite it being on the non-binding side – is therefore having indirect legal effect and is creating indirect legal consequences...|$|R
40|$|With {{vast amounts}} of {{financial}} and intellectual capital already being spent on international harmonization, inefficiencies infecting the lawmaking process render it ineffective and threaten the goodwill of the whole enterprise. This paper represents a synthesis {{of some of the}} most meaningful criticism about the perceived failures of the classic vehicle for harmonization—international conventions. In it, we have highlighted these failures, looked for their underlying causes, and searched for compelling <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> alternatives. This paper seeks to show that, above all, conventions suffer from over ambition. By intervening in the legal marketplace, underestimating national distrust and legal conflict, and insisting on uniformity, conventions create a rigid enterprise that simply tries to do too much. <b>Soft</b> <b>law,</b> on the other hand, embraces the organic emergence of law from practice, in which best solutions rise to the top. In doing so, <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> creates rules as they “should ” be, while conventions create rules as they “must ” be—the fragmentary result of compromised consensus. It would be a misconception to envisage a future of harmonization and unification of commercial law solely driven by the market operators and loosely framed by <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> <b>instruments.</b> However, it would be a similar misconception to envisage a future in which conventions operated on a business-as-usual basis. Thus, in the areas most fraught with failure, this paper seeks t...|$|R
