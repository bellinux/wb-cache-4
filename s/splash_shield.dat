40|$|BACKGROUND:  Utilization {{of fluid}} to remove debris from {{surgical}} wounds {{has been a}} standard of medical care for centuries. Electrically powered pulse lavage systems are now regularly used to flush wounds in the operating room. This study aims to characterize splash patterns and contamination generated by different irrigation techniques commonly used {{in the treatment of}} surgical wounds. METHODS: 4 different irrigation scenarios: gravity flow (GF), asepto bulb syringe (ABS), high pressure pulsatile lavage without <b>splash</b> <b>shield</b> (HPPL), and high pressure pulsatile lavage with splash shielding (HPPL-S) were conducted on a Sawbone® knee model anchored to a standard operating table in a fully operational operating room of a community hospital. Normal saline supplemented with Fluorescein dye was utilized as the fluid.   The OR was divided into 4 quadrants and surveyed with a UV light source to characterize the presence of fluorescent fluid/droplets and radius of droplet displacement. RESULTS: The HPPL trials contaminated the entire room with droplets that were too numerous to count. The HPPL-S trials reduced the number of droplets in quadrants outside of the “head right” quadrants, to a range of 0 - 12 droplets. In addition, the HPPL-S trial reduced the droplet distance to levels comparable to or below the GF and ABS droplet distance. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to characterize splash patterns seen with different irrigation systems. The addition of an inexpensive splashguard during high-pressure irrigation drastically reduced splash displacement.   Decreased splash displacement theoretically reduces OR contamination and the resultant risk of nosocomial contamination...|$|E
40|$|Space {{applications}} that utilize {{solar thermal energy}} [...] such as electric power conversion systems, thermal propulsion systems, and furnaces [...] require highly efficient solar concentration systems. The NASA Glenn Research Center is developing the refractive secondary concentrator, which uses refraction and total internal reflection to efficiently concentrate and direct solar energy. When used in combination with advanced lightweight primary concentrators, such as inflatable thin films, the refractive secondary concentrator enables very high system concentration ratios and very high temperatures. Last year, Glenn successfully demonstrated a secondary concentrator throughput efficiency of 87 percent, with a projected efficiency of 93 percent using an antireflective coating. Building on this achievement, Glenn recently successfully demonstrated high-temperature operation of the secondary concentrator when {{it was used to}} heat a rhenium receiver to 2330 F. The high-temperature demonstration of the concentrator was conducted in Glenn's 68 -ft long Tank 6 thermal vacuum facility equipped with a solar simulator. The facility has a rigid panel primary concentrator that was used to concentrate the light from the solar simulator onto the refractive secondary concentrator. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center provided a rhenium cavity, part of a solar thermal propulsion engine, to serve as the high-temperature receiver. The prototype refractive secondary concentrator, measuring 3. 5 in. in diameter and 11. 2 in. long, is made of single-crystal sapphire. A water-cooled <b>splash</b> <b>shield</b> absorbs spillage light outside of the 3. 5 -in. concentrator aperture. Multilayer foil insulation composed of tungsten, molybdenum, and niobium is used to minimize heat loss from the hightemperature receiver. A liquid-cooled canister calorimeter is used to measure the heat loss through the multilayer foil insulation...|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} {{production}} {{versions of the}} Welbike. The first 1,200 were known as the Mark 1 and were really the developed version of the original prototype with tuned engines. These {{did not have a}} rear mudguard fitted however. 1,400 Mark 2 Series 1 Welbikes were produced and these had a range of minor modifications, including the addition of the rear mudguard. The final batch of 1,340 was the Mark 2 Series 2 and had 'saddle' fuel tanks with a <b>splash</b> <b>shielding</b> between them and an improved filler cap, as the original design required the removal of the pressurisation pump which was too time consuming.|$|R

50|$|He is also tied {{more closely}} to the origin of Skeletor, having battled Skeletor {{when he was still}} Keldor during a war the Eternians call The Great Unrest. That war ended when Keldor and his forces {{attacked}} the Hall of Wisdom, home of the Elders, and Keldor and Randor engaged in a deadly duel that ended with Keldor hurling acid at Randor, only to have Randor deflect the acid with his <b>shield,</b> <b>splashing</b> the acid back at Keldor and burning his face, which led to his transformation into Skeletor. It is revealed by a writer that in this continuity Keldor and Randor are half-brothers, but it is never revealed if either knew that.|$|R
