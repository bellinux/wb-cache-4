5|$|A sexual {{harassment}} lawsuit was filed against Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{in the previous}} episode, and she must take a {{sexual harassment}} training as a result. In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one of her neighbors, Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She understands how Liz feels because she was just like Liz and tells her there are better ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> their lifestyle that she forgets to watch her show, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting {{to come back to}} work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane). She goes back to hanging out with Emily and her friends, but soon discovers that they are a Girl Fight Club, which disappoints Liz. In order for her to get out, Liz needs to fight them.|$|E

500|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The game's inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason it's never really bothersome. Most of the time you're <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the game that you don't notice it, and when you do, you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is just too much fun to dwell on such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Dark's character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|E

50|$|In the 1870s and 1880s, the {{democratic}} movement {{was at its}} height, {{and one of its}} chief leaders was Taisuke Itagaki (1837-1919) from Kochi Prefecture... The prefectural governor of Ehime and the principal of Shiki's school. Though the principal had to resign in the summer of 1879 because of his radical views, his influence remained strong at Matsuyama Middle School. For some years after his departure, democratic thought reigned at the school; yet after the principal's departure many students left, and their numbers decreased from 213 in 1879 to 102 in 1881. Among those strongly influenced by the former principal was Shiki.

2500|$|Cherryh's works depict {{fictional worlds}} with great realism {{supported}} by her strong background in languages, history, archaeology, and psychology. In her introduction to Cherryh's first book, Andre Norton compared {{the effect of}} the work to Tolkien's: [...] "Never since reading The Lord of the Rings have I been <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> any tale as I have been in Gate of Ivrel." [...] Another reviewer commented, [...] "Her blend of science and folklore gives the novels an intellectual depth comparable to Tolkien or Gene Wolfe". [...] Cherryh creates believable alien cultures, species, and perspectives, causing the reader to reconsider basic assumptions about human nature. Her worlds have been praised as complex and realistic because she presents them through implication rather than explication. She describes the difficulties of translating/expressing concepts between differing languages. This is best demonstrated in both the Chanur and Foreigner series.|$|E

50|$|The game {{starts out}} in 1942, {{with the main}} {{character}} saying that his reward for {{taking part in a}} special forces operation in Luxembourg is to serve in the Pacific War. He is part of a special forces group, and is a one-man-army. First, he is ordered to deliver a telegram to General Douglas MacArthur, fighting his way through the jungles of Corregidor to get to a PT boat that brings him to MacArthur. Afterwards, he serves on Guadalcanal, where he takes part in the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo, where he blows up a Japanese seaplane base, and later takes part in the destruction of Henderson Field, calling in airstrikes on key buildings. As a reward for his services, he was sent to Australia for R&R, but before he could do <b>so,</b> he was <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Milne Bay, where he escaped New Guinea with important documents after blowing up Japanese Zeroes with an AA gun. He goes to Australia, and returns to duty when he is sent to Buna-Gona to steal communication codes from beach houses. He finds a dead Japanese officer, and the officer's suicide troubles the main character mentally, as he is confused about it. After this mission, he is sent to Truk to search for communication codes. The next missions involve him heading to Guam to save POWs from a camp and going to Tinian to call in airstrikes on key storehouses that the naval bombardment missed. Finally, he is sent to Iwo Jima to blow up huge artillery pieces in Mt. Suribachi, and the story ends there.|$|R

40|$|Jacques Maritain, {{although}} now {{largely ignored}} in France except for opportunistic re-appropriations of his work, was {{and still is}} highly esteemed in North (and South) America. This thesis examines the extent to which Maritain himself is responsible for the unevenness of his reputation, besides the part played by relevant geopolitical events. It also questions how much his readers have contributed by selecting from the complex mosaic of his work those things which suit their purposes. The thesis examines the core tenet of Maritain’s work: the tension between the ‘esprit dur’ of his inflexible Thomist theology and philosophy and the ‘coeur doux’ of his liberal humanitarianism. This tension is examined {{from the standpoint of the}} Second Vatican Council and Maritain’s response to those pivotal years in the Catholic Church, his self-declared testament, Le Paysan de la Garonne. Maritain’s contribution to the Council and its aftermath, especially as applied to consideration of the Church’s position on ‘la question juive’, helped to seal the fate of his jagged reputation. The research analyses Maritain’s key outputs contextually during a period of massive upheaval and shows their expansive influence. The dialogic approach to the works encompasses not only French but North American sources. The thesis also analyses correspondence between Maritain and his close friend Cardinal Journet, which has not before been the subject of significant analysis, enabling a deeper reading of Le Paysan de la Garonne and what lay behind the book, fifty years after its publication. This multi-disciplinary thesis, relevant to French studies, philosophy, intellectual history, politics and religious studies, makes a compelling case for a reappraisal of Maritain’s legacy - an individual <b>so</b> often ‘homme-carrefour’, <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> key twentieth-century events and yet also having a vital influence on them...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an account of}} the ontological, methodological and epistemological foundations of theoretical finance. I argue that these are linked: financial theory is not just a positive enquiry into the nature of the world, but also a means to engineer it. A core feature of its methodology is a modelling approach that conceives of risk as being identical with the volatility of financial market returns. I argue that this can be justified from the perspective of finance as a positive science, because it successfully points to some real features by using idealisations and simplifications. However, I argue that this feature makes theoretical finance inadequate for the task of designing institutions in certain specific ways. I argue that the epistemic demands we make of models in the service of finance theory are different to the demands we should make of models that are used as blueprints for institutions. A failure to appreciate this difference contributed to the financial crisis and our failure to anticipate it. Finance theory has various effects on the financial system <b>so</b> is causally <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> social ontology, a notion known as “performativity”. I argue that financial theory and its models affect the workings of the financial system in three ways: they provide positive accounts of the financial system that individuals can learn from, they provide normative calculative devices to determine optimal decisions, and finally they provides blueprints for the design of financial institutions. We have in the past assumed that models that succeed in supporting financial theories because of their coherence and validation by data will also be successful blueprints. However, good tests of blueprints should be inductive and assess for unexpected properties, quite unlike how we test theory models. It follows that we have insufficient reason to assume good theory models are good blueprints...|$|R
40|$|I {{am pleased}} {{to be here with}} you today to discuss Animal Damage Control (ADC). I am also very pleased to see the number of ADC people {{attending}} this conference. It is an important indication of our professionalism. During the past several months, I have spoken to many of our people in ADC to challenge them to think about the future of our program. I have also spoken to many of our cooperators such as livestock organizations and resource management agencies about the same thing. This has been done in an effort to broaden our thinking about animal damage control as a service or profession, and as a program delivering that professional service. We are controlled by our paradigm which might be described as the lens of our mind 2 ̆ 7 s eye. It might also be called the sum total of our experiences that govern how we see things or interpret what our eyes see. Over the 2 ̆ 7 years, a paradigm has been created about ADC which to the 2 ̆ 2 non-user 2 ̆ 2 or observer of our program has been extremely negative. This in turn has resulted in another paradigm by the service beneficiaries and professionals within the program which has become competitive with the other. Over the years, this has produced highly independent thinking and action by each group operating within the constraints of their own paradigm. In ADC, this independence has produced a mind set so strong that it has become life-threatening to our program and the profession. We have to realistically confess that in maintaining this independence we have been narrow-minded, even close-minded to new ideas. Our thinking had become so homogenous that new ideas or thoughts which did not meet our 2 ̆ 2 tradition test 2 ̆ 2 or were outside our paradigm were viewed with suspicion, and those who harbored such thoughts were ostracized by their peers. Our thinking was so inbred and our defense mechanism so strong that opportunities for change could not even be seen, much less acted upon. We became <b>so</b> independent and <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> our paradigm that anyone who criticized the program or its actions was viewed with the same suspicion; we made no distinction between constructive professional or scientific critique and the views of animal welfarists or animal rightists. We were so programmed to act within the ADC paradigm that it began to act as a rope around our necks; the more we struggled, the tighter {{it got to the point}} we almost hanged ourselves...|$|R
