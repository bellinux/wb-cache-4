40|$|Most water <b>supply</b> <b>programmes</b> in Cambodia {{have focused}} on {{providing}} access to bacteriologically safe water, an approach {{which has led to}} an increasing reliance on ground water, especially in rural areas. However, there have been very few data collected on the chemical quality of the nation’s drinking water sources, and few water <b>supply</b> <b>programmes</b> have the capacity to assess chemical quality. The study was designed to address this data gap by conducting a low-cost, rapid assessment of drinking water sources nationwide to determine whether there were any chemicals of concern in Cambodian water supply sources. Results of the assessment confirm that there are several parameters of health and aesthetic concern; dissolved arsenic is the most significant. Elevated arsenic levels (some exceeding 500 mg l 21) were detected in aquifers of moderate depth in several highly populated areas, confirming that further investigation of the occurrence of arsenic contamination in Cambodia is warranted. Other chemicals of health concern include nitrate, nitrite, fluoride and manganese. Additionally, many ground water sources are negatively impacted by parameters of aesthetic concern, such as iron, manganese, hardness and total dissolved solids. Elevated levels of these parameters have caused consumers to reject newly installed water supplies, often in favour of surface water sources that are bacteriologically unsafe.

The enquiry examines the underlying reasons that affected these decisions to show how socio-political fear of the potential impact commercial television might have on UK society impinged on the outcomes that prevailed and how changes occurred as this fear diminished. To achieve this aim, the investigation first focuses on the make/buy conditions impinging on decisions that led to the start up phase of UK commercial television.

40|$|Many {{nations in}} Sub-Saharan Africa, {{supported}} by donors, have increased efforts in their rural water supply programmes {{within the last}} few decades. However, these programmes suffer {{from a range of}} challenges and problems and, according to recent figures, over half of rural inhabitants in Sub-Saharan Africa lack access to safe water supplies. In order to improve the delivery of rural water services, effective monitoring and evaluation can provide support. Uganda has recently been recognised for improving its national programme for rural water supply. Furthermore, the country has also introduced programme monitoring and evaluation. However, these undertakings have not been unproblematic. Based on interviews and a document review, this study identifies challenges and difficulties that Uganda has encountered in developing both rural water supply and the corresponding monitoring and evaluation framework. From an analysis of the results, it is apparent that both the rural water <b>supply</b> <b>programme</b> and the monitoring and evaluation frame-work are constrained by political and institutional factors at district level. As a way forward, it is suggested that the roles and responsibilities currently accorded to district politicians are re-thought. Capacity-building efforts should be expanded, and should encompass other district actors such as politicians and extension workers. Monitoring and evaluation of the rural water <b>supply</b> <b>programme</b> could be improved by strengthening its relevance at district level. While further capacity-building efforts may promote its relevance, monitoring and evaluation could also be developed together with district actors in order to better support district decision-making processes. Such actions could help in overcoming current difficulties, and could lead to better information management in support of the rural water <b>supply</b> <b>programme.</b> QC 2010112...|$|E
40|$|MM thesis - P&DMThe Ghana {{government}} {{introduction of}} the weija dam water <b>supply</b> <b>programme</b> to the Accra Metropolis is faced {{with the problem of}} inability to expand the treatment plant and in particular, water supply to Kasoa community. This research study focused on the Kasoa district as a case study and examines underlying reasons that contribute to the problem of inadequate water supply to the district. In order to understand technical and social dynamics around the problem of scarce water supply in the Kasoa district, the research focused on the water meter distribution system which forms part of the water supply implementation strategy. The research fundamentally used qualitative methodology with Kasoa district as the case study for collect of in-depth information from informants. Quantitative tools are used in data presentation and analysis. The purpose of this research was to investigate the problem of inadequate water supply to Kasoa community and develop how the meter system could be improved. The research shows that the water <b>supply</b> <b>programme</b> initiative has been fairly successful in the kasoa district. However, incidence of corruption in the form of selling water meters hinder the programme from achieving its objective of ensuring water gets to every home in the community as evidenced by some pockets of hungry community district managers and water billing officials in the district.
