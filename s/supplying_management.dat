40|$|As {{supply chain}} {{managers}} spend well above 60 % {{of their total}} working time remedying disruptions along the value chain, they require the support of interorganizational information systems {{that allow them to}} focus their attention on the critical problems. In addition, each action they decide on needs to be aligned with the overall network strategy to sustain the supply chain's competitive edge. However, research has only been very limited in this area. Commercially available Supply Chain Event Management-suites are a first step into this direction but so far lack important aspects like diagnostic analyses and integration into existing management and controlling frameworks. Based on a network-wide capturing of performance measurement data and alerting mechanisms in case key figures or process metrics do not meet their targets or exceed pre-set limits, this paper describes a computerized symptom-to-therapy cycle starting with recognizing performance deviations all the way to diagnosing the underlying root causes and <b>supplying</b> <b>management</b> with possible reaction measures to steer clear of the problem.

40|$|Today’s global {{purchasing}} and <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> combines {{two main}} perspectives: sourcing and <b>supply</b> chain <b>management.</b> The {{main focus of}} sourcing is on searching and selecting suppliers, while <b>supply</b> chain <b>management</b> focuses on developing logistics and supply processes in collaboration between supply chain partners. Our research agenda focuses on the challenges in combining sourcing and <b>supply</b> chain <b>management</b> perspectives. The tentative research perspectives in our research agenda include the following: the management system for global purchasing and <b>supply</b> <b>management,</b> evolution of purchasing and <b>supply</b> <b>management,</b> purchasing and <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> capabilities in a globally operating firm, and attractivity of the buying firm towards desired suppliers...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{generally}} positive contribution of <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> capabilities to firm performance their respective routines require more depth of assessment. Using the resource-based view we examine four routines bundles comprising ostensive and performative aspects of <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> capability – <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> integration, coordinated sourcing, collaboration management and performance assessment. Using structural equation modelling we measure <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> capability empirically as a second-order latent variable and estimate {{its effect on}} a series of financial and operational performance measures. The routines-based approach allows us to demonstrate a different, more fine-grained approach for assessing consistent bundles of homogeneous patterns of activity across firms. The results suggest <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> capability is formed of internally consistent routine bundles, which are significantly related to financial performance, mediated by operational performance. Our results confirm an indirect effect of firm performance for ‘core’ routines forming the architecture of a <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> capability. <b>Supply</b> <b>management</b> capability primarily improves the operational performance of the business, which is subsequently translated into improved financial performance. The study is significant for practice as it offers a different view about the face-valid rationale of <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> directly influencing firm financial performance.

40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 A {{literature}} study {{was done on}} the concepts of purchasing and <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> to develop a framework of purchasing and <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> in a mine. A questionnaire was designed, {{based on the findings}} in the literature, and to assist to develop a framework of sustainable purchasing and <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> process and procedure towards value creation in a mine. The state of the internal purchasing and <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> process and procedures was assessed through a survey questionnaire to extract the data. The elements of procurement and <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> were broken down into clear activities towards the creation of value in a mine. The key area of concern is to ensure adherence to proper processes and procedures to create an environment that is conducive towards the objectives of the mine and install a mechanism that is measurable. The focus on procurement and <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> towards value creation has became the key determining factor in the mine. A practical development framework of sustainable purchasing and <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> manage towards value is proposed for a mine and to address the gaps found after analysing the questionnaires. The findings of the empirical study and the literature review were used as the basis of the framework. In this thesis the main focus was Purchasing and <b>Supply</b> <b>Management</b> process and procedures, and Contract Management. The relationship between procurement in the <b>supply</b> chain <b>management</b> process and its functional departments is critical towards sustainable development and value creation.

40|$|The {{purchase}} of business services {{has become an}} important part of organizations' acquisition of external resources, and is therefore receiving growing scholarly attention. The <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> function is increasingly supporting more complex service purchases, including a wide range of marketing services. The trend to involve <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> in the {{purchase of}} these complex business services is partially being driven by increasing awareness of the value of applying standard purchasing techniques to the purchase of these non-standard items. The purchase of such services has historically been managed by content experts, with limited involvement of <b>supply</b> <b>management.</b> However, the involvement of <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> in these purchases is driving the content experts to adopt a more facilitating relationship in which both areas interact with the supplier. This research uses Agency Theory as a lens to look at the Agency Triad among <b>supply</b> <b>management,</b> marketing, and suppliers.

In this research, we explore the concept of <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> alignment, defined as the behavioral characteristics and process requirements for understanding and explicitly outlining internal stakeholder needs, and linking these to supplier performance agreements. Using the lens of dynamic capabilities, we propose a theoretical model for creating <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> alignment.

The underlying set of requirements to achieve <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> alignment is proposed and tested in this model, thereby {{enhancing our understanding of}} the processes and behaviors required for integration of internal stakeholder needs with external suppliers, which can lead to improved performance.
