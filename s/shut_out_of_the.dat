5|$|On October 12, Harris {{was named}} to the 21-player roster that would {{represent}} the United States at the 2004 FIFA Women's World Championship in Thailand. Harris was captain of the team and played every minute in all six matches of the tournament for the United States. Harris started in net in the opening group match against South Korea on November 11 and recorded a shut out for a 3–0 win. She allowed one goal during the match against Russia on November 14 in a 4–1 win for the United States. She recorded her second <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament on November 18 against Spain in the team's final group match. The United States won 1–0 and was the only team to win all three of its group matches. In the quarterfinals, Harris posted her third shut out in the 2–0 win over Australia on November 21. The United States moved into the semifinals, where they faced Germany on November 24. Harris started in the net and allowed three goals during the match. The Germans took the win and halted the United States' advancement in the tournament. The United States faced Brazil in the third place match, where Harris played all 90 minutes. She made eight saves and recorded her fourth <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament. The United States won the game 3–0 and took away third place. Harris was subsequently named to the Tournament All-Star Team by the FIFA Technical Study Group. She was also a 2004 Chevrolet Athlete of the Year Award Finalist.|$|E
5|$|Saskatchewan Conservatives {{eventually}} {{arranged a}} leadership convention for October 28, 1936. Eleven people were nominated, including Diefenbaker. The other ten candidates all deemed the provincial party in such hopeless shape that they withdrew, and Diefenbaker won the position by default. Diefenbaker asked the federal party for $10,000 in financial support, but the funds were refused, and the Conservatives were <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legislature in the 1938 provincial {{elections for the}} second consecutive time. Diefenbaker himself was defeated in the Arm River riding by 190 votes. With the province-wide Conservative vote having fallen to 12%, Diefenbaker offered his resignation to a post-election party meeting in Moose Jaw, but it was refused. Diefenbaker continued to run the provincial party out of his law office, and paid the party's debts from his own pocket.|$|E
5|$|On April 28, Harris {{was named}} to the 18-player roster that would {{represent}} the United States at the CONCACAF U-19 Women's Qualifying Tournament held in Ottawa and Montreal, Canada. Harris was one of four members of the team that were also on the team that won the inaugural FIFA U-19 World Championship in 2002. She was also the most capped U-19 player on the roster. Harris recorded a shut out against Dominican Republic on May 28 for a 14–0 win. She then started in goal against Trinidad & Tobago on May 30. The lone goal for Trinidad & Tobago came during the 86th minute, after Kelsey Davis came on for Harris in the 62nd minute. The United States won the match 11–1, guaranteeing their spot in the semifinals. Harris recorded her second <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament on June 1 during the team's final group match against Costa Rica, which ended in a 0–0 draw. In the semifinal match against Mexico on June 4, Harris recorded another shut out. The 6–0 win secured the United States U-19 women's national team a place in the 2004 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship, although they still had one more match in the tournament. Harris started in the final against Canada on June 6. She made seven saves during the game and allowed two goals. Canada won the match in overtime.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Brown grew {{white to}} the lips, and he shrank back as though afraid or {{reluctant}} {{to enter the}} house. The door stood ajar. He pushed it open with his stick, and peered in upon the darkness. Everything was silent as the grave. He listened for a moment, and then, his natural courage returning, he stepped inside, {{and closed the door}} after him. <b>The</b> <b>shutting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few gleams <b>of</b> daylight which lingered in the sky left him in utter darkness. Fumbling in his pocket, he produced a wax candle wrapped in a piece of newspaper, and a box of matches, one of which he carefully struck.|$|R
5|$|Playing in a torrential downpour, the Buccaneers {{scored the}} first shutout in {{franchise}} history to clinch their first playoff berth and the NFC Central title. The Chiefs were held to a franchise-low 80 yards of total offense. Despite the rain, Ricky Bell claimed that the field had better traction than the dry field they had played on the week previously in San Francisco. Bell carried the ball 39 times for 137 yards in such bad weather that the game had to be played under lights. The Buccaneers lost four previous scoring opportunities to a fumble, two interceptions, and a fumbled snap on a field goal attempt. <b>Shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end zone on three tries with first-and-goal from the 9-yard line, the Buccaneers brought Neil O'Donoghue in to kick {{what would be the}} winning field goal with 8:50 remaining. Tampa Bay would hold the ball for all but four plays {{for the rest of the}} game. The Chiefs players gave the Buccaneers little credit after the victory, saying that the AFC was superior to the NFC and that the Buccaneers would never have won the AFC West.|$|E
25|$|SANZAR {{rejected}} {{a proposal to}} split the Super 14 into two seven-team divisions, and decided to keep the competition in its traditional single-table format. Argentina and the Pacific Islands remained <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the men who}} {{controlled}} the Jacobins rejected the Revolutionary Republican Women as dangerous rabble-rousers. At this point the Jacobins controlled the government; they dissolved the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, and decreed that all women's clubs and associations were illegal. They sternly reminded women {{to stay home and}} tend to their families by leaving public affairs to the men. Organised women were permanently <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution after October 30, 1793.|$|E
25|$|At {{its annual}} meeting in November 1917, the NHA {{announced}} that it was suspending operations because of the difficulties in running a five-team league and the player shortages introduced by conscription in Canada during the off-season. About a week later, all of the owners other than Livingstone announced that they had formed a new league, the National Hockey League. Livingstone was <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new league, but the NHL retained the contracts of the Toronto franchise players.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, its African-American and poor white populations were {{affected}} by changes to laws by the state legislature, which made voter registration and voting more difficult by requirements including imposition of a poll tax in 1889. The effect was to disenfranchise most blacks and many poor whites, after Tennessee {{had been one of}} the most competitive states politically after the Civil War. About one-third of the state's citizens were thus <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political process, a status that lasted for decades, until after passage of legislation during the mid-1960s as a result of the civil rights movement.|$|E

25|$|The Puget Sound Agricultural Company (PSAC), {{with common}} {{variations}} of the name including Puget Sound or Puget's Sound, was a subsidiary joint stock company formed in 1840 by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). Its stations operated within the Pacific Northwest, in the HBC administrative division of the Columbia Department. The RAC-HBC Agreement was signed in 1839 between the Russian-American Company and the HBC, with the British to now supply the various trade posts of Russian America. It was hoped by the HBC governing committee that independent American merchants, previously {{a major source of}} foodstuffs for the RAC, would be <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian markets and leave the Maritime fur trade.|$|E
25|$|A local {{version of}} a legend of Saint Nicholas (D'Seeche vum Zinniklos) refers to the danger of being shut outside the {{fortress}} gates for the night. Three boys were playing outside, and were {{far away from the}} city when the curfew was sounded: {{it was too late for}} them to return home. They sought refuge with a butcher who lived outside the city. At night-time, however, the butcher killed them to turn them into aspic. Luckily, a few days later, Saint Nicholas also found himself <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, and went to the same butcher's house. He found the children, and was able to bring them back to life.|$|E

In the free program, he skated steadily but tentatively, eliminating the second jump from his first planned combination and doubling a planned triple jump on another combination. However, the program was strong enough for Weir to win his first World medal – a bronze – and kept the United States from being <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medals at a World Championship {{for the first time since}} 1994.|$|E

25|$|Saskatchewan {{politics}} has tended towards a two-party system, with third parties enjoying limited political success. For the first 25 {{years of the}} province's existence, political power was split between the Saskatchewan Liberal Party in government, and the Conservatives (initially the Provincial Rights Party) in opposition. The emergence of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), forerunner of the NDP – a social democratic political party formed by the coming together of various socialist, agrarian and labour groups under a united front – forced the Liberals to the right. As a result of vote-splitting with the Liberals, the less popular Tories gradually lost ground in the Legislative Assembly, and were <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber altogether in 1934.|$|E
25|$|The reason {{given for}} the {{appointments}} of Emerson and Fortier was that the Conservatives were completely <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three most populous cities in Canada – Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. The Liberals were the only party to win seats in all three, with the Bloc represented in Montreal and the NDP in Toronto and Vancouver. Emerson's riding is Vancouver Kingsway, and Fortier {{lives and works in}} the Montreal-Laval area, and ran for the riding of Laval West for the Tories in 2000. The only major city this left out was Toronto, although the Conservatives have indicated that they consider that enough Cabinet Ministers are from the Greater Toronto Area, including Jim Flaherty and Bev Oda, to adequately represent the city in Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{after the}} {{announcement}} of the moving of the Philippine Idol franchise (titled Philippine Idol) from ABC to ABS-CBN's main rival GMA Network (there renamed as Pinoy Idol), there were already reports that because of their connections with ABS-CBN, Philippine Idol judge Ryan Cayabyab and host Ryan Agoncillo will join the Academy instead of reprising their roles in Pinoy Idol. Eventually, Cayabyab was named the Academy's new Headmaster, but Agoncillo was <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hosting plum. Instead, Billy Crawford was chosen as a new host for the show, heading the late afternoon show Pinoy Dream Academy Über-ture (which has a format similar to Pinoy Big Brother Über). Toni Gonzaga and Nikki Gil also alternate as main host for the second season.|$|E
50|$|Philadelphia {{opened its}} 1901 season with <b>shut</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conshohocken Tigers, the Orange Athletic Club, Susquehanna University and a tough squad from Lafayette College. Next Philadelphia {{had to play}} the 1901 Homestead Library & Athletic Club {{football}} team. Homestead was a successful team that gave up only seven points over a span of two seasons and was clearly <b>the</b> strongest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many competitive teams of Western Pennsylvania. In fact Homestead was considered it the best professional team in the nation. This match-up was generally accepted as <b>the</b> professional championship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. Both teams worked diligently {{to prepare for the}} game. However Philadelphia proved no match for the Homestead team and lost by a score <b>of</b> 18-0. <b>The</b> two teams then closed out their seasons in Pittsburgh the following Saturday. This time Philadelphia lost by a score of only 6-5. They held Homestead to a single touchdown and managed to score the only touchdown against the team in two seasons.|$|R
