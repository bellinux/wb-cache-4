40|$|The total {{structural}} {{intensity in}} beams {{can be considered}} as composed of three types of waves: bending, longitudinal, and torsional. In passive and active control applications, it is useful to separate each of these components in order to evaluate their contribution to the total structural power flowing through the beam. In this paper, a twisted z-shaped beam is used in order to allow the three types of waves to propagate. The contributions of the structural intensity, due to these waves, are computed from measurements taken over the surface of the beam with a simple homodyne interferometric laser vibrometer. The optical sensor incorporates some polarizing optics, additional to a Michelson type interferometer, to generate two optical <b>signals</b> <b>in</b> <b>quadrature,</b> which are processed to display velocities and/or displacements. This optical processing scheme is used to remove the directional ambiguity from the velocity measurement and allows nearly all back-scattered light collected from the object to be detect. This paper investigates the performance of the laser vibrometer in the estimation of the different wave components. The results are validated by comparing the total structural intensity computed from the laser measurements, with the measured input power. Results computed from measurements using PVDF sensors are also shown, and compared with the non-intrusive laser measurements...|$|R

40|$|This work {{explores the}} effects of weak {{nonlinearity}} on harmonic oscillators. Two particular systems are studied experimentally: A superconductingresonator formed from a coplanar waveguide that oscillates at microwave frequencies,and the cantilever of an atomic force microscope (AFM) vibratingat ultrasonic frequencies. Both of these systems are described in the introduction,followed by a theory chapter giving a general theoretical framework for nonlinear oscillators. Basic properties of nonlinear oscillators, such asbifurcation and intermodulation, are explained using simple models. Experimental methods, including cryogenic and microwave measurement techniques,are described in some detail. The nonlinear superconducting resonator is studied {{for use as a}} parametric amplifier. A strong drive tone, called the pump, drives the oscillator nearthe point of bifurcation. A second, much weaker drive signal that is slightlydetuned from the pump, will cause energy to move from the pump to the signal, giving signal amplification. We have measured a signal gain greaterthan 22 dB in a bandwidth of 30 kHz, for a resonator pumped at 7. 6 GHz. This type of amplifier is phase-sensitive, meaning that <b>signals</b> <b>in</b> phase withthe pump will be amplified, but <b>signals</b> <b>in</b> <b>quadrature</b> phase of the pump will be deamplified. Phase-sensitivity has important implications on the amplifier’snoise properties. With a parametric amplifier, a signal can be amplified without any additional noise being added by the amplifier, something that is fundamentally impossible for a standard amplifier. The vibrating AFM cantilever becomes a nonlinear oscillator when it is interacting with a surface. When driven with two frequencies, the amplitudeand phase of the cantilever’s response will develop mixing products, or intermodulation products, that are very sensitive to the exact form of the nonlinearity. Very small changes in the surface properties will be detectable when measuring the intermodulation products. Simultaneously measuring many intermodulation products, or acquiring an intermodulation spectrum,allows one to reconstruct the tip-surface interaction. Intermodulation AFM increases the sensitivity of the measurement or the contrast of the acquiredimages, and provides a means of rapidly measuring the nonlinear tip-surface interaction. The method promises to enhance the functionality of the AFM beyond simple topography measurement, towards quantitative analysis of the chemical or material properties of the surface.

This thesis presents an ultra-fast {{data acquisition system}} (DAQ) which samples and digitises the output signal of OSAM. The author's work includes {{the design of the}} clock source and the sampler, and integration of the whole system. The clock source is a unique pulse generator based on a 2. 624 GHz PLL with a Quadrature VCO (QVCO), which is able to generate 4 clock <b>signals</b> <b>in</b> accurate <b>quadrature</b> phase difference. The pulse generator used the 4 -phase clocks to provide control pulses to the sampler. The pulses were carefully aligned to the clock edges by digital logic, so that jitters were reduced as much as possible. The required short time delay for the sampler was also provided by the pulse generator, and this was implemented by a smartly-controlled switch box which re-shuffles the 4 -phase clocks. The presented sampler is a novel 10. 496 GSample/s Sub-Sampling Sample-and-Hold Amplifier (SHA).

40|$|As Moore's law predicted, {{transistor}} scaling {{has continued}} unabated {{for more than}} half a century, resulting in significant improvement in speed, efficiency, and integration level. This has led to rapid growth of diverse computing and communications technologies, including the Internet and mobile telephony. Nevertheless, we still face the fundamental limit of noise from transistors and passive components. This noise limit becomes more critical at higher frequencies due to the decrease in intrinsic transistor gain as well as with voltage scaling that accompanies the transistor scaling. On the other hand, insufficient transistor gain and breakdown in silicon limits high-power signal generation at sub-millimeter frequencies that is essential in many security and medical applications, including detection of concealed weapons and bio/molecular spectroscopy for drug detection and breath analysis for disease diagnosis. To go beyond these limits, we propose a new circuit design methodology inspired by nonlinear wave propagation. This method is closely related to intriguing phenomena in other disciplines of physics such as nonlinear optics, fluid mechanics, and plasma physics. Based on this, in the first part of this study, we propose a passive 20 -GHz frequency divider for the first time implemented in CMOS. This device has close to ideal noise performance with no DC power consumption, which can potentially reduce overall system power and phase noise in high-frequency synthesizers. Next, to achieve sensitivity toward the thermal noise limit, we propose a 10 -GHz CMOS noise-squeezing amplifier.

Line Spectral Frequency parameters related to autoregressive models and the spectral components of the residual signals are transmitted. For simulating the effects of lossy transmission channels, bit-packets are dropped randomly. In the objective and subjective quality evaluations, the proposed FDLP speech codec is judged to be more resilient to bit-packet losses compared to the state-of-the-art Adaptive Multi-Rate Wide-Band (AMR-WB) codec at 12 kbps...|$|R
40|$|Designed {{oscillator}} of quadrature {{harmonic signals}} is {{made on the}} basis of quasi-conservative managed care with a quick stabilization of output amplitude oscillations. The calculated ratio is tested on a mathematical model in the PSIM- 9. 03. The use of relay element in combination with a high-speed voltage <b>signal</b> <b>in</b> the feedback allowed us to obtain good performance of the generator under dynamic conditions both at the transition from one frequency to another and at the start-up mode. Designed generator has negligible nonlinear distortions of generated quadrature signals and can be used in multi-phase systems of converters, <b>in</b> <b>quadrature</b> modulators and demodulators of communication systems, in frequency multipliers...|$|R
