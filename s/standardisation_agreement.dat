40|$|The {{relationship}} between standardization processes, {{intellectual property rights}} and competition rules has increasingly become {{of interest in the}} recent years. Recent investigations of the European Commission confirm that standardization processes and in particular ownership of IPRs that cover standardized technology might in certain circumstances infringe competition rules. The article first explores the meaning and different forms of standardization. It then analyses selected parts of the Guidelines on the applicability of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to horizontal co-operation agreements, in particular those parts that cover <b>standardisation</b> <b>agreements.</b> The Guidelines have been adopted by the Commission in December 2010 with a view to addressing the anti-competitive concerns stemming from inter alia <b>standardisation</b> <b>agreements</b> (eg, they encourage IPRs holders to disclose their exclusive rights before the adoption of the standard, as well as to give an irrevocable commitment to offer to license the IPR to all parties interested on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms: so-called FRAND commitment). The author will then present and comment on different points of view on whether the ownership of IPRs which cover standardized technologies really create market dominance capable of triggering anti-competitive behaviours. Finally, a set of additional solutions proposed by various legal scholars will be highlighted and commented...|$|R

HLA - the High Level Architecture,  Data interchange standards - e. g. SEDRIS - Synthetic Environment Data Representation and Interchange Specification, and  Best practices - e. g. DSEEP – Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution Process. The NATO Modelling and Simulation Group (NMSG), the NATO Delegated Tasking Authority for standardisation in NATO M&S has developed NATO <b>Standardisation</b> <b>Agreements</b> (STANAGs) in the M&S domain (e. g. HLA and SEDRIS). However, the need was identified to provide and maintain an overview or a “Standards Profile” of existing or emerging standards for M&S, {{above and beyond}} the STANAGs, in order to promote interoperability and reuse. This profile includes “de facto” standards, which are not developed by official organisations but have emerged and are in large use within the international community and could be useful in NATO and national activities.

As Gorton's biographer writes: [...] "For all his erratic and {{sometimes}} bizarre behaviour, his flaws were at least those of an inventive mind". Despite this, he had a long wait for ministerial preferment, mainly because he was a party-room rebel on other matters, such as pensions. During these years he busied himself with parliamentary committee work. He was {{an active member of the}} Foreign Affairs Committee from 1952 to 1961. From 1956 he was chair of the Government Members Committee on Rail Gauge Standardisation. He made important recommendations on solving one of Australia's longest-standing infrastructure problems, the incompatible rail gauges in the different states, a legacy of colonial times. Gough Whitlam, no admirer of Wentworth in other respects, credits him with being one of the architects of the rail <b>standardisation</b> <b>agreement</b> that led to the opening of the single-gauge rail line from Melbourne to Sydney in 1961.|$|E
40|$|A switchable-rate quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) {{coding scheme}} has been {{proposed}} for integration within the legacy and next-generation high-frequency internet protocol (HF-IP) systems. The novelty in this work is based upon using a class of switchable-rate short-block-length (lt;; 1500 bits) QC-LDPC codes for the HF fading channel modelled by the ITU-R F. 1487 for all latitudes and conditions. The QC-LDPC codes are constructed using a switchable-rate approach based on finite fields which provides the ability to switch among three rates to combat varying channel conditions using a single encoder/decoder structure. The proposed structure enables low-complexity implementation of the low-density parity-check encoder/decoder for use within the existing data link (DL) layer of the <b>standardisation</b> <b>agreement</b> (STANAG) 5066 profile. The performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated comprehensively for all the HF channel conditions and latitudes.

40|$|Work is {{proceeding}} within NATO toward establishing STANAG 4686, which would define the performance levels of armoured vehicles' active protection systems. This {{would be in}} addition to the existing, well-established <b>standardisation</b> <b>agreements</b> embodied in STANAG 4569 on the levels of ballistic protection of armoured vehicles and the threat of blast mines to them. The new STANAG has been ratified recently in principle and the first three of its eight volumes are now being ratified but details of it all remain to be released. In the meantime, Czech magazine ATM has reported that tests have already been carried out in the Czech Republic according to STANAG 4686 with the Czech Explosively Formed Axe (EFA) active protection system. The tests were conducted against RPG- 7 rocket-propelled grenades and, in keeping with STANAG 4686, took into account not only the failure of the grenades to defeat their targets but also how little, if any, collateral damage the active protection system caused. So far, only the EFA's developers have agreed to have their system tested in accordance with STANAG 4686. However, its tests represent a significant contribution to the efforts of the NATO working group to finalise the new standard.

Focusing on three sectors: waste, cleaning and elderly care, the authors {{draw attention to}} the respective roles of trust, <b>standardisation,</b> contracts and <b>agreements,</b> and management strategies for workers’ autonomy. The analyses show that although low skills, low levels of customer contact and high levels of standardisation often predict low levels of autonomy, trust, employment relations and management strategies may allow for an alternative work organisation design with higher levels of autonomy. However, autonomy may also have a downside when workers become over-involved in their job, tend to self-Taylorise to achieve the shortest possible working time or to self-exploit to satisfy customer requests. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To explore {{perceptions}} of the current practice and future potential of advanced practitioners (APs) {{from the perspectives of}} different professional groups in Wales UK. Design A qualitative study consisting of nine focus group interviews. Methods Initially verbatim transcriptions of each focus group interviews were analysed thematically before themes were merged to represent perceptions for the whole data set. Participants Data were gathered from a total of 67 stakeholders—including APs from a variety of professional groups (eg, nursing, physiotherapy, paramedics) as well as managers, workforce developers, educators and medical staff who have a role developing and supporting APs in practice. Results The results are presented in four themes: (1) demand, policy context and future priorities, (2) role clarity and <b>standardisation,</b> (3) <b>agreement</b> and understanding of the role and (4) interprofessional working. The context within which current and future AP roles were considered was influenced by inexorable demands for healthcare and the requirements to meet health policy priorities. Developing AP roles were hampered currently by a lack of shared understanding and ‘joined-up’ working between different groups such as medical practitioners, managers, commissioners and educators. Conclusions For the AP role to flourish more ‘joined-up’ thinking, support and development opportunities are required between APs, managers, senior clinicians, commissioners and educators. Working together to plan and deliver education, innovation and service delivery is of prime importance to meeting ever increasing complex health needs. This will ensure that future APs are adequately prepared and supported to reach their full potential and help deliver necessary innovations in current models of care delivery...|$|R

The article also discusses the shortcomings of the current legal framework for data protection with regard to cloud computing, and analyses the possible improvements made by the General Data Protection Regulation. A cloud client usually plays the role of a data controller, while the provider may be a data controller, data processor or may not fall under the scope of data protection law. The relationship between the client and cloud provider, as a data processor, must be governed by a contract stating that the provider is bound by the instructions of the client, and describing the security measures. The contract for Microsoft Office 365 was found to be compliant with data protection law. The contract for Google Apps for Work suffers from several deficiencies that may cause a breach of data protection law. The current data protection framework lacks unification, clarity, scalability and balance regarding liability. With the exception of unification, the General Data Protection Regulation is not expected to bring a substantial improvement if it is adopted using the proposed wording. To cope with the problems arising from the interaction of cloud contracts with current law, cloud clients and providers may use the Cloud Service Level <b>Agreement</b> <b>Standardisation</b> Guidelines.

40|$|The aim of my {{contribution}} to the ICERI 2014 conference will be to analyze the privacy issues in online learning systems and discuss them {{in relation to the}} legal framework in Europe, taking into account the next step forward. The impact on learning systems of the proposal of new privacy regulation in Europe, along with the adoption of guidelines in cloud systems contracts, should be the core subject of this study. Specific attention will be drawn on the contract and service license agreements between the institution (school or business) and the cloud providers and towards end-user (learners) and the use of privacy policy. From the legal perspective, the intellectual property and privacy issues are the more relevant in this field nowadays: my analysis will the focus on the latter and its relations with security and trust. The increasing demand of online learning systems as school and business tools is allowing service providers to develop sophisticated tools. While the technology is allowing more and more interaction between the pupils and the teacher, many of these aren’t aware of the issues related to security and privacy of their data. Furthermore, trust between co-learners and towards the institution that deliver the online course rely heavily on the security features embedded in the platform. The availability and disclosure of information is also a matter of trust. Anonymity could offer a better privacy protection but could also diminish trust, mostly in collaborative work’s environment. The attribution and control of the identity of the parties involved is also important and will be increasingly complex to deal with the use of mobile devices to access the learning systems. Nowadays are also available webcam or wearable sensor which allows simulated session in specific fields (e. g. health and surgery or aviation learning) and could gather a lot of sensible data, their application in online learning systems would necessitate to specific measures in order to avoid misuse or data-leaking. The competing need of evaluation and tracking of the learner’s activity from one side can be fulfilled building systems privacy-compliant since their first development. In the proposal of regulation from EU, which will replace the Directive 95 / 46, the EU Commission is willing to embrace the Privacy By Design approach (PBD) : the implication on e-learning systems will be discussed in the final paper. The use (and abuse) of cloud computing services is spreading in each sector of economic activity and learning field is no exception. The subtlety and specifications of this technology is particularly relevant since the easiness to interact also on mobile devices. Mobile devices access is a feature that poses many dangers in terms of privacy. The Art. 29 Working Group, gathers the privacy Authorities of the European member states, on Opinion 05 / 2012 on Cloud Computing published as document WP 196 in early July 2012, discussed the risks of this technology. On June 26, 2014 the EU Commission delivered the Cloud Service Level <b>Agreement</b> <b>Standardisation</b> Guidelines drafted by the Cloud Select Industry Group, which should be helpful to providers and users to fully explain and understand the legal content of their agreements.
