5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the hairs or {{feathers}} of their host and feed on <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the {{indications}} for linezolid use {{approved by}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, with or without bacterial invasion of the bloodstream; nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired) and community-acquired pneumonia caused by S. aureus or S. pneumoniae; complicated <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible bacteria, including diabetic foot infection, unless complicated by osteomyelitis (infection of the bone and bone marrow); and uncomplicated <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> soft tissue infections caused by S. pyogenes or S. aureus.

40|$|Background: Ultraviolet {{radiation}} exposure during an individuals' lifetime is a known {{risk factor for}} the development of skin cancer. However, less evidence is available on assessing the relationship between lifetime sun exposure <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> damage <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> aging. Objectives: This study aims to assess the relationship between lifetime sun exposure <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> damage <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> aging using a non-invasive measure of exposure. Methods: We recruited 180 participants (73 males, 107 females) aged 18 - 83 years. Digital imaging of skin hyper-pigmentation (<b>skin</b> damage) <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> wrinkling (skin aging) on the facial region was measured. Lifetime sun exposure (presented as hours) was calculated from the participants' age multiplied by the estimated annual time outdoors for each year of life. We analyzed the effects of lifetime sun exposure on <b>skin</b> damage <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> aging. We adjust for the influence of age, sex, occupation, history of skin cancer, eye color, hair color, <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> color. Results: There were non-linear relationships between lifetime sun exposure <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> damage <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> aging. Younger participant's skin is much more sensitive to sun exposure than those who were over 50 years of age. As such, there were negative interactions between lifetime sun exposure and age. Age had linear effects on <b>skin</b> damage <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> aging. Conclusion: The data presented showed that self reported lifetime sun exposure was positively associated with <b>skin</b> damage <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> aging, in particular, the younger people. Future health promotion for sun exposure needs to pay attention to this group for skin cancer prevention messaging. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed on metallic sandwich structures as an armor for aeronautical applications. Several combinations of AA 5086 -H 111 aluminium <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> aluminium honeycomb core have been studied, considering medium-velocity and highenergy impacts. The aim is to establish links between the sandwich performances and the material and geometrical parameters. An elasto-plastic, strain-rate dependent behavior has been implemented to represent the <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> the core. The sandwich model has been calibrated and validated from the experimental data. Dynamic effects, as well as strong couplings between the <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> the core {{appear to have a}} significant effect on the target performance...|$|R

5|$|While the pupa is {{generally}} stationary and immobile, {{those of the}} primitive moth families Micropterigidae, Agathiphagidae and Heterobathmiidae have fully functional mandibles. These serve principally to allow the adult {{to escape from the}} cocoon. Besides this, all appendages and the body are separate from the pupal <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> enjoy a degree of independent motion. All other superfamilies of the Lepidoptera are more specialised, have non-functional mandibles, appendages and body attached to the pupal <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> lose a degree of independent movement.|$|E
5|$|A common {{parasite}} of bowfin is {{the anchor}} worm (Lernaea). These small crustaceans infest the <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays {{eggs in the}} bowfin gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.|$|E
