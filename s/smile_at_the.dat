Despite this, Davinger complimented the episode for focusing on one single plot. Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that [...] "Junior Salesman"—along with [...] "Vandalism"—was [...] "so much sharper than last week's trial in Dullsville". Campbell also complimented the return of Michael Schur as Mose and the performances of Matt L. Jones and Brian Baumgartner. Multiple critics considered the episode superior to [...] "Vandalism", particularly due to their displeasure with the Brian-Pam storyline, which was more prevalent in [...] "Vandalism".|$|E

They credited Cook's likableness, {{in spite of the}} character's flaws, to O'Connell's [...] "great" [...] acting. Ellie Newton-Syms of InJournalism Magazine wrote that [...] "digging into slightly deeper issues is what Skins is good at" [...] and [...] "there is clearly lots left to be revealed", as signified by Cook's drug-induced revelation that he has [...] "nothing". Digital Spy's Dan French reviewed the episode positively, finding JJ to be a [...] "lovable" [...] character.

500|$|A promotional teaser was {{released}} before the full {{release of the}} video; it saw Roberts walking on the New York City pavements, {{with a pair of}} backing dancers gaining looks from men. It also showed a neon-style aspect of the video, where Roberts wore Nike Air Max trainers, with neon moving sperm-shaped graffiti moving to the beat of the track. OK! magazine responded well whilst noting her unusually short dress in the video, they said [...] "we can't help but feel upbeat and summery when watching the star bounce about for single Lucky Day." [...] Aaron Spencer-Charles of Metro gave a mixed review, whilst describing the video, he ended with [...] "and that's it really. Nicola strolls along with a few colourful effects to keep things interesting. Maybe adding a male model would have made things a bit livelier." [...] Popjustice commented on Nicola's seemingly lack of confidence in the video, stating Nicola, you light up our world like nobody else. But when you <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground it ain't hard to tell, you don't know you're beautiful. Her short-dress in the video sparked criticism from some critics, to which Roberts responded saying [...] "I'm not safe with fashion, and I haven't been for a long time. I liked it, and everybody on the team liked it on the day. It was 120 degrees, so anything longer, I'd have died." ...|$|E

500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. I gave him a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E

2500|$|With {{his mental}} health on the mend, Wilson decided {{to revisit the}} aborted Smile project from 1967. Aided by {{musician}} and longtime fan Darian Sahanaja of Wondermints, and lyricist Van Dyke Parks, Wilson reimagined the session material into something that would work in a live context. His work was finally revealed in concert on February 20, 2004, 37 {{years after it was}} conceived, though he later stated that the finished product was substantially different from what was originally envisioned. Wilson debuted his 2004 interpretation of <b>Smile</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Festival Hall in London and subsequently toured the UK. Following the tour, Brian Wilson Presents Smile was recorded, and released in September 2004. The release hit number 13 on the Billboard chart. At the 47th Grammy Awards in 2005, Wilson won his first Grammy for the track [...] "" [...] as Best Rock Instrumental. In 2004, Wilson promoted Brian Wilson Presents Smile with a tour of Australia, New Zealand and Europe.|$|E
2500|$|... "Christianity – {{and that}} is its {{greatest}} merit – has somewhat mitigated that brutal Germanic love of war, but it could not destroy it. Should that subduing talisman, the cross, be shattered, the frenzied madness of the ancient warriors, that insane Berserk rage of which Nordic bards have spoken and sung so often, will once more burst into flame. This talisman is fragile, and the day will come when it will collapse miserably. Then the ancient stony gods will rise from the forgotten debris and rub the dust of a thousand years from their eyes, and finally Thor with his giant hammer will jump up and smash the Gothic cathedrals. (...)"Do not smile at my advice – {{the advice of a}} dreamer who warns you against Kantians, Fichteans, and philosophers of nature. Do not <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> visionary who anticipates the same revolution {{in the realm of the}} visible as has taken place in the spiritual. Thought precedes action as lightning precedes thunder. German thunder is of true Germanic character; it is not very nimble, but rumbles along ponderously. Yet, it will come and when you hear a crashing such as never before has been heard in the world's history, then you know that the German thunderbolt has fallen at last. At that uproar the eagles of the air will drop dead, and lions in the remotest deserts of Africa will hide in their royal dens. A play will be performed in Germany which will make the French Revolution look like an innocent idyll." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lenglen was criticised widely for her {{decision}} to turn professional, and the All England Club at Wimbledon even revoked her honorary membership. Lenglen, however, described {{her decision}} as [...] "an escape from bondage and slavery" [...] and said in the tour programme, [...] "In the twelve years I have been champion I have earned literally millions of francs for tennis and have paid thousands of francs in entrance fees {{to be allowed to}} do so.... I have worked as hard at my career as any man or woman has worked at any career. And in my whole lifetime I have not earned $5,000 – not one cent of that by my specialty, my life study – tennis.... I am twenty-seven and not wealthy – should I embark on any other career and leave the one for which I have what people call genius? [...] Or should I <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> prospect of actual poverty and continue to earn a fortune – for whom?" [...] As for the amateur tennis system, Lenglen said, [...] "Under these absurd and antiquated amateur rulings, only a wealthy person can compete, {{and the fact of the}} matter is that only wealthy people do compete. Is that fair? [...] Does it advance the sport? [...] Does it make tennis more popular – or does it tend to suppress and hinder an enormous amount of tennis talent lying dormant in the bodies of young men and women whose names are not in the social register?" ...|$|E
