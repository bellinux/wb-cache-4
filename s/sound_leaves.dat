60|$|One needs, of course, a {{far less}} {{complicated}} notation than a singer, and one is even permitted slight modifications of the fixed note when dramatic expression demands it and the instrument is not sounding. The notation which regulates the general form of the <b>sound</b> <b>leaves</b> it free to add a complexity of dramatic expression from its own incommunicable genius which compensates the lover of speech {{for the lack of}} complex musical expression. Ordinary speech is formless, and its variety is like the variety which separates bad prose from the regulated speech of Milton, or anything that is formless and void from anything that has form and beauty. The orator, the speaker who has some little of the great tradition of his craft, differs from the debater very largely because he understands how to assume that subtle monotony of voice which runs through the nerves like fire.|$|E

5000|$|The Way <b>Sound</b> <b>Leaves</b> a Room is {{the second}} EP and third release by Texas {{musician}} Sarah Jaffe. The EP consists of eight songs recorded in Jaffe's home in Denton, Texas. Two songs are covers, one is a different version of a song from her first album Suburban Nature, one is an outro version of a song from her debut, and the remaining four are demo versions of songs that might appear on her second full-length album. This EP steps away from Jaffe's acoustic sound and moves in more of an electric sound. She stated this EP {{was more of a}} transition piece to lead into her second studio album.The CD version come packaged with a DVD of Jaffe's live show at the Wyly Theater. [...] "A Sucker for Your Marketing" [...] was released as the first single from the EP.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Sean Westergaard awarded the album 4 stars stating [...] "Guitarist Mel Brown is hailed as [...] "An Impulse!

5000|$|Parker {{commented that}} [...] "the guitars operate as {{interlocking}} {{pieces of a}} larger puzzle, while bassist Susan Stenger floats below, providing structure without being chained to the beat. The sound alternates between haunting and crushing, and the guitars are finally consistently corralled into the dramatic service of the song. The clean, nearly reverb-less guitar <b>sound</b> <b>leaves</b> {{plenty of room to}} hear the guitars' idiosyncratic directions while maintaining a nearly opaque wall of sound." [...] He described [...] "Plot Twist" [...] and [...] "Silver Lining" [...] as examples of songs when [...] "the band breaks loose from their throbbing chords to deliver a crunchy punch to the solar plexus," [...] but noted that, [...] "mostly, though, the effect is of rich lattices of guitar and intermingling swells, lifting and propelling the songs through an omnipresent guitar drone. Bassist Stenger's throaty vocals add a moody counterpoint to the guitars' pitched screech and anchor the album's opening two tracks, not incidentally two of the better compositions on the disc." [...] He later referred to the album is being based around songcraft.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the journey}} in the Zone, {{the sound of}} water becomes more and more prominent, which, {{combined}} with the visual image, presents the zone as a drenched world. In an interview Tarkovsky dismissed the idea that water has a symbolic meaning in his films, saying that there was so much rain in his films because it is always raining in Russia. In another interview, on the film Nostalghia, however, he said [...] "Water is a mysterious element, a single molecule of which is very photogenic. It can convey movement and a sense of change and flux." [...] Emerging from the tunnel called the meat grinder by the Stalker they arrive at the entrance of their destination, the room. Here, as {{in the rest of the}} film, sound is constantly changing and not necessarily connected to the visual image. The journey in the Zone ends with the three sitting in the room, silent, with no audible sound. When the sound resumes, it is again {{the sound of water}} but with a different timbre, softer and gentler, as if to give a sense of catharsis and hope. The transition back to the world outside the zone is supported by sound. While the camera still shows a pool of water inside the Zone, the audience begins to hear the sound of a train and Ravel's Bol√©ro, reminiscent of the opening scene. The soundscape of the world outside the zone is the same as before, characterized by train wheels, foghorns of a ship and train whistles. The film ends as it began, with the sound of a train passing by, accompanied by the muffled sound of Beethoven's Ninth symphony, this time the Ode to Joy from the final moments of the symphony. As in the rest of the film the disconnect between the visual image and the <b>sound</b> <b>leaves</b> the audience in the unclear whether the sound is real or an illusion.|$|E
40|$|Results {{are given}} of a {{preliminary}} research {{aimed at the}} molecular investigation of dryness of horse chestnut leaves incited by Guignardia aesculi and environmental pollution. Modifications due to pathology and physio-logical disorders are characterized. Leaves showing pathologies or a physiological disorder compared to <b>sound</b> <b>leaves</b> were investigated by FTIR Spectroscopy. The spectra showed a weakening of the aromatic do-main bands (1650 - 1500 cm- 1) and intensity inversion of two bands of this domain (1650, 1610 cm- 1) passing from the <b>sound</b> <b>leaves</b> to those affected with a physio-logical disorder. Moreover in the spectrum of these leaves, the 1300 cm- 1 band disappears, the carbonylic esteric band (1730 cm- 1) decreases while the band at 1400 cm- 1 is enhanced probably because of partial hy-drolysis of the esteric groups. These bands could be a spectroscopic marker of the disease. The results show that FTIR spectroscopy is a promising technique helping to unravel the processes involving the biological macromolecules of plant tis-sues...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Experiences from {{isotropic}} materials {{suggest that}} it is impossible to derive a statistical model with few parameters to model a weld in an anisotropic material. The parameter that remains unknown even after a large number of empirical investigations is the orientation of the dendrites due to the heating. Our intention is to apply some simplified models in an optimization scheme to predict the dendrites ‚Äô orientation in different kinds of welds. In this paper, a model of ultrasonic ray traveling through anisotropic materials, as well as the corresponding computer simulation is presented. First, based on the previous work on texture analysis of various austenitic stainless steel weld samples, a typical simplified model of the geometry of welds is established. It is subdivided into a finite number of smaller regions with specific anisotropy. Then by means of the ray tracing method, ray path running through the weld model is developed. As a function of incident angle, the point of entrance of the sound path to the weld and the given orientation of the dendrites, the model will ultimately give the point where the <b>sound</b> <b>leaves</b> the weld, the time of flight and the angle between the sound ray and the weld. A numerical simulation of the forward problem is also provided as a validation of the model...|$|E
40|$|This {{documentary}} by the French artist Floy Krouchi {{in collaboration}} with Nathalie Battus and Bruno Mourlan from Radio France is a hybrid piece that lies between music and poetic creation. It attempts to make a radiophonic connection between the mythic memory of the indigenous peoples of India and what remains today in certain pieces of music, in (people‚Äôs) memory, in singing and translation. The project began five years ago (2010) in Southern India where Floy Krouchi was then travelling. There she heard a short piece of music taken from a very ancient tradition that struck her as so strange and at once exhilarating that she decided to come {{home as soon as}} she could and spend a month gathering together what is still accessible from this strangely beautiful material that has come down to us across the centuries. On their tribal lands, the indigenous Irula tribe hold a ceremony that tells the story of their historical conflict with, and near destruction by, the ways of the so-called civilised or modern world. This music drama, played out over 7 days and 7 nights, unfolds like a symbolic tale. To record them is to capture the oral memory of these people who belong still to the Ancient World. The <b>sound</b> <b>leaves</b> an imprint which connects deeply with our collective memory. Based on a tiny fleeting fragment, ‚ÄúNothing but Bones‚Äù revisits the action {{at the heart of this}} drama, a fiction turned into history, a narrative shot through with time metaphors. Through the medium of radio our collective memory is stimulated, allowing us to share a little of what the Irula ‚Äì born in the nurturing forest ‚Äì had to face when confronted with the greed of the children of King Money. ‚ÄúNothing but Bones‚Äù is a piece of experimental radio which leads those who have ears to hear on a path where the past seems behind a very fragile pane of glass. It is a delicate and deeply moving piece of radio. Translation by Simon Elmes, gratefully acknowledged...|$|E
