40|$|This paper {{presents}} the current approaches in land tenure <b>securisation</b> in French-speaking West Africa. Recent socio-anthropological research on land tenure {{makes it possible}} to clarify the concepts of rights, security, and <b>securisation.</b> This research emphasises <b>securisation</b> processes and the dynamic relationships between norms, rights, and authorities. In West Africa, the stake for rural land tenure policies is to propose concrete responses to the problems facing rural populations, with an aim to economic effectiveness, social peace, and citizenship building. For this, the challenge is overcoming the divorce between legality, legitimacy, and practices by building land tenure regulation mechanisms based on shared norms. A series of approaches emphasising regulation systems or the formalisation of rights has been developed. Tested in several countries, Plans Fonciers Ruraux (PFR, rural land tenure maps) identify and map customary land rights and lead to "land tenure certificates". While providing significant innovations, pilot projects had an overly positivist approaches to rights, which induced significant bias. In Benin, the draft bill on rural land tenure regulation includes PFRs. In the framework of the preparations for implementing this law, potential responses to these challenges have been proposed.

The transgenerational dimension emerges as one significant factor from among the many likely to impede autonomy.

40|$|Understanding the {{response}} of a propellant [1], specifically under dynamic loading, needs (at least) to know its mesostructural morphology and the mechanical behaviour of each of its components.

The shorter it is, the more important the morphologic description of the material is. In our problems, involving the <b>securisation</b> of reactive materials, propellant can be submitted to a large spectrum of loading. The first of them is a dynamic loading which leaves the material in a specific state. In this presentation, we show, from microtomography acquisitions before and after tests, the consequences on the sample of different levels of dynamic loading.

The purpose is to compare the changes in civil law and social security law with social practices. Three questions are investigated here: How dependant or independent income security of women is achieved in France? What kind of support do women receive to enhance their independent income security? To what extend care work is regarded as an equivalent to gainful employment then generating independent income security for care givers ? The investigation shows that changes in models are progressively taking place in France although not completely achieved. Women have been supported both as workers and as carers, enabling them to « choose » between working and caring. However, {{despite the fact that}} more and more women are in paid work, care responsibilities continue to shape their career and their social rights entitlement with consequences on pensions in old age.

40|$|In {{migration}} control policies, {{social rights}} are often restricted {{in order to}} discourage immigration. The right to education {{seems to be the}} exception to the rule. This paper examines whether the right to education-beyond legal technical questions of the personal scope of application of human rights treaties, and the nature and the meaning of the right-is able to provide empowering leverage to undocumented children, or rather remains a lofty ideal on paper. Empirical data are drawn from the Belgian situation. Sociological research has shown that while quantitative educational democratisation has been highly successful, qualitative educational democratisation remains problematic. With regard to undocumented children, real-life limitations to school access (both individual and institutional), as well as psycho-social and institutional impediments during the schooling process seriously limit equal schooling and life opportunities. Unequal responses to organisational and pedagogical challenges that the presence of mobile students puts to schools, reinforce institutional factors of educational inequality for undocumented children. A key factor in understanding the tension between the legal recognition of the human right to education and daily realities is the outright contradiction between the approaches towards education on the one hand, and to migration more generally on the other hand.

40|$|The {{crisis of}} the {{financial}} markets had its onset as early as February 2007, when the first defaults of mortgage debts with a low rating of creditworthiness were reported. Following that, the crisis shifted to the secured mortgage debt market to finally affect the entire financial system. All in all, the required valuation adjustments in the financial services are estimated to $ 3, 400 billion. The resulting losses compelled, on a world-wide basis, the allocation of public funds to credit institutions, a considerable increase of government guarantees to finance credit institutions, {{the reduction of the}} key interest rates to approximately 0 percent, and, moreover, direct measures safeguarding liquidity in the credit sector on behalf of the central banks. Macroeconomic imbalances, arbitrage dealings between low and high interest currencies and an overly expansive monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve can be quoted as the macroeconomic reasons for the crisis on the financial markets. However, the crisis also unveiled deficiencies within the control and supervision systems of the financial service providers. The <b>securisation</b> of mortgages and other financial instruments allowed financial service providers to shift business activities outside the regulated area. These regrouping activities in turn required a fair-value assessment of securitised credits and pro-cyclically triggered higher equity provisions within the Basel II standards.

In spite of their oriental attraction and their installation in Egypt in 973, the Fatimids never lost their interests for Ifriqiya and Sicily. The Geniza letters give new informations concerning the Barqa’s area in modern Libya {{in the beginning of}} the xi th century. Unable to ensure the order themselves, the Fatimids had to put up with the settlement in the area of an uncontrollable Bedouins clan: the Banū Qurrā’ and their chiefs. They created a corsary emirate in charge of the security of the shipping lanes in the name of the Fatimids. These emirs used to get from the Fatimids caliphate an astonishing freedom of action and they played a major part in the navigation between Egypt, Ifriqiya and Sicily. They helped the Fatimids to keep their image and reputation of naval strength whereas the official fleet was quite inactive. The Barqa’s emirate actions in the central Mediterranean respond to key stakes for a caliphal dynasty in search for legitimacy and ready for everything to serve its goals. En dépit de leur tropisme oriental et de leur installation en Égypte en 973, les Fatimides ne se désintéressèrent pas du sort de l’Ifrīqiya, de la Sicile. Les lettres de la Geniza apportent des informations inédites sur la région de Barqa en Cyrénaïque au début du xie siècle. Incapables d’y assurer eux-mêmes l’ordre, les Fatimides s’accommodèrent de l’installation dans cette zone d’un clan de bédouins incontrôlables, les Banū Qurrā’ et leurschefs. Ils prirent la tête d’un véritable émirat corsaire chargé de la <b>sécurisation</b> des routes maritimes pour le compte des Fatimides. Dotés d’une liberté d’action surprenante, ils jouèrent un rôle majeur dans la navigation entre les territoires fatimides et permirent à la dynastie de conserver son image de puissance navale active alors que la flotte officielle ne sortait plus que rarement.

40|$|This book is an {{examination}} of the effect of contemporary wars (such as the 'War on Terror') on civil life at a global level. Contemporary literature on war is mainly devoted to recent changes in the theory and practice of warfare, particular those in which terrorists or insurgents are involved (for example, the 'revolution in military affairs', 'small wars', and so on). On the other hand, today's research on security is focused, among other themes, on the effects of the war on terrorism, and on civil liberties and social control. This volume connects these two fields of research, showing how 'war' and 'security' tend to exchange targets and forms of action as well as personnel (for instance, the spreading use of private contractors in wars and of military experts in the 'struggle for security') in modern society. This shows how, contrary to Clausewitz's belief war should be conceived of as a "continuation of politics by other means", the opposite statement is also true: that politics, insofar as it concerns security, can be defined as the 'continuation of war by other means'. This book will be of much interest to students of critical security studies, war and conflict studies, terrorism studies, sociology and IR in general.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{intends to}} {{illustrate}} {{to what extent}} the construction of the risk of shark attacks and its management reveal developments in surfing in la Réunion. The survey presented is based on a mixed methodology : the making of monograph from “whistleblowers” associations and analysis of their public discourses. Although it was well-known, this threat becomes more apparent, its visibility and its permanence now jeopardize the practice across the island. The forced defection of the spots led to a growing concern : a crisis begins in the surfing community. To understand this crisis one must know in what extend the shark threat was normal before 2011 and how it led surfers to fishing sharks. This activity generated a controversy that we will study in two ways : first by looking how surfers introduce themselves in order to legitimize their discourse and then by analyzing the functions of conflict in this crisis. The methods {{to reduce the risk of}} shark attacks do not fit in with the values promoted by the whistleblowers. We propose to analyze the arguments expressed in order to make them socially accept. The study of the controversy about methods of risk prevention can finally make understand the conditions for resumption of the nautic activities. We will illustrate this with an original repossession process based on free-divers (called “lookouts”). Cet article se propose de montrer dans quelles mesures la construction puis la gestion du risque requin révèlent les évolutions dans la pratique du surf à la Réunion. L’article s’appuie sur une enquête de terrain à la méthodologie mixte (observation participante et entretiens). Bien que connue de longue date, la permanence de la menace requin en 2011 compromet la pratique du surf à l’échelle de l’île. La désertion forcée des sites de pratique amorce une crise sans précédent dans la communauté surf réunionnaise. Du reste, les méthodes pour réduire le risque requin semblent ne pas coïncider avec la dimension valorisée de la prise de risque en surf. Nous nous proposons d’analyser les arguments exprimés pour les faire accepter en étudiant la polémique de deux manières : d’abord en regardant du côté des jeux d’acteurs puis en analysant les jeux d’arguments. L’étude de la dispute autour des méthodes de prévention du risque permet enfin de comprendre les conditions de reprise des activités nautiques.

40|$|Introduction: Delayed {{cerebral}} ischemia (DCI) is {{a frequent}} and serious complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The diagnosis of DCI lies primarily on {{the deterioration of the}} clinical state (neurological deficit), but can be difficult to detect in the comatose patient. Transcranial Dopper (TCD) and perfusion Computer Tomography with calculation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain perfusion help with the diagnosis of DCI but their predictive values remain limited. The DCI mechanisms are complex, involving alteration of CBF, impaired cerebral autoregulation, brain energy dysfunction and activation of pro-inflammatory mediators. The use of novel techniques for advanced intracranial monitoring (including brain tissue PO 2 	and cerebral microdialysis) offer the opportunity to study in detail DCI physiopathology and might help detecting DCI and guiding therapeutic interventions in patients suffering from SAH. General objectives: The main objective {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between global CBF - measured with TCD and perfusion-CT - and regional brain metabolism, measured with the brain tissue oxygen (PbtO 2) probe and the cerebral microdialysis (CMD) technique. Specific objectives: To examine the relationship between: - DCI and the brain tissue oxygen pressure reactivity index (ORx), which is calculated as the moving linear correlation coefficient between PbtO 2 and CPP (=mean arterial pressure - intracranial pressure). The ORx is considered as a surrogate marker of the cerebral autoregulation state; - ORx and CBF, calculated with the perfusion-CT; - ORx and CMD markers of brain energy metabolism (including the lactate/pyruvate ratio and glucose). Methods: Retrospective analysis of an ongoing cohort database of patients with coma (defined by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤ 8) after aneurysmal SAH, with an abnormal CT-scan (Fisher grade II-IV), who underwent intracranial monitoring with PbtO 2 and CMD as part of standard care. Intracranial monitoring was inserted after admission (2 ± 1 days). A total of 21 patients were admitted in the Intensive Care Department with poor-grade SAH and underwent imaging and aneurysm <b>securisation</b> (with surgical clipping or endovascular coiling). Cerebral microdialysis allows to measure every hour, through a catheter placed in the cerebral parenchyma (white matter), the extracellular concentration of the main brain metabolites (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, lactate/pyruvate ratio). The DCI is diagnosed with the TCD and the perfusion-CT. The CBF (derived from the cerebral blood volume and the mean transit time) was calculated with the perfusion-CT, with a CBF 40. The different variables were compared by univariate analysis using a Wilcoxon test for comparisons. The relationship between variables was analysed with the Pearson's R linear correlation coefficient factor. Expected results: From a clinical standpoint, if a relationship between regional brain physiological variables and global cerebral blood flow can be demonstrated, this could serve as a validation of PbtO 2 and cerebral microdialysis monitoring as complementary tools for the diagnosis and the management of DCI in comatose SAH patients. From a pathophysiological standpoint, this study will provide new insights concerning the relationship between cerebral blood flow, brain oxygenation and cerebral energy metabolism in the acute phase of SAH...|$|E
40|$|Land tenure is {{becoming}} less secure {{in rural areas}} in ACP States. Competition for access to land and its resources is rising, under pressure {{from a variety of}} factors: migration from less-endowed parts of the Sahel, the growing thrust towards the opening up of new lands, successful policies for intensified agriculture, and the gradual inclusion of the countryside in the market place. More attention than ever is being paid to this insecurity, yet the issues seem to grow in number and in complexity, blurring hopes for a miracle solution. Modern traders find ways to use modern law {{to gain access to the}} permanent rights of customary law. The certainties of the policies of yesteryear ? of giving land rights to all ? are now in doubt, and are being replaced by a more modest pragmatism, which is perhaps more realistic. Wholesale private appropriation of land is no longer a viable option in ensuring equitable land tenure. In other words, the field is opening up to experimental approaches. Can new practices of decentralised and mediated management offer a genuine alternative? Land tenure conflicts are on the rise again, sometimes resulting in violent clashes, as were recently witnessed in eastern Niger, between pastoralists and farmers, or around gum tree orchards in Chad. They are one extreme of the surge of new interest in tenure of land and land resources, and point to the imperfections of existing policies and the dangers of inaction, as much as to the emergence of new groups keen to gain a foothold in the market for land. Some approaches which emphasise full 'ownership' rights have worked well, in an attempt to clarify land rights, and to encourage investment. Some parts of the market (urban land tenure, plantation areas) operate simply under the laws of supply and demand. Why, then, shouldn't privatisation schemes spread out into rural areas? 'Seductive maybe, but impractical' is how Professor Etienne Le Roy 1 describes the idea. It is indeed easier said than done, since considerable efforts are required for registering rural land tenure. 'In sub-Saharan Africa, 2 % of land is in the public domain. Add to that the areas which are correctly recorded ? ranging from 0. 2 % of the national total in the Sahel to 3 % in countries such as Côte d'Ivoire ? and we have about 5 % of a country's land which is properly registered. Not very much'. The process of registering private land is hugely expensive as shown by the example of the Comoros. In this little nation of islands, having 650, 000 inhabitants, the cost of a cadastral (land) survey and land registration would be twice the size of its national budget. Furthermore, one can be sure of serious resistance from the traditional authorities (land chiefs, in particular) who would be none too keen on weakening the foundations of their legitimacy. Conceptual doubts [...] . The given 'truths' of cadastral experts have also been shaken to their doctrinal foundations by recent findings. At the end of 1994, the renowned Land Tenure Centre (LTC), based in the United States of America, published its conclusions drawn from dozens of cadastral case studies. The major finding is that owning a deed of property, or not, is not a key issue in decisions about investment in rural areas in Africa. Other factors (small number of businesses, weaknesses in the legal system) are also seen as brakes on private investment. This led one LTC leader, John Bruce, to call for a change of approach, and to no longer seek to replace customary law with the modern, but to go with its flow. This requires a change of attitude, of moving from the line of confrontation, to some form of 'co-habitation'. This approach has already been tried in several places. In southern Mali, the Malian Textile Development Company (CMDT) has helped to intensify production in the cotton growing zone (through increasing productivity and cultivated areas) by working within the framework of customary law. This has been a real success story: the national cotton harvest rose from 96, 000 tonnes in 1981 to 450, 000 tonnes in 1997. It is not a new approach either. An example from decades ago, mentioned by Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch, talks of British settlers in Tanganyika (which was to become Tanzania) gambling on greater success for their policies of mechanisation, more mixed cropping and herd improvement if they worked within customary law, through traditional chiefdoms. 2 Looking closer at today, and tomorrow, our vision of land tenure is being changed by the upsurge in environmental concerns, and the obligatory reference to 'sustainable development' in developmental policies. Any reference to land tenure now has to take long-term management of natural resources, such as water and forests, into account. Finally, globalisation leads us to devote as much attention to ensuring a proper flow of resources (circulation of agricultural wealth) as to strict demarcation of land. [...] . and innovative practices The complexity of the land tenure puzzle is already well-known, thanks to field research. Under 'customary' approaches, community ownership (through family and lineage) means that access to land and land resources is modulated by social position and alliances between lineages. Traditional authorities can also grant land use rights to 'strangers'. The case of subtle relationships between 'native' Ivoirians in Côte d'Ivoire and 'strangers' from Burkina Faso, Mali and Ghana was observed by Alain Karsenty, a socio-economist at CIRAD (International Centre for Agricultural Research) : 'Even when they have bought land, the migrants still have commitments to the native vendors ? annual gifts, tithes (parts) of the harvest, or free labour. Nor can the migrants be sure that they will be able to pass on the land they bought to their descendants. ' There are many such complicated cases, but where there is a will to find solutions, there is a way. In just one village north of Lake Chad, for example, villagers made no fewer than 109 agreements on seasonal grazing with nomadic pastoralists in the region, covering routes, grazing grounds, and access to water. These agreements led to tensions between the two communities subsiding. When local community organisations are still active ? as is the case in Africa and in Melanesia ? customary law often changes with the times. Paul Mathieu 3, a university specialist, tells of cases in Burkina Faso, where villagers in the department of Sapouy, south of Ouagadougou, have made arrangements which transcend the separate identities of lineages, neighbourhood or villages. Members of the native Nuni, migrants of the Mossi and Gourmantché, and Peulh pastoralists, have come together to make a pact about land use which gives all parties a fair share of access to the natural resources of the bush. Elsewhere, new approaches have been made under the heading 'land tenure forums' or 'heritage management' (see box). They have one aspect in common: they all seek to bridge the gap between land tenure management and the actual functioning of African societies and production systems, without idealising rural communities, which sometimes maintain feudal relationships, and are not free from political or religious interference. Such approaches have the wind behind them, as reform and decentralisation take hold. The growth in 'local' elections means that power is now passing into the hands of authorities who are more in tune with local realities. A hidden danger lurks in these innovative approaches: that of local isolationism. It can be avoided by making sure that (inter-) village agreements are approved by a more central regional authority, once their equitable nature has been assured. Locally-made deals can thus become defensible against outside parties, and a new form of land tenure law can emerge, which is based more on consensus ? and, in consequence, is more effective. 1 Director of the Anthropological Law Laboratory at the Sorbonne, University of Paris. 2 see 'Who owns land in Africa', Spore 48, December 1993 3 Professor at the Agricultural Faculties of Gembloux, Belgium Direct action by farmers in Burkina Faso against top-down decisions on land tenue For further information: Menaces sur les terroirs, Courrier de la Planète, number 34, Montpellier, May-June 1996.

The stamps on smooth sigillated pottery provide valuable evidence on the organisation of workshops and their production. Their use varied from region to region and from period to period, both in terms of frequency (the proportion of smooth stamped vases) and nature (the types of stamped vases, the function of the stamps, the potter represented). They are also a very good indicator of the commercial relationships established in turn between the workshops of Gaul, Germany, the Danubian regions (chosen for this study) and Pannonia. From {{the time of the first}} research undertaken in Pannonia at the end of the 19 th century up until recent excavation work, the corpus of the stamps has been progressively enhanced, in particular thanks to studies of such large sites as Carnuntum, Salla, Brigetio, Poetovio, Budaörs, Baláca, Páty, Aquincum, Gerulata, Gorsium, and Vindobona, the sigillated pots of which have sometimes been the subject of systematic publication. However, though the data offer increasing study potential, it has not yet been possible to make a report on the entire province. As things stand, to look up the distribution of a potter's production in Pannonia necessitates trawling through a scattered and difficult to access bibliography. One of the purposes of this article was thus to gather the data pertaining to the whole province in one place, a development that I hope will be of particular help to foreign researchers. A total of 2043 stamps are presented here, of which approximately half are reproduced. Each is identified and classified by potter, followed by a detailed analysis of the commercialisation and use of sigillated pots made in western workshops. A statistical and cartographic study shows the trends of the numbers of stamps in circulation in the Province. The consumption of sigillated pots is initially studied in relation to the consumer societies. It required the analysis of the best known sites in Pannonia and comparison of the appearance of the sigillated pots in the different types of communities (civil, military, indigenous, rural, urban). It is noted that at certain moments the communities with strong economic and social ties to the army (especially on the ripa Pannonica) were those that had the greatest purchasing power and the greatest demand. A strong link can also be established with the location of the urban centres on the main routes by which sigillated pots were diffused in Pannonia. The question is then broached from a chronological point of view in order to retrace the history of the trade in sigillated pottery coming from different groups of western workshops. Several large workshops were favoured for trading purposes in Pannonia (La Graufesenque in particular during the reigns of Domitian and Trajan, Lezoux between 140 and 170, Rheinzabern between 180 and 250). They later dominated the Pannonian market even though workshops like Banassac, les Martres-de-Veyre, Heiligenberg, Westerndorf and Pfaffenhofen also played a role in imports. Changes that occurred in the organisation of the supply of the Pannonian markets were certainly linked to the dynamism of the workshops but they were also strongly influenced by the economic, social and historic conditions extant in the province. Military events were of major incidence : the wars against the Dacians, which followed the securing of the river trade and the construction of a line of fortifications on the ripa, entailed a concentration of the army on the Danube and created a favourable context for increasing imports from southern Gaul up the river. Conversely, the disturbances caused by the wars with the Marcomans and Sarmatians largely contributed to the fact that the products of the Lezoux workshops were no longer found in the markets of Pannonia. In other cases imperial policy reinforced the consumer communities, for example, through the urbanisation campaigns promoted during the reign of Hadrian (a period during which imports from Lezoux rose) and the Severan dynasty, and as a result of the favours bestowed and money spent by the emperors on the army in this strategically located region (which brought about the domination of Rheinzabern sigillated pots in the sites of Pannonia). At certain times during periods of particular prosperity demand was so great that it could not be fully satisfied by the workshops that controlled the market, and these favourable circumstances allowed other workshops to benefit. For instance, the workshops of eastern Gaul between the years 135 and 160 / 165. Westerndorf and Pfaffenhofen equally profited during the second golden age in the Severan dynasty and Pfaffenhofen benefited too from its position in the same taxation zone. All these developments in turn influenced the structure of the pottery's distribution channels, encouraging the development of certain routes, such as the amber route, the diagonal Aquincum-Poetovio way and the Danubian axis. In parallel, the dynamism of the centres of consumption on these routes increased : the rise of the Danubian axis reduced the importance of Neviodunum and Siscia, which were situated on the ancient trading routes out of Italy, while Aquincum and Carnuntum prospered as commercial ports. The rise and fall in intensity of consumption of sigillated pottery in urban centres is reflected in the proportions of stamps representing different groups of workshops : the composition of the goods varies greatly between sites in the south and the west of the province and those along the ripa. This study might be furthered by analysis of other aspects relating to the importation of sigillated pots in Pannonia, for example, from the standpoint of consumption, or the types of pots (forms, size, usage) used for living purposes and in the necropolises, or perhaps from the perspective of the manufacturers, and the commercial relations between the officina and the potters. La céramique sigillée est bien souvent utilisée en archéologie pour dater les sites, mais elle donne également des informations sur les modes de vie et les capacités économiques des communautés consommatrices ainsi que sur relations commerciales interprovinciales. Les estampilles sur les sigillées lisses sont des témoins précieux de l'organisation des ateliers et de la production. Leur utilisation a varié selon les régions et les époques, à la fois en fréquence (proportion des vases lisses estampillés) et en nature (types de vases signés, fonction de l'estampille, personne représentée). Elles sont également un très bon indicateur des relations commerciales établies tour à tour entre les ateliers de Gaule, de Germanie, des régions danubiennes (choisis pour cette étude) et la Pannonie. Depuis les premières recherches faites en Pannonie à la fin du XIXe siècle jusqu'aux fouilles récentes, le corpus des estampilles s'est progressivement enrichi, notamment grâce aux études de grands sites tels que Carnuntum, Salla, Brigetio, Poetovio, Budaörs, Baláca, Páty, Aquincum, Gerulata, Gorsium, Vindobona, dont les sigillées ont parfois fait l'objet de publications systématiques. Néanmoins, bien que le matériel soit de plus en plus riche, aucune synthèse n'a encore pu être faite pour la province entière. À l'heure actuelle, si l'on souhaite retrouver la distribution d'un potier en Pannonie, on est confronté au dépouillement d'une bibliographie dispersée et peu accessible. L'un des objectifs de cet article est donc de proposer un recueil regroupant les données pour l'ensemble de la province, qui pourrait notamment être utile aux chercheurs étrangers. 2043 estampilles sont présentées ici, environ la moitié avec leur reproduction. Chacune est identifiée et classée par potier, afin dans un second temps, de proposer une analyse fine de la commercialisation et de la consommation des sigillées provenant des ateliers occidentaux. Une étude statistique et cartographique permet de retracer les évolutions des quantités d'estampilles en circulation dans la Province. La consommation des sigillées est tout d'abord appréhendée du point de vue des sociétés consommatrices. Il s'agit d'analyser les sites les mieux connus de Pannonie et de comparer l'arrivée des sigillées dans les différents types de communautés (civiles, militaires, indigènes, rurales, urbaines). On remarque qu'à certains moments, les communautés fortement liées économiquement et socialement à l'armée (notamment sur la ripa Pannonica), étaient celles qui avaient le plus grand pouvoir d'achat et présentaient la plus forte demande. Un lien étroit peut également être établi avec la position des centres urbains sur les principaux axes de diffusion des sigillées en Pannonie. La question est ensuite abordée d'un point de vue chronologique afin de retracer l'historique de la commercialisation de la sigillée en provenance des différents groupes d'ateliers occidentaux. Quelques grands ateliers sont privilégiés pour le commerce en Pannonie (La Graufesenque particulièrement sous les règnes de Domitien et Trajan, Lezoux entre 140 et 170, Rheinzabern entre 180 et 250). Ils ont dominé successivement le marché pannonien, même si d'autres ateliers comme Banassac, les Martres-de-Veyre, Heiligenberg, Westerndorf et Pfaffenhofen ont également joué un rôle dans les importations. Les changements survenus dans l'organisation de l'approvisionnement des marchés pannoniens sont bien sûr liés au dynamisme des ateliers, mais ils ont également été fortement influencés par la conjoncture à la fois économique, sociale et historique en Pannonie. Les événements militaires ont joué un rôle majeur : les guerres contre les Daces, qui ont suivi la <b>sécurisation</b> du commerce fluvial, la construction d'une ligne de fortifications sur la ripa, ont entraîné une concentration de l'armée sur le Danube et créé un contexte favorable pour le développement des importations depuis la Gaule du Sud par la voie danubienne. À l'inverse, les perturbations causées par les guerres des Marcomans et des Sarmates ont largement contribué à la sortie des productions lezoviennes des marchés pannoniens. Dans d'autres cas, c'est la politique impériale qui a renforcé les communautés consommatrices, par exemple par les campagnes d'urbanisation sous le règne d'Hadrien (époque de développement des importations de Lezoux) et à l'époque sévérienne, ainsi que par toutes les faveurs et l'argent que les empereurs ont dépensé sur l'armée dans cette région qui avait une position stratégique (ce qui a eu pour effet la domination des sigillées de Rheinzabern dans les sites pannoniens). À certaines phases de prospérité particulière, la demande était si importante qu'elle ne pouvait être entièrement satisfaite par les seules productions venues des ateliers dominant le marché; cela a créé une ouverture pour l'arrivée des productions d'autres ateliers qui ont ainsi profité de ces circonstances favorables. C'est par exemple le cas des ateliers de Gaule de l'Est entre 135 et 160 / 165. Westerndorf et Pfaffenhofen ont également profité du second âge d'or de l'époque sévérienne et Pfaffenhofen était avantagée par sa position dans la même zone de taxation. Toutes ces évolutions ont à leur tour influencé la structure des réseaux de diffusion de la sigillée par le développement de certains axes comme la route de l'ambre, la voie diagonale Aquincum-Poetovio et l'axe danubien. En parallèle, cela a influencé le dynamisme des centres de consommation situés sur ces axes : le développement de la voie danubienne a réduit l'importance de Neviodunum et Siscia situés sur les anciennes routes commerciales depuis l'Italie, tandis qu'il a favorisé le rôle d'Aquincum ou Carnuntum comme ports de commerce. Les évolutions de l'intensité de la consommation de sigillée dans les centres urbains sont particulièrement visibles dans les proportions des estampilles provenant des différents groupes d'ateliers : la composition du mobilier varie fortement entre les sites du sud et de l'ouest de la province et ceux situés le long de la ripa. Cette étude peut être complétée par une analyse des autres aspects de l'importation des sigillées en Pannonie, par exemple du point de vue de la consommation, les choix des types de vases (formes, taille, utilisation) dans les habitats et dans les nécropoles, ou bien du point de vue des fabricants, les relations commerciales des officina et des potiers...|$|E
