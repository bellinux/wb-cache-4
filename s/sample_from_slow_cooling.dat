In the present study, solid state characteristics of the sodium salt of the candidate cholesterol reducing compound eritadenine, 2 (R), 3 (R)) -dihydroxy- 4 -(9 -adenyl) -butanoic acid, were investigated. The compound was crystallized by <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>from</b> water and various aqueous ethanol solutions, at different temperatures. Further, the compound solution was subjected to lyophilization and to high vacuum drying. The resulting solids were screened for polymorphism by micro Raman spectroscopy (λex = 830 nm) and the crystallinity was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction. Further, thermal analysis was applied to study possible occurrence of solvates or hydrates. Solids obtained <b>from</b> <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> showed crystallinity, whereas rapid cooling gave rise to more amorphous solids. Analysis of difference spectra of the Raman data for solids obtained <b>from</b> <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> of solution revealed subtle differences in the structures between crystals derived from pure water and crystals derived from aqueous ethanol solutions. Finally, from the thermal analysis it was deduced that crystals obtained from pure water were stoichiometrically dihydrates whereas crystals obtained from aqueous ethanol solutions were 2. 5 hydrates; this formation of different hydrates were supported by the Raman difference analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{petrogenesis}} of igneous and {{metamorphic rocks}} {{is a function}} of several parameters. Of these, temperature and pressure are of particular importance. Information concerning these two parameters is obtained through the use of mineral indicators. One such commonly used geothermometer/oxybarometer is that involving ilmenite/titano-magnetite. Anomalously low temperatures have been reported in cases in which the geothermometer/oxybarometer was employed. The studies suggest that low temperatures result <b>from</b> <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> rates which allows the Fe-Ti oxides to re-equilibrate. The current investigation is mainly concerned with the kinetics of the reduction of ilmenite-hematite solid solution, since this is the slower and, consequently, rate-controlling step in the re-equilibration process.

40|$|The {{development}} of high-performance uranium-metal fuel elements for Savannah River reac-tors required a major metallurgical effort to achieve satisfactory irradiation behavior. Fuel ele-ment designs were progressively modified {{from the original}} small-diameter slug through a hollow slug of similar dimensions to the final large-diameter tubes that provided the increased heat transfer surface needed for high reactor powers. Concurrent adaption of cladding tech-niques led to the {{development of}} hot-press bonding and later to hot-die-size bonding of the aluminum can onto the nickel-plated uranium core to replace the original aluminum-silicon-dip bonding process. Concurrent modifications in processing the uranium cores were necessary for satisfactory reac-tor performances of the fuel elements. An intermediate rate cooling process, specifically oil quenching, for beta host treatment of the alpha phase cores was developed to prevent introduc-ing (a) crystallographic texture due to fast cooling from the beta phase, which resulted in aniso-tropic shape changes during irradiation, and (b) a large grain size <b>from</b> <b>slow</b> <b>cooling,</b> which produced surface roughening. Low solubility alloying elements, such as silicon and aluminum, were added to the uranium to control the gross cavitational swelling encountered during irra-diation at elevated temperatures.

Samples of high density PE (HDPE), low density PE (LDPE), linear low density PE (LLDPE), and very low density PE (VLDPE) with different crystal structures and morphologies were prepared by various thermal treatments (isothermal crystallization and slow, fast, and dynamic cooling). The reversing and nonreversing contributions, measured on the experimental time scale, were varied, depending on the crystal stability. A relatively large reversing melt contribution occurs for unstable crystals formed by fast cooling compared to those <b>from</b> <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> treatments. All <b>samples</b> of highly branched LDPE, LLDPE, and VLDPE showed a broad exotherm before the main melting peak in the nonreversing curve, suggesting crystallization and annealing of crystals to more stable forms. Other samples of HDPE, except when cooled quickly, did not show any significant crystallization and annealing before melting. The crystallinity indicated that dynamically cooled polymers were much more crystalline, which {{can be attributed to}} crystal perfection at the lamellar surface. A reversible melting component was also detected during the quasiisothermal TMDSC measurements. Melting is often accompanied by large irreversible effects, such as crystallization and annealing, where the crystals are not at equilibrium.

(1988) {{have shown}} that <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> of dental {{porcelain}} produces increases in thermal expansion sufficient to make a compatible metal-porcelain system incompatible. The present study was undertaken {{to determine whether the}} in-crease in porcelain thermal expansion might be attributable to crystallization of additional leucite during <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> of the porcelain. Eight x-ray diffraction specimens for each of six commercial dental porcelains and for the Component No. 1 frit of the Weinstein and Weinstein (1962) and Weinstein et al.

Specimens in the first group (termed fast-cooled) were cooled in the conventional manner by removing them from the furnace at the maximum firing temperature immediately into room air. Specimens in the second group (termed slow-cooled) were cooled slowly by interrupting power to the furnace muffle and allow-ing them to cool inside the closed furnace. Quantitative x-ray diffraction was performed on the fast- and slow-cooled por-celain specimens with standards containing leucite volume fractions of 0. 111, 0. 223, 0. 334, and 0. 445. Unpaired, one-tailed t tests were performed on the fast- and slow-cool data, and a significant increase (p< 0. 05) in the amount of leucite (as a function of the <b>slow</b> <b>cooling)</b> was found for each of the porcelains.

40|$|This paper {{builds on}} the "Grain Refinement of Mg Alloys" {{published}} in 2005 and reviews the grain refinement research on Mg alloys that has been undertaken since then {{with an emphasis on}} the theoretical and analytical methods that have been developed. Consideration of recent research results and current theoretical knowledge has highlighted two important factors that affect an alloy&# 039;s as-cast grain size. The first factor applies to commercial Mg-Al alloys where it is concluded that impurity and minor elements such as Fe and Mn have a substantially negative impact on grain size because, in combination with Al, intermetallic phases can be formed that tend to poison the more potent native or deliberately added nucleant particles present in the melt. This factor appears to explain the contradictory experimental outcomes reported in the literature and suggests that the search for a more potent and reliable grain refining technology may need to take a different approach. The second factor applies to all alloys and is related to the role of constitutional supercooling which, on the one hand, promotes grain nucleation and, on the other hand, forms a nucleation-free zone preventing further nucleation within this zone, consequently limiting the grain refinement achievable, particularly in low solute-containing alloys. Strategies to reduce the negative impact of these two factors are discussed. Further, the Interdependence model has been shown to apply to a broad range of casting methods <b>from</b> <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> gravity die casting to fast cooling high pressure die casting and dynamic methods such as ultrasonic treatment...|$|R

40|$|Earth’s global {{magnetic}} field arises from vigorous convection within the liquid outer core. Palaeomagnetic evidence {{reveals that the}} geodynamo has operated for at least 3. 4 billion years, which places constraints on Earth’s formation and evolution. Available power sources in standard models include compositional convection (driven by the solidifying inner core’s expulsion of light elements), thermal convection (<b>from</b> <b>slow</b> <b>cooling),</b> and perhaps heat from the decay of radioactive isotopes. However, recent first-principles calculations and diamond-anvil cell experiments indicate that the thermal conductivity of iron is {{two or three times}} larger than typically assumed in these models. This presents a problem: a large increase in the conductive heat flux along the adiabat (due to the higher conductivity of iron) implies that the inner core is young (less than one billion years old), but thermal convection and radiogenic heating alone may {{not have been able to}} sustain the geodynamo during earlier epochs. Here we show that the precipitation of magnesium-bearing minerals from the core could have served as an alternative power source. Equilibration at high temperatures in the aftermath of giant impacts allows a small amount of magnesium (one or two weight per cent) to partition into the core while still producing the observed abundances of siderophile elements in the mantle and avoiding an excess of silicon and oxygen in the core. The transport of magnesium as oxide or silicate from the cooling core to underneath the mantle is an order of magnitude more efficient per unit mass as a source of buoyancy than inner-core growth. We therefore conclude that Earth’s dynamo would survive throughout geologic time (from at least 3. 4 billion years ago to the present) even if core radiogenic heating were minimal and core <b>cooling</b> were <b>slow...</b>|$|R

40|$|Summary. — The {{spectra of}} the {{majority}} of bursts exhibit a low-energy power law index, α, that is either a constant or becomes softer with time. However, in the burst of 30 May 1996 α becomes harder. Here we show that this behavior can be explained by a hybrid model consisting of a thermal and a non-thermal component. In this burst the power-law index of the non-thermal component changes drastically from s ∼ − 1. 5 to s ∼ − 0. 67 at approximately 5 seconds after the trigger, thereby revealing, at low energies, the thermal component with its hard Rayleigh-Jeans tail. This leads to the large α-values that are found if the Band function is fitted to the spectra. We suggest that the change in s could be due to a transition <b>from</b> fast to <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> of the electrons emitting in the BATSE range.

Experimental {{results show that the}} Type (II) viscous magnetization, which gives the presence of superparamagnetic metallic grains more than 1 / 4 of total metal, is observed in almost all lunar fines and breccias but none of stony meteorites possesses the Type (II) viscous magnetization, and that almost all stony meteorites are still maintaining a magnetic phase composition resulted <b>from</b> a <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> of a metallic melt, approximately keeping the phase equilibrium condition, whereas the majority of lunar materials, particularly lunar breccias, contain the secondary products of a remelting (or a reheating) followed by a rapid cooling such as α_ 2 -phase of metallic nickel-iron, schereibersite, and pure metallic iron exsolved from Fe-bearing silicate minerals by the subsolidus reduction process.

All sites received a ecological quality (post-) classification ranging from 1 (bad status) to 4 (good status) based on biotic and abiotic variables, using a combination of multivariate analysis and expert-judgement. A number of bioassessment metrics was tested for both stream types (fast and slow running streams) to examine their power to discriminate between streams of different ecological quality within each stream type. A metric was selected for inclusion in the final multimetric index when there was no overlap of the 25 th and 75 th percentile between one (or more) ecological quality class(es). Out of all metrics tested, none could distinguish between all four ecological quality classes without overlap of the 25 th and 75 th percentile between {{one or more of the}} classes. Instead, metrics were selected that could distinguish between one (or more) ecological quality class(es) and all others.

40|$|The present thesis {{demonstrates}} {{an integrated}} {{approach to the}} development of a potential active pharmaceutical ingredient, eritadenine, a cholesterol reducing compound originating from the shiitake mushroom (Lentinus edodes). The main areas covered in the thesis are a method for quantification of eritadenine, production of eritadenine by submerged cultivation of fungal mycelia and investigation of the influence of process parameters on mycelial growth and production, and finally solid state characterizations of eritadenine. The usage of the fungus as a source of eritadenine requires an analytical tool for quantification of the compound. An HPLC method was hence developed for identification and quantification of eritadenine, using chemically synthesized eritadenine as a reference. The amount of eritadenine in fruit bodies of selected strains of shiitake was determined and with the method developed in this study, eritadenine concentrations up to ten times higher than previously reported were detected. Since both fruit bodies and mycelia of shiitake have been shown to contain eritadenine submerged cultivation of shiitake mycelia was investigated as an alternative source for this compound. The mycelia were cultivated in various submerged conditions, both in shake flasks and in bioreactors. It was found that both the mycelia and the culture media contained eritadenine, of which the major part was detected in the culture media. While the biomass concentrations were higher in shake flasks, the eritadenine concentrations were considerably higher in the bioreactors, which were assigned to morphological variations. In an attempt to improve the mycelial growth and eritadenine production, a growth promotive substance in the form of a water extract of DDGS, a by-product from drygrind ethanol facilities, was added to the culture media. It was demonstrated that an amendment of the cultivation media with this extract caused a considerable growth promotive effect on shiitake mycelia in bioreactor cultivations, along with enhanced eritadenine production. If eritadenine will be used as a pharmaceutical agent, understanding about the solid state chemistry of the compound is required. Raman spectroscopy is a valuable technique for investigation of structural properties; hence, a Raman reference spectrum with line assignments for the solid state of synthetic eritadenine was established. To further investigate the solid state chemistry of eritadenine, its synthetic analogue was slowly crystallized from water and different ethanol concentrations, at different temperatures. Solids formed <b>from</b> <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> of either water or aqueous ethanol showed crystallinity. No polymorphism was detected, irrespective of solvent system or temperature. However, dissimilar thermal behaviours were observed, deducing crystals derived from water as dihydrates and crystals derived from aqueous ethanol as 2. 5 hydrates.

40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanism}} of brittleness due to <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> during quenching was experimentally investigated in 12 % Cr martensitic heat resistant steel. The mechanical property tests and {{microstructural characterization by}} SEM、?TEM and XRD were conducted. The results showed the impact toughness would decrease with the <b>slowing</b> of <b>cooling</b> rate during quenching, and the low cooling rate within the temperature range from 820 to 660 °C played {{a significant effect on}} the impact toughness. Different from the {{mechanism of}} temper brittleness, the main causes of embrittlement due to the <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> upon quenching were both the continuous precipitation of M 23 C 6 along prior austenite grain boundaries during the process of <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> and that of M 2 C along prior residual austenite film during tempering, and this kind of quench brittleness was nonreversal. 1...|$|R
