40|$|Abstract—Several {{extensive}} {{experimental studies}} of human/machine interac-tions wherein the human operators and the target machines are separated by dis-tances of up to several thousand miles yield anomalous results comparable in scale and character to those produced under conditions of physical proximity. The output distributions of random binary events produced {{by a variety of}} micro-electronic random and pseudorandom generators, as well as by a macroscopic random mechanical cascade, display small but replicable and statistically signifi-cant mean shifts correlated with the remote operators ' pre-stated intentions, and feature cumulative achievement patterns {{similar to those of the}} corresponding local experiments. Individual operator effect sizes distribute normally, with the majority of participants contributing to the overall effect. Patterns of <b>specific</b> <b>count</b> populations are also similar to those found in the corresponding local ex-periments. The insensitivity of the size and details of these results to intervening distance and time adds credence to a large database of precognitive remote per-ception experiments, and suggests that these two forms of anomaly may draw from similar mechanisms of information exchange between human conscious-ness and random physical processes...|$|E
30|$|The {{importance}} of newspapers {{as well as}} the propensity to post HW ads in them might be different across cities. For these reasons adding the rough HW count for the cities to obtain a national count of HW ads would be misleading. Instead, we use an analogous strategy to the one adopted by the Conference Board Help-Wanted Index (e.g., Preston 1977) in the US. We convert the city <b>specific</b> <b>count</b> of advertisements into city specific indexes with a common base year—in our case we set the city indexes equal to 100 in year 2000. Then, these indexes are averaged across cities using the relative weights of their respective labor forces over time. (To obtain the labor force series we had to merge several pieces of information. The assumptions made are reported in Additional file 1). The relative weights are adjusted according to the availability of HW indexes. For example, for the period 1976 – 1977 the weights are calculated only for the five cities for which HW data is available. Since January 1978 Barranquilla is included and finally the full set of seven cities, including Pasto, is used since January 2000.|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} between the intensity of X-rays induced by β-rays of tritium and the total pressure of hydrogen isotope mixtures was examined in a pressure range from 10 - 1 to 105 Pa by using three different tritium gases, i. e., pure T 2, D 2 - 1 %T 2 and H 2 - 1 %T 2 mixtures. It was found that linear pressure dependence was obtained up to a few kPa {{for all of the}} measured gases by taking dead time of the X-ray detector into account. Above this pressure, however, downward deviation from the linear relation appeared. It was revealed that the effect of self-absorption of β-rays on the pressure dependence was not negligibly small, because the ratios of the counting rates corrected by dead time to total pressure, i. e., <b>specific</b> <b>counting</b> rates, could not be reproduced by a simple exponential function using the absorption coefficients of hydrogen isotopes as variables. The results suggested that an additional factor such as contribution of an X-ray formation on the surfaces of a measuring cell must be taken into consideration in changing in the <b>specific</b> <b>counting</b> rates...|$|R

40|$|An {{extension}} of the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), denoted class-specific-simplex LDA (css-LDA), is proposed for image classification. An analysis of the supervised LDA models currently used for this task shows {{that the impact of}} class information on the topics discovered by these models is very weak in general. This implies that the discovered topics are driven by general image regularities, rather than the semantic regularities of interest for classification. To address this, we introduce a model that induces supervision in topic discovery, while retaining the original flexibility of LDA to account for unanticipated structures of interest. The proposed css-LDA is an LDA model with class supervision at the level of image features. In css-LDA topics are dis-covered per class, i. e. a single set of topics shared across classes is replaced by multiple class-specific topic sets. This model can be used for generative classification using the Bayes decision rule or even extended to discriminative clas-sification with support vector machines (SVMs). A css-LDA model can endow an image with a vector of class and topic <b>specific</b> <b>count</b> statistics that are similar to the Bag-of-words (BoW) histogram. SVM-based discriminants can be learned for classes in the space of these histograms. The effec-tiveness of css-LDA model in both generative and discrim-inative classification frameworks is demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation, involving multiple benchmark datasets, where it is shown to outperform all ex-isting LDA based image classification approaches. 1...|$|E

INCOSE provided expertise {{as well as a}} forum for collaboration between stakeholders that led to the eventual development of the model. In 2004, we provided eleven lessons learned from experiences collecting systems engineering data from six companies in collaboration with the INCOSE Measurement Working Group and the Practical Software and Systems Measurement (PSM). These lessons were focused on the development of COSYSMO that was motivated by a similar model from the software domain, COCOMO II, but was a first of its kind for systems engineering. Now that the development phase of the model is completed we take a retrospective view of lessons learned during the ongoing validation phase of the model and present new lessons learned that should help cost model developers, academic researchers, and practitioners develop and validate similar approaches. These lessons include the need for more <b>specific</b> <b>counting</b> rules, an approach to account for reuse in systems engineering, and strategies for model adoption in organizations.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{two problems}} {{at the forefront of}} neurobiology and of noise research. They arise from non-renewal firing processes in nerve cells, due to various forms of memory. The combination of short and long-term correlations between firing intervals has been shown to enhance information transfer, namely by causing a minimal variability in the spike count distribution at a <b>specific</b> <b>counting</b> time. The first problem concerns first passage time calculations in a model that combines these two forms of correlations. It is a two-dimensional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model in which the threshold is also a dynamical variable. The second problem concerns the effect of long-range correlations on neuron firing statistics. We show new results on the interspike interval densities as well as the spike count Fano factor for the perfect integrate-and-fire (PIF) model forced by a slow (long-correlation time) Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which is a simplification of the previous model. These theoretical results are obtained using a quasi-static noise approximation. There remain, however, many exciting challenges in relating correlations with signal detection in neurobiological systems, some of which are highlighted in our paper...|$|R

Therefore, such penetrating radiation {{can be used for}} in vivo control of hadrontherapy treatments, for which the primary beam is absorbed inside the patient. Among secondary radiations, prompt-gamma rays were proposed for real-time verification of ion range. Such a verification is a desired condition to reduce uncertainties in treatment planning. For more than a decade, efforts have been undertaken worldwide to promote prompt-gamma-based devices to be used in clinical conditions. Dedicated cameras are necessary to overcome the challenges of a broad- and high-energy distribution, a large background, high instantaneous count rates, and compatibility constraints with patient irradiation. Several types of prompt-gamma imaging devices have been proposed, that are either physically-collimated or electronically collimated (Compton cameras). Clinical tests are now undergoing.

40|$|International audienceParallel image {{compositing}} {{has been}} widely studied over the past 20 years, as this is one, if not the most, crucial element {{in the implementation of}} a scalable parallel rendering system. Many algorithms have been proposed and implemented on a large variety of supercomputers. Among the existing supercomputers, InfiniBandTM (IB) PC clusters, and their associated fat-tree topology, are clearly becoming the dominant architecture, as they provide the scalability, high bandwidth and low latency required by the most demanding parallel applications. Surprisingly, very few efforts have been devoted to the implementation and performance evaluation of parallel image compositing algorithms on this kind of architecture. We propose in this paper a new parallel image compositing algorithm, called Shift-Based, relying on a well-known communication pattern called shift permutation. Indeed, shift permutation is one of the possible ways to get the maximum cross bisectional bandwidth provided by an IB fat-tree cluster. We show that our Shift-Based algorithm scales on any number of processing nodes (with peak performance on <b>specific</b> <b>counts),</b> allows overlapping communications with computations and exhibits contention-free network communications.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to prove Golyshev’s {{conjecture}} in the cases of Fano threefolds V 10 and V 14. This conjecture states modularity of D 3 equations for smooth Fano threefolds with Picard group Z. More precisely, we find counting matrices of prime two-pointed Gromov–Witten invariants for them. For this we use the method that lets us find Gromov–Witten invariants of complete intersections in varieties whose invariants are (partially) known. The paper is organized as follows. In § 1 we give definitions of Gromov–Witten invariants and stacks of stable maps of genus 0 with marked points. In § 2 we state Golyshev’s conjecture. In § 3 we prove three main theorems of this paper. These theorems are based on S. Mukai’s description of Fano threefolds as complete intersections in the orbifolds and Quantum Lefschetz Theorem. The first and the second theorem describe the methods to find Gromov–Witten invariants of complete intersections in varieties whose invariants are (partially) known; in the third we explicitly find the <b>specific</b> <b>counting</b> matrices for threefolds V 10 and V 14.

These issues are organised in a five-fold typology covering OECD domestic agricultural policy, agricultural trade policy, regulatory policies, development cooperation policy {{as well as}} the coherence of developing country policies. Changes in OECD agricultural policy have varying impacts on different groups of developing countries, and on different groups within developing countries. The message for policy coherence for development analysis is that <b>specifics</b> <b>count,</b> and that impacts need to be assessed on a country by country basis. Bringing a policy coherence perspective to the debates on OECD agricultural policy reform requires a careful classification of the various channels whereby developing countries are impacted by this reform, not least so as to identify ways in which development assistance can be used so as to maximise the opportunities it creates but also to help to mitigate adverse impacts where they occur.
