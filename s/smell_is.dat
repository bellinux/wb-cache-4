5|$|The {{sense of}} <b>smell</b> <b>is</b> {{generated}} by receptor {{cells in the}} epithelium of the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity. This information passes through a relatively permeable part of the skull to the olfactory nerve. This nerve transmits to the neural circuitry of the olfactory bulb from where information is passed to the olfactory cortex.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, a bottlenose's {{sense of}} <b>smell</b> <b>is</b> poor, because its blowhole, the {{analogue}} to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins {{are able to}} detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but {{this has not been}} well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, although it is not clear if taste mediates this preference.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been {{directly}} studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, {{it is able to}} recognize observers at great distances. The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of <b>smell</b> <b>is</b> excellent.|$|E
40|$|Code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> poor {{implementation}} choices, {{thought to}} make object-oriented systems hard to maintain. In this study, we investigate if classes with code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> more change-prone than classes without smells. Specifically, we test the general hypothesis: classes with code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> not more change prone than other classes. We detect 29 code smells in 9 releases of Azureus and in 13 releases of Eclipse, {{and study the}} relation between classes with these code smells and class change-proneness. We show that, in almost all releases of Azureus and Eclipse, classes with code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> more change-prone than others, and that specific <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> more correlated than others to change-proneness. These results justify a posteriori previous work on the specification and detection of code smells and could help focusing quality assurance and testing activities...|$|R

5|$|Bears {{have small}} rounded ears {{so as to}} {{minimise}} heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have colour vision, perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive whiskers on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent sense of smell, better {{than that of the}} dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. <b>Smell</b> <b>is</b> the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before.|$|E
5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of <b>smell</b> <b>is</b> more important than sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E
5|$|The Boletus pinophilus is edible, {{and may be}} used fresh, preserved, {{dried and}} cooked {{in a manner similar}} to that of other edible boletes. It is highly {{regarded}} and can be quite expensive in central Mexico, and is often sold dried there. The flesh is white, soft in mature specimens and does not change colour upon bruising. The taste and <b>smell</b> <b>is</b> pleasant. People of La Malinche have likened the flavour to pork and pork crackling. It is easily misidentified as the porcini Boletus edulis, due to the similar habitat and appearance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{explores the}} various code smells or {{the so called}} bad code {{symptoms}} present in procedural C software. The code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> analyzed {{in the light of}} aspect oriented programming. The intention is to handle the code smells with aspect oriented constructs as it offers more versatile decomposition techniques than the traditional modularization techniques, for software evolution and understandability. The code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> described at the function and program level. The code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> followed by the aspect oriented transformations that may be required in order to improve the code quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} into test <b>smells</b> <b>was</b> {{to find out how}} familiar developers <b>are</b> with test <b>smells,</b> the frequency of test smells and their severity in the industrial world. First of all, a taxonomy of different test <b>smells</b> <b>was</b> created and grouped according to programming principles as a basis for this study. Several interviews were then conducted to find out which test smells to include in the subsequent survey. 20 people with different industrial experience levels participated in this survey. It was hypothesised that test <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> not identified as such and that their names are unknown. The hypothesis was supported by the results of the survey. The results revealed that test <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> not quite well-known despite {{the fact that some of}} them occur rather frequently and pose severe problems...|$|R
40|$|In {{computer}} programming, code smell may {{origin of}} latent problems in source code. Detecting and resolving bad smells remain time intense for software engineers despite proposals on bad smell detecting and refactoring tools. Numerous code <b>smells</b> have <b>been</b> recognized yet the sequence {{in which the}} detection and resolution {{of different kinds of}} code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> performed because software engineers {{do not know how to}} optimize sequence. In this paper, the novel refactoring approach is proposed to improve the performance of programs. In this recommended approach the code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> automatically detected and refactored. The simulation results propose the reduction of time over the semi-automated refactoring are achieved when code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> refactored by using multi-step automated refactoring...|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{lookalike}} species found in North American {{with which the}} Appalachian waxy cap might be confused. Hygrocybe cantharellus is a bright red mushroom that has smaller fruit bodies and a more slender stipe than H.appalachianensis. It also has smaller spores, measuring 7–12 by 4–8µm. Hygrocybe reidii, found in Europe and northeastern North America, has flesh with a sweet odor that reminiscent of honey. This <b>smell</b> <b>is</b> sometimes weak and only noticeable when the tissue is rubbed, or when it is drying. Its scarlet cap initially has a narrow yellow-orange margin.|$|E
5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. This sense of <b>smell</b> <b>is</b> important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef sharks feed {{mainly on}} bony fishes, with {{cephalopods}} such as squid and octopus being the second-most important food group, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters {{making up the}} remainder. The larger sharks take {{a greater proportion of}} cephalopods. These sharks hunt individually or in groups, and have been known to pin schools of fish against the outer walls of coral reefs for feeding. They excel at capturing fish swimming in the open, and they complement hunting whitetip reef sharks, which are more adept at capturing fish inside caves and crevices. Their sense of <b>smell</b> <b>is</b> extremely acute, being capable of detecting one part tuna extract in 10 billion parts of sea water. In the presence of a large quantity of food, grey reef sharks may be roused into a feeding frenzy; in one documented frenzy caused by an underwater explosion that killed several snappers, one of the sharks involved was attacked and consumed by the others.|$|E

25|$|Its {{sense of}} <b>smell</b> <b>is</b> very well developed, {{to the point}} that the animal is used for drug {{detection}} in Germany.

30|$|Specific <b>smells</b> {{can also}} <b>be</b> related to {{cultural}} practices, expressions and knowledge.

25|$|Deep sea {{demersal}} fish are usually long and narrow. Many are eels or shaped like eels. This {{may be because}} long bodies have long lateral lines.

40|$|Code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> {{manifestations of}} design flaws that can degrade code {{maintainability}} if left to fester. The {{research in this}} paper investigates the potential of code smells to reflect system-level indicators of maintainability.

We evaluated four medium-sized Java systems using code smells and compared the results against previous evaluations on the same systems based on expert judgment and the Chidamber and Kemerer suite of metrics. The systems were maintained over a period up to 4 weeks. During maintenance, effort (person-hours) and number of defects were measured, to validate the different evaluation approaches. Results suggest that code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> strongly influenced by size. An implication <b>is</b> that code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> likely to yield inaccurate results when comparing the maintainability of systems differing in size. When comparing the evaluation approaches, expert judgment was found as the most accurate and flexible since it considered effects due to a system’s size and complexity and could adapt to different maintenance scenarios.
