2500|$|The {{next three}} layers {{comprise}} lamina LPs, which is stratified by their histological composition of elastin and collagen fibers, with fibroblast, myofibroblast and macrophages interspersed sparsely. The superficial layer LPs (SLLPs), {{also known as}} Reinke's space, is composed of amorphous substance and microfibrils which allows this cover layer to “slide” over the deep layer easily. The vibratory and viscoelastic characteristics of human VFs are mainly attributed to the molecular composition of SLLPs. In normal vocal fold, the jelly-like “Reinke's space” is very loose and abundant with interstitial proteins such as hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, proteoglycan like fibromodulin, decorin and versican. All these ECM components together regulate the water content of vocal fold and render the viscous shear property for it. [...] The squamous epithelium and superficial lamina propria form the vocal mucosa which serves as vibratory component in phonation. The mucosa layer vibrates at a frequency range of 100–1000Hz and displacement at 1mm approximately. The intermediate layer of LPs consists primarily of elastic fiber while the deep layer LP consists of fewer elastin and more collagen fibers. These two layers have poor differentiated boundary but are increasingly stiffer than SLLPs. The intermediate and deep layers of LPs compose the vocal ligaments which are enclosed within the vocal folds and are responsible for strain in phonation. Within the ECM community of vocal ligament, fibrous proteins such as elastin and collagen are pivotal in maintaining the proper elastic biomechanical property of vocal fold. Elastin fibers impart the flexibility and elasticity of the vocal folds and, collagen {{is responsible for the}} resistance and resiliece to tensile strength. The normal <b>strain</b> <b>level</b> of vocal ligament ranges from 0–15% during phonation These fibrous proteins exhibit distribution variations spatially and temporally due to fibroblast turnover during tissue maturation and aging.

Several site response analysis codes are available, but their variabilities to predict site response at shear stress levels approaching the shear strength of the soil have not been demonstrated. This study evaluates the performance of different soil models employed in each code to predict the nonlinearity behavior of soil {{over a wide range}} of <b>strain</b> <b>levels.</b> This research performed a set of 1 D site response analyses utilizing input motions, scaled to various intensity levels, against sites that were underlain by cohesive deposits with determined shear wave velocity profiles. The analyses utilized several available nonlinear soil models while the model-to-model variability was characterized. These codes were then validated against free-field downhole data from a vertical array at a relatively well characterized site. The evaluations of the variabilities of ground motion amplitude, duration, response spectra and cyclic hysteresis loop at various <b>strain</b> <b>levels</b> were performed by comparing all predictions to data from a vertical array. The results showed that all codes give consistent predictions with reasonable accuracy at small to moderate shear <b>strain</b> <b>levels.</b> At larger shear <b>strain</b> <b>levels,</b> only some of current nonlinear soil models were capable of predicting reasonable cyclic behavior in terms of being able to approach the peak shear strength with reasonable damping behavior. The analyses show that the variability of predicted peak shear strain parameters are higher than peak acceleration and shear stress parameters.

It may be noted that for a body loaded in constant displacement mode, the displacement is applied and the force level is dictated by stiffness (or compliance) of the body. If the crack grows in size, the stiffness decreases, so the force level will decrease.

50|$|Of {{all modern}} strain gauge alloys, {{constantan}} is the oldest, {{and still the}} most widely used.

This alloy has, for example, an adequately high strain sensitivity, or gauge factor, which is relatively insensitive to <b>strain</b> <b>level</b> and temperature. Its resistivity (49.0 x 10−8 Ω·m) is high enough to achieve suitable resistance values in even very small grids, and its temperature coefficient of resistance is fairly low. In addition, constantan is characterized by good fatigue life and relatively high elongation capability. However, constantan tends to exhibit a continuous drift at temperatures above 65 °C (150 °F); and this characteristic should be taken into account when zero stability of the strain gauge is critical over a period of hours or days. Constantan is also used for electrical resistance heating and thermocouples.|$|E

The topmost layer comprises stratified squamous epithelium which is bordered by ciliated pseudostratified epithelium. The inner lining surface of this squamous epithelium is covered by a layer of mucus (acting as a mucociliary clearance), which is composed of two layers: a mucinous layer and serous layer. Both mucus layers provide viscous and watery environment for cilia beating posteriorally and superiorly. The mucociliary clearance keeps the vocal folds essentially moist and lubricated.The epidermis layer is secured to the deeper connective tissue by basement membrane. Due to the primarily amorphous fibrous and nonfibrous proteins in the lamina propria, the basement membrane applies strong anchoring filaments like collagen Ⅳ and Ⅶ to secure the hemidesmosome of basal cell to the lamina propria. These attachments {{are strong enough to}} sustain beating and stretch, to which VFs are subjected. The population density of some of the anchoring fibers in the basement membrane, such as collagen Ⅶ, is genetically determined, and these genetics may influence the health and pathogenesis of the vocal folds.The next three layers comprise lamina LPs, which is stratified by their histological composition of elastin and collagen fibers, with fibroblast, myofibroblast and macrophages interspersed sparsely.

Application of the abductor muscle force produced a marginal decrease in the <b>strain</b> <b>levels</b> on all aspects of the femur as compared with the joint reaction force alone.

This improvement in fatigue life has been attributed to the significant slowing of small cracks while growing through surface regions of significant compressive residual stresses and local work hardening developed by the shot peening process.
