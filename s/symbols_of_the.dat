5|$|Auburn High's costumed mascot is Samford, an {{anthropomorphic}} tiger. Samford {{was created}} in 1995 and named for three <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school: Samford Avenue, which runs by the school; Duck Samford Stadium, Auburn High's football stadium; and Samford Hall, the most prominent building in Auburn. Kari Pierce and Brian Puckett were the first Samford in 1995.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, the palace and its owners became <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{slightly}} risqué glamour and decadence that {{were associated with}} Monte Carlo and the French Riviera. Glamour and theatricality became reality when the American film star Grace Kelly became chatelaine of the palace in 1956. In the 21st century, the palace remains the residence of the current Prince of Monaco.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{a lawsuit}} by the Alliance Defense Fund, a {{conservative}} Christian {{group in the}} United States, was brought against the state of Washington when it permitted a public display of a holiday tree and a menorah but not a nativity scene. Because of the lawsuit, {{the decision was made}} to permit a nativity scene to be displayed in the rotunda of the state Capitol, in Olympia, as long as other <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season were included.|$|E

Capoeira is officially considered intangible cultural heritage of Brazil.|$|R
5|$|One of the {{enduring}} <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landing of the Pilgrims is Plymouth Rock, a large granodiorite boulder that was near their landing site at Plymouth. However, {{none of the}} contemporary accounts of the actual landing makes any mention that the Rock was the specific place of landing. The Pilgrims chose the site for their landing, not for the rock, but for a small brook nearby that {{was a source of}} fresh water and fish.|$|E
5|$|The two-handled cameo cup, {{one of the}} {{acknowledged}} masterpieces among hardstone carvings {{of classical}} antiquity, was carved out of onyx and measures 8.4cm high with a diameter of 12.5cm. The cup is covered in Dionysiac vignettes and emblems, depicting masks, vases, holy animals, and garland: <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cult itself.|$|E
5|$|Within Final Fantasy Tactics, legends {{revolve around}} the Zodiac Brave Story, which deals with twelve knights who used the power of Zodiac Stones—magical stones {{engraved}} with <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelve Zodiac constellations—to fight against a demon summoned by an ambitious king to control Ivalice. This myth was twisted by the Glabados Church, as explained in the game's backstory, by including St. Ajora {{as the leader of}} the Zodiac Braves.|$|E

The text reads 'Palestine deserves the Democratic Alliance'.|$|R
5|$|After {{civil war}} broke out in England in 1135, the third earl, also called William, set about {{improving}} the defences of the castle. He began to build a tall keep {{on top of the}} motte, reinforcing the surrounding earthworks with stone walls. A planned settlement was established alongside the castle, surrounded by its own earthworks and walls, and the Peddars Way was redirected to pass by the castle, town and priory, all important <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> de Warennes' power in the region. Hamelin de Warenne acquired the castle through marriage and curtailed the building work on the keep around 1165, but completed the construction of three large stone gatehouses in the castle and town. One of these, the town's bailey gate, still survives intact.|$|E
5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|Preserved {{images of}} Szczerbiec from various {{points in time}} {{indicate}} that the decorative plates were several times dismounted and placed again on the hilt in variable configurations. The current composition, with the <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Evangelists duplicated {{on each side of}} the hilt, matches that known from the earliest preserved depiction drafted by Johann Christoph Werner in 1794. It is possible, though, that the original placement of the golden plates was different, with the symbols of Saints John and Matthew on the obverse of the grip, so that each side of the hilt displayed the symbols of all four of the Evangelists.|$|E
25|$|The eagle {{supports}} the shield on <b>the</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coat <b>of</b> arms, while <b>the</b> lion {{on the right}} side. The eagle was <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Artaxiad Dynasty and later on <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arsacid Dynasty <b>of</b> Armenia. It holds the Artaxiad Dynasty's branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shield. Whereas, the lion was <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bagratuni Dynasty and later on <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rubenid Dynasty. It holds the Rubenid Dynasty's branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shield. The eagle and the lion are a common theme for civilizations on the Armenian Highland. As such they have been represented throughout various Armenian dynasties.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> cluster <b>of</b> {{items at}} <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hunter (on the left), {{including}} a guitar, a dagger, a plumed hat, and a buckled shoe, is a <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romantic art movement. It {{could be a}} <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> Romanticism due to <b>the</b> rising popularity <b>of</b> Realism, or a <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> Romanticism in Courbet's own oeuvre.|$|R
5000|$|... "Lady Silimaka {{was known}} for <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turtle, sacred to Niue and the Pacific. During her later years <b>of</b> life, <b>the</b> turtle became a {{represented}} <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silimaka family." ...|$|R
5|$|Subsequently {{recognised}} as {{the design}} {{from which all}} later locomotives are derived, Rocket eventually came to be {{considered one of the}} most important <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Industrial Revolution. It was returned to Robert Stephenson and Company in 1851 with the intention of displaying it at The Great Exhibition, but this did not take place. It was loaned to the Patent Office for display in 1862. Moved to the Science Collection of the South Kensington Museum in 1876 (renamed the Science Museum in 1885), it has remained there ever since other than a brief display at the National Railway Museum.|$|E
5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} the sentiment of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E
5|$|The {{most visible}} way for {{graduates}} of Texas A to recognize {{each other is}} by the Aggie Ring. The Aggie Ring is worn by current students and alumni, {{and is one of}} the most well-known <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aggie Network. The first Aggie Ring was designed by E. C. Jonas in 1894, and the design has remained relatively unchanged since- the only major change came when the school's name was changed from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas to Texas A University in 1963.|$|E
50|$|This retablo shows a {{ceremony}} (“Yawar Fiesta”) involving {{a struggle between}} a bull (<b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish) and a condor (<b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andeans). The condor is tied to <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bull, who is infuriated and cannot rid itself <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condor, and eventually dies from exhaustion. The condor is then set free. It spreads its wings, and it becomes <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andean Indigenous peoples.|$|R
25|$|The Prussian Army black cross pattée {{was also}} used as <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{succeeding}} German Army from 1871 to March/April 1918, when it {{was replaced by the}} Balkenkreuz. In 1956, it was re-introduced as <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> , the modern German armed forces.|$|R
5000|$|The sickle {{is used as}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{well known}} <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hammer and sickle, which was <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Soviet Union. It is <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> Communism or Revolutionary Socialism. The sickle {{represents}} the agricultural working class or peasantry in this symbol.|$|R
5|$|The {{octagonal}} font {{dates from}} the 15th century; its carved panels alternate images of the <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Four Evangelists with seated figures of the Doctors of the Church (Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustine, Saint Jerome, and Pope Gregory I). The central column carries shields depicting the Instruments of the Passion and the Holy Wounds. The eastern shield is unusual in that a sword is shown with an ear stuck to it. This refers {{to the story of}} Saint Peter striking off the ear of Malchus, the High Priest's servant, in the garden of Gethsemane.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. {{state of}} Maryland. The {{majority}} of the items in the list are officially recognized symbols created by an act of the Maryland General Assembly and signed into law by the governor. However, two of the more famous symbols of Maryland, the state motto and the state nicknames, were never made official by the state government. While the state seal derives from the colonial heritage of the state, the majority of official state symbols were designated in the last few decades.|$|E
5|$|Throughout most of {{the history}} of Poland, the banner of Poland {{was one of the main}} <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish State, {{normally}} reserved for use by the head of state. Although its design changed with time, it was generally a heraldic banner, i.e., one based directly on the national coat of arms: a crowned White Eagle on a red field (Gules an eagle Argent crowned Or). The banner should not be confused with the flag of Poland, a white and red , officially adopted in 1919.|$|E

It is now obsolete.|$|R
5|$|Andrew {{suffered}} a stroke which paralyzed him. In an attempt to strengthen his son's claim to the throne, he had the child Solomon crowned in the one-year-long period beginning {{in the autumn of}} 1057. For the same purpose, Andrew also arranged the engagement of his son with Juditha daughter of the late Emperor Henry III, and sister of the new German monarch, Henry IV (r. 1056–1105)in September 1058. Thereafter, according to an episode narrated by most Hungarian chronicles, the king invited Duke Béla to a meeting at Tiszavárkony. At their meeting, Andrew seemingly offered his brother to freely choose between a crown and a sword, which were the <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom and the ducatus, respectively. Duke Béla, who had previously been informed by his partisans in Andrew's court that he would be murdered on the king's order if he opted for the crown, chose the sword.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of these}} works, the Peddars Way was redirected. It had {{previously}} run straight across the de Warenne estates, but it was now diverted so that travellers coming from the south {{had to leave the}} main road, progress west around the priory and the castle fishpond, before reaching {{the southern end of the}} walled town and the route to the north. If they intended to enter the castle, they would have needed to enter through the town's western gate, then the castle's gatehouse, before probably passing through a ceremonial sequence of rooms in order to finally meet the lord. The route was designed to highlight the important <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> de Warenne lordship of the region and provide a dramatic view of the castle, and may have been a response to the political uncertainties of the Anarchy years.|$|E
5|$|Bartholdi and Laboulaye {{considered}} {{how best}} to express the idea of American liberty. In early American history, two female figures were frequently used as cultural <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. One of these symbols, the personified Columbia, {{was seen as an}} embodiment of the United States in the manner that Britannia was identified with the United Kingdom and Marianne came to represent France. Columbia had supplanted the earlier figure of an Indian princess, which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans. The other significant female icon in American culture was a representation of Liberty, derived from Libertas, the goddess of freedom widely worshipped in ancient Rome, especially among emancipated slaves. A Liberty figure adorned most American coins of the time, and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art, including Thomas Crawford's Statue of Freedom (1863) atop the dome of the United States Capitol Building.|$|E
