This paper uses consumer sovereignty, as described by Averitt and Lande (1997) in their unified theory of antitrust and consumer protection law, to frame analysis of the shifting boundaries between the industryspecific and general business legal regimes for telecommunications and broadband access services. It first describes the differential evolution and historical relationship between the traditional industry-specific and general business regimes that are essential for understanding the evolving interrelationship between these regimes under deregulatory policies. It then discusses how the interrelationship is evolving since enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“TA 96 ”). For telecommunications services, there is considerable disagreement and uncertainty related to judicial reinterpretation of the preexisting <b>savings</b> <b>clause</b> in section 414 of the Communications Act of 1934 as well as interpretation of the new antitrust-specific <b>savings</b> <b>clause</b> in section 601 (b) of TA 96, the FCC’s Truth-in-Billing rules and its <b>savings</b> <b>clause,</b> and the <b>savings</b> <b>clause</b> for state regulation in section 332 (c) (3) (A) related to CMRS services.

We analyze the interpretive approaches the judiciary may employ {{to make sense of the}} statutory savings language, and conceptualize them along a continuum of influence in resolving cases.

40|$|Federal {{prisoners who}} wish to mount a {{collateral}} challenge to their conviction or sentence are generally prohibited from making their claim via the writ of habeas corpus and are forced to proceed under a similar procedure set out in 28 U. S. C. § 2255. After {{the passage of the}} Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), which added significant restrictions to § 2255 review but not to habeas review, that prohibition can be the difference between freedom and incarceration for a federal prisoner serving a term of incarceration based on an illegal conviction or sentence. There is, however, a provision within § 2255, known as the <b>savings</b> <b>clause,</b> that contains an exception to the habeas bar where the remedy provided by § 2255 is “inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of the detention. ” The courts of appeals have split on the proper test to govern the application of the <b>savings</b> <b>clause.</b> This Note examines each of the tests that has been adopted by the circuits and shows how each is problematic when analyzed in light of the text of § 2255, the legislative intent behind the passage of the AEDPA, and the constitutional considerations inherent in post-conviction review. This Note goes on to posit a new test for the application of the <b>savings</b> <b>clause</b> that more effectively navigates those competing interests...|$|R
40|$|A writ of {{habeas corpus}} is often the last resort—the final 2 ̆ 2 Hail Mary 2 ̆ 2 —for {{prisoner}}s seeking relief. Dubbed the 2 ̆ 2 Great Writ, 2 ̆ 2 a writ {{of habeas corpus}} is used to bring a prisoner before the court to determine {{the legality of the}} prisoner 2 ̆ 7 s incarceration or detention. This writ, utilized since our country 2 ̆ 7 s inception, is protected by the Constitution, and is available to all prisoners, both state and federal. Federal prisoners seeking habeas corpus relief must proceed under 28 U. S. C. § 2255. Section 2255 permits a federal prisoner to move to vacate or set aside his sentence upon the grounds that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States. Federal prisoners may bring an initial habeas corpus motion pursuant to Section 2255 as a matter of right. Thereafter, in order to be heard, any subsequent motion must either present a new rule of constitutional law previously unavailable to the prisoner or newly discovered evidence that would demonstrate innocence of the underlying crime. If these conditions are not satisfied, the prisoner is barred from filing a successive habeas corpus motion under 28 U. S. C. § 2255. There is, however, one well-known and often-relied-upon exception to this procedural bar. The <b>Savings</b> <b>Clause,</b> contained within Section 2255, allows a federal prisoner to file a traditional writ of habeas corpus when the remedy provided by Section 2255 is 2 ̆ 2 inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of the detention. 2 ̆ 2 This is largely a fact-specific inquiry, as the terms 2 ̆ 2 inadequate 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 ineffective 2 ̆ 2 have not been defined by Congress or interpreted by the Supreme Court. Because of this ambiguity, the application of the <b>Savings</b> <b>Clause</b> is frequently litigated, and the Circuit Courts of Appeal have developed different approaches for determining whether the Clause applies. In Webster v. Daniels, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit applied the <b>Savings</b> <b>Clause</b> to allow a federal prisoner, Daniel Webster, to present new evidence that would allegedly demonstrate categorical ineligibility for the death penalty. The Seventh Circuit cited two reasons in support of its decision. The first being that that a plain reading of Section 2255 justifies application of the <b>Savings</b> <b>Clause</b> in Mr. Webster 2 ̆ 7 s case. The Seventh Circuit also reasoned that Mr. Webster should have the benefit of arguing his ineligibility {{on the basis of a}} so-called 2 ̆ 2 new 2 ̆ 2 constitutional ruling. This Comment argues that these justifications fail to support the application of the <b>Savings</b> <b>Clause</b> in Mr. Webster 2 ̆ 7 s case. Indeed, the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Webster exceeds far beyond the limitations established by relevant Seventh Circuit <b>Savings</b> <b>Clause</b> jurisprudence. The Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Webster also fails to take into account the objective of 28 U. S. C. § 2255, which raises significant policy concerns...|$|R

40|$|In Bell v. Cheswick Generating Station, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit {{reversed}} {{a decision}} by the U. S.

The Third Circuit found that the <b>savings</b> <b>clause</b> of the CAA was nearly identical to that of the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), which had already been found to not preempt state common law tort actions by the U.

Further, it argues that the Supreme Court, with its history of allowing states to add to baseline federal safety legislation, would permit this action to stand.
