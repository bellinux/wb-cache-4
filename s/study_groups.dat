5|$|McCarthyism was {{supported}} by a variety of groups, including the American Legion and various other anti-communist organizations. One core element of support was a variety of militantly anti-communist women's groups such as the American Public Relations Forum and the Minute Women of the U.S.A.. These organized tens of thousands of housewives into <b>study</b> <b>groups,</b> letter-writing networks, and patriotic clubs that coordinated efforts to identify and eradicate what they saw as subversion.|$|E
5|$|From 1960, {{apparently}} {{in response to}} the book burning, the New York publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux began republishing his major works. Reichian physicians organized <b>study</b> <b>groups.</b> In 1967 one of his associates, Dr. Elsworth Baker, established the bi-annual Journal of Orgonomy, still published as of 2015, and in 1968 founded the American College of Orgonomy in Princeton, New Jersey. According to Sharaf, contributors to the Journal of Orgonomy who worked in academia often used pseudonyms. The Orgone Biophysical Research Laboratory was founded in 1978 by James DeMeo and the Institute for Orgonomic Science in 1982 by Morton Herskowitz.|$|E
5|$|Strom also {{resisted}} calling {{an early}} election {{to give his}} government a fresh mandate, despite Hamilton's impassioned advocacy for this course of action. He was no more positive towards Anderson's proposals for a radical overhaul of the party, including the computerization of political data (such as voting trends, demographic shifts, and polling results) and the purchase of an office building to make the party a profit and free it from the need for fundraising. The ideas that Strom did not reject outright were referred to committees and <b>study</b> <b>groups</b> where they were watered down or shelved.|$|E

Mr. Milsap offers Scully a room at the local boarding house, but Scully tries the rest of the town only to be ignored by everyone; they are all too engrossed in Bible <b>study</b> <b>groups.</b> Disturbed by the turn of events, she keeps her gun close at hand. The next morning, Mr. Milsap tells Scully that there is a man who needs help downstairs. She goes with him and finds the hitchhiker from the teaser having a seizure.

Meanwhile, Doggett calls the local sheriff and learns that Scully has not arrived yet, and so he sets out to find her.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{communities}} in Crawley {{that do not}} worship at a building used solely for religious purposes. The non-denominational Crawley Family Church uses Waterfield Primary School, which opened in 1985 in Bewbush. Also in Bewbush, an Elim Pentecostal congregation meets weekly at Bewbush Community Primary School; regular prayer meetings, <b>study</b> <b>groups</b> and other social activities take place elsewhere in the neighbourhood. The congregation was established in May 2005. This church {{is associated with the}} Elim church in Langley Green. The Crawley Gatwick Church of Christ, an independent, non-denominational congregation formed in 1996, meets at the community centre in Gossops Green. The Salvation Army established a barracks in 1902 in West Green, but the Crawley branch is now based in Ifield: worship takes place at the neighbourhood's community centre. The Kingdom Faith church, affiliated with a group of churches based in nearby Horsham, meets at Oriel High School in the Maidenbower neighbourhood and at Roffey Place, just over the borough boundary at Faygate. In 2006, a Pentecostalist community founded the Exodus Pentecostal Church, which worships at Tree House—Crawley's ancient manor house, now owned by the Borough Council. The weekly services cater especially for residents from Diego Garcia and Mauritius. Also in the town centre, the Potter's House Church uses the church hall of St John the Baptist's Church. It is part of the London Fellowship of Potter's House Christian Fellowship churches. The Solution Chapel International, a non-denominational church founded in January 2009 by Pastor Adama Segbedji with just 2 adults and 1 child has grown to become the largest non denominational, multi cultural church, is based at Northgate Community Centre. The Vine Christian Fellowship meets in a hotel in Southgate and holds joint services in the New Life and Green Fields Baptist churches. The Powerhouse Revival Centre meets for worship at the community centre on Ifield Drive in the Ifield neighbourhood.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinomas (OSCCs) are malignancies which develop predominantly from preexisting potentially malignant disorders. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) in saliva and serum {{is responsible for}} local immune response. The present study evaluates the role of serum and salivary IgA in OSCC and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). Materials and Methods: Ninety individuals were recruited into the <b>study</b> in three <b>groups</b> of thirty each. The participants were categorized as control <b>group,</b> <b>study</b> <b>Group</b> I consisting of OPMDs, and <b>study</b> <b>Group</b> II consisting of OSCC. Serum and salivary IgA was analyzed using nephelometry. Results: Serum IgA showed statistically significant increase between controls and <b>study</b> <b>Group</b> II and between <b>study</b> <b>Group</b> I and <b>study</b> <b>Group</b> II (P < 0. 05). Salivary IgA showed statistically significant difference between controls and <b>study</b> <b>Group</b> I and between controls and <b>study</b> <b>Group</b> II (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The results show increased serum IgA in OSCC group as compared to controls while salivary IgA increased in both OPMD and OSCC groups. Thus, the present study indicates a role for serum IgA in OSCC while salivary IgA has potential as a prognostic indicator in OPMDs and OSCCs...|$|R
