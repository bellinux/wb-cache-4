500|$|German naturalists Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Schneider {{described}} the bowmouth guitarfish in their 1801 Systema Ichthyologiae. Their account {{was based on}} a [...] long specimen, now lost, collected off the Coromandel Coast of India. The genus name Rhina comes from the Greek rhinos ("snout"); the specific epithet ancylostoma is derived from the Greek ankylos ("curved" [...] or [...] "crooked") and stoma ("mouth"). Although Block and Schneider wrote the epithet as ancylostomus and that form appears in some literature, most modern sources regard the correct form to be ancylostoma. Other common names for this species include <b>shark</b> <b>ray,</b> mud skate, shortnose mud skate, bow-mouthed angel fish, and bow-mouthed angel shark.|$|E
500|$|The bowmouth {{guitarfish}} (Rhina ancylostoma), {{also called}} the <b>shark</b> <b>ray</b> or mud skate, is a species of ray {{and a member of}} the family Rhinidae. Its evolutionary affinities are not fully resolved, though it may be related to true guitarfishes and skates. This rare species occurs widely in the tropical coastal waters of the western Indo-Pacific, at depths of up to [...] Highly distinctive in appearance, the bowmouth guitarfish has a wide and thick body with a rounded snout and large shark-like dorsal and tail fins. Its mouth forms a W-shaped undulating line, and there are multiple thorny ridges over its head and back. It has a dorsal color pattern of many white spots over a bluish gray to brown background, with a pair of prominent black markings over the pectoral fins. This large species can reach a length of [...] and weight of [...]|$|E

50|$|William Toby White is an Australian ichthyologist. He studies {{speciation}} {{and biodiversity}} of <b>shark,</b> <b>ray,</b> and skate species (subclass Elasmobranchii) through morphological and molecular systematics.|$|E
5000|$|White {{received}} bachelor's (1997) {{and doctoral}} (2003) degrees in Biological Science from Murdoch University in Perth, Australia. His doctoral thesis, [...] "Aspects of {{the biology of}} elasmobranchs in a subtropical embayment in Western Australia and of chondrichthyan fisheries in Indonesia", examined 1) spatial partitioning of food resources available to <b>shark,</b> <b>ray,</b> and skate species in Shark Bay (off the western coast of Australia), and 2) the relative frequencies of <b>shark,</b> <b>ray,</b> and skate species caught in fisheries {{off the coast of}} southeastern Indonesia.

40|$|Catches of <b>shark</b> and <b>ray</b> are {{considered}} important in Indonesian fisheries. Anecdotal {{evidence suggests that}} these fisheries may be over-exploited, but catches of <b>shark</b> and <b>ray</b> may be critical to their economic viability and the welfare of fishing communities dependent on them. Through {{a case study in}} Cilacap, Central Java, this paper assesses the potential economic and social impact on fishers and their households of restrictions on <b>shark</b> and <b>ray</b> catch. It reveals that <b>shark</b> and <b>ray</b> rep resent a minor component of this fishery's total catch, so the likely impact on the cash profitability of individual boats and the cash flow of fishing households would be minimal. However, inclusion of non-monetary costs in the analysis reveals that net returns to boat owners are negative. <b>Shark</b> and <b>ray</b> catch reductions will add further losses, and downstream activities such as processing of <b>shark</b> and <b>ray</b> products could imply an amplified aggregate impact. ...|$|R
