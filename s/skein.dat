5|$|Just {{before her}} death, Oliver had been shortlisted for the 2006 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award. In the year following, Oliver was amongst 60 artists {{profiled}} in Sonia Payes' book Untitled: Portraits of Australian Artists, while in 2008 her final works {{were included in}} the Adelaide Biennale of Australian Art. The secondary art market, meanwhile, was returning six-figure sums for her works at auction; in 2007 a record for Oliver's work was set when <b>Skein</b> (2004) went under the hammer for $192,000. By 2010, Sydney Biennale chairman Luca Belgiorno-Nettis was reported to have paid $300,000 for one of Oliver's sculptures, titled Tracery. In 2011, Sydney's College of Fine Arts announced that its new sculpture studio would be named after Oliver.|$|E
25|$|This process {{continues}} {{until the}} whole <b>skein</b> is wound. The time to <b>skein</b> yarn on a niddy-noddy {{depends on the}} yardage, and thus how many wraps need to be made. A larger niddy-noddy can speed up the skeining, but a very large one can be bulky, and thus slow down {{the time to do}} one wrap. At this point, the <b>skein</b> is secured by loose figure eight knots between each crossbar. This can be done with scrap yarn, or with slip knots {{from the end of the}} <b>skein.</b> In either case, loosely securing each end with a slip knot makes it easier to find the ends in the finished <b>skein.</b> Generally 4 or more knots are tied.|$|E
25|$|By {{counting}} {{the number of}} wraps for the <b>skein,</b> and measuring the length of one wrap, the approximate yardage can be calculated. The yardage is approximate because an exact yardage requires an even tension throughout wrapping the whole <b>skein.</b> Also, a very large <b>skein</b> requires wrapping the new layers on top of the old, which increases the length of the top layers.|$|E

2500|$|Yarn for hand-knitting {{is usually}} sold as balls or <b>skeins</b> (hanks), {{although}} {{it may also be}} wound on spools or cones. [...] <b>Skeins</b> and balls are generally sold with a yarn-band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge/tension, etc. [...] It is common practice to save the yarn band for future reference, especially if additional <b>skeins</b> must be purchased. [...] Knitters generally ensure that the yarn for a project comes from a single dye lot. [...] The dye lot specifies a group of <b>skeins</b> that were dyed together and thus have precisely the same color; <b>skeins</b> from different dye-lots, even if very similar in color, are usually slightly different and may produce a visible horizontal stripe when knitted together. [...] If a knitter buys insufficient yarn of a single dye lot to complete a project, additional <b>skeins</b> of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online. Otherwise, knitters can alternate <b>skeins</b> every few rows to help the dye lots blend together easier.|$|R

25|$|Manufactured niddy-noddies {{can be made}} of {{different}} sizes, producing skeins from 12 inches in length to 4 feet in length. The most common size, however, produces a two-yard <b>skein.</b> Very small niddy-noddies are generally used for small samples. Many spinners will spin a sample length of yarn, ply it, and <b>skein</b> it using a niddy-noddy before washing. Then the spinner can see if the yarn is as desired or not.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper adopts {{reactive}} disperse bright-red KR- 2 B to dye wool <b>skeins</b> in supercritical CO 2 dyeing equipment. The {{influencing factors}} are analyzed {{by measuring the}} surface depth of dyed wool <b>skeins,</b> including time, temperature and pressure, and the optimal dyeing parameters are as following: time 60 min, temperature 120 ℃, pressure 24 MPa. Then we adopt the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the infrared spectrum (FTIR) to observe the apparent shape and structure before dyeing and after dyeing. The {{results indicate that the}} global dye structure divide and the dyestuffs have good fixation on the wool <b>skeins...</b>|$|R
25|$|The second rule is what {{is often}} {{referred}} to as a <b>skein</b> relation. To check that these rules give an invariant of an oriented link, one should determine that the polynomial does not change under the three Reidemeister moves. Many important knot polynomials can be defined in this way.|$|E

25|$|Generally yarn is skeined {{directly}} after spinning or plying. This {{is because}} after spinning or plying the yarn generally gets washed, and a <b>skein</b> {{is the best}} form to have the yarn in for washing.

25|$|The closest tools {{similar to}} a niddy-noddy are the swift, and the spinner's weasel. Some swifts need to be {{attached}} to the table, and even folding swifts tend to be a bit inconvenient to fold and carry and thus are not as portable as a niddy-noddy, and while the swift has other uses (mainly being to hold skeins for balling), it is not as convenient as the niddy-noddy for creating a <b>skein,</b> nor does it allow one to calculate the yardage as easily. A spinner's weasel is also not portable, however it does measure the yardage, and is faster and easier to use.|$|E
25|$|Before the 15th century preaching had {{not become}} a regular {{institution}} in England, and pulpits were not so common. However, {{the value of the}} sermon began to be appreciated from the use to which the Lollards and other sects put this method of teaching doctrine, and pulpits became a necessity. A very beautiful one exists at Kenton, Devon. It is, as is generally the case, octagonal, and stands on a foot. Each angle is carved with an upright column of foliage between pinnacles, and the panels, which are painted with saints, are enriched with carved canopies and foliage; it is, however, much restored. The puipit at Trull, Somerset, is noted for its fine figure carving. A large figure standing under a canonv fills each of the nanelled sides. while many other smaller figures help to enrich the general effect. Examples of Gothic sounding boards are very rare; that, together with the pulpit, in the choir of Winchester is of the time of Prior Silkstede (1520), and is carved with his rebus, a <b>skein</b> of twisted silk.|$|E
