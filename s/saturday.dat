5|$|Because of {{regulations}} {{imposed by the}} Writers Guild of America, only those employed as writers for <b>Saturday</b> Night Live were allowed to write sketches for the program.

5|$|Bernie Brillstein, Henson's talent agent, {{helped him}} {{move away from}} working solely on {{productions}} for children.

Henson wanted Muppets incorporated into <b>Saturday</b> Night Live {{as a way to}} expunge the popular view his characters were only for young audiences. With help from Frank Oz, Henson generated The Land of Gorch characters for use on <b>Saturday</b> Night Live. His new characters were featured in the television program's first season. Henson designed the conceptual framework of The Land of Gorch characters to be eccentric.|$|E

5|$|Frank Oz said The Land of Gorch {{experiment}} had its positives and negatives. Oz said {{he thought}} the routine was not a good fit for <b>Saturday</b> Night Live, and that the cartoon-style humor of their characters did not work well with the comedy of <b>Saturday</b> Night Live, much of which was initially derived from the Second City environment. Oz said he generally enjoyed working on <b>Saturday</b> Night Live and witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E
