40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of large}} amplitude second mode internal solitary waves has been investigated. Waves were {{generated in the}} laboratory {{by a variety of}} methods and were observed using dye and particle visualisation techniques. Observations of wave generation, propagation and dissipation were used to develop new theories about the behaviour of such waves. Waves were generated by exchange flow, forced inflow and gravity collapse. The generation sequence was found to be similar for all three methods, with the gravity collapse technique allowing the most rapid and repeatable generation of second mode waves. External propagation characteristics (wave celerity and geometry) were investigated using waves of dimensionless amplitude up to a/h = 11. 6. It was found that wave geometry was described well by existing theory over the entire range of amplitudes, but the existing wave celerity relationships were only accurate up to a/h ≌ 3. A new analytical approach produced a relationship which is applicable to all large amplitude waves. Internal propagation characteristics (internal circulation, entrainment and mass transport) were investigated using both particle visualisation and laser induced fluorescence techniques. It was found that internal circulation differs from the pattern suggested by existing numerical models. The interior of the wave is made up of an assemblage of vortices, symmetrical about the wave centreline, with a net flow rearwards along the centreline. These vortices are seen {{to play an important role}} in the entrainment of fluid into the wave. Entrainment appears to be caused by a non-symmetric Holmboe instability at the wave boundary. The entrainment into and expulsion of fluid from the wave results in the flushing of fluid from the wave. Measurements indicate that the rate of flushing is linearly proportional to distance and Richardson number during the primary flushing phase (from 100 % to 10 % tracer concentration). During the <b>secondary</b> <b>flushing</b> phase (from 10 % to 1 % tracer concentration) the flushing rate is lower but also linearly proportional to distance and Richardson number. Wave dissipation experiments indicate that wave amplitude decay rate is constant for any wave but varies with densimetric factor. Waves with larger densimetric factors decay at a slower rate. An expression for wave energy was formulated and the wave energy decay rate was examined. It was found that the radiation of first mode waves does not provide a significant contribution to wave decay. Wall shear was quantified and found to vary with flume width. In this study it was responsible for approximately 9 % of the dissipation rate. The remaining dissipation is due to fluid drag (interfacial shear, pressure drag and mixing) and was quantified by a drag coefficient. The drag coefficient varies with the inverse of the cube root of densimetric factor...|$|E
40|$|Dead volume {{classified}} as bed head, bed tail, and bed line affects the purity and recovery in industrial-scale simulated-moving-bed (SMB) processes. Considering {{the three types}} of dead volume, the operation strategies for four, seven, and eight zones are presented for an industrial-scale para-xylene (PX) SMB process, and their performances are compared in terms of purity, recovery, and dilution. The dead volume is treated by a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy- (CFL-) number-insensitive method of characteristics (MOC). An extended node model integrating the dead volumes has been developed and solved by using the MOC. Seven-zone operation including line and <b>secondary</b> <b>flushes</b> enhances the purity, while keeping almost the same recovery as achieved with four-zone operation. The <b>secondary</b> <b>flush</b> introducing pure PX reduces the dilution of the extract.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} initial lung {{flushing}} with intracellular and extracellular fluid type solutions were studied in lungs stored with the University of Wisconsin solution. Excised Sprague-Dawley rat lungs (n = 39) were flushed first {{with one of}} the following solutions: (1) the University of Wisconsin solution (K+ = 140 mmol/L), (2) modified (low potassium) University of Wisconsin solution (K+ = 20 mmol/L), (3) phosphate buffered saline solution (K+ = 3. 9 mmol/L), (4) modified low-potassium phosphate-buffered saline solution (K+ = 20 mmol/L), (5) modified high-potassium phosphate-buffered saline solution (K+ = 40 mmol/L), and (6) Euro-Collins solution (K+ = 115 mmol/L) followed by <b>secondary</b> <b>flush</b> with storage solution and cold (4 ° C) storage in University of Wisconsin solution for 24 hours. The lungs were then reperfused in the isolated, pulsatile, blood-perfused working lung system for 2 hours or until lung failure. Blood gas analysis and shunt fraction, aerodynamic parameters (airway resistance, lung compliance, elastic work, and flow resistive work), and total pulmonary vascular resistance were measured throughout the perfusion period. The mean oxygen tensions (in millimeters of mercury) at 30 minutes after the onset of reperfusion for University of Wisconsin solution, modified University of Wisconsin solution, phosphate-buffered saline solution, modified phosphate-buffered saline solutions (20 and 40 mmol/L), and Euro-Collins solution were 56. 1 ± 4. 2, 72. 7 ± 9. 1, 87. 7 ± 6. 9 (p < 0. 01 versus University of Wisconsin solution; p < 0. 01 versus Euro-Collins solution), 86. 0 ± 9. 6 (p < 0. 01 versus University of Wisconsin solution; p < 0. 01 versus Euro-Collins solution), 87. 9 ± 7. 7 (p < 0. 01 versus University of Wisconsin solution; p < 0. 01 versus Euro-Collins solution), and 53. 5 ± 6. 0, respectively. All aerodynamic parameters in the lungs flushed with extracellular fluid type solutions were superior to those flushed with intracellular fluid type solutions. We conclude that the efficacy of initial flushing was essential for successful lung preservation and that extracellular fluid type solutions were superior to intracellular fluid type solutions, at least for flushing the lung before storage with University of Wisconsin solution. Potassium concentration in flushing solution should be 20 mmol/L or less to obtain appropriate flushing and subsequent adequate distribution of the storage solution.

40|$|Background: In various case series, pulse {{therapy has}} shown good results in {{pemphigus}} vulgaris (PV), with long-term remissions. Aims: To compare the efficacy and side-effects of dexamethasone-cyclophosphamide pulse and daily oral cyclophosphamide (DCP&#x 002 B;C) versus cyclophosphamide pulse and daily oral prednisolone (CP&#x 002 B;P) in PV. Methods: Twenty-eight active PV patients were randomized to receive either DCP with daily oral cyclophosphamide (Group A, n = 15) or CP with tapering doses of daily oral prednisolone (Group B, n = 13) for 12 months and followed-up {{for at least}} 3 months after stopping therapy. They were compared for time taken to achieve mucocutaneous disease control, achieve remission, relapse during treatment period, relapse after stopping therapy and side-effects. Results: Of 28 cases, 25 (Group A - 15, Group B - 10) completed the study period and were analyzed. The time for initiation of cutaneous response and time to achieve complete disease remission were significantly lesser in group B. However, other efficacy parameters were comparable. In Group A, significant adverse events were dysgusea, hiccups, palpitation, nail discoloration, bone pain and urinary tract infection while in Group B, they included nausea, moon facies, <b>flushing,</b> <b>secondary</b> amenorrhea, steroid withdrawal symptoms and dyspnea due to weight gain. Conclusions: Early remission was achieved in group B but the relapse rates during the treatment phase or after stopping therapy were comparable. Both therapies had comparable side-effect profiles, although Group B showed greater steroid-induced adverse events...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the relationship of anti-M?llerian hormone (AMH) to ova production in various breeds of cattle in an embryo transfer program. Factors evaluated included breed type, age, weight, body condition, and previous response to flush history. Cow superovulation regimen included insertion of a CIDR (Controlled Internal Drug Release) and a 2 cc injection (IM) of Combo (25 mg and 1. 25 mg/mL injectable) on Day 0. On Day 4, FSH treatments were initiated in both morning and afternoon with decreasing amounts over the next three days (five injections). Day 6, prostaglandin was also administered (IM) in both the AM and PM. On Day 7, AM final FSH injection and CIDR removal were performed. This resulted in estrus and AI on day 8 and collection of ova on day 15. Results were based on analysis of 369 animals; Angus (n = 25), Black Brangus (n = 43), Red Brangus (n = 53),, Brahman (n = 103), Beefmaster (n = 112), and Wagyu (n = 33). Age of donors ranged from 1. 6 years to 15. 4 years at collection with an average age of 7. 2. Age had a significant (P 0. 05). Total ova production was positively associated (P< 0. 05) with AMH concentration (the greater the AMH concentration, the greater number of ova per <b>flush).</b> <b>Secondary</b> studies evaluated the use of AMH as a predictor of conception rate following timed artificial insemination. and tracked the concentration both over 9 consecutive months in heifers and a superovulatory regimen in donors...|$|R
40|$|Serpentinized abyssal peridotites sampled by the Ocean Drilling Program Leg 209 {{along the}} mid-Atlantic Ridge near the 15 ° 20 'N Fracture Zone have been {{analyzed}} for oxygen, hydrogen, and chlorine isotope compositions {{in order to}} determine isotopic behavior under a wide range of serpentinization conditions and place constraints on fluid history. Oxygen and hydrogen thermometry suggests peak serpentinization temperatures of 300 - 500 °C. Serpentine separates have low deltaD values possibly due to a magmatic fluid component or low-temperature exchange during seafloor weathering. Chlorine geochemistry focused on three holes: 1274 A and 1272 A (serpentinized peridotites) and 1268 A (serpentinite locally altered to talc). Concentrations of both, water-soluble chloride (WSC) and structurally bound chloride (SBC) are significantly lower at Hole 1268 A compared to Holes 1274 A and 1272 A. The delta 37 Cl values for WSC and SBC of serpentinites in Holes 1274 A and 1272 A are slightly positive (avg. WSC = 0. 20 per mil, n = 22 and avg. SBC = 0. 35 per mil, n = 22), representing typical seawater-hydration conditions commonly determined for abyssal peridotite. The SBC of serpentinites from Hole 1268 A are also positive (avg. = 0. 63 per mil); whereas, the SBC in talc-dominated samples is negative (avg. = - 1. 22 per mil). The WSC of both talc- and serpentine-dominated samples are also negative (avg. = - 0. 15 per mil). We interpret the chlorine isotope data to preserve a record of multiple fluid events. As seawater hydrated the peridotite, 37 Cl was preferentially incorporated into the forming serpentine and water-soluble salts, yielding similar delta 37 Cl values on a regional scale as sampled by Holes 1268 A, 1274 A and 1272 A. The resultant pore fluid was left depleted in 37 Cl. Locally (Hole 1268 A), this evolved fluid was remobilized possibly due to the initiation of hydrothermal circulation in response to emplacement of a mafic magma body. The low delta 37 Cl pore fluids attained elevated SiO 2 and sulfur concentrations due to interaction with the gabbroic intrusion and, when ascending through the surrounding serpentinite, caused formation of isotopically negative talc. This <b>secondary</b> fluid also <b>flushed</b> the preserved serpentinite of its previously formed salts, resulting in negative delta 37 Cl WSC values. The delta 37 Cl SBC values of the serpentinite samples remained unmodified by reaction with the secondary fluid...|$|R
