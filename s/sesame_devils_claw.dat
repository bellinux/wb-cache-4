At doses 100 times or greater than the recommended daily dose for humans, <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> was completely ineffective in reducing edema of the rat hind foot induced by either lambda-carrageenan or Mycobacterium butyricum. At concentrations of up to 1 x 10 (5) microgram/ml, <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> was also ineffective as an in-vitro inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase. These results indicate that <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> lacks the anti-inflammatory properties possessed by all antiarthritic drugs of the nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory analgesic type...|$|R
40|$|<b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> (Harpagophytum procumbens) a plant {{native to}} Southern Africa, has {{historically}} been used in traditional medicine to treat {{a wide range of}} diseases and currently is widely employed as antiinflammatory and pain-relieving natural remedy in Europe {{and other parts of the}} world. Aim of the study: Little is known about possible herb-drug interactions arising from effects of <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> on the major drug metabolizing enzymes or transporters. This study evaluated in vitro the effects of <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> on the multidrug transporter ABCB 1 /P-glycoprotein. Materials and methods: The effects of three commercially available <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> preparations and that of pure harpagoside were studied in the human kidney (HK- 2) proximal tubule cell line, constitutively expressing ABCB 1 /P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Pgp activity and expression were tested by the calcein-AM test and by Western blotting, respectively. Results: Commercial preparations inhibited P-gp activity, even if to a different extent, while pure harpagoside was almost ineffective. In cells cultured for three days in the presence of <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> preparations or pure harpagoside, a dose-dependent P-gp upregulation was found. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate for the first time that <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> may interact with the multidrug transporter ABCB 1 /P-gp, the effect not appearing strictly related to the harpagoside relative content. Modulation of both P-gp activity and P-gp expression by <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> raise the possibility of herb-drug interactions, to be further explored in depth...|$|R
40|$|During our ongoing {{research}} (Nabhan et al. 1981; Bretting 1982; Nabhan and Rea n. d.) {{we found}} that <b>devil's</b> <b>claw</b> has a much wider ecogeographical distribution and is (or was) important to many more native groups throughout the Greater Southwest than is commonly known (Fig. 1).

Herbarium specimens, ethnohistorical, archaeological, and ethnological literature were first surveyed; these references were complemented and updated by recent extensive fieldwork (by Nabhan) at more than 30 different Indian reservations.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports on}} NIR-FT-Raman {{analysis}} of harpagoside in <b>devil’s</b> <b>claw</b> roots and related phytopharmaceutical products (ethanolic extracts, tablets). Raman mappings of root samples and tablets reveal {{spatial distribution of}} this valuable iridoid glycoside within samples. Spectral data and reference HPLC values of harpagoside demonstrate a possibility for developing a multivariate calibration based model of useful prediction ability. <b>Devil's</b> <b>claw</b> (Harpagophytum procumbens, Pedaliaceae), also known as "grapple plant " because of its claw-like dried seedpods, is a herb from the Kalahari desert region of south western Africa. The tubers from the plant {{have been used in}} traditional African medicine for a variety of disorders [1, 2]. Recent research in Europe has shown that it reduces inflammation and pain in rheumatic conditions and can stimulate appetite. <b>Devil's</b> <b>claw</b> contains iridoid glycosides, such as harpagoside, which are believed to have strong anti- inflammatory effects [3, 4]. Harpagoside is highly concentrated in the secondary roots of the plant. Usually ground <b>devil's</b> <b>claw</b> roots are processed into capsules, tablets, liquid extracts, and topical ointments, but teas (infusions) are also prepared from dried <b>devil's</b> <b>claw</b> root. Standard analytical methods like HPLC are time-consuming and need special preparation of the samples. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} develop a fast and non-destructive Rama...|$|R

40|$|Extracts of the {{secondary}} roots of the southern African plant, <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> (Harpagophytum procumbens) provide a herbal drug {{with a variety of}} traditional indications. One area of its use that has become very popular in recent years is in the treatment of inflammatory disorders of the musculoskeletal system and of low back pain. There have been several clinical studies recently published that generally support its use in treating osteoarthritis although more studies are required in order to establish this drug as a definite therapeutic option. Here in this review, the pharmacological properties of <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> are reviewed in detail and the clinical evidence is briefly summarised. There is good in vitro and in vivo pharmacological evidence of the anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties of this drug, although some negative findings have also been reported.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} musculoskeletal disorder. Conventional treatment (i. e., the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-NSAIDs) is associated with well-documented adverse effects. <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> (Harpagophytum procumbens) a traditional South African herbal remedy used for rheumatic conditions, may be a safer treatment option. To date, 14 clinical trials have assessed its efficacy/ effectiveness in OA. AIM: To address the two main questions of importance to clinicians: (1) Does <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> work {{for the treatment of}} OA, and (2) Is it safe? METHODS: A review of the literature on <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> and OA from 1966 to 2006 was performed using multiple search databases, monographs, and citation tracking. Relevant trials in all languages were identified and included. Both internal validity (i. e., adequacy of the dosage and period of treatment for this condition, reporting of randomization, rates of dropout, blinding, and statistical analysis) and external validity (i. e., inclusion/ exclusion criteria, baseline characteristics of the study populations, trial setting, and the appropriateness of the outcome measures of the trials) were assessed. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified: eight observational studies; 2 comparator trials (1 open, the other randomized to assess clinical effectiveness); and 4 double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials to assess efficacy. Many of the published trials lacked certain important methodological quality criteria. However, the data from the higher quality studies suggest that <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> appeared effective in the reduction of the main clinical symptom of pain. The assessment of safety is limited by the small populations generally evaluated in the clinical studies. From the current data, <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> appears to be associated with minor risk (relative to NSAIDs), but further long-term assessment is required. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological quality of the existing clinical trials is generally poor, and although they provide some support, there are a considerable number of methodologic caveats that make further clinical investigations warranted. The clinical evidence to date cannot provide a definitive answer to the two questions posed: (1) Does it work? And (2) is it safe? A definitive high-quality trial that addresses the necessary methodologic improvements noted is needed to answer these important clinical questions...|$|R
