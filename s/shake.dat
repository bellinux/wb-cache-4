5|$|The {{crowd in}} the stands, the {{opposing}} players and all four umpires gave Ripken a standing ovation lasting more than 22 minutes, {{one of the longest}} standing ovations for any athlete; ESPN did not go to a commercial break during the entire ovation.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the results of the study}} regarding the influence of <b>shaking</b> forces on olive tree harvesting systems. Shaking forces can be released through several methods. Important is the end result, namely the <b>shaking</b> force and the cadence of <b>shaking</b> speed. Mechanical and automatic harvesting methods collect more olives than traditional methods but may damage the olive trees. In order to prevent this damage, we need to calculate the necessary <b>shaking</b> force. An original research method is proposed to simulate <b>shaking</b> forces using a 3 D olive tree model with Autodesk Inventor software. In the experiments, we use different <b>shaking</b> forces and various <b>shaking</b> speeds. We also use different diameters of the olive tree trunk. We analyze the results from this experiment to determine the optimal <b>shaking</b> force for harvesting olives without damaging the olive tree...|$|R

5|$|After {{losing a}} bitter {{series against the}} rival Rangers in the opening round of the 2008 NHL playoffs, Brodeur refused to <b>shake</b> Sean Avery's hand.

The day after this game the NHL announced that it had revised its unsportsmanlike conduct rule, now known as The Sean Avery Rule, effectively outlawing such antics.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to <b>shake</b> the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E

The bowl catches the venom, but when the bowl becomes full Loki writhes in extreme pain, causing the earth to <b>shake</b> and resulting in what we know as an earthquake.|$|E

Evra stated that he would <b>shake</b> Suárez's hand before the game, having refused to in a previous game.|$|E

The floors of the Krabs' residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her blowhole.|$|E

Unable to get near the President during the presidential visit earlier, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to <b>shake</b> his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.|$|E

5|$|Forfeit: A {{player who}} cheats, or violates {{the rules of}} the game, or violates the rules {{specified}} for the particular tournament can be forfeited. In high-level tournaments, players have been forfeited for such things as arriving late for the game (even by a matter of seconds), receiving a call or text on a cell phone, refusing to undergo a drug test, refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices, and unsporting behavior (such as refusing to <b>shake</b> the opponent's hand).|$|E
5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in his opinion it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused to <b>shake</b> his hand in one infamous incident.

40|$|<b>Shaken</b> baby syndrome, or inflicted {{traumatic}} brain in-jury, {{is caused by}} the violent <b>shaking</b> of a child with orwithout contact between the child’s head and a hard surface. Such contact may result in head trauma, including subdural hematoma, diffuse axonal injury and retinal hemor-rhage. The annual estimated rate of inflicted {{traumatic brain}} injury is 30 cases per 100 000 children aged 1 year of younger. 1, 2 Because <b>shaken</b> baby syndrome is inflicted by a care giver and {{because of a lack of}} awareness about the dam-age caused by <b>shaking,</b> <b>shaken</b> baby syndrome may be pre-ventable. There are no randomized controlled trials of materi-als to prevent <b>shaken</b> baby syndrome. 3 Information provided to new parents at birth about the dangers of <b>shaking</b> their child may decrease the incidence of <b>shaken</b> baby syndrome. 4 Crying is a common stimulus for <b>shaking.</b> 3 – 9 The age-specific incidence curves for <b>shaken</b> baby syndrome have similar onsets, shapes and peak patterns as for crying in healthy infants. 5 – 7 Crying increases in the first month after birth, peaks in the second month, and decreases by the fourth month. 8 – 10 Prolonged, inconsolable and unpredictable episodes of crying that cluster in the evening occur only during the first few months after birth. These episodes are a source of frustra-tion and anger for parents. 11, 12 Policy statements recommend that anticipatory guidance about crying be given to parents to help prevent <b>shaken</b> baby syndrome. 13, 14 The Period of PURPLE Crying program materials 15 use the association between crying and <b>shaken</b> baby syndrome to edu-cate parents about the dangers of <b>shaking</b> and the importance of sharing this information with other caregivers. Because <b>shaken</b> baby syndrome can occur by week 2, 1, 5, 6 information should be given to parents before or soon after birth. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of pro-viding mothers with the Period of PURPLE Crying materials on their knowledge and behaviour related to the prevention of <b>shaken</b> baby syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to {{experimentally}} study how the vibrational acceleration spreads along the branch <b>shaken</b> by PVC tine, steel tine, and nylon tine for citrus canopy <b>shaking</b> harvesting and to compare the difference. PVC tine and steel tine have potential to be used as <b>shaking</b> rod for citrus canopy <b>shaking</b> harvesting. Nylon tine is a commonly used <b>shaking</b> rod. A tractor-mounted canopy shaker was developed to do the trial. The <b>shaking</b> frequency was set at 2. 5 and 5 [*]Hz. Experimental results showed that the vibrational acceleration at the <b>shaking</b> spot is not the highest. Spreading from <b>shaking</b> spot to the stem, it increases evidently. When spreading from stems of the outside subbranch to stems of the nearest inside subbranch, its average decrease percentage is 42 %. The overall vibrational acceleration of <b>shaking</b> at 5 [*]Hz is 1. 85 times as high as <b>shaking</b> at 2. 5 [*]Hz. The overall vibrational acceleration exerted by straight PVC tine and steel tine is 1. 77 and 1. 97 times as high as that exerted by straight nylon tine, respectively. It is indicated that replacing nylon tine with steel tine or PVC tine helps remove the fruits inside the canopy. Replacing with steel tine is more effective than with PVC tine...|$|R
