60|$|CULPEPPER, VA., Feb. '64.--Here I am FRONT {{pretty well}} {{down toward the}} extreme front. Three or four days ago General S., {{who is now in}} chief command, (I believe Meade is absent, sick,) moved a strong force southward from camp as if {{intending}} business. They went to the Rapidan; there has since been some manoeuvering and a little fighting, but nothing of consequence. The telegraphic accounts given Monday morning last, make entirely too much of it, I should say. What General <b>S.</b> <b>intended</b> we here know not, but we trust in that competent commander. We were somewhat excited, (but not so very much either,) on Sunday, during the day and night, as orders were sent out to pack up and harness, and be ready to evacuate, to fall back towards Washington. But I was very sleepy and went to bed. Some tremendous shouts arousing me during the night, I went forth and found it was from the men above mention'd, who were returning. I talk'd with some of the men; as usual I found them full of gayety, endurance, and many fine little outshows, the signs of the most excellent good manliness of the world. It was a curious sight to see those shadowy columns moving through the night. I stood unobserv'd in the darkness and watch'd them long. The mud was very deep. The men had their usual burdens, overcoats, knapsacks, guns and blankets. Along and along they filed by me, with often a laugh, a song, a cheerful word, but never once a murmur. It may have been odd, but I never before so realized the majesty and reality of the American people en masse. It fell upon me like a great awe. The strong ranks moved neither fast nor slow. They had march'd seven or eight miles already through the slipping unctuous mud. The brave First corps stopt here. The equally brave Third corps moved on to Brandy station. The famous Brooklyn 14th are here, guarding the town. You see their red legs actively moving everywhere. Then they have a theatre of their own here. They give musical performances, nearly everything done capitally. Of course the audience is a jam. It is good sport to attend one of these entertainments of the 14th. I like to look around at the soldiers, and the general collection in front of the curtain, more than the scene on the stage.|$|E

40|$|Requirements of rationality, {{like the}} following, have {{recently}} {{been the focus of}} much discussion: (1) Rationality requires of S that, if <b>S</b> <b>intends</b> that e and believes that e will not be so unless <b>S</b> <b>intends</b> that m, then <b>S</b> <b>intends</b> that m. (2) Rationality requires of S that S not both believe p and believe not-p. 1 How many requirements there are and how precisely to state them is a matter of controversy, but I will focus on a different kind of controversy, namely, how to conceive of such requirements in general. 2 I will start by sketching a picture of their general nature and role that I find compelling and attractive. My picture is not, however, consistent with many of the recent approaches to rational requirements in the literature. 3 As I will try to show, the arguments that are often made about rational requirements assume, mostly implicitly, that my picture is flawed. These arguments do not, however, or so I will claim, actually give us reason to reject my picture of rational requirements. Indeed, many of the puzzles about rational requirements taken up by others turn out not to really be puzzles once we realize that this alternative pictur...|$|R

40|$|Jorge Gracia’s paper “The Fundamental Character of Metaphysics” (2014) proposes five {{conditions}} that, if satisfied, {{would be}} sufficient to establish metaphysics as a fundamental discipline for other sciences: (1) universal extension, (2) ontological neutralism, (3) sui generis character, (4) overall disciplinary integration, and (5) necessity.

Gracia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intends</b> to be radically inclusive, yet unintentionally excludes certain views. His notion of fundamentality avoids reference to establishing normative principia, yet a key benefit of grounding is to provide such norms.

40|$|Generational accounting, {{initiated}} {{in the early}} 90 ?<b>s,</b> <b>intends</b> to take the government long term financial liabilities into account. Indeed, these {{are not included in}} the standard measure of the budget deficit. Our calculations, using this technique, indicate that French generational policy is imbalanced against future generations. Current policies in France can not be sustained without requiring future generations to pay higher net taxes over their lifetime than current generations pay. If this generational imbalance, mainly resulting from demographic evolutions, is not contested, its precise size would depend on a great number of assumptions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to highlight the impact of these assumptions, by comparing the different French studies using generational accounting. We show that the generational imbalance may vary from 1 to 4, according to the assumptions relative to the age and sex profiles of taxes and transfers, the treatment of the debt interest payment, the distribution of education expenditures, the treatment of governments?s investment spendings, the measure of the net wealth of the government, and the evolution of age and sex profiles of taxes and transfers.

Layers {{are made up of}} asynchronous modules that communicate over low-bandwidth channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly simple computational machine. Higher-level layers can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system has been used to control a mobile robot wandering around unconstrained laboratory areas and computer machine rooms. Eventually it i <b>s</b> <b>intended</b> to control a robot that wanders the office areas of our laboratory, building maps of its surroundings using an onboard arm to perform simple tasks. I...|$|E

This paper seeks to demonstrate the conjunctive insufficiency of the foregoing conditions due to the inadequacy of the sincerity condition to guarantee predicated acts being fulfillable. Being the definitive condition which contains the psychological state distinct in promises as illocutionary acts, that is the expression of intention (<b>S</b> <b>intends</b> to A), I purport that not all sincere promises are non-defective.

As a response to this insufficiency, I shall propose a condition, as {{part and parcel of the}} Propositional Content Clause, that makes up Searle’s felicity conditions for promises, which requires explicitness of the form: “A is fulfillable if A is explicit in form”. A is explicit if and only if 1) A is literal in form, where A can have either 1 basic or multiple meanings, and 2) The meaning of A, whether basic or multiple, with respect to its context is directly stated in the sentence uttered.

The problem of perfectly reliable message transmission (PRMT), requires only correctness of the message received by R. However, unlike most of the literature on the problem, we assume the adversary modeling the faults is mixed (and can corrupt different set of nodes in Byzantine, failstop and passive fashion simultaneously) and thus versatile enough to disrupt the information flow in the network in variety of ways. The mixed adversary can be either static or mobile. The communication complexity of multiphase interactive PRMT and PSMT protocols is one of their most important complexity measure.
