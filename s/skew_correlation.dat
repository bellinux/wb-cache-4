40|$|Abstract Background Bird genomes {{have very}} {{different}} compositional structure compared with other warm-blooded animals. The variation in the base skew rules in the vertebrate genomes remains puzzling, but it must relate somehow to large-scale genome evolution. Current research is inclined to relate base skew with mutations and their fixation. Here we wish to explore base skew correlations in bird genomes, to develop methods for displaying and quantifying such correlations at different scales, and to discuss possible explanations for the peculiarities of the bird genomes in <b>skew</b> <b>correlation.</b> Results We have developed a method called Base Skew Double Triangle (BSDT) for exhibiting the genome-scale change of AT/CG skew as a two-dimensional square picture, showing base skews at many scales simultaneously in a single image. By this method we found that most chicken chromosomes have high AT/CG <b>skew</b> <b>correlation</b> (symmetry in 2 D picture), except for some microchromosomes. No other organisms studied (18 species) show such high skew correlations. This visualized high correlation was validated by three kinds of quantitative calculations with overlapping and non-overlapping windows, all indicating that chicken and birds in general have a special genome structure. Similar features were also found {{in some of the}} mammal genomes, but clearly much weaker than in chickens. We presume that the <b>skew</b> <b>correlation</b> feature evolved near the time that birds separated from other vertebrate lineages. When we eliminated the repeat sequences from the genomes, the AT and CG skews correlation increased for some mammal genomes, but were still clearly lower than in chickens. Conclusion Our results suggest that BSDT is an expressive visualization method for AT and CG skew and enabled the discovery of the very high <b>skew</b> <b>correlation</b> in bird genomes; this peculiarity is worth further study. Computational analysis indicated that this correlation might be a compositional characteristic, present not only in chickens, but also remained or developed in some mammals during evolution. Special aspects of bird metabolism related to e. g. flight may be the reason why birds evolved or retained the <b>skew</b> <b>correlation.</b> Our analysis also indicated that repetitive DNA sequence elements need {{to be taken into account}} in studying the evolution of the correlation between AT and CG skews. </p...|$|E

40|$|The multivariate {{lognormal}} {{model is}} a basic pricing model for derivatives with multiple underlying processes, for example, spread options. However, the market observation of implied <b>correlation</b> <b>skew</b> examplifies how inaccurate the constant correlation assumption in the multivariate lognormal model can be. In this paper, we study alternative modeling approaches that generate implied <b>correlation</b> <b>skews</b> {{while at the same}} time maintain practical tractability. First, we propose a multiscale stochastic volatility model, and derive asymptotic formulas for option valuation and implied correlation. The {{model is a}} two-dimensional extension of the multiscale stochastic volatility model proposed in [20] which was tested on single underlying options. To obtain option valuations, we only need to calibrate a set of special parameters, and we propose a calibration procedure using option prices on individual underlying assets. From our simulated results, the multiscale stochastic volatility model generates implied <b>correlation</b> <b>skews,</b> and the asymptotic formulas are easy and fast to implement. However, in the multiscale stochastic volatility model, the stochastic volatilities introduce non-tradable sources of risk, and the market is no longer complete. Alternatively, we propose a local correlation model, which assumes the instantaneous correlation to be a deterministic function of time and the underlying prices. This model can be viewed as a two-dimensional extension of Dupire’s local volatility model. The local correlation approach preserves the completeness of the market and low dimensionality of uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{existing}} pricing models of variance derivative products assume continuous sampling of the realized variance processes, though actual contractual specifications compute the realized variance based on sampling at discrete times. We present a general analytic approach for pricing discretely sampled generalized variance swaps under the stochastic volatility models with simultaneous jumps in the asset price and variance processes. The resulting pricing formula of the gamma swap is in closed form while those of the corridor variance swaps and conditional variance swaps {{take the form of}} onedimensional Fourier integrals. We also verify through analytic calculations the convergence of the asymptotic limit of the pricing formulas of the discretely sampled generalized variance swaps under vanishing sampling interval to the analytic pricing formulas of the continuously sampled counterparts. The proposed methodology can be applied to any affine model and other higher moments swaps as well. We examine the exposure to convexity (volatility of variance) and <b>skew</b> (<b>correlation</b> between the equity returns and variance process) of these discretely sampled generalized variance swaps. We explore the impact on the fair strike prices of these exotic variance swaps with respect to different sets of parameter values, like varying sampling frequencies, jump intensity, and width of the monitoring corridor.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address a {{fundamental}} problem of the standard one factor Gaussian Copula model. Within this standard framework a default event will have a large impact on the default probability of the survivors, through a shock in available information on the common factor. Moreover this effect is larger for defaults occurring instantaneously. In this paper it is shown that this problem is caused by linearly combining the common factor and idiosyncratic terms. In this paper we propose an extended model, which overcomes this problem. An extra idiosyncratic term is introduced which models totally external default risk. Here one should think of default events due to fraud, or legal issues. The most noticeable default events {{over the last couple of}} years have been Enron, Worldcom and Parmalat. All of these defaulted due to totally external causes. The occurrence of such default events do not increase the available information on the common factor driving correlated defaults. In addition it is shown that this extended model provides a plausible explanation for the observed compound correlation smile, or equivalently, the base <b>correlation</b> <b>skew.</b> Moreover, this model requires two additional parameters with which one can control the shape of the so-called base <b>correlation</b> <b>skew.</b> JEL Classification: G 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, a {{considerable}} {{growth has been}} added to the volume of the credit risk derivatives market. This growth has been followed by the current financial market turbulence. These two periods have outlined how significant and important are the credit derivatives market and its products. Modelling-wise, this growth has parallelised by more complicated and assembled credit derivatives products such as mth to default Credit Default Swaps (CDS), m out of n (CDS) and collateralised debt obligation (CDO). In this thesis, the Lévy process has been proposed to generalise and overcome the Credit Risk derivatives standard pricing model's limitations, i. e. Gaussian Factor Copula Model. One of the most important drawbacks is that it has a lack of tail dependence or, in other words, it needs more <b>skewed</b> <b>correlation.</b> However, by the Lévy Factor Copula Model, the microscopic approach of exploring this factor copula models has been developed and standardised to incorporate an endless number of distribution alternatives those admits the Lévy process. Since the Lévy process could include a variety of processes structural assumptions from pure jumps to continuous stochastic, then those distributions who admit this process could represent asymmetry and fat tails as they could characterise symmetry and normal tails. As a consequence they could capture both high and low events' probabilities. Subsequently, other techniques those could enhance the skewness of its correlation and be incorporated within the Lévy Factor Copula Model has been proposed, i. e. the 'Stochastic Correlated Lévy Factor Copula Model' and 'Lévy Random Factor Loading Copula Model'. Then the Lévy process has been applied through a number of proposed Pricing Basket CDS&CDO by Lévy Factor Copula and its skewed versions and evaluated by V-FFT limiting and mixture cases of the Lévy Skew Alpha-Stable distribution and Generalized Hyperbolic distribution. Numerically, the characteristic functions of the mth to default CDS's and (n/m) th to default CDS's number of defaults, the CDO's cumulative loss, and loss given default are evaluated by semi-explicit techniques, i. e. via the DFT's Fast form (FFT) and the proposed Very Fast form (VFFT). This technique through its fast and very fast forms reduce the computational complexity from O(N 2) to, respectively, O(N log 2 N) and O(N).

40|$|Abstract. The multifactor {{version of}} copula models {{has the ability}} to {{generate}} complex correlation structure among defaults that is useful in fitting the base <b>correlation</b> <b>skew.</b> However, multifactor models have often been dismissed for their intractability. Even the semianalytical approach using Laplace trans-forms is computationally challenging, because although the model is tractable upon conditioning on the factors, unconditioning usually requires high efforts of integrating out the factors. To circum-vent this problem, this paper develops a fast, closed-form approximation to the Laplace transform in multifactor models. The method, which approximates the conditional transform in a way that lends itself to closed-form unconditioning in arbitrarily high dimensions, is applicable to a range of models with Gaussian factors, including models that extend the standard Gaussian copula to allow stochastic recovery rates and factor loadings. We analyze the accuracy and convergence properties of the approximation. Numerical examples illustrate the speed and accuracy of the method. Key words.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{design a}} frailty index (FI) and {{evaluate}} three methods to handle missing data. Furthermore, we evaluated its construct (i. e., <b>skewed</b> distribution, <b>correlation</b> {{with age and}} sub-maximum score) and criterion validity (based on mortality risk). STUDY DESIGN: We included 11, 539 participants (45 +/- years) from a population-based cohort in the Netherlands. Frailty was measured with a FI, which we constructed based on the accumulation of 45 health-related variables, related to mood, cognition, functional status, diseases and conditions, biomarkers, and nutritional status. A total FI-score was calculated by averaging the scores of the deficits, resulting in a score between 0 and 1, with higher scores indicating increasing frailty. Mean imputation, single- and multiple imputation were applied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mortality data were obtained by notification from the municipal administration. Median follow-up time was 9. 5 years, during which 3902 (34 %) participants died. RESULTS: The median FI for the full population was 0. 16 (IQR= 0. 11 - 0. 23). The distribution of the FI was slightly right-skewed, the absolute maximum score was 0. 78 {{and there was a}} strong correlation with age (Pearson correlation= 0. 52; 95 %CI= 0. 51 - 0. 54). The adjusted HR per unit increase in FI-score on mortality was 1. 05 (95 %CI= 1. 05 - 1. 06). Multiple imputation seemed to provide more robust results than mean imputation. CONCLUSION: Based on our results we advise to the use of at least 30 deficits from different health domains to construct a FI if data are not imputed. Future research should use the continuous nature of the FI to monitor trajectories in frailty and find preventive strategies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{expresses the}} price of a spread option as the sum of the prices of two {{compound}} options. One compound option is to exchange vanilla call options on the two underlying assets and the other is to exchange the corresponding put options.

Our approach has many advantages over existing analytic approximations, which have limited validity and an indeterminacy that renders them of little practical use. The compound exchange option approximation for European spread options is then extended to American spread options on assets that pay dividends or incur carry costs. Simulations quantify the accuracy of our approach; we also present an empirical application, to the American crack spread options that are traded on NYMEX. For illustration, we compare our results with those obtained using the approximation attributed to Kirk (1996) which is commonly used by traders.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two {{new models}} of portfolio default loss that extend the standard Gaussian copula model yet preserve tractability and computational efficiency. In one extension, we randomize recovery rates, explicitly {{allowing for the}} empirically well-established effect of inverse correlation between recovery rates and default frequencies. In another extension, we build into the model random systematic factor loadings, effectively allowing default correlations to be higher in bear markets than in bull markets. In both extensions, special cases of the models are shown to be as tractable as the Gaussian copula model and to allow efficient calibration to market credit spreads. We demonstrate that the models – even in their simplest versions – can generate highly significant pricing effects such as fat tails and a correlation “skew ” in synthetic CDO tranche prices. When properly calibrated, the skew effect of random recovery is quite minor, but the extension with random factor loadings can produce <b>correlation</b> <b>skews</b> similar to the steep skews observed in the market. We briefly discuss two alternative skew models, one based on the Marshall-Olkin copula, the other on a spread-dependent correlation specification for the Gaussian copula...|$|R
40|$|We {{begin with}} the classic result of Dupire which shows that any {{diffusion}} model with stochastic volatility {{can be reduced to}} a local volatility model without changing the prices of European options. Specifically, the value of the effective local volatility at state S and time T is equal to the expectation of the stochastic volatility conditional on achieving state S at time T. This leads to a technique of model calibration in which the original model without a low-dimensional Markovian representation is approximated by a low-dimensional Markovian model. We cite the results for the projection on an effective displaced diffusion and Heston models. We then set the goal of extending the technique from diffusions to jump processes used for dynamic modeling of credit basket loss. We identify the one-step Markov chain as the counterpart of the local volatility model and prove the version of the Dupire result applicable to jump processes. We conclude by observing that the local intensity of the effective Markov chain bears a distinctive signature of credit <b>correlation</b> <b>skew,</b> which can be used to predict success or failure of certain models in matching the market of CDO tranches. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} a multi-asset model based on Wishart processes {{that accounts for}} stochastic volatility and for stochastic correlations between the assets returns, {{as well as between}} their volatilities. The model accounts for the existence of correlation term structure and allows for a positive link between the assets returns correlation and their volatility that is consistent with the empirical evidence. In this sense, the model is able to account for the existence of <b>correlation</b> <b>skew.</b> Another advantage of the model is its analytical tractability: it is possible to derive semi-closed form solutions for European options on each underlying asset, {{as well as for the}} price of multi-asset exotic options such as the outperformance option. The article shows that the price of this option depends crucially on the term structure of the correlation corresponding to the assets returns. To motivate the introduction of the model, I compare the prices obtained under this model and under other models with constant correlations commonly used by financial institutions. The empirical results show that the consideration of stochastic correlation is a key element for the correct valuation of multi-asset exotic options...|$|R
40|$|A {{large family}} (MRX 48) with a nonspecific X-linked mental {{retardation}} condition is described. An X-linked semidominant inheritance {{is suggested by}} the segregation in three generations of a moderate to severe mental retardation in seven males and by a milder intellectual impairment in two females, without any specific clinical, radiological, or biological feature. Two-point linkage analysis demonstrated significant linkage between the disorder and several markers in Xq 28 (maximum LOD score [Zmax] = 2. 71 at recombination fraction [theta] = 0); multipoint linkage analyses confirmed the significant linkage with a Zmax of 3. 3 at theta = 0, at DXS 1684. A recombination event observed with the flanking marker DXS 8011 delineates a locus between this marker and the telomere. The approximate length of this locus is 8 - 9 cM, corresponding to 5. 5 - 6 Mb. In an attempt to explain the variable intellectual impairment in females, we examined X-chromosome inactivation in all females of the family.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to price CDOˆ 2 -type transactions consistently with the pricing of the underlying CDOs. We first present an extension to the current market standard model using a Gaussian mixture (GM) copula model instead of one parameter single Gaussian Copula model. It shows that GM broadly captures the <b>correlation</b> <b>skew</b> shown in the index tranche market, but not exactly and across time or across term structure. Then using an analogy to the option pricing for CDO tranche pricing we extract an implied loss distribution from the observed index tranche market or a set of bespoke pricing of the underlying baby portfolios. To strike a balance of matching the underlying baby CDO pricing and having a plausible economic correlation model to price CDOˆ 2 -type trades we create a loss distribution transformation for each baby CDO portfolio between the implied loss distribution from the index tranche market or bespoke pricing and the loss distribution from the GM model.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an extension of}} the popular Large Homogeneous Portfolio (LHP) approach to the pricing of CDOs. LHP (which has already become a standard model in practice) assumes a flat default correlation structure over the reference credit portfolio and models defaults using a one factor Gaussian copula. However, this model fails to fit the prices of different CDO tranches simultaneously which leads to the well known implied <b>correlation</b> <b>skew.</b> Many researchers explain this phenomenon with the lack of tail dependence in the Gaussian copula and propose to use a Student t-distribution. Incorporating the effect of tail dependence into the one factor portfolio credit model yields significant pricing improvement. However, the computation time increases dramatically as the Student t-distribution is not stable under convolution. This makes it impossible to use the model for computationally intensive applications such as the determination of the optimal asset allocation in an investor’s portfolio over different asset classes including CDOs. We present a modification of the LHP model replacing the Student t-distribution with the Normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution. We compare the properties of our new model with those of the Gaussian and the double t-copulas. The employment of the NIG distribution not only speeds u...|$|R

The horses were then allowed free choice access to early-growth annual ryegrass pasture, salt and water for a 28 day period. Random hay and grass samples were analyzed for nutrient content. Blood samples were collected at 6 am, 8 am, 6 pm, and 8 pm {{on the final day}} of hay consumption and on the 4 th, 9 th and 28 th days of grass consumption. Samples were subsequently analyzed to determine the effects of diet type on circulating blood glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations. Body weights and body condition scores were monitored on the first and last day of blood collection. Ryegrass pasture consumption by horses in this trial resulted in body weight gains, increased body condition scores, and elevated insulin secretions. While blood glucose levels varied depending on day of sampling, there was no effect of diet type and blood glucose concentrations. Sex of test subject did not affect any of the parameters measured.

40|$|GRB {{satellites}} {{are relatively}} inefficient detectors of dim hard bursts because they trigger on photon counts, which are number-biased against hard photons. Therefore, for example, given two bursts of identical peak luminosity near the detection threshold, a dim soft burst will be preferentially detected over a dim hard burst. This detector bias can create or <b>skew</b> an apparent <b>correlation</b> where increasingly hard GRBs appear increasingly bright. Although such correlations may be obfuscated by a middle step where GRBs {{need to be}} bright enough to have their actual redshifts determined, {{it is found that}} the bias is generally pervasive. This result is derived here through simulations convolving a wide variety of possible GRB brightnesses and spectra with the BATSE Large Area Detectors (LAD) detection thresholds. The presented analyses indicate that the rest-frame ν F_ν spectrum peak energy of long-duration GRBs,, is not a good cosmological standard candle without significant corrections for selection effects. Therefore, the appearance of in seeming correlations such as the Amati (E_iso-), Ghirlanda (E_γ-), and L_iso- relations is statistically real but strongly influenced by so far uncalibrated GRB detector thresholds.

40|$|The {{immune system}} is tightly {{intertwined}} with tumor development, i. e. tumor immune surveillance, and can be manipulated to induce anti-tumor responses by targeting tumor immune escape pathways. Recently, {{it has become clear}} that several different escape mechanisms need to be targeted simultaneously for robust effects. This dissertation will outline the various intricacies of tumor immune surveillance and tumor immune therapies, offering new perspectives, therapies, and questions that need addressing. In this body of work, murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) was used as an anti-tumor therapy and to model virus-specific tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). ^ MCMV is a promising tumor vaccine vector as it induces accumulation of massive numbers of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells (i. e. memory inflation), which enter most tissues and remain functional. To explore this, MCMV expressing a modified gp 100 melanoma antigen was used. Systemic vaccination was able to induce gp 100 -specific memory inflation, but minimal therapeutic effect. However, intratumoral delivery of MCMV significantly delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival in a CD 8 + T cell-dependent, gp 100 -independent manner. Despite MCMV infecting and killing B 16 F 0 s in vitro, infection was restricted to tumor- associated macrophages in vivo, suggesting it was not inducing direct oncolysis. Importantly, the therapy synergized with anti-PD-L 1 therapy, resulting in tumor clearance and protection in over half of the treated mice. These data demonstrate that multiple immune escape mechanisms must be targeted in order to induce tumor clearance. ^ CD 8 + TIL are correlated with positive prognosis in cancer patients. Broad phenotypic markers are used to determine TIL correlations, mostly assuming that TIL are tumor-specific. It is unknown if CD 8 + T cells without tumor specificity can become TIL at steady state or in response to pathogens. To address this, tumor- specific and virus-specific CD 8 + TIL were compared using MCMV-gp 100 and vaccinia virus. Virus-specific CD 8 + T cells migrated to tumors and became TIL in a CXCR 3 -dependent manner and independent of antigen during acute, cleared or latent infections. Surprisingly, virus-specific CD 8 + TIL were fully functional compared to tumor-specific TIL, independent of antigen-dependent PD- 1 expression. These results suggest that CD 8 + TIL can reflect an individual’s immune status and may not always be tumor-specific, potentially <b>skewing</b> prognostic <b>correlations.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Which {{statistical}} {{features of}} spiking activity matter for how stimuli are encoded in neural populations? A vast {{body of work}} has explored how firing rates in individual cells and correlations in the spikes of cell pairs impact coding. Recent experiments have shown evidence {{for the existence of}} higher-order spiking correlations, which describe simultaneous firing in triplets and larger ensembles of cells; however, little is known about their impact on encoded stimulus information. Here, we take a first step toward closing this gap. We vary triplet correlations in small (approximately 10 cell) neural populations while keeping single cell and pairwise statistics fixed at typically reported values. This connection with empirically observed lower-order statistics important, as it places strong constraints on the level of triplet correlations that can occur. For each value of triplet correlations, we estimate the performance of the neural population on a two-stimulus discrimination task. We find that the allowed changes in the level of triplet correlations can significantly enhance coding, in particular if triplet correlations differ for the two stimuli. In this scenario, triplet correlations must be included in order to accurately quantify the functionality of neural populations. When both stimuli elicit similar triplet correlations, however, pairwise models provide relatively accurate descriptions of coding accuracy. We explain our findings geometrically via the <b>skew</b> that triplet <b>correlations</b> induce in population-wide distributions of neural responses. Finally, we calculate how many samples are necessary to accurately measure spiking correlations of this type, providing an estimate of the necessary recording times in future experiments...|$|R

Regional growth in 227 regions of 6 countries in central Europe (see Figure 1. 0) is explored as how they depend on the young and old dependency ratio. The young dependency ratio (YDR) is defined as ratio of the less than 20 years old and the old dependency ratio (ODR) as the more than 60 years old divided by the total population. We found {{that there is a}} medium sized negative correlation of these demographic dependency ratios on regional growth and the long-term forecast for the year 2020 is for most regions rather bleak. The distribution of the YDR is right skewed and the distribution of the ODR is left <b>skewed</b> and the <b>correlation</b> coefficient is negative:- 0. 82. While the negative dependence of growth on ODR is significant in both models, the coefficient on YDR is not significant. Furthermore it changes sign when we go from the aggregate model to the disaggregated fixed effect model. This behavior is consistent with a phenomenon that is called Simpson paradox. A main result is: A 10 %-point positive difference in the DR will decrease GDP growth by about 1 %-point for YDR and by- 1. 8 %-points for ODR. If there were no old or young people in the population we see from the fixed effects that average growth could lie between 6. 5 % per annum (in the Czech R.) and 9. 9 % (in Slovakia).
