The more complete characters profiles in the novel clearly showed the <b>strong</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> Bond and Leiter.

5|$|From {{the overall}} stock of an {{estimated}} 458 million workers, 394million (86%) operate in the unorganised sector (of which 63% are self-employed) mostly as informal workers. There is a <b>strong</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the quality of employment and social and poverty characteristics. The relative growth of informal employment was more rapid within the organised rather than the unorganised sector. This informalisation is also related to the flexibilisation of employment in the organised sector that {{is suggested by the}} increasing use of contract labour by employers in order to benefit from more flexible labour practices.|$|E
5|$|Special {{investigations}} may be {{indicated to}} rule out other causes of oral ulceration. These include blood tests to exclude anemia, deficiencies of iron, folate or vitamin B12 or celiac disease. However, the nutritional deficiencies may be latent and the peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal. Some suggest that screening for celiac disease should form part of the routine work up for individuals complaining of recurrent oral ulceration. Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral ulceration, which {{is in contrast to}} aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral ulceration. Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a <b>strong</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> certain foods and episodes of ulceration). Several drugs can cause oral ulceration (e.g. nicorandil), and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a causal relationship.|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} {{to the present}} study; some limitations are statistical in nature. One such limitation is the observed ceiling effect of the SPWB subscales. If greater variability in response options had been allowed (e.g., 10 response options rather than 6), <b>stronger</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> SPWB subscale scores and SAT component scores may have been observed. Responses that might otherwise have exceeded these ranges are attenuated, reducing the overall variance in the scores and thus systematically reducing the covariance between these variables. Although extrapolating below this point could lead to incorrect conclusions about the data pattern, visual analysis showed more maximum scores {{in the middle of}} SAT component score ranges. This suggests that if greater response variability were allowed, <b>stronger</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> SPWB subscales and SAT component scores may have been discovered.|$|R

Yet {{it is important to}} realize, as Peterman and Bradford did, that all this evidence does not affirm a certain relationship between larval survival and severe weather; this is particularly true given the lack of data regarding larval survival in the absence of storm events for context and comparison. Furthermore, Peterman and Bradford (1987) did not find a <b>strong</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the larval survival rates documented adjacent to wind/storm events and recruitment levels observed months afterward.|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{studies of}} cross-national {{differences}} in consumer behavior in different consumption sectors have verified that cultural differences {{have a strong}} influence on consumers. Despite the importance of cross-national analysis, no studies in the literature examine the moderating effects of nationality {{on the construction of}} behavioral intentions and their antecedents among cruise line passengers. This study investigates the moderating effects of nationality on the <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> perceived value, satisfaction, trust and behavioral intentions among Spanish and (U. S.) American passengers of cruise lines that use Barcelona as home port and port-of-call. A theoretical model was tested with a total of 968 surveys. Structural equation models (SEMs) were used, by means of a multigroup analysis. Results of this study indicated that Spaniards showed <b>stronger</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> trust and behavioral intentions, and between emotional value and satisfaction.

25|$|Omar Khayyám (c. 1050 – 1123) {{wrote a book}} on Algebra {{that went}} beyond Al-Jabr to include {{equations}} of the third degree. Omar Khayyám provided both arithmetic and geometric solutions for quadratic equations, but he only gave geometric solutions for general cubic equations since he mistakenly believed that arithmetic solutions were impossible. His method of solving cubic equations by using intersecting conics had been used by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), but Omar Khayyám generalized the method to cover all cubic equations with positive roots. He only considered positive roots {{and he did not}} go past the third degree. He also saw a <b>strong</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> Geometry and Algebra.|$|E
25|$|Lt. General Vernon A. Walters, a {{military}} attaché of Dwight Eisenhower and later military attaché in France from 1967–1973, noted the <b>strong</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> de Gaulle and Eisenhower, de Gaulle's unconditional support of Eisenhower during the U-2 incident, and de Gaulle's strong support of John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Thus Walters was intensely {{curious as to}} the great contrast between de Gaulle's close relations with two United States presidents during notable Cold War crises and de Gaulle's later decision to withdraw France from NATO's military command, and Walters spoke with many close military and political aides of de Gaulle. Walters' conclusion, based upon de Gaulle's comments to many of his aides (and to Eisenhower during a meeting at Ramboullet Castle in 1959), is that de Gaulle feared that later United States presidents after Eisenhower would not have Eisenhower's special ties to Europe and would not risk nuclear war over Europe. Also, de Gaulle interpreted the peaceful resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis without fighting to take back Cuba from communism a mere 90 miles from the United States as {{an indication that the}} United States might not fight for Europe's defense 3,500 miles away following Soviet aggression in Europe, but would only go to war following a nuclear strike against the United States itself. De Gaulle told Eisenhower that France did not seek to compete with the Strategic Air Command or army of the United States, but believed that France needed a way to strike the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|A general {{consensus}} is that privity is distinct from consideration. As well as Haldane's judgment in Dunlop, the courts have stated a similar principle in other cases such as Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd [...] AC 446 and Beswick v Beswick - that privity is separate from consideration. Supporters of this view concede that while privity and consideration are distinct doctrines, there is a <b>strong</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the two.
