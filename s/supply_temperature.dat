40|$|Most air {{handling}} units (AHUs) in commercial buildings have an air economizer cycle for free cooling under certain outside air conditions. During the economizer cycle, the outside air and return air dampers are modulated to seek mixing air <b>temperature</b> at <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> setpoint. Mechanical cooling is always required when outside air temperature {{is higher than the}} <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> setpoint. Generally the <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> setpoint is set at 55 ?F for space humidity control. Actually the dehumidification is not necessary when outside air dew point is less than 55 ?F. Meanwhile the space may have less cooling load due to envelope heat loss and/or occupant schedule. These provide an opportunity to use higher <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> to reduce or eliminate mechanical cooling and terminal box reheat. On the other hand the higher <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> will require higher air flow as well as higher fan power. Therefore the <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> has to be optimized to minimize the combined energy for fan, cooling and heating energy. In this paper a simple energy consumption model is established for AHU systems during the economizer and then a optimal <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> control is developed to minimize the total cost of the mechanical cooling and the fan motor power.

Increasing the <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> and decreasing <b>supply</b> air flowrate can reduce energy consumption, however it causes insufficient air circulation and thus leads to low indoor air quality risk.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{influence}} of the personalized <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> control strategy on energy consumption and the energy-saving potentials of a personalized ventilation system have been investigated by means of simulations with IDA-ICE software. GenOpt software was used to determine the optimal <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature.</b> The simulated office room was located in a cold climate. The results reveal that the <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> control strategy has a marked influence on energy consumption. The energy consumption with personalized ventilation may increase substantially (in the range: 61 - 268 %) compared to mixing ventilation alone if energy-saving strategies are not applied. The results show that the best <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> control strategy is to provide air constantly at 20 °C. The most effective way of saving energy with personalized ventilation is to extend the upper room operative temperature limit (saving up to 60 % compared to the reference case). However, this energy-saving strategy can be recommended only in a working environment where the occupants {{spend most of their time}} at their workstation.

40|$|In {{a single}} duct {{variable}} air volume (SDVAV) system, the <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> is usually set as a constant value. Since this constant setpoint is selected {{to satisfy the}} maximum cooling load conditions, significant reheat will occur once the airflow reaches the minimum and the heating load increases. Resetting the <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> (SAT) higher during the heating season can reduce the reheat. However, air flow will increase when the SAT is higher which consume extra fan power. Therefore, to minimize the total operating cost of a SDVAV system, the <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> is typically reset based on outside air temperature (OAT) with a linear reset schedule. However, the linear reset schedule is often determined based on the engineer?s experience {{and it may not}} represent the optimal reset schedule for each building. This thesis documents a study to determine the optimized <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> reset schedule for SDVAV systems and analyzes the influencing factors under different operation scenarios. The study was divided into five main sections. The first section introduces the research background and objective. Literature review is documented after the introduction. The third section describes the methodology used in this study and the fourth section develops an in-depth discussion and analysis {{of the impact of the}} key influencing factors: minimum air flow ratio; ratio of exterior zone area to total floor area (i. e., exterior area ratio); internal load and the prices of the electricity; the cooling and the heating energy. The simulation results using EnergyPlus Version 2. 1. 0 for various operation scenarios are investigated in this section. The last section is a conclusion of the whole study. The optimized <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> can be set with respect to the OAT. The study found that instead of a simple linear relationship, the optimal reset schedule has several distinctive segments. Moreover, it is found that the optimal <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> reset schedule should be modified with the change of operation conditions (e. g., different minimum flow ratios and internal loads). Minimum air flow ratio has a significant impact on energy consumption in a SDVAV system. Exterior area ratio determines zone load distribution and will change system load indirectly. For buildings with small internal load, a more aggressive <b>supply</b> air <b>temperature</b> reset tactic can be implemented. In addition, the cost of electricity, cooling and heating energy can determine which end use energy (i. e., reheat energy and fan power) should take the priority...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{electrically}} driven compression {{heat pumps}} {{have come to}} be widely used for the heating of buildings. Their efficiency strongly depends on the temperature lift which is influenced by the <b>supply</b> <b>temperature</b> of the heat sink. When used with radiator heating systems it is challenging to operate heat pumps efficiently because high supply temperatures are required. Therefore, in order to efficiently operate heat pumps, this work analyses advanced control concepts for heatpump heating systems that adapt the <b>supply</b> <b>temperature</b> according to the demand. The heat output of radiators is influenced by the mass flow rate and the <b>supply</b> <b>temperature.</b> Today, usually only the outdoor air temperature is used for controlling the <b>supply</b> <b>temperature.</b> However, control strategies exist that consider additional disturbances. In this work, heat pumps in existing buildings are analyzed on the basis of field test data. The temperature of heat source and heat sink influence the efficiency of the heat pump. But additional influences such as the usage of additional appliances can be found which were studied and documented comprehensively. However, without data on user influences, room temperature and control settings, the potential of the field test cannot be fully realized. Field test data are used to evaluate models of the heat pump and the buffer storage of the heating system. The heat pump is implemented as a table-based model, the buffer storage is modeled as a stratified fluid volume. The validated models and existing model components make up a model of the overall system. It includes a model of a one-family home with nine heated zones. User influences implemented as different user schedules, the building physics, dimensioning of components and control are analyzed in simulations of heating periods. The usage and insulation standard of the building have a strong influence on the energy demand and thermal comfort. The system model is also used to analyze different <b>supply</b> <b>temperature</b> control strategies. Three control concepts are modeled: A rule-based one which adapts the set temperature step-wise, a model predictive one which calculates the optimal <b>supply</b> <b>temperature</b> for each heated zone, and a continuously operating controller which uses an integral element controlling the <b>supply</b> <b>temperature</b> according to the room air temperature. The advantages and disadvantages of each strategy are evaluated {{on the basis of the}} simulation results. A decrease of the mean <b>supply</b> <b>temperature</b> leads to considerable savings in energy demand. However, an increased thermal discomfort cannot be fully avoided. Attained energy savings crucially depend on the type of building physics and the user influences. Energy savings in real buildings can exceed the ones simulated using ideally parametrized systems...|$|E
