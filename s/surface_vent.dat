Generally all geyser field sites are located near active volcanic areas, and the geyser effect is due to the proximity of magma.

The last period contains the most pronounced impulsive signal activity. During this period, the largest vent (15 - 1 in Fig.  1 b) formed (Mannen et al. 2015). Yukutake et al.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for predicting {{the sizes of}} clasts which may be expected in proximal ignimbrite deposits on the earth and Mars is developed. The model can provide {{an explanation of the}} eruption mechanism. It takes into account the inside and outside conditions of a vent from which a large-scale pyroclastic flow takes place. The drag forces exerted by the dusty gas on relatively large clasts are also taken into account. The sizes of the largest clasts that contribute to a proximal lag breccia deposit can thus be deduced. The analysis has shown that the pressure at the <b>surface</b> <b>vent</b> level in an ignimbrite-forming eruption is independent of the planetary atmospheric pressure; the gravity and vent size then become the major factors controlling the size of the largest clast which can be erupted...|$|E

40|$|During {{rainfall}} events, macropores {{are generally}} considered to play a dominant role in infiltration after matrix ponding has occurred. Once ponding has been initiated on the soil matrix, surface runoff may be generated at rainfall intensities less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil. The amount of runoff will depend on detention storage and how efficiently the surface flow is captured by soil macropores. The efficiency of surface water removal by macropores is diminished if <b>surface</b> <b>vents</b> become clogged sealed by washed-in sediment during the runoff event. Post-event opening of <b>surface</b> <b>vents</b> by the animals that created them can remove evidence of the sealing process {{and so it is}} particularly important to examine the temporal stability of the soil surface during rainfall events. In this paper evidence of macropore clogging and post-event clearing of the <b>surface</b> <b>vents</b> is presented. A fine sandy loam passed through a 2 mm diameter sieve was packed into two boxes, each with a surface area of 0. 5 m 2. The boxes were irrigated at 28 mm h- 1 using a low energy rainfall sprinkler. This application rate exceeded the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix. After measuring runoff and infiltration from the boxes, one box was held as a control and the second was inoculated with earthworms. After four weeks the inoculated box had a burrow density at the soil surface of 380 m- 2, with an average diameter of 5 mm. Macropore sealing occurred immediately after ponding and runoff from the macroporous soil was only 10. 7 % less than a control with no macropores. Within 24 h after cessation of simulated rainfall the earthworms had cleared washed in material from over 95 % of burrow vents. Time to matrix ponding was well predicted using hydraulic parameters characteristic of the soil matrix, indicating that matrix sealing was not significant under the experimental conditions...|$|R

The erupted material consisted of fragmented magma, steam, and country rock which expanded from a choked state at the <b>surface</b> <b>vent</b> to form a near-ballistic, Io-like eruption plume. Outward flow of the plume at velocities of ∼ 430 m/s from a ∼ 30 – 60 km-long section of the graben is interpreted to have formed the system of dune-like ridges.

40|$|Deformation {{caused by}} {{processes}} within a volcanic conduit are localised, transient, and therefore challenging to measure. However, observations of such deformation {{are important because}} they provide insight into conditions preceding explosive activity, and are important for hazard assessment. Here, we present measurements of low magnitude, transient deformation covering an area of ∼ 4 km 2 at Masaya volcano spanning a period of explosive eruptions (30 th April - 17 th May 2012). Radial uplift of duration 24 days and peak displacements of a few millimetres occurred in the month before the eruption, but switched to subsidence ∼ 27 days {{before the onset of}} the explosive eruption on 30 th of April. Uplift resumed during, and continued for ∼ 16 days {{after the end of the}} explosive eruption period. We use a finite element modelling approach to investigate a range of possible source geometries for this deformation, and find that the changes in pressurisation of a conduit 450 m below the <b>surface</b> <b>vent</b> (radius 160 m and length 700 m), surrounded by a halo of brecciated material with a Young’s modulus of 15 GPa, gave a good fit to the InSAR displacements. We propose that the pre-eruptive deformation sequence at Masaya is likely to have been caused by the movement of magma through a constriction within the shallow conduit system. Although measuring displacements associated with conduit processes remains challenging, new high resolution InSAR datasets will increasingly allow the measurement of transient and lower magnitude deformation signals, improving the method’s applicability for observing transitions between volcanic activity characterised by an open and a closed conduit system...|$|E
30|$|We {{detected}} infrasound signals {{associated with}} eruptive {{activity in the}} Owakudani geothermal region during {{the opening of a}} shallow crack using a cross-correlation method between infrasound and vertical ground velocity. The correlation pattern showing the infrasound signal associated with the volcanic source occurred nearly simultaneously as the rapid tilt change related to the opening of a crack beneath the Owakudani geothermal region. Given that {{the upper end of the}} open crack is approximately 150  m beneath the surface, the direct emission of highly pressurized hydrothermal fluid from the open crack is not plausible because of the hydraulic diffusivity in this region. The instantaneous response of the infrasonic wave may reflect rapid vaporization of groundwater beneath Owakudani caused by the strain transfer resulting from the crack opening. We also detected a correlation pattern corresponding to discrete impulsive infrasound signals at 06 : 57 and 10 : 32 on June 30 and from 04 : 05 to 06 : 00 on July 01 that may be related to the behavior of a gas slug at the <b>surface</b> <b>vent.</b> The most pronounced impulsive infrasound activity was detected approximately 2  days after the rapid tilt change, during which the largest vent formed. These results suggest that the sudden emission of vapor occurred simultaneously with the inflation of the shallow pressure source, whereas the eruptive burst events accompanied by the largest vent formation were delayed for 2  days. We demonstrated that the infrasonic wave during the phreatic eruption, even with a small amplitude on the order of less than 1  Pa, could be distinguished from wind and seismic noise using the correlation method. Furthermore, this study showed that the correlation method is a powerful tool for monitoring surface phenomena at vents when only one microphone is available.|$|E

30|$|Similar seismic and {{infrasonic}} {{records were}} measured during the explosive events at Stromboli (Ripepe et al. 2001). Here the mean Δt, measured as 2.1  s, {{could not be}} explained by assuming a common source {{on the surface of}} the magma, considering the 300  m between the vent and the station. To explain the large Δt, Ripepe et al. (2001) assumed that the source processes were different, and that the seismic signal was generated by the sudden collapse of foam into a large gas bubble (a gas slug) in the magma column, whereas the infrasound signal was generated by the explosion of a gas slug at the magma surface. The foam collapse model for the generation mechanism of the tremor at Stromboli was supported by the observation of the very-long period (VLP) signals associated with the explosions (e.g., Chouet et al. 1999). On the other hand, the Δt observed at Hakone (Fig.  11) shows that seismic and infrasonic waves are generated at the same time at the surface of the vent. Moreover, we did not observe significant VLP signals exceeding microseismic noise around the infrasonic onsets at the E.KMYB broadband station. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that the impulsive infrasonic wave and large amplitude seismic signal observed before the infrasonic onset (Fig.  12) were generated by a gas slug bursting at the surface of the vent. The generation of an impulsive infrasonic wave due to a shallow explosive source has been demonstrated by underwater explosion experiments (Ichihara et al. 2009). A similar model was proposed for the tremor activity at White Island, New Zealand (Jolly et al. 2016), in which the dynamic behavior of a gas slug near a <b>surface</b> <b>vent</b> was related to the occurrence of a tremor and infrasonic signals. The high-frequency (>  6  Hz) signal coincident with the infrasonic onset (Fig.  12 c) was thought to be produced by a seismic source coupled to the atmosphere, as indicated in Ripepe et al. (2001).|$|E
40|$|The Jericho {{kimberlite}} (173. 1. ±. 1. 3. Ma) {{is a small}} (~. 130. ×. 70. m), multi-vent {{system that}} preserves products from deep (>. 1. km?) portions of kimberlite vents. Pit mapping, drill core examination, petrographic study, image analysis of olivine crystals (grain size distributions and shape studies), and compositional and mineralogical studies, are used to reconstruct processes from near-surface magma ascent to kimberlite emplacement and alteration. The Jericho kimberlite formed by multiple eruptions through an Archean granodiorite batholith that was overlain by mid-Devonian limestones ~. 1. km in thickness. Kimberlite magma ascended through granodiorite basement by dyke propagation but ascended through limestone, at least in part, by locally brecciating the host rocks. After the first explosive breakthrough to <b>surface,</b> <b>vent</b> deepening and widening occurred by the erosive forces of the waxing phase of the eruption, by gravitationally induced failures as portions of the vent margins slid into the vent and, in the deeper portions of the vent (>. 1. km), by scaling, as thin slabs burst from the walls into the vent. At currently exposed levels, coherent kimberlite (CK) dykes (<. 40. cm thick) are found {{to the north and}} south of the vent complex and represent the earliest preserved in-situ products of Jericho magmatism. Timing of CK emplacement on {{the eastern side of the}} vent complex is unclear; some thick CK (15 - 20. m) may have been emplaced after the central vent was formed. Explosive eruptive products are preserved in four partially overlapping vents that are roughly aligned along strike with the coherent kimberlite dyke. The volcaniclastic kimberlite (VK) facies are massive and poorly sorted, with matrix- to clast-supported textures. The VK facies fragmented by dry, volatile-driven processes and were emplaced by eruption column collapse back into the volcanic vents. The first explosive products, poorly preserved because of partial destruction by later eruptions, are found in the central-east vent and were formed by eruption column collapse after the vent was largely cleared of country rock debris. The next active vent was either the north or south vent. Collapse of the eruption column, linked to a vent widening episode, resulted in coeval avalanching of pipe margin walls into the north vent, forming interstratified lenses of country rock-rich boulder breccias in finer-grained volcaniclastic kimberlite. South vent kimberlite has similar characteristics to kimberlite of the north vent and likely formed by similar processes. The final eruptive phase formed olivine-rich and moderately sorted deposits of the central vent. Better sorting is attributed to recycling of kimberlite debris by multiple eruptions through the unconsolidated volcaniclastic pile and associated collapse events. Post-emplacement alteration varies in intensity, but in all cases, has overprinted the primary groundmass and matrix, in CK and VK, respectively. Erosion has since removed all limestone cover...|$|E
40|$|Europa, on {{the basis}} of its {{spectral}} characteristics and its apparently young surface age, is likely to be at least partially resurfaced by liquid water volcanic processes; however, convincing evidence for lava flow morphology in Voyager data has not previously been found, and the lower density of liquid water relative to an overlying solid water ice crust suggests that extrusive volcanism could be uncommon. We examine a candidate lava-flow-like feature (Thrace Macula) and compare its characteristics with theoretical predictions for the ascent and eruption of water magma on Europa, outlining a range of conditions under which water ice magma could plausibly be erupted to the surface. Thrace Macula (45 °S, 171 °W) is a dark lobate feature extending NNW to SSE; its northern part is centered in a 140 km diameter arcuate to circular lineament, and within this zone are radial and concentric lineaments and three dark lobes similar in appearance to flow lobes extending away from a central region for distances of 40, 50, and 160 km. The 160 km lobe appears to follow local topographic features, producing lobate margins at subdued structures, broadening locally parallel to structural trends, and terminating against a gray band. Models for the present structure and state of the predominantly H 2 O exterior of Europa range from solid water ice to a thin ice layer overlying a liquid water layer, and these conditions may even vary as a function of space and time. Ascent and eruption of H 2 O magma through a less dense water ice crust means that sustained effusive eruptions are very difficult to produce if a globally continuous liquid water (or salt-water) layer exists [e. g., Crawford and Stevenson, 1988; Kargel, 1991]. For flows as extensive as the Thrace Macula feature, we thus require magma source regions sufficiently localized that excess pressure can be built up in the source region. Given the elastic properties of ice at these source depths, the most likely scenario is intrusion of silicate magma into the base of an ice crust, and melting and mobilization of water magma. With this range of magma source settings, we model plausible <b>surface</b> <b>vent</b> geometries for a water lava flow interpretation of Thrace Macula. Modeling calculations show that flow lobes with the above geometries, and thicknesses on the order of 10 m, could be formed in water eruptions on Europa involving discharge rates of ∼ 2 × 105 m 3 /s through dikes with widths in the range 5 – 10 m. These discharge rates (about 3 times larger than those of terrestrial flood basalts) should not be unusual for water eruptions on Europa under these conditions and suggest that water volcanic resurfacing could be common on the satellite if source regions meeting these criteria were readily available. The lack of abundant similar dark flows could be due to brightening with time or might imply that conditions for their formation (grounded or nearly solid ice crust) only evolved in the latter part of Europan history...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The mobilized sediments {{expelled}} by the mud volcanoes in Trinidad {{correspond to}} lique-fied argillaceous and sandy material {{in which the}} solid fraction is systematically polygenic and originating from several formations (Cretaceous to Pliocene). The mud is notably rich in thin-grained quartz that is ngular and frequently mechanically damaged related to shearing at great depth, during the sedimentary burial, and/or hydraulic fracturing processes. The exotic clasts ar mostly fractured fragments from various formations f the tectonic wedge (mostly Palaeocene to Miocene). The origin of the solid particles of the mud ispolygenic, including deep Cr taceous-Palaeogene horizons close to the drcollement, and various materials from the stratigraphic pile pierced by the mud conduits. Moreover, the fluids expelled by the mud volcanoes have a deep origin and notably the gas phase is thermogenic methane generated probably below a depth of 5000 m. The effusions occur either during cycles of moderate effusion of mud and fluids (quiescence regime), or during catastrophic events responsible for the expulsion of huge volumes of mud, clasts and fluids (transient regime). Available subsurface {{data suggest that the}} deep structure of the mud volcanoes includes: (1) a focused deep conduit at depth in the zone f overpressure; (2) a mud chamber intruding the surrounding formations around and above the top of the abnormal pressure zone; and (3) a superficial outlet leading to the <b>surface</b> <b>vents.</b> Convergent and transpressive margins are frequently affected by mud volcanism (extrusion of liquefied sediments) and shale diapirism (extrusion of plastic shale) processes, which influence the structural evo-lution and the fluid dynamics within the tectonic wedge.
