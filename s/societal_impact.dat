5|$|Atlantic storms are {{becoming}} more destructive financially, since five of the ten most expensive storms in United States history have occurred since 1990. According to the World Meteorological Organization, “recent increase in <b>societal</b> <b>impact</b> from tropical cyclones has largely been caused by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions.” Pielke et al. (2008) normalized mainland U.S. hurricane damage from 1900–2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade 1996–2005 has the second most damage among the past 11 decades, with only the decade 1926–1935 surpassing its costs. The most damaging single storm is the 1926 Miami hurricane, with $157billion of normalized damage.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{demands on}} the part of the public for a {{demonstrable}} return on their investment in scientific and technical research have led to the widespread introduction of considerations of <b>societal</b> <b>impacts</b> into the peer review processes at public science and technology funding agencies. This answer to the accountability challenge also introduces a peculiar strain on peer review: expertise in particular areas of scientific and technical research is no guarantee of expertise in addressing the <b>societal</b> <b>impacts</b> of proposed research. Presenting preliminary results of a larger study, this article describes five current models of the peer review of grant proposals and shows that different agencies have very different ways of incorporating <b>societal</b> <b>impacts</b> considerations. The article also elucidates a notion of theoreti-cal adequacy, which will be used to determine whether and how some peer review processes are better than others. The objectives of this article are to lay out the description of the agencies and to offer a preliminary assessment of each model’s theoretical adequacy. The objective of our larger study is to determine the best ways to incorporate <b>societal</b> <b>impacts</b> considerations into the peer review of grant proposals, thus helping funding agencies respond to the demand for demonstrable results.

40|$|Around {{the world}} many peatlands are managed unsustainably. Drainage of the peat causes soil {{subsidence}} {{and a range}} of negative <b>societal</b> <b>impacts.</b> Integrated strategies are required to ensure more sustainable long-term settings, based on impact assessment models that simulate the interrelated dynamics of water management and soil subsidence, and determine the spatial and temporal range of <b>societal</b> <b>impacts.</b> This paper presents an integrated modelling framework that meets these requirements. We used the framework to assess the impacts of a range of water management strategies in Dutch peatlands. Average soil subsidence rates were shown to range from 0. 6 to 4. 5 mm·y− 1, resulting in marked differences in <b>societal</b> <b>impacts</b> that affect stakeholders unequally. Moreover, the impacts on real estate damage and water system maintenance revealed inverse trends that result in increasingly unbalanced cost-benefit ratios. The generated insights led the regional water authority to change their current water management strategy, preventing unsustainable future developments. We find the results relevant for improving stakeholders' awareness of long-term impacts of management strategies, and making negotiation processes on goals, means, and possible future pathways more transparent...|$|R
