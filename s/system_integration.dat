The research results support the hypothesis that the work requirements of the July 2007 data set of 4600 P-coded billets (billets requiring graduate education in Human <b>Systems</b> <b>Integration)</b> was not properly representative of the Human <b>Systems</b> <b>Integration</b> competencies as developed through the Educational Skill Requirements; not all Navy Human <b>Systems</b> <b>Integration</b> work was identified by a 4600 subspecialty; and the 4600 billet structure did not allow sufficient career progression opportunities. Despite the focus on the defense acquisition process in the Human <b>Systems</b> <b>Integration</b> curriculum at Naval Postgraduate School, the billets did not reflect this priority. In order for Human <b>Systems</b> <b>Integration</b> to be a viable subspecialty requiring graduate education, relevant billets need to be identified in the Navy.

40|$|Today, {{most cities}} {{function}} linearly. One {{way to improve}} their environmental performance {{is to make a}} transition from linear to Circular Urban Systems (CUS) so that part of the waste streams becomes valorised locally. This does not only require technical but also organisational and institutional changes. Moreover it implies that links have to be created between systems that were previously separate (wastewater treatment and transport for instance). This is called <b>systems</b> <b>integration.</b> This research aims to better understand how <b>systems</b> <b>integration</b> comes about. To be able to reconstruct processes of <b>systems</b> <b>integration,</b> a conceptual framework is developed that combines Actor-Network Theory with insights from structuration theory. A method is also suggested that helps visualising integration processes. These are then applied to the study of three urban areas: EVA-Lanxmeer in Culemborg (NL), Hammarby Sjöstad in Stockholm (SE) and Lille Métropole (FR). In total ten attempts at <b>systems</b> <b>integration</b> are analysed. Researchers earlier pointed out that <b>systems</b> <b>integration</b> could potentially lock systems in a sub-optimal situation. This study however shows that <b>systems</b> <b>integration</b> can foster innovation and open up new technological pathways. Moreover, this research highlights that <b>systems</b> <b>integration</b> often faces barriers due to the structural incompatibilities of the systems involved. Creating bridging systems can be a way to lift these incompatibilities. It also shows that the presence of an organisation able to provide inter-sectorial coordination is often necessary.
