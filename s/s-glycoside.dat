For an N-acetylated allyl N-glycoside, an N-glycoside-based product was formed in poor yield with loss of the N-acetyl residue, while the major product 4 (60 %), in which the sugar moiety was absent, arose from cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond, under the cyclo-addition conditions. The cycloadducts of the O-, and <b>S-glycoside</b> type were ring-opened and subjected to acidic and basic hydrolysis, for removing the chiral auxiliary. This resulted in glycosidic bond cleavage for O-glycosides and loss of material, while an <b>S-glycoside</b> amino acid was isolated in 78 % yield, indicating a higher resistance of the S-glycosidic bond. N-O Bond cleavage and hydrolytic treatments applied to 4 afforded 4 (S) - 4 -hydroxy-L-ornithine in high yield.

40|$|Family 3 �-D-glucan glucohydrolases are {{distributed}} widely in higher plants. The enzymes catalyze the hydrolytic removal of �-D-glucosyl residues from nonreducing termini {{of a range}} of �-D-glucans and �-D-oligoglucosides. Their broad specificity can be explained by x-ray crystallographic data obtained from a barley �-D-glucan glucohydrolase in complex with nonhydrolyzable <b>S-glycoside</b> substrate analogs and by molecular modeling of enzyme/substrate complexes. The glucosyl residue that occupies binding subsite � 1 is locked tightly into a fixed position through extensive hydrogen bonding with six amino acid residues near the bottom of an active site pocket. In contrast, the glucosyl residue at subsite � 1 is located between two Trp residues at the entrance of the pocket, where it is constrained less tightly. The relative flexibility of binding at subsite � 1, coupled with the projection of the remainder of bound substrate away from the enzyme’s surface, means that the overall active site can accommodate a range of substrates with variable spatial dispositions of adjacent �-D-glucosyl residues.

40|$|Abstract- Several novel {{solutions}} to the efficient and selective preparation of glycosides are presented. Commercial tris(4 -bromophenyl) aniumyl hexachloroantimonate, a one-electron transfer homogeneous reagent, nicely activates in acetonitrile various ethyl or phenyl <b>S-glycosides</b> having either participating or non-participating substituents at C- 2 to give p- 0 -glycosides in good yield. In {{a variation on the}} theme, phenyl <b>S-glycosides</b> react with alcohols under mild electrochemical conditions to give the corresponding 0 -glycosides. Azidoxanthates, prepared via a two-step sequence from various galactals, are efficient galactosyl donors for the steroselective synthesis of protected precursors of biologically important galactosamine-containing oligosaccharides. We have also discovered that anomeric enol-ethers, or the corresponding carbonates, are remarkably efficient glycosyl donors. Finally, a "non-orthodox " strategy based on the idocyclization of appropriate acyclic enol-ethers resulted in a novel approach to KDO-containing disaccharides. This last synthesis critically benefited from the use of the Tebbe reagent for the preparation of the key starting enol ethers...|$|R

Thioglycosides are less investigated in contrast to O-glycosides. It is known that O-glycosidase is able to split O-glycosides, including of O-arylglycosides, in biological systems. Enzymes capable of cleaving the thioglycosidic bond are less common in nature and occur mainly in plants [9, 10]. While O-glycosidases are ubiquitous, plant myrosinase is the only known S-glycosidase [11]. Thioglycosides possess significantly lower susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis than the corresponding oxygen glycosides [12]. Also, thioglycosides have gained widespread use in carbohydrate chemistry as inhibitors of O-glycosidase and O-glycosyltransferase inhibitors [13]. Nevertheless, unlike intensively investigated O-glycosides of MDP, S-glycosides have received relatively little attention. Currently, only three S-alkyl glycosides of MDP, namely, methyl and butyl β-glycosides and hexadecyl <b>S-glycoside,</b> have been obtained [8], although 1 -thiomuramyl dipeptide itself was found to possess the adjuvant effect close to the action of muramyl dipeptide [8]. For this reason, we synthesized the thioglycosides of MDP.|$|E

We have now compared the inhibitory effects of α-Neu 5 thioAc 2 Me and other sialic acid analogs on receptor binding and plaque formation of intact influenza A viruses. When α-Neu 5 thioAc 2 Me was polymerized by conjugation to polyacrylamide, its affinity to HA increased 103 -fold. When analyzed by plaque reduction, the α-Neu 5 thioAc 2 polymer was about 10 times more efficient as an inhibitor of virus replication than the α-Neu 5 Ac 2 polymer, stressing the importance of sulfur at C 5. The <b>S-glycoside</b> α- 2 -S-methyl- 5 -N-thioacetylneuraminic acid (α-Neu 5 thioAc 2 SMe) had the same affinity to HA as α-Neu 5 thioAc 2 Me, but was resistant to neuraminidase.

40|$|Higher plant, family GH 3 β-d-glucan glucohydrolases exhibit exo-hydrolytic and {{retaining}} (e→e) mechanisms {{of action and}} catalyze the removal of single glucosyl residues from the non-reducing termini of β-d-linked glucosidic substrates, with retention of anomeric configuration. The broad specificity β-d-glucan glucohydrolases are likely to play roles in cell wall re-modelling, turn-over of cell wall components and possibly in plant defence reactions against pathogens. Crystal structures of the barley β-d-glucan glucohydrolase, obtained from both native enzyme and from the enzyme in complex with a substrate analogues and mechanism-based inhibitors, have enabled the basis of substrate specificity, the mechanism of catalysis, {{and the role of}} domain movements during the catalytic cycle to be defined in precise molecular terms. The active site of the enzyme forms a shallow ‘pocket’ that is located at the interface of two domains of the enzyme and accommodates two glucosyl residues. The propensity of the enzyme to hydrolyze a broad range of substrates with (1 → 2) -, (1 → 3) -, (1 → 4) - and (1 → 6) -β-d-glucosidic linkages is explained from crystal structures of the enzyme in complex with non-hydrolysable <b>S-glycoside</b> substrate analogues, and from molecular modelling. During binding of gluco-oligosaccharides, the glucosyl residue at subsite − 1 is locked in a highly constrained position, but the glucosyl residue at the + 1 subsite is free to adjust its position between two tryptophan residues positioned at the entry of the active site pocket. The flexibility at subsite + 1 and the projection of the remainder of the substrate away from the pocket provide a structural rationale for the capacity of the enzyme to accommodate and hydrolyze glucosides with different linkage positions and hence different overall conformations. While mechanism-based inhibitors with micromolar Ki constants bind in the active site of the enzyme and form esters with the catalytic nucleophile, transition-state mimics bind with their ‘glucose’ moieties distorted into the 4 E conformation, which is critical for the nanomolar binding of these inhibitors to the enzyme. The glucose product of the reaction, which is released from the non-reducing termini of substrates, remains bound to the β-d-glucan glucohydrolase in the − 1 subsite of the active site, until a new substrate molecule approaches the enzyme. If dissociation of the glucose from the enzyme active site could be synchronized throughout the crystal, time-resolved Laue X-ray crystallography could be used to follow the conformational changes that occur as the glucose product diffuses away and the incoming substrate is bound by the enzyme.

A new route to O-acetylated glycosyl thiols involving specific S-deacetylation of peracetylated 1 -thioglycoses was developed by the conversion of 1 -thio-Beta-D-glucopyranose pentaacetate into tetra-O-acetyl- 1 -S-phenylmercury (II) thio-Beta-D-glucopyranose and subsequent demercuration of this by hydrogen sulphide. A range of acylated alkyl and aryl 1, 2 -trans- 1 -thioglycosides was prepared by one step processes from peracylated 1, 2 -trans-related sugars by a procedure which involved the use of equimolar proportions of thiols together with boron trifluoride. A similar procedure was used to obtain benzoylated 1, 2 -cis-O-glucosides from penta-O-benzoyl-Beta-D-glucopyranose. Partial desulphurisation of acetylated glucosyl phenyl disulphide with tris(diethylamino) phosphine led to both phenyl tetra-O-acetyl- 1 -thio-alpha-D-glucopyranoside and the alpha, beta-linked thiotrehalose peracetate.

40|$|An {{efficient}} seven-step {{synthesis of}} carbohydrate-based novel oxepines {{has been accomplished}} using reductive elimination reactions. Classical Fisher-Zack synthesis of glycals via reductive eliminations of glycosyl bromides was adapted to develop a simple and efficient route to oxepine synthesis. The scope of the synthesis was evaluated by varying both the pyranose starting materials and protecting groups incorporated into the oxepine products. The efficiency, economy and simplicity of this method made it amenable to a practical, scalable synthesis of per-O-acetyl oxepines. Interestingly, this study incorporated the synthesis of di-O-acetyl septanoses and per-O-acetyl septanoses. We expect that the reactivities of these two systems are analogous to the respective pyranose derivatives. Bromination reactions of di-O-acetyl septanoses using HBr in AcOH provided the un-expected 1, 4 -anhydroseptanoses. These intramolecular cyclizations of di-acetyl systems were not affected with the change in ring configuration. The unusual reactivity of the septanoses {{is linked to the}} formation of kinetically favoured five-memebered ring and stereoselectivity. Alternatively, sequential bromination and glycosylation on per-O-acetyl septanoses gave access to the β-septanosides such as O-, N-, and <b>S-glycosides</b> exclusively. A two-step synthesis of C-septanosides from protected pyranoses has been developed. Vinyl addition to tetra-O-benzyl D-glucose, D-galactose and D-mannose gave the corresponding allylic alcohols. Electrophilic cyclization of the allylic alcohols followed by iodination gave iodomethyl C-septanosides. The route is comparable to those that convert furanoses to C-pyranosides. The cyclization reactions were highly diastereoselective, giving cis- 1, 2 configured C-septanosides. The selectivity is rationalized based on inside alkoxy model for electrophilic cyclizations that correlates reactivity with the conformation of the allylic system. Substitution on the iodomethyl group of the cyclization products provided the C-septanose derivatives. The approach should be generally applicable for the synthesis of a variety of C-septanosides. In the seperate study, septanose carbohydrates and related a polyhydroxylated oxepanes were studied as a ligands for the mannose-specific lectin FimH. Lectin Protein FimH {{at the tip of the}} E. coli is a bacterial adhesion that was primarily responsible for Urinal Tract infections (UTIS). Blocking of these bacterial adhesions by modified Carbohydrates was able to cure UTIS. Competitive binding assays and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) indicated an approximately ten-fold lower affinity for the 3 -n-heptyloxy oxepane derivative compared to n-heptyl α-D-mannopyranoside, resulting exclusively from a loss of conformational entropy. Further investigations by solution NMR, X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling revealed that the oxepane ligand establishes an identical H-bond network compared to the prototypical mannoside ligand, but at the price of a high entropic penalty due to loss of its conformational flexibility. Overall, the observations made on the oxepane-FimH interaction can guide the design of ligands for other therapeutically important protein-small molecule interactions...|$|R
