40|$|Ph. D. (Chemistry) The {{effect of}} crystal defects on the {{adsorption}} and flotation properties of zinc sulphides was examined. Flotation experiments were restricted to collectorless flotation, {{that is to}} the flotation of untreated and copper-activated samples. The effect of cyanide treatment was examined only so that an explanation could be found for the bonding characteristics of the adsorbed copper on regions where the crystallography was undisturbed and on those where it was distorted. The electrochemical method for the determination of copper permitted continuous and highly sensitive monitoring of the copper adsorption on the <b>sphalerites.</b> The {{first part of the}} thesis concerns the adsorption of copper on synthetic zinc sulphide crystals and natural <b>sphalerites.</b> It is stated that the degree of adsorption depends on the defect structure.

However, the combination of dispersion with extreme hardness, wear and chemical resistivity, as well as clever marketing, determines the exceptional value of diamond as a gemstone.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} {{normally}} found {{in association with}} other base metals such as copper and lead in ores. Zinc is a chalcophile, meaning the element has a low affinity for oxides and prefers to bond with sulfides.

Russia's deposits are located in the far east of Sakhalin Island, and northeast of Vladivostok. The deposits in China are located mainly in the lignite mines near Lincang, Yunnan; coal is also mined near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia.|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} compositions of pyroxenes from 46 skarn {{deposits in}} Japan were statistically examined after compiling published and newly analyzed compositional data {{in order to}} put constraints on skarn metallogeny. The Mn/Fe ratio and Zn content of pyroxene in each de-posit are relatively constant and tend to vary regionally in accordance with metal type. Most pyroxenes of Cu-Fe deposits are characterized by a low Mn/Fe ratio ( 0. 2) and a high Zn content (> 200 ppm). Pyroxenes of W deposits have an intermediate Mn/Fe ratio (around 0. 15) and a very high Zn content, especially those of W-Sn-F deposits (> 500 ppm). The systematic relation between the pyroxene composition and the metal type extends to the Mn/Fe ratio and Cd content of skarn <b>sphalerites.</b> These compositional features of pyroxenes and <b>sphalerites</b> seem to indicate that the proportion of Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cd contents in hydrothermal fluids did not change significantly from the time of pyroxene formation to the period of the later sulfide deposition, on the scale of the deposit. The Mn/Fe ratio and Zn content of skarn pyroxene can serve as an additional aid in the classification and defining of the environment of skarn formation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Hongdonggou Pb-Zn polymetallic ore deposit, {{located in}} the southwestern part of the Luanchuan Mo-W-Pb-Zn-Ag polymetallic ore {{mineralization}} in Henan Province, China, {{is an important part}} of the East Qinling metallogenic belt. The orebodies in the deposit, which are vein, bedded and lenticular, are mainly hosted in the syenite porphyry, and formed within the carbonate and clastic rocks of the Yuku and Qiumugou formations partially. The genesis of the deposit has previously been argued to be of hydrothermal-vein type or of skarn-hydrothermal type. In this study, we report the results of Rb-Sr isotopic dating based on <b>sphalerites</b> from the main orebody of the Hongdonggou Pb-Zn polymetallic ore deposit, which yield an isochron age of 135. 7  ±  3. 2  Ma, constraining the timing of mineralization as early Cretaceous. The age is close to those reported for the Pb-Zn deposits in the Luanchuan ore belt. The (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i values of the <b>sphalerites</b> (0. 71127  ±  0. 00010) are lower than that of terrigenous silicates (0. 720) and higher than the mantle (0. 707), suggesting that the metallogenic components were mainly derived through crust-mantle mixing. Combining the results from this study with those from previous work, we propose that the Hongdonggou Pb-Zn polymetallic ore deposit is a hydrothermal-vein deposit associated with the early Cretaceous tectonothermal event, and the mineralization is controlled by NW- and near EW-trending faults in the Luanchuan Mo-W-Pb-Zn-Ag polymetallic ore concentration belt...|$|R

5|$|Boron nitride is a heat- and {{chemically}} resistant refractory compound of boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN. It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite {{is the most}} stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (<b>sphalerite</b> structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior.

5|$|Group 12 metals are chalcophiles, {{meaning the}} {{elements}} have low affinities for oxides and prefer {{to bond with}} sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere. The commercially most important minerals of group 12 elements are sulfide minerals. <b>Sphalerite,</b> which {{is a form of}} zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc. No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with <b>sphalerite</b> (ZnS). This association is caused by the geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium which makes geological separation unlikely. As a consequence, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper. One place where metallic cadmium can be found is the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia. Although mercury is an extremely rare element in the Earth's crust, because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be highly concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in cinnabar (HgS), corderoite, livingstonite and other minerals, with cinnabar being the most common ore.|$|E
40|$|The topaz-bearing ores {{were found}} from the Akazawa mine,Katashina,Gunma Prefecture,Japan. This {{is the first}} finding of topaz from the mines in Gunma Prefecture. The Akazawa mine is an {{abandoned}} copper mine and the ore deposit lies in the Okunikkou rhyolites (late Cretaceous～Paleozoic). Seventeen minerals {{were found in the}} wastes from the Akazawa mine:chalcopyrite,sphalerite,arsenopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, native sulfur, quartz, topaz, calcite, chlorite, sericite, kaolinite, feldspar, anglesite, goethite and jarosite. The unit-cell dimensions of chalcopyrites, <b>sphalerites,</b> arsenopyrites, pyrites, pyrrhotites, galena, quartzes and topazes were calculated. Galena occurs only in the wastes carrying topaz. Anglesites are formed at the margin or along the cleavage planes of galena. A small amount of sericite and kaolinite occur only in topaz-bearing wastes. Most of gangue minerals are quartz. Two kinds of quartz are found in the topaz-bearing wastes. One is coarse-grained euhedral to subhedral crystals or their fragments. The other occurrence is fine-grained quartz mosaic,surrounding coarse-grained quartz. Some coarse-grained quartzes are partly corroded and are recognized the successively growing after the corrosion. Topaz occurs in a few wastes as the radial aggregates of colorless columnar crystals (usually less than 0. 1 mm in long) around chalcopyrites, <b>sphalerites</b> and galenas. In the quartz mosaic, topazes crystallize between quartz grains and seem to be going to replace quartzes. The OH/(OH＋F) value of topaz was estimated from the unit-cell dimensions and volume (Wunder et al. 1993). The average value was 0. 21 atom. ％ and this is corresponding to 16. 39 wt％ in F contents of the topaz.

Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium, they searched for the green thallium emission spectrum lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line. Because that blue line did not match any known element, they hypothesized a new element was present in the minerals. They named the element indium, from the indigo color seen in its spectrum, after the Latin indicum, meaning 'of India'.|$|E

5|$|Because it seldom {{appears in}} high concentration, {{germanium}} was discovered comparatively {{late in the}} history of chemistry. Germanium ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's crust. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties from its position on his periodic table, and called the element ekasilicon. Nearly two decades later, in 1886, Clemens Winkler found the new element along with silver and sulfur, in a rare mineral called argyrodite. Although the new element somewhat resembled arsenic and antimony in appearance, the combining ratios in compounds agreed with Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named the element after his country, Germany. Today, germanium is mined primarily from <b>sphalerite</b> (the primary ore of zinc), though germanium is also recovered commercially from silver, lead, and copper ores.|$|E

The Silesian-Cracow {{lead and}} zinc {{deposits}} are occurring mainly within the so-called ore-bearing dolomites of the Middle Triassic (Muschelkalk) and by the most authors are classified as Mississippi Valley-type deposits (Sass-Gustkiewicz et al. 1982, Wodzicki 1987, Leach et al. 2001, 2010). Coaly accumulations within the Zn-Pb deposits of the Silesian-Cracow region such as so-called dopplerite - a black, amorphous organic matter (OM) macroscopically resembling gelificated detrital lignite (see Sass-Gustkiewicz & Kwiecińska 1994, Kwiecińska et al. 1997), brown and matte-blacke intercalations in the clayey rocks of the internal sediment type (Sass-Gustkiewicz 1996) and organic matter present in inclusions of the sulfide minerals (Karwowski et al. 1979, 2001, Kozlowski 1995) are well known, but the problem of their origin {{is the subject of}} numerous discussions and to present day has not been clearly resolved. There is an agreement among investigators that the above-mentioned OM has an allochtonous origin, but the controversy raises the question of the potential source of OM and its age (Kołcon & Wagner 1983, Sass-Gustkiewicz & Kwiecińska 1999, Karwowski et al. 2001). Preliminary tests using gas chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) and total organic carbon (TOC) measurements were carried out. First results show that studied samples (dopplerites, internal sediments and <b>sphalerites)</b> from various locations of the Silesian-Cracow Zn-Pb ore districts are organic matter-rich rocks/minerals. Dopplerite OM content varies from 35 % to over 50 % TOC, internal sediments contain up to 14 % TOC, while <b>sphalerites</b> usually have 0. 1 - 0. 2 % TOC (although there are some samples with over 1 % TOC). The contents of total sulfur (TS) are highly variable and depend on the degree of sulfides mineralization. For dopplerites, TS is in the range of 2 - 8 %, while the internal sediments usually containing more sulfur (5 - 20 % TS) because of their association with the ore minerals. The study of coaly matter extracts from the various localities of the Silesia-Cracow Zn-Pb ore districts using GC-MS revealed its immature nature. Although hopanes distribution differs quite considerably between samples, all of them contain hop- 13 (18) -ens, hop- 17 (21) -ens and 17 ß, 21 ß (H) -hopans compounds typical for an immature OM, unstable in temperature exceeded 50 - 60 °C (Karwowski et al. 2001). It is interesting, that the pilot investigations of OM using pyrolysis and off-line derivatization showed only the presence of small amounts of fatty acids, which did not confirm the proposed origin of these organic accumulations, according to which they were precipitated with humic acids due to the presence of Ca ions (Sass-Gustkiewicz & Kwiecinska 1999).

40|$|The Ruddock Creek {{property}} {{is located in}} the northern Monashee Mountains, southern British Columbia. The deposit is hosted by Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Mica Creek succession within the Windermere Supergroup. Structurally the Ruddock Creek {{property is}} interpreted to reside within the base of the Selkirk allochthon, in the immediate hanging wall of the Monashee décollement, a crustal-scale, northeast-directed thrust-sense shear zone. The Neoproterozoic strata have been complexly folded and transposed by Mesozoic deformation. U-Pb dates for deformational events range from ca. 116 to 63 Ma (63 Ma being the end of ductile deformation). The geometry of the main sulphide body indicates that the mineralized horizon was subject to all phases of deformation and was metamorphosed to amphibolite facies. Detrital zircon geochronology provides U-Pb ages that constrain the provenance for the host Windermere Supergroup, and define a maximum depositional age of ca. 663 Ma. The 663 Ma age is not common to the North American Cordillera, and is found almost exclusively in igneous rocks in central Idaho, suggesting south to north transportation of sediment along the Neoproterozoic rifted paleo-margin of western Laurentia. The 206 Pb/ 204 Pb isotope ages of galena, pyrite and pyrrhotite from several mineralized horizons that make up the Ruddock Creek deposit indicate an Early Cambrian, 535 ± 30 Ma model age of mineralization. Different colour <b>sphalerites</b> and calcite were analyzed to generate a Rb/Sr errorchron with an age of ore formation of 556 ± 420 Ma. Together the maximum age of deposition, the Pb isotope ages and the Rb/Sr errorchron reveal a spatial and temporal syngenetic relationship of the deposition of the Mica Creek succession within the Selkirk allochthon and the mineralized horizon at the Ruddock Creek property. Local basement topography, such as horst and graben structures resultant from rifting related to the final phase of breakup of Rodinia, may have focused fluid flow into carbonaceous host lithology at Ruddock Creek. Local structural and stratigraphic traps, hydrothermal fluids, as well as the redox state of the basinal brines, would ultimately have localized and controlled the precipitation of the sulphides...|$|R
40|$|The Pinguino deposit, {{located in}} the low {{sulfidation}} epithermal metallogenetical province of the Deseado Massif, Patagonia, Argentina, represents a distinct deposit type in the region. It evolved through two different mineralization events: an early In-bearing polymetallic event that introduced In, Zn, Pb, Ag, Cd, Au, As, Cu, Sn, W and Bi represented by complex sulfide mineralogy, and a late Ag-Au quartz-rich vein type that crosscut and overprints the early polymetallic mineralization. The indium-bearing polymetallic mineralization developed in three stages: an early Cu-Au-In-As-Sn-W-Bi stage (Ps(1)), a Zn-Pb-Ag-In-Cd-Sb stage (Ps(2)) and a late Zn-In-Cd (Ps(3)). Indium concentrations in the polymetallic veins show a wide range (3. 4 to 1, 184 ppm In). The highest indium values (up to 1, 184 ppm) relate to the Ps(2) mineralization stage, and are associated with Fe-rich <b>sphalerites,</b> although significant In enrichment (up to 159 ppm) is also present in the Ps(1) paragenesis associated with Sn-minerals (ferrokesterite and cassiterite). The hydrothermal alteration associated with the polymetallic mineralization is characterized by advanced argillic alteration within the immediate vein zone, and sericitic alteration enveloping the vein zone. Fluid inclusion studies indicate homogenisation temperatures of 308. 2 - 327 A degrees C for Ps(1) and 255 - 312. 4 A degrees C for Ps(2), and low to moderate salinities (2 to 5 eq. wt. % NaCl and 4 to 9 eq. wt. % NaCl, respectively). delta(34) S values of sulfide minerals (+ 0. 76 aEuro degrees to + 3. 61 aEuro degrees) indicate a possible magmatic source for the sulfur in the polymetallic mineralization while Pb isotope ratios for the sulfides and magmatic rocks ((206) Pb/(204) Pb, (207) Pb/(204) Pb and (208) Pb/(204) Pb ratios of 17. 379 to 18. 502; 15. 588 to 15. 730 and 38. 234 to 38. 756, respectively) {{are consistent with the}} possibility that the Pb reservoirs for both had the same crustal source. Spatial relationships, hydrothermal alteration styles, S and Pb isotopic data suggest a probable genetic relation between the polymetallic mineralization and dioritic intrusions that could have been the source of metals and hydrothermal fluids.

40|$|The pre-Cenozoic geology at Candelaria, Nevada {{comprises}} {{four main}} lithologic units: the basement consists of Ordovician cherts of the Palmetto complex; this is overlain unconformably by Permo-Triassic marine clastic sediments (Diablo and Candelaria Formations); these are structurally overlain by a serpentinitehosted tectonic mélange (Pickhandle/Golconda allochthon); all these units are cut by three Mesozoic felsic dike systems. Bulk-mineable silver-base metal ores occur as stratabound sheets of vein stockwork/disseminated sulphide mineralisation within structurally favourable zones along {{the base of}} the Pickhandle allochthon (i. e.

The most prominent felsic dike system — a suite of Early Jurassic granodiorite porphyries — exhibits close spatial, alteration and geochemical associations with the silver mineralisation. Disseminated pyrites from the bulk-mineable ores exhibit a δ 34 S range from — 0. 3 ‰ to + 12. 1 ‰ (mean δ 34 S = + 6. 4 ± 3. 5 ‰, 1 σ, n = 17) and two <b>sphalerites</b> have δ 34 S of + 5. 9 ‰ and + 8. 7 ‰ These data support a felsic magmatic source for sulphur in the ores, consistent with their proximal position in relation to the porphyries. However, a minor contribution of sulphur from diagenetic pyrite in the host Candelaria sediments (mean δ 34 S = — 14. 0 ‰) cannot be ruled out. Sulphur in late, localised barite veins (δ 34 S = + 17. 3 ‰ and + 17. 7 ‰) probably originated from a sedimentary/seawater source, in the form of bedded barite within the Palmetto basement (δ 34 S = + 18. 9 ‰). Quartz veins from the ores have mean δ 18 O = + 15. 9 ± 0. 8 ‰ (1 σ, n = 10), which is consistent, over the best estimate temperature range of the mineralisation (360 °– 460 °C), with deposition from 18 O-enriched magmatic-hydrothermal fluids (calculated δ 18 O fluid = + 9. 4 ‰ to + 13. 9 ‰). Such enrichment probably occurred through isotopic exchange with the basement cherts during fluid ascent from a source pluton. Whole rock data for a propylitised porphyry (δ 18 O = + 14. 2 ‰, δD = — 65 ‰) support a magmatic fluid source.

(<b>Sphalerite</b> (ZnS2), for example, is not uncommon in copper sulfide deposits, and the metal smelted would be brass, which is both harder and more durable than copper.) The metals could theoretically be separated out, but the alloys resulting were typically much stronger than the metals individually.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} iron, copper, arsenic and zinc ores such as arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, pyrite and {{chalcopyrite}} with <b>sphalerite,</b> are present as small veins and in quartz veins throughout north-trending shear zones that cut the iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. Dikes composed of quartz-feldspar porphyry run parallel to or lie within the shear zones and are {{cut by the}} mineralization. Chalcopyrite occupies later fractures which intersect massive arsenopyrite. Sparse quartz veins normally exist in or adjacent to the arsenopyrite-rich zones. Several northeast-trending deformation zones intersect pyroxenite of a mafic sill in northwest Strathy Township. Within these high-strain zones quartz veins normally contain chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite with exsolved pentlandite and traces of <b>sphalerite</b> and galena. Chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and pentlandite are deposited throughout shear zones which lack quartz veining. These zones are not known to contain large amounts of gold, although investigations are incomplete. It is also unknown if platinum group metals (which include platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium) exist in these zones because no searches for platinum group elements have been undertaken.|$|E
25|$|The {{mineralogy}} of VMS massive sulfide {{consists of}} over 90% iron sulfide, {{mainly in the}} form of pyrite, with chalcopyrite, <b>sphalerite</b> and galena also being major constituents. Magnetite is present in minor amounts; as magnetite content increases, the ores grade into massive oxide deposits. The gangue (the uneconomic waste material) is mainly quartz and pyrite or pyrrhotite. Due to the high density of the deposits some have marked gravity anomalies (Neves-Corvo, Portugal) which is of use in exploration.|$|E
25|$|Gallium is a {{relatively}} rare element in the Earth's crust and is not found in as many minerals as its lighter homologues. Its abundance on the Earth is a mere 0.0018% (18 ppm). Its production is very low compared to other elements, but has increased greatly {{over the years as}} extraction methods have improved. Gallium can be found as a trace in a variety of ores, including bauxite and <b>sphalerite,</b> and in such minerals as diaspore and germanite. Trace amounts have been found in coal as well.|$|E
25|$|As {{cleavage}} is {{a function}} of crystallography, {{there are a variety of}} cleavage types. Cleavage occurs typically in either one, two, three, four, or six directions. Basal cleavage in one direction is a distinctive property of the micas. Two-directional cleavage is described as prismatic, and occurs in minerals such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes. Minerals such as galena or halite have cubic (or isometric) cleavage in three directions, at 90°; when three directions of cleavage are present, but not at 90°, such as in calcite or rhodochrosite, it is termed rhombohedral cleavage. Octahedral cleavage (four directions) is present in fluorite and diamond, and <b>sphalerite</b> has six-directional dodecahedral cleavage.|$|E
25|$|Indium is {{the fourth}} element of the boron group but was {{discovered}} before the third, gallium, and after the fifth, thallium. In 1863 Ferdinand Reich and his assistant, Hieronymous Theodor Richter, were looking {{in a sample of}} the mineral zinc blende, also known as <b>sphalerite</b> (ZnS), for the spectroscopic lines of the newly discovered element thallium. Reich heated the ore in a coil of platinum metal and observed the lines that appeared in a spectroscope. Instead of the green thallium lines that he expected, he saw a new line of deep indigo-blue. Concluding that it must come from a new element, they named it after the characteristic indigo color it had produced.|$|E
