40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose to {{represent}} a scene as an abstraction of 'things'.

Where the recent successes and excitement of the field lie in object identification, we represent the scene composition independent of object identities. We make three contributions in this work. First, we study simple observable properties of 'things', and call it things syntax. Second, we propose translating the things syntax in linguistic abstract statements and study their descriptive effect to retrieve scenes. Thirdly, we propose querying of scenes with abstract block illustrations and study their effectiveness to discriminate among different types of scenes. The benefit of abstract statements and block illustrations is that we generate them directly from the images, without any learning beforehand as in the <b>standard</b> <b>attribute</b> learning. Surprisingly, we show that even though we use the simplest of features from 'things' layout and no learning at all, we can still retrieve scenes reasonably well...|$|E

Current grid security mechanisms support individual users who are members of well-defined virtual organizations. Recent research seeks to provide manageable grid security services for self-regulating, stable communities. Our prior work with component-based systems for grid computation demonstrated a need to support spontaneous, limited, short-lived collaborations. Such collaborations most often rely on shared or delegated fine grained access privileges to data and executable files as well as to grid compute resources. The mechanisms we are developing focus on the management and the enforcement of fine grained access rights. Our solution employs <b>standard</b> <b>attribute</b> certificates to bind rights to users (or their surrogates) and enables the high level management of such fine grained privileges which may be freely delegated, traded, and combined. Enforcement is provided by POSIX operating systems extensions that extend standard file permissions and regulate resource usage through access control lists. These extensions are available for common platforms and fully support legacy services. In combination, our privilege management and enforcement mechanisms are compatible with and enable the usage of fine-grained rights, leverage other work in the grid computing and security communities, reduce administrative costs to resource providers, enable ad-hoc collaboration through incremental trust relationships and can be used to provide improved security service to long-lived communities. 1...|$|E
40|$|PATTERNS OF THE ATTRIBUTE PHRASE IN DAUKŠA’S „POSTILĖ“ AND DIALECTAL TEXTS COMPILED BY ANTANAS BARANAUSKAS Summary The {{placement}} of the adjective, the participle and the genitive attribute in a noun phrase is very similar both in 1) „Punktai sakymų“ and Daukša’s „Postilė“ (postposition is more frequent; the influence of Latin and Polish is evident, {{especially in the case}} of the genitive pronoun) and 2) in Bretkūnas’ „Postilė“ and dialectal texts compiled by Baranauskas (preposition is more frequent; the {{placement of}} the genitive noun varies). Similar features could be found in „Punktai sakymų“ and dialectal texts. But the patterns of the attribute phrase constituents in Old Lithuanian differ in certain cases from those of Modern Lithuanian: (a) the position of the genitive attribute was less strictly determined in Old Lithuanian; (b) the adjective more frequently follows the head noun than in Modern Lithuanian; (c) the postposed genitive and the adjective attribute in some cases may have a more prominent stress only; (d) very often enclitics occupy second position in the sentence. These conclusions initiated further research into the attribute phrase (K. Lukauskas’ „Sermons” (18 th c.) and the didactic prose of the 19 th c.) because the data obtained did not reveal any change in the attribute phrase word order. Preliminary results enable us to put forward several hypotheses, the most important of these is as follows: in written works the <b>standard</b> <b>attribute</b> phrase with the preposed adjective and the postposed genitive noun (actually its placement was not determined) has been preserved for almost 300 years. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Biological {{sequences}} {{from different}} species are called orthologs if they {{evolved from a}} sequence of a common ancestor species {{and they have the}} same biological function. Approximations of Kolmogorov complexity or entropy of biological sequences are already well known to be useful in extracting similarity information between such sequences — in the interest, for example, of ortholog detection. As is well known, the exact Kolmogorov complexity is not algorithmically computable. In practice one can approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression methods do not provide a good approximation to Kolmogorov complexity for short sequences. Herein is suggested a new approach to overcome the problem that compression approximations may not work well on short sequences. This approach is inspired by new, conditional computations of Kolmogorov entropy. A main contribution of the empirical work described shows the new set of entropy-based machine learning attributes provides good separation between positive (ortholog) and negative (non-ortholog) data — better than with good, previously known alternatives (which do not employ some means to handle short sequences well). Also empirically compared are the new entropy based attribute set and a number of other, more standard similarity attributes sets commonly used in genomic analysis. The various similarity attributes are evaluated by cross validation, through boosted decision tree induction C 5. 0, and by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results point to the conclusion: the new, entropy based attribute set by itself is not the one giving the best prediction; however, it is the best attribute set for use in improving the other, <b>standard</b> <b>attribute</b> sets when conjoined with them.

40|$|U župnom uredu u Olibu prije nekoliko je godina pronađen zanimljiv srebrni {{fragment}} s prikazom svetice. Slijedom usporedbe sa srodnim liturgijskim predmetima utvrđuje se da je riječ o fragmentu ophodnoga križa s prikazom svetice zaštitnice olipske župe, sv. Stošije, koji je nekada bio pričvršćen u središtu njegova reversa, te se određuje njegova datacija u konac 14. st. Ikonografska je identifikacija prikazanoga lika, osim logikom mjesta nalaza, učvršćena i ikonografskom analizom prikaza sv. Stošije u romaničkoj i gotičkoj umjetnosti na području Zadra nastalih tijekom toga višestoljetnoga razdoblja, napose u zlatarstvu, te je na taj način utvrđen i svojevrstan evolutivni pomak u prikazivanju svetice koja je ujedno i zaštitnica Zadarske nadbiskupije. This paper discusses {{an interesting}} silver fragment showing {{an image of}} a saint which was found a few years ago in the rectory of the island of Olib. Based on a thorough comparison of the fragment with similar liturgical objects from the wider area of Zadar, especially with the processional cross from Vlašići (Pag), the authoress proposes that the fragment once belonged to a Gothic proccessional cross dating {{from the end of the}} 14 th century and that it was nailed as the middle part of its reverse side. The image of the saint depicted on this fragment is identified, based partly on the place of its discovery, with the patron saint of the parish of Olib, St. Anastasia. This identification is further strenghtened also by an iconographical analysis of various depictions of St. Ananstasia in Romanesque and Gothic art of Zadar and its area, especially in goldsmiths’ work of the time, where there are relatively many of her images considering that St. Anastasia was the patron saint of Zadar cathedral, where her relic was treasured for centuries, and also one of four main patron saints of this important Adriatic city. That analysis led to the conclusion that there was a certain evolutive change in the depiction of the saintly patroness during that era, and that, starting form our fragment and the end of the 14 th century, she is more often adorned with a book as her <b>standard</b> <b>attribute.</b> It was also noted that the image depicted on the Olib fragment may, perhaps, be identified with St. Catherine of Alexandria who was also often depicted with a book. Namely, she was the patron saint of a church in Novigrad, a small medieval town situated in the hinterland of Zadar, whence its inhabitants could have brought a whole cross, or solely this fragment, centuries after its making, as C. F. Bianchi recorded thet they brought to Olib a worshipped painting when fleeing from the Turks. This move of the local treasure from Novigrad to Olib in times of crisis and flight would thus coincide with the same practice of the move of the processional cross from Gorica to Pašman, as proposed by N. Jakšić. The stumbling stone of this theory is, of, course, the existence of the 14 th century processional cross in Novigrad, with very similar image of St. Catherine on its reverse. Although she is iconographically coherent with the saintly image on the fragment from Olib, it is rather difficult to explain the making of two similar processional crosses in such a short period of time, since the evident stylistic and tehnical differences between the two images allow only for a short time difference. On the other hand, if the saint on the Olib fragment indeed is St. Anastasia, this would mean that the parish church of Olib regularly refurbished its liturgical equipment during the period of less than two centuries, since one processional cross from Olib older than our fragment has also survived, still partly Romanesque in its morphology and iconography, as well as has survived the late 15 th century cross attributed to Toma Martinov, goldsmith from Zadar, whose style is already Rennaissance in many aspects. In course of the search for the images of St. Anastasia in the medieval goldsmiths’ work of Zadar it was also observed that the long established iconographical identification of the figures depicted on the luxurious bishop’s staff of the archbishop Maffeo Vallaresso (1460) has to be partially revised...|$|E
