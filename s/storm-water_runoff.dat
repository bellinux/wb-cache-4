50|$|The {{water in}} the Cheetham Wetlands is {{dependent}} on the pumping of water from Skeleton Creek. Pumping of water from the estuary must continue for the wetlands to flourish and maintain diversity in habitats as well as fauna species. Pollution of waterways and lakes is a real threat to the biodiversity of the parklands. Pollutants from sewage discharge points in Port Phillip Bay include elevated levels of Nitrogen. Other pollutants that need to be reduced come from <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff,</b> such as heavy metals, oils, and litter. There is also the potential threat of pollutants in runoff after heavy rainfall events, which can include biocides, sediments and nutrients. This can lead to blooms of blue-green algae if nutrient levels are high. Pumping of water from the Skeleton Creek during periods of high runoff may lead to the accumulation of these pollutants in the wetlands. Litter, especially plastics have the potential to harm or kill wildlife in the park and in the marine sanctuary as waterbirds and marine mammals often consume or get trapped in these plastic that don’t break down.|$|E
40|$|The town of Emerald Isle, {{located in}} North Carolina's Outer Banks, {{experiences}} significant <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff</b> and flooding problems {{during the fall}} and winter months. The topography of the island influences drainage patterns as well as the position of the water table. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine if the shallow groundwater system is responsible for <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff</b> on the island. Two hypotheses were developed to test the relationship between the water table and <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff.</b> The first hypothesis states: the water table rises above the land surface during periods of high precipitation, which leads to <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff</b> in the town. The second hypothesis states: low infiltration rates in the swales of the island impede water from recharging the Surficial aquifer. The first hypothesis was tested by monitoring the position of the water table in the Surficial aquifer over a 12 -month period using a network of 15 shallow groundwater monitoring wells. Potentiometric surface maps of the aquifer show that the water table does breach the land surface during storm events that produce at least 25 mm of precipitation. The second hypothesis was tested by conducting infiltrometer tests to determine if low infiltration rates were retarding natural recharge to the groundwater system. These tests reveal that the soils located in small portions of the swales have the lowest infiltration rates on the island, making it more likely for <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff</b> to be generated. A 3 D finite-difference groundwater model was then used to determine if pumping water from the aquifer during extreme storm events (e. g., hurricanes) would alleviate an elevated water table. Numerical and analytical modeling results suggest that pumping water from the aquifer may be impractical for the town to employ because it is only a short-term solution to the storm-water problem. Therefore, several structural best management practices (BMP's) are presented as alternative measures to reduce <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff.</b> These structural BMP's are ideal for the needs of the town, and they include bioretention, level spreader-vegetative filter strips, and infiltration basins/trenches.   M.

40|$|Operational {{inventory}} {{limits for}} {{the disposal of}} solid low-level waste in Slit Trenches 1 - 7 were established by the Special Analysis (SA) performed by Collard and Hamm (2008). To determine disposal limits for the Slit Trenches, the SA followed the methodology used in the 2008 PA (WSRC, 2008) which assumed that the inventories in each trench were instantaneously placed in 12 / 1995, which is the date when SLIT 1 began operation. The 2008 SA analyzed the impact from placing <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff</b> covers simultaneously over Slit Trenches 1 - 7 at 5, 10 and 15 years after the inventory was introduced. To include a measure of conservatism in the limits, the lowest of the limits calculated for any <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff</b> cover placement time or that calculated in the original 2008 PA {{was chosen as the}} operational limit for each radionuclide. Through the availability of funding provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff</b> covers were placed over Slit Trenches 1 - 5 in December 2010. SRNL was requested to perform a UDQE for this accelerated action. Table 1 below lists the operational dates for Slit Trenches 1 - 5 and the time elapsed between when the first waste package was disposed in each Slit Trench and when the <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff</b> covers were placed. As shown in Table 1, SLIT 1 was covered 15. 0 years after the date of the first waste package disposal. SLIT 2 was covered 9. 2 years after the date of the first waste package disposal in SLIT 2 which falls within the window of {+-} 1. 0 year within which the 2008 SA cover time analysis was assumed to be valid (Crowley and Butcher, 2008). Therefore, the analysis of SLIT 1 and SLIT 2 in the 2008 SA is considered adequate. However, the cover timings for SLIT 3, SLIT 4 and SLIT 5 are from 2. 2 to 1. 6 years beyond the nearest cover time of 5 years assumed in the 2008 SA analysis and fall outside of the acceptable one-year margin. Therefore, an additional study was conducted by Collard et al. (2011) that assessed the impact on Slit Trench performance from a covering date that is between 12 / 2010 and 9 / 2011. Accelerated placement of <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff</b> covers over Slit Trenches 1 - 5 put the cover timing outside of the range considered in the 2008 SA (Collard and Hamm, 2008) which establishes Slit Trench disposal limits. Results from a recent study (Collard et al., 2011) demonstrate that the actual cover installation in December 2010 produces acceptable Slit Trench performance. Additionally, covering Slit Trench 5 separately from Slit Trenches 6 and 7, which will be operationally closed at a later date, does not adversely affect performance of the operationally closed trenches...|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{quantities}} of nutrients in urban <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff</b> {{can lead to}} problems such as eutrophication in receiving water bodies. Accurate process based models are difficult to construct due to the vast array of complex phenomena affecting nutrient concentrations. Furthermore, it is often impossible to successfully apply process based models to catchments with limited or no sampling. This has created the need for simple models capable of predicting nutrient concentrations at unmonitored catchments. In this study, simple statistical models were constructed to predict six different types of nutrients present in urban storm-water runoff: ammonia (NH 3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total nitrogen, dissolved phosphorus, and total phosphorus. Models were constructed {{using data from the}} United States, collected {{as a part of the}} Nationwide Urban Stormwater Program more than two decades ago. Comparison between the models revealed that regression models were generally more applicable than the simple estimates of mean concentration from homogeneous subsets, separated based upon land use or the metropolitan area.

40|$|The {{degradation}} {{rates of}} three industrial wastes were evaluated under simulated land treatment conditions. A wood-preserving bottom sediment, <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff</b> impoundment sludge, and combined API-separator/slop-oil emulsion solid waste {{were applied to}} greenhouse boxes containing Norwood silt loam or Bastrop clay soils. Soil samples were collected before waste application and 0, 180, 360 and 540 days follow-ing application. Solvent extractable organic compounds were determined gravi-metrically, and a GC/MS/DS system was used to identify major extractable organic constituents. The most rapid degradation rate over a 360 day period was observed in the Bastrop soil amended with the combined API separator/slop-oil emulsion solid waste. The half-lives of the total extractable hydrocarbons ranged {{from a low of}} 217 days for the combined API waste in the Bastrop soil to a high of 340 days for the <b>storm-water</b> <b>runoff</b> waste in the Norwood soil. Major residual organic constituents in the waste amended soil after 60 days incubation included pentachlorophenol, fluoranthene, pyrene, dihydro acenaphthylene, cyclopenta phen-anthrene and trimethyl naphthalene.
