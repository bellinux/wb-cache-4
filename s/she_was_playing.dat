5|$|Focused on hockey, {{exposed to}} drugs and alcohol and {{frequently}} getting into fights, James {{paid little attention to}} her education and nearly dropped out of school. A vice-principal at Valley Park Middle School, Ross Dixon, encouraged her to pay greater attention to her studies, allowing her to graduate from Overlea High School, now named Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute, and move onto Seneca College in Toronto. James struggled academically in her first year at Seneca, partially because she had rarely been held accountable for failing in her studies in the past, and partly because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> two sports at both the college and community level while working part-time jobs to help pay the family's bills. Seneca's hockey coach Lee Trempe had several arguments with James before she began to take her studies seriously.|$|E

25|$|It was {{the music}} of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and the {{traditional}} songs of the folk revival of the early 1960s, however, that kindled Collins' interest and awoke in her a love of lyrics. Three years after her debut as a piano prodigy, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> guitar.

[...] In preparation for her role, Chopra wanted to visit a brothel, but Malhotra insisted that she doesn't for safety reasons.|$|E
