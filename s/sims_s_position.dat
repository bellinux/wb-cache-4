We hypothesize that <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> expression must be lost in premalignant lesions for breast cancer to develop. We first analyzed <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> in the involuting mammary gland, which is a highly tumorpromoting environment. <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> is down-regulated during involution, and forced expression delays involution. We then analyzed <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> expression in human breast cancer samples and found that <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> is lost with progression from DCIS to IDC, and this loss correlates with metastasis. <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> expression in DCIS promoted a differentiated phenotype and suppressed genes associated with de-differentiation. Furthermore, loss of <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> expression in DCIS xenografts increased metastasis likely due to an increase in hedgehog signaling and matrix metalloproteinase expression.

Furthermore, loss of <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> in breast cancer cells resulted in downregulation of epithelial markers and acquisition of a basal-like phenotype. The objective {{of this study was}} to further define the role of <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> in mammary differentiation. We found that <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> is developmentally regulated throughout mammary gland development with highest expression during lactation. Mammary glands from nulliparous mice expressing <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter were morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type mice but displayed hallmarks of precocious lactogenic differentiation. These included elevated expression of the milk protein genes Wap and Csn 2, and apical localization of the lactation marker Npt 2 b. Consistent with the in vivo results, <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> enhanced prolactin-mediated Csn 2 expression in HC 11 and CIT 3 mouse mammary epithelial cells, and downregulation of <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> by shRNA in HC 11 cells inhibited Csn 2 expression.

40|$|The {{short splice}} {{variant of the}} basic helix-loop-helix Per-Arnt-Sim {{transcription}} factor Singleminded- 2, <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s,</b> has been implicated in development and is frequently lost or reduced in primary breast tumors. Here, we show that loss of <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> causes aberrant mouse mammary gland ductal development with features suggestive of malignant transformation, including increased proliferation, loss of polarity, down-regulation of E-cadherin, and invasion of the surrounding stroma. Additionally, knockdown of <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> in MCF- 7 breast cancer cells contributed to an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased tumorigenesis. In both Sim 2 −/− mammary glands and SIM 2 s-depleted MCF 7 cells, these changes were associated with increased SLUG and MMP 2 levels. <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> protein was detectable on the SLUG promoter, and overexpression of <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> repressed expression from a SLUG-controlled reporter in a dose-dependent manner.

40|$|<b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> {{is a basic}} helix-loop-helix Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) {{transcription}} factor. In Drosophila, the Sim 2 homolog, sim, {{is necessary}} for cell fate determination during central nervous system (CNS) development. In mammals, both Sim 2 isoforms are involved in development of various tissues, including muscle, cartilage, and mammary gland. Loss-of-function studies revealed a role for <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> in specifying epithelial cell fate during mammary development and inhibiting growth and invasion of aggressive breast cancer cells. This study determined the role of <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> in mammary epithelial cell differentiation. Our hypothesis is that <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> is sufficient to promote lactogenic differentiation in vivo, characterized by expression of lactation-specific genes. Two models were used to test this hypothesis: (1) a transgenic mouse, expressing <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> under control of the MMTV-LTR, and (2) the mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC 11. Together, these models allow analysis {{of the effect of}} <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> on global mammary gland differentiation and the mechanism through which it accomplishes this in a relatively homogenous population of cells. We determined that precocious expression of <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> in vivo is associated with upregulation of a subset of milk protein genes in nulliparous females. During early pregnancy, <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> regulation of lactogenic differentiation extended to a larger group of genes. Following pup removal, <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> appears to promote survival of alveolar epithelial cells. In vitro, <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> expression is necessary for maximal Csn 2 expression, as determined by loss-of-function studies. Overexpression of <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> is sufficient to enhance prolactin-mediated Csn 2 expression.

40|$|Single-minded 2 (SIM 2), a class I basic Helix-Loop-Helix/PAS (bHLH/PAS) {{transcription}} factor, {{is essential}} for early development, and the short isoform (<b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s)</b> is selectively up-regulated in pancreatic and prostate tumours. Mechanistic roll(s) for SIM 2 that are essential for development and in these cancers is unknown, {{largely due to the}} fact that few bona fide target genes have been described for SIM 2. SIM 2 must heterodimerise with the obligate class II partner factor ARNT to regulate transcription. Surprisingly, these studies reveal SIM 2 plays a role in the regulation of the ARNT homologues, ARNT 1 and ARNT 2. Two nonexclusive mechanisms were identified; enhanced protein stabilisation, and the specific increased transcription of ARNT 2. The regulation of ARNT by a class I family member was found to be unique to the SIM homologues. These findings suggest novel insights into how elevated levels of <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> in tumours may confer increased transcriptional activities and/or increase the availability of the essential partner factor for other class I family members to promote their respective activities and functions in developmental and/or tumourigeneic processes. Furthermore, microarray studies in prostate DU 145 cells identified the pro-cell death gene, BNIP 3 (Bcl- 2 /adenovirus E 1 B 19 kDa interacting protein 3), as a novel target of <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> mediated repression. Further validation showed BNIP 3 repression in several prostate and pancreatic carcinoma derived cell lines with ectopic expression of human <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> via <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> activities at the proximal promoter hypoxia response element (HRE), the site through which bHLH/PAS family member, Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 α (HIF 1 α), induces BNIP 3. <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> attenuates BNIP 3 hypoxic induction via the HRE, and increased hypoxic induction of BNIP 3 occurs with siRNA knockdown of endogenous <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> in prostate PC 3 AR+ cells. BNIP 3 is implicated in hypoxia-induced cell-death processes. PC 3 AR+ cells expressing ectopic <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> have enhanced survival upon treatment with hypoxia mimetics, DP and DMOG. LC 3 -II protein levels fail to induce in PC 3 AR+/SIM 2 s DMOG and hypoxia treated cells, suggesting <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> may attenuate autophagic cell-death processes, perhaps via BNIP 3 repression. These data show, for the first time, <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> cross-talk on an endogenous HRE. <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> functional interference with HIF 1 α activities on BNIP 3 may indicate a novel role for <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> in promoting tumourigenesis. Moreover, SIM 2 expression has previously been implicated in the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway during mouse brain development. The Hh-pathway is known to promote pancreatic and prostate tumour growth, and these studies indicate that <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> is indeed implicated in promoting and/or maintaining Hh-signalling in cell lines of these cancer types. Likewise, aberrant Androgen Receptor (AR) -signalling is implicated in prostate tumour development, and androgen-independent AR activity is a hallmark of aggressive prostate cancer. Unexpectedly, <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> expression was found to up-regulate endogenous AR protein levels in prostate carcinoma PC 3 AR+ cells. Furthermore, <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> expression is associated with androgen-dependent wtAR-transcriptional responsiveness in these cells, and <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous AR in a hormone independent manner. Together these data suggest, for the first time, that <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> may function as a coactivator, and concomitant with enhancing AR levels, aid AR-signalling in prostate cancer cells. In summary, these studies sought to identify molecular mechanisms by which aberrant levels of <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> expression in solid tumours of the prostate and pancreas may promote tumour development. Several novel mechanisms for <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> activities were identified which implicate <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> in tumour processes. Namely <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> was found to be implicated in: 1) promoting pro-tumourigeneic Hh and AR signalling pathways 2) regulation of the common partner factor ARNT, and 3) attenuation of hypoxically-induced cell-death processes in tumour cells via the direct transcriptional repression of the novel <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> target gene, BNIP 3.

40|$|Single minded 2 (Sim 2) is {{a member}} of the basic helix-loop-helix Per-ARNT-Sim (Period-Arylhydrocarbon Nuclear Translocator-Single minded) family. Human SIM 2 is {{involved}} in the etiology of the Down?s phenotype. In addition to the physical and mental deficiencies associated with DS, it has become apparent that women with DS are 10 - 25 times less likely to develop breast cancer in comparison to age-matched normal populations. Such significant effects on breast cancer susceptibility are thought to result from gene dosage effects of one or more tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 21. Here we report the identification and transcriptional characterization of mouse <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s,</b> a splice variant of Sim 2, which is missing the carboxyl Pro/Ala-rich repressive domain. Similar to full-length Sim 2, <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> interacts with ARNT and to a lesser extent, ARNT 2. The effects of <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> on transcriptional regulation through hypoxia-, dioxin- and central midline response elements are different than that of full length Sim 2. Specifically, <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> exerts a less repressive effect on hypoxia-induced gene expression than full length Sim 2, but is just as effective as Sim 2 at repressing TCDD-induced gene expression from a dioxin response element. Interestingly, <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> binds to and activates expression from a central midline response element-controlled reporter through an ARNT transactivation domain-dependent mechanism. Forced expression of <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> in MDA-MB- 435 breast cancer cells significantly inhibited proliferation, reduced anchorage-independent growth, and decreased invasive potential. <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> directly decreased expression of matrix metalloprotease- 3, a known mediator of breast cancer metastasis. In addition, loss of Sim 2 in the mouse mammary gland increased ductal branching, accelerated lobuloalveolar-like precocious hyperplasia, and decreased cell apoptosis, suggesting that <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> is a mammary tumor suppressor. Sim 2 -/- mammary glands lose E-cadherin expression, suggesting that <b>Sim</b> 2 <b>s</b> plays a role in regulating E-cadherin/beta-catenin signaling. Loss of Sim 2 in the mammary glands also resulted in dramatically increased MMP 3 expression. The mechanism of SIM 2 smediated repression of MMP 3 was found to be due to its ability to inhibit AP- 1 binding to the MMP 3 promoter. These results suggest that <b>SIM</b> 2 <b>s</b> contributes to the breast cancer protective effects observed in DS individuals...|$|R

Methods: The sample consists of thirty patients with {{carcinoma of the}} uterine cervix, Stage II and III. Patients often feel discomfort in supine <b>position</b> (<b>S</b> <b>position)</b> when compared to lithotomy position (M position) due to relaxation of pelvic floor muscles after the insertion of applicator (tandem and ovoids) or before delivery of the treatment. Each patient was imaged with orthogonal X- ray radiographs simultaneously in two <b>positions,</b> i. e. <b>S</b> <b>position</b> and M position. Dwell time and dwell position pattern obtained from the optimized plan in <b>S</b> <b>position</b> was used to generate plan in M position.

Odometry estimation of rover position is only reliable over relatively short distances assuming no wheel slip, sinkage, etc. As the rover traverses, its onboard estimate of position in the current site frame accumulates errors and will need to be corrected on occasions via relocalization on the ground (mission operations). The procedure provides a systematic process for ground operators to localize the rover. The method focuses on analysis of acquired images used to declare a site frame and images acquired post-drive. Target selection is performed using two main steps. In the first step, the user identifies features of interest from the images used to declare the current site.
