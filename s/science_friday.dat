500|$|In an 18 August 2006 <b>Science</b> <b>Friday</b> interview, Mike Brown {{expressed}} {{doubt that}} a scientific definition was even necessary. He stated, [...] "The analogy that I {{always like to}} use is the word [...] "continent".

500|$|Whether an {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization would send humanity a decipherable message {{is a matter}} of debate in itself. Sagan argued that a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization would bear in mind that they were communicating with a relatively primitive one and therefore would try to ensure that the receiving civilization would be able to understand the message. Arguing against this view, astronomer Guillermo Lemarchand stated that {{an advanced}} civilization would probably encrypt a message with high information content, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, {{in order to ensure that}} only other ethically advanced civilizations would be able to understand it. Douglas Vakoch assumes it may take some time to decode any message, telling ABC News that [...] "I don't think we're going to understand immediately what they have to say." [...] “There’s going to be a lot of guesswork in trying to interpret another civilization," [...] he told <b>Science</b> <b>Friday,</b> adding that [...] "in some ways, any message we get from an extraterrestrial will be like a cosmic Rorschach ink blot test.” ...|$|E

[...] The answer you can expect is [...] "Professor Irwin Corey." [...] You’ll find his routines timeless humor.For an October 2011 interview, Corey invited a New York Times reporter to visit his 1840 carriage house on East 36th Street. Corey estimated its resale value at $3.5 million. He said that, when not performing, he panhandled for change from motorists exiting the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. Every few months, he told the interviewer, he donated the money to a group that purchased medical supplies for Cuban children. He said of the drivers who supplied the cash, [...] "I don’t tell them where the money’s going, and I’m sure they don’t care." [...] Irvin Arthur, Corey's agent for half a century, assured the reporter that Corey did not need the money for himself. [...] "This is not about money," [...] Arthur said. [...] "For Irwin, this is an extension of his performing." [...] In his memoir, Phoning Home, Jacob M. Appel cites a personal encounter with Corey on a street in New York City as the basis for his novel, The Man Who Wouldn't Stand Up.|$|R
