40|$|A {{modulator}} circuit board {{has recently been}} developed {{to be used in}} conjunction with a vector modulator to generate any {{of a large number of}} modulations for bandwidth-efficient radio transmission of digital data signals at rates than can exceed 100 Mb/s. The modulations include quadrature phaseshift keying (QPSK), offset quadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK), Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK), and octonary phase-shift keying (8 PSK) with square-root raised-cosine pulse shaping. The figure is a greatly simplified block diagram showing the relationship between the modulator board and the rest of the transmitter. The role of the modulator board is to encode the incoming data stream and to shape the resulting pulses, which are fed as inputs to the vector modulator. The combination of encoding and pulse shaping in a given application is chosen to maximize the bandwidth efficiency. The modulator board includes gallium arsenide <b>serial-to-parallel</b> <b>converters</b> at its input end. A complementary metal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) field-programmable gate array (FPGA) performs the coding and modulation computations and utilizes parallel processing in doing so.

40|$|Transitions on high {{capacitance}} busses in VLSI systems {{result in}} considerable power dissipation. Various coding schemes {{have been proposed}} in literature to encode the input signal {{in order to reduce}} the number of transitions. Number of transitions can be reduced by introducing redundancy in data transferred over the busses. For a given amount of redundancy there exists a lower bound on the average number of transitions. In this paper we de-rive a new coding scheme which leads to extremely practical tech-niques for bus transmission that reduce bus transitions to within 3 : 96 - 8 : 42 % of the lower bound depending on the redundancy em-ployed. There is also a net reduction in power dissipation rang-ing from 8 : 53 - 21 : 88 % over an uncoded bus transmission scheme. This savings in power dissipation is identical to that for bus-invert coding per word transmitted the higher efficiency brought about by codeword slimming, however, results in shorter codewords than bus-invert coding which in turn results in higher energy efficiency in word transmission. Applications suitable for this new tech-nique include systems relying on bit-serial implementation and systems with bit-parallel implementations where the cost of ex-tra parallel-to-serial and <b>serial-to-parallel</b> data-format <b>converters</b> is marginal compared to the power savings obtained. 1...|$|R

40|$|Although {{photonic}} {{devices have}} experienced a rapid development lately, there is still room for substantial improvements in performance. From a telecommunications perspective, improvements in speed, size, integration and power consumption are desired. There is also a general interest in photonic devices with new functionalities. Being a key component in fiber-optic systems, high-speed optical modulators often initiate the development towards higher bit-rates. The technology of current state-of-the-art modulators has matured suggesting new paths of development. In this thesis we investigate the potential of modulators based on intersubband (IS) transitions in quantum wells (QWs). Specific QW designs are suggested and complete modulator structures are simulated. IS absorption is also experimentally characterized. Absorption linewidth is critical for IS modulator performance since narrow linewidth implies high bandwidth and/or small driving voltage. High material quality is important, since linewidth is typically limited by well-width fluctuations and interface roughness. A mid-IR AlGaAs/GaAs-modulator is proposed having a RC-limited bandwidth of 130 GHz and a peak-to-peak voltage of 0. 9 V. Experimentally, Stark shift is measured in InAlAs/InAlGaAs/InGaAs step QWs at λ ~ 6 μm predicting that an IS modulator based on this material would have a bandwidth of 90 GHz and a peak-to-peak voltage of 0. 9 V. IS absorption at 1. 55 μm requires material combinations with high conduction-band offset. Simulations of an InGaAs/InAlAs/AlAsSb-modulator predict a bandwidth of 90 GHz and a peak-to-peak voltage of 2. 0 V. Experimental studies of IS absorption in AlN/GaN QWs are presented. IS absorption at 1. 5 - 3. 4 μm with linewidth below 100 meV is measured for well widths between 15 - 54 Å. Subpeaks corresponding to well-width fluctuations on the monolayer scale are identified with linewidths of ~ 60 meV. Agreement between theoretical calculations and measured spectra is encouraging. Theoretical simulations together with measured absorption linewidths suggest that high performance IS modulators operating at 1. 55 μm are realizable. Photonic devices with new functionalities are addressed by investigating electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) theoretically and considering potential applications based on EIT. Simulations of two-dimensional pulse-propagation based on the Maxwell-Bloch equations are performed {{with a focus on}} storing and reading out optical pulses. We explicitly formulate the phase-matching conditions for reading out stored pulses in a new direction and propose a <b>serial-to-parallel</b> <b>converter</b> based on this. For slow-light devices, e. g. optical buffers, we identify and analyze two main limitations on the medium bandwidth; the frequency dependent absorption and the group velocity dispersion. Since large bandwidth and large delay are contradictory requirements, the delay bandwidth product is considered. Analytical expressions are derived and analyzed and verified by simulations on pulse propagation. Insertion of parameters relevant for semiconductors indicates that development of materials with long coherence times are necessary for realizing optical buffers based on EIT. QC 2010090...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} and data rate of wireless communication {{have traditionally been}} limited {{by the presence of}} multipath fading in wireless channels. However, dramatic performance improvements can be obtained by the use of multiple transmit and receive antennas. Specifically, multiple antennas increase reliability by providing diversity gain, namely greater immunity to deep channel fades. They also increase data rates by providing multiplexing gain, i. e., the ability to multiplex multiple symbols in one signaling interval. Harvesting the potential benefits of multiple antennas requires the use of specially designed space-time codes at the transmitter front-end. Space-time codes introduce redundancy in the transmitted signal across two dimensions, namely multiple transmit antennas and multiple signaling intervals. In this work, we focus on linear space-time codes, which linearly combine the real and imaginary parts of their complex inputs to obtain transmit vectors for multiple signaling intervals. We aim to design optimum linear space-time codes. Optimality metrics and design principles for space-time codes are shown to depend strongly on the codes' function in the overall transmitter architecture. We consider two cases, depending on whether or not the space-time code is complemented by a powerful outer error-control code. In the absence of an outer code, the multiplexing gain of a space-time code is measured by its rate, while its diversity gain is measured by its raw diversity order. To maximize multiplexing and diversity gains, the space-time code must have maximum possible rate and raw diversity order. We show that there is an infinite set of maximum-rate codes, almost all of which also have maximum raw diversity order. However, different codes in this set have different error rate for a given input alphabet and SNR. Therefore, we develop analytical and numerical optimization techniques to find the code in this set which has the minimum union bound on error rate. Simulation results indicate that optimized codes yield significantly lower error rates than unoptimized codes, at the same data rate and SNR. In a concatenated architecture, a powerful outer code introduces redundancy in the space-time code inputs, obtaining additional diversity. Thus, the raw diversity order of the space-time inner code is only a lower limit to the total diversity order of the concatenated transmitter. On the other hand, we show that the rate of the space-time code places an upper limit on the multiplexing ability of the concatenated architecture. We conclude that space-time inner codes should have maximum possible rate but need not have high raw diversity order. In particular, the <b>serial-to-parallel</b> <b>converter,</b> which introduces no redundancy at all, is a near-optimum space-time inner code. This claim is supported by simulation results. On the receiver side, we generalize the well known sphere decoder to develop new detection algorithms for stand-alone space-time codes. These new algorithms are extended to obtain efficient soft-output decoding algorithms for space-time inner codes. Ph. D.
