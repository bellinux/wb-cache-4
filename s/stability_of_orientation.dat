40|$|Analysis of the timecourse of the {{orientation}} tuning of responses in {{primary visual cortex}} (V 1) can {{provide insight into the}} circuitry underlying tuning. Several studies have examined the temporal evolution of orientation selectivity in V 1 neurons, but there is no consensus regarding the <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>orientation</b> tuning properties over the timecourse of the response. We have used reverse-correlation analysis of the responses to dynamic grating stimuli to re-examine this issue in cat V 1 neurons. We find that the preferred orientation and tuning curve shape are stable in the majority of neurons; however, more than forty percent of cells show a significant change in either preferred orientation or tuning width between early and late portions of the response. To examine the influence of the local cortical circuit connectivity, we analyzed the timecourse of responses as a function of receptive field type, laminar position, and orientation map position. Simple cells are more selective, and reach peak selectivity earlier, than complex cells. There are pronounced laminar differences in the timing of responses: middle layer cells respond faster, deep layer cells have prolonged response decay, and superficial cells are intermediate in timing. The average timing of neurons near and far from pinwheel centers is similar, but there is more variability in the timecourse of responses near pinwheel centers. This result was reproduced in an established network model of V 1 operating in a regime of balanced excitatory and inhibitory recurrent connections, confirming previous results.

The present study investigates the methods of Veldpaus et al. [1988; Journal of Biomechanics 21, 45], Challis [1995; Biomechanics 28, 733] and Andriacchi et al. [1998; Journal of Biomedical Engineering 120, 743] for obtaining segment orientation parameters when segment markers ranged from well-defined to highly ill-conditioned depending on the symmetry of segment markers. A novel fourth approach is also presented that enabled comparisons of the root mean square error of reconstructed marker coordinates to verify that an optimal solution was obtained. No single method produced optimal results for all axis orientation parameters when reconstructing movement trials. The best performed was the method of Veldpaus et al.

The fourth approach presented provided a reliable method in all but the highly ill-conditioned markers, however implementation was computationally difficult.

40|$|Continuum neural field models {{mimic the}} large scale spatio-temporal {{dynamics}} of interacting neurons on a cortical surface. For smooth Mexican hat kernels, with short-range excitation and long-range inhibition, they support various localised structures {{as well as}} travelling waves similar to those seen in real cortex. These non-local models have been extensively studied, both analytically and numerically, yet there remain open challenges in their study. Here we provide new numerical and analytical treatments {{for the study of}} spatio-temporal pattern formation in neural field models. In this context, the description of spreading patterns with a well identified interface is of particular interest, as is their dependence on boundary conditions. This Thesis is dedicated to the analyses of one- and two-dimensional localised states as well as travelling waves in neural fields. Firstly we analyse the effects of Dirichlet boundary conditions on shaping and creating localised bumps in one- dimensional spatial models, and then on the development of labyrinthine structures in two spatial dimensions. Linear stability analysis is used to understand how spatially extended patterns may develop in the absence and presence of boundary conditions. For the case without boundary conditions we recover the results of Amari, namely the widest bump among two branches of solutions is stable. However, new stable solutions can arise with an imposed Dirichlet boundary condition. For a Heaviside non-linearity, the Amari model allows a description of solutions using an equivalent interface dynamics. We generalise this reduced, yet exact, description by deriving a normal velocity rule that can account for boundary conditions. We extend this approach to further treat neural field models with spike frequency adaptation. These can exhibit breathers and travelling waves. The latter can take the form of spiral waves, to which we devote particular attention. We further study neural fields on feature spaces in the primary visual cortex (V 1), where cells respond preferentially to edges of a particular orientation. Considering a general form of the synaptic kernel which includes an orientation preference at each spatial point, we present the construction and <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>orientation</b> bumps, as well as stripes. To date there has been surprisingly little analysis of spatio-temporal pattern formation in neural field equations described on curved surfaces. Finally, we study travelling fronts and pulses on non-flat geometries, where we consider the effects of inhomogeneities on the propagation velocity of these waves. In all sections, theoretical results for pattern formation are shown to be in excellent agreement with simulations of the full neural field models...|$|E
