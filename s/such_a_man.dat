5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Like ale, aloviti men led hail-producing and {{thunderstorm}} clouds: {{when the}} skies darkened, <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{would fall into}} a trance, and his spirit would fly out of his body toward the clouds as if his spirit were an ala herself. There was, however, a significant difference– he never led the clouds over the fields of his own village; the damage was done to the neighboring villages. In this respect, aloviti men are equivalent to zduhaći. Besides leading clouds away, an aloviti man could also fight against ale to protect his village. Children, too, could be aloviti, and they fought ale using plough beams. In these fights they were helped by the Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian), {{and for this reason}} people would not hurt these snakes.|$|E
5|$|Raurava (fearful or hell of rurus): As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana, it is {{assigned}} {{for a person}} who cares about his own and his family's good, but harms other living beings and is always envious of others. The living beings hurt by <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{take the form of}} savage serpent-like beasts called rurus and torture this person. The Vishnu Purana deems this hell fit for a false witness or one who lies.|$|E

5|$|The Roman army {{awarded a}} variety of {{individual}} decorations (dona) for valour to its legionaries. Hasta pura was a miniature spear; phalerae were large medal-like bronze or silver discs worn on the cuirass; armillae were bracelets worn on the wrist; and torques were worn round the neck, or on the cuirass. The highest awards were the coronae ("crowns"), of which the most prestigious was the corona civica, a crown made of oak-leaves awarded for saving {{the life of a}} Roman citizen in battle. The most valuable award was the corona muralis, a crown made of gold awarded to the first man to scale an enemy rampart. This was awarded rarely, as <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> hardly ever survived.|$|E
5|$|Victoria's {{youngest}} son, Leopold, {{was affected}} by the blood-clotting disease haemophilia B and two of her five daughters, Alice and Beatrice, were carriers. Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons, Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, and Infante Gonzalo of Spain. The presence of the disease in Victoria's descendants, but not in her ancestors, led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but a haemophiliac. There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria's mother, and as male carriers always suffer the disease, even if <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> had existed {{he would have been}} seriously ill. It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria's father was over 50 {{at the time of her}} conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers. Spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases.|$|E

John Hawkesworth and Alfred Shaughnessy wished an episode to revolve around Hannah Gordon's character Virginia, and Rosemary Anne Sisson wrote <b>Such</b> <b>A</b> Lovely <b>Man.</b> The character of Sir Guy Paynter was inspired by Sir Philip Sassoon, who was the Conservative Member of Parliament for Hythe from 1912 {{until his death in}} 1939, and cousin of Siegfried Sassoon.|$|R
25|$|Another {{instance}} of absurdist themes in Kierkegaard's work appears in The Sickness Unto Death, which Kierkegaard signed with pseudonym Anti-Climacus. Exploring {{the forms of}} despair, Kierkegaard examines the type of despair known as defiance. In the opening quotation reproduced {{at the beginning of}} the article, Kierkegaard describes how <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> would endure such a defiance and identifies the three major traits of the Absurd Man, later discussed by Albert Camus: a rejection of escaping existence (suicide), a rejection of help from a higher power and acceptance of his absurd (and despairing) condition.|$|E
25|$|Often {{food and}} {{clothing}} {{would be sent to}} the regiment from families back home, in care of a soldier returning from furlough; Private Matthews writes that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> would have to remain with them on the boxcars even after his leave had expired, to prevent them from being stolen. One such man was AWOL for two weeks while keeping an eye on some boxes shipped by families of soldiers from Eufaula, but when he was finally able to obtain transportation for himself and his cargo to the regiment, he was absolved of all charges and nothing further was said.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860 Democratic National Convention at Charleston, South Carolina, Butler {{initially}} supported John C. Breckinridge for President, {{but then}} shifted his support to Jefferson Davis, believing {{that only a}} moderate Southerner could keep the Democratic party from dividing. A conversation he had with Davis prior to the convention convinced him that Davis might be <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> and he gave him his support before the convention split over slavery. Butler ended up supporting Breckinridge over Douglas against state party instructions, ruining his standing with the state party apparatus. He was nominated for governor in the 1860 election by a Breckinridge splinter of the state party, but trailed far behind other candidates.|$|E

25|$|After Harrison's {{body was}} found, a $10,000 reward was placed for {{information}} about the abductor, which showed composite sketches of the perpetrator. None was arrested until two years later. In 1984, 44-year-old Robert Anthony Buell, employed by the state of Ohio, kidnapped a 28-year-old woman while she was working as a manager at an Ohio gas station in Damascus, Ohio. The woman's head was shaved, she was shocked with a severed electrical cord, beaten and was bound to Buell's bed and raped. She was able to escape, twelve hours later, fearing for her life, and ran to a nearby house and notified police after her attacker had left to go to work. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> had previously preyed on Ohio women, who were usually in their late twenties to forties.|$|E
25|$|Jon Birgerson was succeeded as {{archbishop}} by Eystein (Beatus Augustinus, 1158–88), previously royal {{secretary and}} treasurer, {{a man of}} brilliant intellect, strong will and deep piety. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> was then needed to defend the liberty of the Catholic Church against the encroachments of King Sverre, who wished to make the Church a mere tool of the temporal power. The archbishop was compelled to flee from Norway to England until {{he was able to}} return, and a sort of reconciliation took place later between him and the king. But on Eystein's death Sverre renewed his attacks, and Archbishop Eric had to leave the country and take refuge with Archbishop Absalon of Lund. At last, when Sverre attacked the papal legate, Pope Innocent III laid the king and his partisans under interdict.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E

500|$|In the mid-afternoon of 30 April, Hitler shot himself. After Hitler's suicide, Goebbels was depressed. Voss later recounted Goebbels as saying: [...] "It {{is a great}} pity that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> is {{not with}} us any longer. But {{there is nothing to}} be done. For us, {{everything}} is lost now and the only way out left for us is the one which Hitler chose. I shall follow his example." ...|$|E
500|$|Balzac {{believed}} that the July Monarchy had brought a wave of poor leadership, and that people of quality and integrity were scorned {{in the name of}} cronyism. Marcas, a prime example of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> is doomed to fail in the government of Louis-Philippe. Those in power were blind to the valuable minds being lost in their midst, as the students discover early in the story: [...] ("we were amazed at the brutal indifference of the authorities to everything connected with intellect, thought, and poetry"). Marcas' personal woes– and his tales of life within the corridors of power– strongly reinforce this view.|$|E

[...] On the other hand, Knight's name spread among Singaporeans as the man who brought Adrian Lim to justice, boosting his career. [...] He handled more high-profile cases, and became the director of the Commercial Affairs Department in 1984. [...] He would maintain his good reputation until his conviction for corruption seven years later.|$|E

500|$|Gul Panag was {{impressed}} with Kukunoor's previous film, Rockford (1999) and her constant correspondence with him fetched her the role of Zeenat. Kukunoor felt that Panag had characteristics of someone who was lean and fit, good height, large frame, and with an appropriate skin tone. After a successful audition, she was chosen for the character that she felt was a difficult one to portray. Critiquing the actress with [...] "I see urgency, pain but no sadness" [...] and [...] "I see anger and vulnerability but no guilt", the director pushed Panag to her limits. She felt that Kukunoor was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of conviction that he constantly forgot to eat and this once caused him a stomach infection. Gul Panag, on the other hand, said that her role was very multi-dimensional, multi-layered and hence it was quite tough to play the character. She said that Kukunoor helped her in defining her character with ease and said, [...] "Nagesh looked at the minutest detail and was an immense support to me as an actor." [...] However, Dor's executive producer, Elahe Hiptoola lent her voice for Panag in the film.|$|E
500|$|A vetrenjak {{from the}} village of Trlić had {{reportedly}} claimed that he clashed with oxen and rams led by devils whose aim was to discharge hail over his village. Seeing hail clouds, people in Tamnava would shout, [...] "Keep your cattle out of our crops!" [...] Thus they addressed hanged and drowned persons who were imagined to fly before the clouds and lead them. Farmers avoided leaving a harrow on the field, as they thought that the hail-bringing devils could slam it on the head of the vetrenjak who defended the village. People behaved amicably toward vetrenjaks, but they warned their children to keep off from them, as these men had [...] "business with devils". In 2004, ethnographers interviewed elderly people in a group of hamlets south-west of the town of Valjevo, who defined the vetrenjak as a man able to direct the movement of clouds. When <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> died, the wind would suddenly start to blow and clouds would loom. The term vetrenjak also designated a man who could fly invisible, which he usually did by night. He was born with a caul which was thrown away and eaten by birds.|$|E
500|$|Shelley's biographies {{begin by}} {{describing}} the author, offering examples of their writings {{in the original}} language and in translation, and end by summarising their [...] "beauties and defects". She also discusses the problems of writing biography itself, engaging in a written dialogue with the theories of her now-dead father. In [...] "Of History and Romance" [...] Godwin had written that for the genius, [...] "I am not contented to observe <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> upon the public stage, I would follow him into his closet. I would see the friend {{and the father of}} a family, as well as the patriot". Shelley and Godwin had seen the negative effects of this approach when Godwin published Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798), his biography of Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft. Its frank description of Wollstonecraft's affairs and suicide attempts shocked the public and sullied her reputation. Shelley criticises this technique in her biographies, concerned that such works perpetuate [...] "follies". She is even more concerned that often an absence of information regarding a particular writer is interpreted as evidence that the writer was insignificant.|$|E
