25|$|Consolidation is {{a process}} by which soils {{decrease}} in volume. It occurs when stress is applied to a soil that causes the soil particles to pack together more tightly, therefore reducing volume. When this occurs in a soil that is saturated with water, water will be squeezed out of the soil. The time required to squeeze {{the water out of}} a thick deposit of clayey <b>soil</b> <b>layer</b> might be years. For a layer of sand, the water may be squeezed out in a matter of seconds. A building foundation or construction of a new embankment will cause the soil below to consolidate and this will cause settlement which in turn may cause distress to the building or embankment. Karl Terzaghi developed the theory of consolidation which enables prediction of the amount of settlement and the time required for the settlement to occur. Soils are tested with an oedometer test to determine their compression index and coefficient of consolidation.|$|E
25|$|The 1985 Mexico City {{earthquake}} of September 19, 1985 is a {{good example}} of earthquake damage to a modern city built on soft sediment. Though the earthquake epicenter was located around 350km from the city, the sites with soft clay deposits exhibited a huge amplification of ground motion resulting in severe damage. Mexico City is built on a thick layer of soft soil over a hard stratum. The western part of the city is located on the edge of an old lakebed, whereas, soft clay deposits filling the former lakebed underline the eastern part. In the lake bed area, the soft clay deposits have shear wave velocities ranging from 40 to 90m/s and the underlying hard strata has a shear wave velocity in the range 500m/s or greater. During the earthquake of 1985, the seismic waves were trapped in the soft strata. The soft <b>soil</b> <b>layer</b> allowed the upward propagating shear waves to propagate easily; however, the hard strata at the bottom acted like a reflector and bounced back the downward propagating waves. This kind of trapping of waves created a resonance and consequently resulted in an enormous amplification of the ground motion. As a result, the lake bed area suffered catastrophic damage; however, in the southwest part of the city, ground motions were moderate and building damage was minor. The acceleration recorded in the hill-zones were relatively low-amplitude, short period ground motions compared to high amplitude and long period ground motions recorded at stations located in the lake zone.|$|E

To study the temporal stability of SWS and identify representative locations in diverse <b>soil</b> <b>layers,</b> an analysis of temporal stability was performed using Spearman rank correlation coefficients and relative differences. From July 2008 to October 2010, the SWS of three <b>soil</b> <b>layers</b> (0 - 1, 1 - 2, and 2 - 3 m) were measured using a neutron probe at 91 locations on a hillslope on the Loess Plateau, China. A total of 20 SWS datasets were collected over the period of measurement. The results showed that the variability of SWS decreased over time and increased over space with the increase in soil depth. High Spearman rank correlation coefficients (p< 0. 01) indicated a strong temporal stability of spatial patterns for all <b>soil</b> <b>layers.</b> Temporal stability increased with increasing soil depth. Furthermore, the closer two <b>soil</b> <b>layers</b> were within a given profile and the deeper any two adjacent <b>soil</b> <b>layers</b> were, the more similar were the temporal patterns. A significant negative correlation (p< 0. 01) existed between the status of soil moisture and temporal stability, and the dependency increased with soil depth. With increasing soil depth, more locations were able to estimate the mean SWS of the area. None, however, represented the mean values for all three <b>soil</b> <b>layers</b> separately.

30|$|In {{relation}} to the high ground water salinity levels {{in the region as}} reported by Monjerezi et al.

The source of high salt accumulation in the upper <b>soil</b> <b>layers</b> in the aforementioned blocks could therefore not be attributed to the groundwater intrusion in the root-zone depth.

This study will give us a conclusion about ground water contamination from solid waste and sewage water. The study was performed on two soil samples brought from Jericho and Talkarem. The physical and chemical properties of the two soil samples were analyzed. The experiment was studied using physical simulation by using different soil column techniques and making some estimation using the amount of rainfall each year and the dimensions of those columns. The study was conducted between April and May, 2009. The concentration of BOD in the leachate was found to increase with time in both types of soil, in April the BOD concentration was higher in the leachate from Jericho soil than Talkarem soil, but in May the BOD concentration was higher in Talkarem soil than Jericho soil. The concentration of BOD in the leachate collected from blank column was decreasing with time, the dissolved oxygen (DO) was decreasing with increasing BOD concentration in both soils. The total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration in the leachate was decreasing in both soils with time.
