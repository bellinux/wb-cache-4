Feed consumption and feed conversion ratio of these treatments were statistically lower than other treatment groups. Furthermore, production index and percentage of mortality was better than other treatment groups. Likewise, viscera% and abdominal fat% remained significantly constant in all treatment groups. But the cost of feed per unit of live body weight was lower in the treatment receiving diluted diets in all three stages of their growing period...|$|R
