Ten years later Leskov conceded that, while the story itself was mostly based on real facts, the end of it was made up. What happened in reality he revealed in Chapter 41 of The Pechersk Antics set of memoir sketches. As my story The Sealed Angel appeared in Katkov's The Russian Messenger, some periodicals, condescendingly giving me credit for having some talent, stressed the fact that such a story had indeed taken place - in the times when the Kiev bridge (the old one, obviously) was being constructed. The story, mind you, is that of an icon [...] "sealed" [...] by officials so as to be transferred to an Orthodox monastery, and of a group of Old Believers, those to whom it belonged, which retrieved the icon by replacing it with another, during the Easter Matins. This feat involved another one: a man crossed the river over <b>stretched</b> <b>chain,</b> in times of violent ice break-up. … The setting of The Sealed Angel... is indeed reminiscent of Kiev, which can be explained by my being rather used to Kiev backdrops. But no Old Believer man has ever crossed Dnieper by chain with an icon. What did happen in reality - a stonemason from Kaluga - and chains indeed have been stretched already, - made it over Dnieper to the Chernigov bank during the Easter morning service, walking a chain like a tightrope. It was not, though, an icon that he'd made this venture for, but vodka which in those times sold much cheeper on the Chernigov side. With a barrel of vodka hung down his neck and armed with a pole for maintaining balance, this intrepid traveler indeed safely walked a chain over to Kiev side with his cargo which has been promptly consumed by his comrades, in celebration of the Easter. This brave expedition has indeed taken place and I used the fact in the story to highlight the Russian prowess, but since the goal of the expedition had been different, The Seal Angel is, of course, fiction.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} of {{numerical}} self-consistent field (SCF) calculations for the equilibrium mechanical unfolding of a globule formed {{by a single}} flexible polymer chain collapsed in a poor solvent. In accordance with earlier scaling theory and stochastic dynamics simulations findings we have identified three regimes of extensional deformation: (i) a linear response regime characterized by a weakly elongated (ellipsoidal) shape of the globule at small deformations, (ii) a tadpole structure with a globular "head" coexisting with a stretched "tail" at intermediate ranges of deformations, and (iii) an uniformly <b>stretched</b> <b>chain</b> at strong extensions. The conformational transition from the tadpole to the <b>stretched</b> <b>chain</b> is accompanied by an abrupt unfolding of the depleted globular head and a corresponding jump-wise drop in the intrachain tension. The unfolding-refolding cycle demonstrates a hysteresis loop {{in the vicinity of}} the transition point. These three regimes of deformation, as well as the first-order like transition between the tadpole and the <b>stretched</b> <b>chain</b> conformations, can be experimentally observable provided that the number of monomer units in the chain is large and/or the solvent quality is sufficiently poor. For short chains, on the other hand, under moderately poor solvent strength conditions, the unfolding transition is continuous. Upon an increase in the imposed end-to-end distance the extended globule retains a longitudinally uniform shape at any degree of deformation. In all cases the system exhibits a negative extensional modulus in the intermediate range of deformations. We anticipate that predicted patterns in force-deformation curves for polymer molecules in poor solvent can be observed in single molecule atomic spectroscopy experiments.

40|$|The {{microscopic}} {{model of}} semi-crystalline polymer in high-elastic state is proposed.

The key factor that stalls the phase transition below the melting temperature is the tension of the SCS. External stress applied to the polymer also shifts the equilibrium and causes unfolding of the nuclei, which enables large reversible deformation of the polymer without loss of integrity. The simple 1 D model predicts plateau in stress-strain curve of high-elastic polymer above the yield stress, which agrees with experimental observations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{develop a}} theory of the {{adsorption}} of many polyampholyte chains on a charged surface. The adsorption {{is due to the}} polarization of polyampholyte chains in the external electric field created by the charged surface. The equilibrium polymer density profile is determined by balancing the long-range polarization-induced attraction of polyampholytes to the charged surface and the three-body repulsion between monomers in a ı-solvent for the polymer backbone (or the two-body repulsion in a good solvent). We demonstrate that the long-range nature of polyampholyte adsorption can lead to an adsorbed layer much thicker than the size of individual chains. Adsorbed polyampholytes that do not touch the surface form a multibrush of <b>stretched</b> <b>chains.</b> The chains that touch the surface form a self-similar <b>stretched</b> pseudobrush. Polyampholyte <b>chains</b> carrying the net charge of the same sign as that of the surface can also adsorb. In this case, the adsorption stops at that distance from the surface where the electrostatic repulsion between polyampholytes and a similarly charged surface becomes stronger than the polarization-induced attraction. The thickness of the adsorbed layer and the surface coverage decrease with increasing net charge on polyampholytes. The effect of added salt on polyampholyte adsorption is also discussed. 1...|$|R

We observed that both static and dynamic properties are significantly affected by the addition of even a small quantity of polymer. The large increment of the rotational viscosity coefficient may be explained in the framework of a model of anisotropic dumbell, due to F. Brochard. These viscoelastic effects are compared to analogous measurements obtained in the case of solutions of side-chain polymers.

Adopting also a Flory-Huggins equation of state for the local chemical potential, we obtain monomer density profiles and chain-end density distributions under various solvent conditions. We use an analytic self-consistent field approximation for long, highly stretched chains, as developed by Milner, Witten and Cates (Macromolecules 21 (1988) 2610), who found a parabolic density profile for brushes at « moderate densities » in a good solvent.

The extension ratio is determined by the entanglement length, and the characteristic length of <b>stretched</b> <b>chain</b> segments in the polymer craze is N_e/ 3. In the craze, tension is mostly carried by the covalent backbone bonds, and the force distribution develops an exponential tail at large tensile forces.

We find that the distributions of homogeneous chains of two conformations are very different: there are two independent peaks in hairpin distribution; while only one peak is observed in the distribution of secondary structure conformations.
