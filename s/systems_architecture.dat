25|$|The Exploration <b>Systems</b> <b>Architecture</b> Study {{concluded}} that the cost and safety of the Ares was superior to that of either of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELVs). The cost estimates {{in the study were}} {{based on the assumption that}} new launch pads would be needed for human-rated EELVs. The facilities for the current EELVs (LC-37 for Delta IV, LC-41 for Atlas V) are in place and could be modified, but this may not have been the most cost effective solution as LC-37 is a contractor owned and operated (COGO) facility and modifications for the Delta IV H were determined to be similar to those required for Ares I. The ESAS launch safety estimates for the Ares were based on the Space Shuttle, despite the differences, and included only launches after the post-Challenger Space Shuttle redesign. The estimate counted each Shuttle launch as two safe launches of the Ares booster. The safety of the Atlas V and Delta IV was estimated from the failure rates of all Delta II, Atlas-Centaur, and Titan launches since 1992, although they are not similar designs.|$|E

The atomic information <b>system</b> <b>architecture's</b> role and applied the patterns are of crucial importance for the implementation phase of the complex business transformation projects; where these patterns can be adapted in a just-in-time manner, using atomic building blocks 1, 2, 26.

40|$|<b>System</b> <b>architecture</b> {{is defined}} as the {{description}} of a complex system in terms of its functional requirements, physical elements and their interrelationships. Designing a complex <b>system</b> <b>architecture</b> can be a difficult task involving multi-faceted trade-off decisions. The <b>system</b> <b>architecture</b> designs often have many project-specific goals involving mix of quantitative and qualitative criteria and a large design trade space. Several tools and methods have been developed to support the <b>system</b> <b>architecture</b> design process in the last few decades. However, many conventional problem solving techniques face difficulties in dealing with complex system design problems having many goals. In this research work, an interactive multi-criteria design optimization framework is proposed for solving many-objective <b>system</b> <b>architecture</b> design problems and generating a well distributed set of Pareto optimal solutions for these problems. <b>System</b> <b>architecture</b> design using multi-criteria optimization is demonstrated using a real-world application of an aero engine health management (EHM) system. A design process is presented for the optimal deployment of the EHM system functional operations over physical architecture subsystems. The EHM <b>system</b> <b>architecture</b> design problem is formulated as a multi-criteria optimization problem. The proposed methodology successfully generates a well distributed family of Pareto optimal architecture solutions for the EHM system, which provides valuable insights into the design trade-offs. Uncertainty analysis is implemented using an efficient polynomial chaos approach and robust architecture solutions are obtained for the EHM <b>system</b> <b>architecture</b> design. Performance assessment through evaluation of benchmark test metrics demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed methodology...|$|R
