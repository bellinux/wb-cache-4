40|$|The <b>stereometric</b> <b>camera</b> was {{designed}} for close-range techniques in biostereometrics. The camera focusing distance of 360 mm to infinity covers a broad field of close-range photogrammetry. The design provides for a separate unit for the lens system and interchangeable backs on the camera {{for the use of}} single frame film exposure, roll-type film cassettes, or glass plates. The system incorporates the use of a surface contrast optical projector...|$|E

Since the definition of " 3 D vision" is inaccurately referred to as the simple perspective of an object, it is required to add the word stereo so that " 3 D stereo vision " shall stand for "three-dimensional view" and,therefore, measure the width, height and depth of the surveyed image. Thanks {{to the development of a}} stereo metric model, either real or virtual, through the "materialization", either real or virtual, of the optical-stereo metric model made visible with a stereoscope. It is feasible a continuous on line updating of the cultural heritage with the help of photogrammetry and stereometric modelling.
