40|$|This report gives {{guidance}} for summarizing and evaluating field studies with non-target arthropods. Plant protection products can cause harmful effects on non-target organisms. A guidance document {{has been developed}} for ensuring that the test results required for the registration of pesticides be supplied in a uniform and transparent manner. This document is specifically directed at experiments with non-target arthropods, living on the soil surface or on the vegetation, for example on arable land or in orchards. With this dossier Ctgb assesses whether a certain use of a plant protection product is allowed in the Netherlands. Complex and extensive information concerning field studies with non-target arthropods {{can be part of}} the dossier. In the Netherlands, these reports are evaluated by different evaluating institutes. Potential differences in the evaluator’s methodology may lead to a lack of uniformity in the form and content of the <b>summaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations</b> <b>and</b> – occasionally – in the conclusions. This was the reason for Ctgb to ask for standardization of the <b>summaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> of field studies with non-target arthropods. Apart from the guidance, the report contains two elaborated examples of evaluating reports and recommendations {{for the use of the}} results of a particular field study for the risk assessment. This concerns, for example, the extrapolation of the results of a particular field study in a particular crop and region to the crop and region relevant for the registration...|$|R
