5|$|This method {{worked well}} for digging soft dirt and gravel near the street surface. However, {{tunnelling}} shields were required for deeper sections, such as the Harlem and East River tunnels, which used <b>cast-iron</b> <b>tubes.</b> Rock or concrete-lined tunnels were used on segments from 33rd to 42nd streets under Park Avenue; 116th to 120th Streets under Broadway; 145th to Dyckman Streets (Fort George) under Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue; and 96th Street and Broadway to Central Park North and Lenox Avenue.|$|R

50|$|The Beaux-Arts {{terminal}} {{opened with}} its first train service on July 19, 1909, marking the {{first use of}} the Downtown Hudson Tubes, and closed in 1971, when the World Trade Center-Port Authority Trans Hudson railroad station opened. The station was located at 30 Church Street, east of the current PATH terminal. The building was mostly demolished by 1972. Some portions of the track level {{became part of the}} PATH station. The last remnant of the station, a <b>cast-iron</b> <b>tube</b> in the slurry wall of the site's foundation, was demolished in 2008.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to undertakings at home Bateman carried out several works abroad. In 1869 in a pamphlet Channel Railway, written with Julian John Révy, {{he proposed to}} construct a submarine railway between France and England in a <b>cast-iron</b> <b>tube.</b> In the same year he represented the Royal Society {{at the opening of}} the Suez Canal, and wrote a report of his visit, which was read to the Society on 6 January 1870, and published in the Proceedings. In winter 1870 he visited Buenos Aires, at the request of the Argentine government, for the purpose of laying out harbour works for that city. His plans were not adopted, but he was employed to design and carry out drainage and water supply works for the city.|$|R
500|$|The High Street {{station was}} part of a three-stop {{extension}} of the IND Eighth Avenue Line from Chambers Street in Lower Manhattan to Jay Street–Borough Hall in Downtown Brooklyn. Construction of the extension began in June 1928. Due to the station's proximity to the Cranberry Street Tunnel under the East River, instead of typical cut-and-cover (or open-cut) construction methods, the station site was constructed [...] below the street (the tunnel is [...] below the surface at its lowest point) using mining techniques. The station was built between the eastern ends of the <b>cast-iron</b> river <b>tubes</b> reinforced with cement, leading to its tubular design. The depth of the station meant that few buildings in the area would be disturbed or demolished, except for two structures along Cranberry Street between Henry Street and Old Fulton Street.|$|R

Construction of the extension began in June 1928. Due to the station's proximity to the Cranberry Street Tunnel under the East River, instead of typical cut-and-cover (or open-cut) construction methods, the station site was constructed 70 ft below the street (the tunnel is 90 ft below the surface at its lowest point) using mining techniques.

5000|$|Attracted by the {{possibilities}} of the [...] "Silent Knight" [...] engine, Daimler's chairman had contacted Knight in Chicago and Knight settled in England near Coventry in 1907. Daimler contracted Dr. Frederick Lanchester as their consultant for the purpose and a major re-design and refinement of Knight's design took place in great secrecy. Knight's design was made a practical proposition. When unveiled in September 1908, the new engine caused a sensation. [...] "Suffice {{it to say that}} mushroom valves, springs and cams, and many small parts, are swept away bodily, that we have an almost perfectly spherical explosion chamber, and a <b>cast-iron</b> sleeve or <b>tube</b> as that portion of the combustion chamber in which the piston travels." [...] Daimler dropped poppet-valve engines altogether and kept their silent sleeve-valve engines until the mid-1930s.|$|R
