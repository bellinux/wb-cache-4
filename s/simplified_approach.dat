25|$|Holoxica has successfuly {{demonstrated}} {{several generations}} of holographic video displays. The technical approach advocates a <b>simplified</b> <b>approach</b> by starting with basic building blocks and scaling towards higher resolution and performance. The first-generation holographic display demonstrator, built in 2010, had up to nine voxels and could show simple numeric information, icons, symbology etc. This technology {{can be used to}} build segmented 3D displays, similar to the early segmented LCDs found in calculators and clocks. The second-generation display was announced in 2013. This is a planar Head-Up Display (HUD) with hundreds of thousands voxels and freeform images floating in mid-air that can change in real time. Interactivity is added with a Kinect motion sensor that allows you to 'touch' icons in free space and 'draw' in mid-air. The third generation display builds upon the previous generations to create a volumetric display. The images are bright and visible under indoor lighting conditions, and the approach is scalable, leveraging existing manufacturing techniques and components.|$|E

40|$|Capacity credits {{are widely}} used to {{quantify}} the ability of different generating technologies to support demand. Most practical capacity credit calculations are based on detailed risk modelling, however {{a wide range of}} <b>simplified</b> <b>approaches</b> are also in use. This paper presents a critical review of these <b>simplified</b> <b>approaches,</b> ranging from annual peak calculations and probabilistic representations of wind, to closed-form expressions derived for small installed wind capacities. The principal themes are that simplified methods must retain the key features of the problem at hand, and that to be of interest simplified methods must either bring substantial computational advantages, or provide additional insight beyond that from a more detailed risk calculation...|$|R

40|$|Two {{simplified}} {{versions of}} a numerical life cycle model for diazotrophic cyanobacteria (of the order Nostocales) are developed and evaluated. Both consider two life cycle stages, one growing, nitrogen-fixing stage and one stage that combines the resting, germinating and vegetative stages. The versions differ in the vertical resolution of the non-diazotrophic stage: version 1 collects the biomass in one layer at the bottom, version 2 considers sinking and rising of biomass explicitly. The results of the two versions are compared with a complex cyanobacteria life cycle model which describes four different life cycle stages each with two internal quotas for energy and nitrogen. The two <b>simplified</b> <b>approaches</b> show a good agreement {{with respect to the}} main characteristics of cyanobacteria dynamics (timing and duration of blooms, magnitude of nitrogen fixation, interannual variability). Our model study shows that both <b>simplified</b> <b>approaches</b> are suitable to be implemented into three-dimensional coastal or lake models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
