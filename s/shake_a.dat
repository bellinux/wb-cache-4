5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to <b>shake</b> <b>a</b> bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{aggregate}} {{in large}} numbers (>20 individuals) under rocks and logs along the immediate edge of the breeding sites and breed explosively over a few days. Suitable breeding sites include small fish-free ponds, marshes, shallow lakes and other still-water wetlands. Like other ambystomatid salamanders, they have evolved a characteristic courtship dance where they rub bodies and release pheromones from their chin gland prior to assuming a copulatory mating position. Once in position, the male deposits a spermatophore, which is a gooey stalk tipped with a packet of sperm, and walks the female forward to be inseminated. Males may mate more than once and may deposit as many as 15 spermatophores {{over the course of}} a five-hour period. The courtship dance for the long-toed salamander is similar to other species of Ambystoma and very similar to A.jeffersonianum. In the long-toed salamander, there is no rubbing or head-butting; the males directly approach females and grab on, while the females try to rapidly swim away. The males clasp the female from behind the forelimbs and <b>shake,</b> <b>a</b> behavior called amplexus. Males sometimes clasp other amphibian species during breeding and shake them as well. The male only grabs with the front limbs and never uses his hind limbs during the courtship dance as he rubs his chin side to side pressing down on the female's head. The female struggles but later becomes subdued. Males increase the tempo and motions, rubbing over the female's nostrils, sides, and sometimes the vent. When the female becomes quite docile the male moves forward with his tail positioned over her head, raised, and waving at the tip. If the female accepts the males courtship, the male directs her snout toward his vent region while both move forward stiffly with pelvic undulations. As the female follows, the male stops and deposits a spermatophore, and the female will move forward with the male to raise her tail and receive the sperm packet. The full courtship dance is rarely accomplished in the first attempt. Females deposit their eggs a few days after mating.|$|E

25|$|Einstein {{acknowledged}} {{the controversy over}} his derivation in his 1907 survey paper on special relativity. There he notes that it is problematic to rely on Maxwell's equations for the heuristic mass–energy argument. The argument in his 1905 paper {{can be carried out}} with the emission of any massless particles, but the Maxwell equations are implicitly used to make it obvious that the emission of light in particular can be achieved only by doing work. To emit electromagnetic waves, {{all you have to do}} is <b>shake</b> <b>a</b> charged particle, and this is clearly doing work, so that the emission is of energy.|$|E
25|$|The series {{centers on}} the surreal adventures and antics of three {{anthropomorphic}} fast food items: Master <b>Shake,</b> <b>a</b> selfish, pathological lying milkshake; Frylock, an intelligent, well-meaning box of French fries; and Meatwad, a shapeshifting, simple-minded ball of ground meat. They live together as roommates, and rarely get along with their human neighbor Carl Brutananadilewski, a balding, middle-aged, sex-crazed sports fanatic. The main protagonists also interact with various villains or other individuals in each episode; these interactions are often restricted to one episode, as minor characters rarely reappear in following episodes. Some episodes feature the main protagonists interacting with celebrities (such as adult film actress Tera Patrick) and occasionally with historical figures and professional athletes (such as Bart Oates or John Kruk).|$|E

Mac MacEntire of DVD Verdict wrote that the establishing shots in Vegas were the episode's highlights.

The subsequent conversation between Kurt and Finn in the locker room was described by Canning as [...] "one of the truest moments of the season so far". Votta wrote, [...] "Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith often shine together in scenes, especially one-on-one, and this is no exception." [...] Another duo that reviewers complimented was Mercedes and Sam. Futterman, while she criticized the episode for setting [...] "its scope too wide", credited their storyline as the [...] "only one played out strongly enough through dialogue and song". Votta stated that [...] "Glee is getting more romantic tension mileage out of this duo than you can <b>shake</b> <b>a</b> stick at, and it's delicious, especially with Valentine's around the corner", and Canning noted that their week-long verbal silence [...] "helped build their relationship into something we care more about". Chaney, however, could not see the sense in Mercedes bringing Sam with her [...] "to see Miss Pillsbury to sort out her conflicted feelings for Sam and Shane".|$|E
500|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{described}} Makoto Yuki {{as being}} an initially [...] "ambivalent, broken character" [...] and added that the character's growth took center stage in the film. He also remarked that the film could have [...] "been a very dark, difficult-to-see movie" [...] since the majority of it takes place at night but praised the lighting effects and contrasts which rendered the action easily visible while creating a [...] "visual style all its own". On the flip side, Eisenbeis explained that while the movie covers only {{the very beginning of}} the Persona 3 story, there was [...] "the unfortunate side effect of a good chunk of the main cast and the majority of the antagonists not even being in the movie." [...] Adding that since none of the game's key plot twists are reached, he felt that it was [...] "a very simple, straight-forward movie." [...] Eisenbeis also noted that the film had [...] "more images of teen suicide than you can <b>shake</b> <b>a</b> stick at". The [...] "Evokers" [...] which in the Persona 3 world allowed the characters to summon Personas by putting one to their heads and pulling the trigger, were likened to guns in this context. Despite not being actual weapons, Eisenbeis stated that [...] "it still looks like they are blowing their brains out — often complete with spiritual brain and skull fragments." ...|$|E

500|$|When Cisneros {{describes}} the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas, {{the theme of}} place often emerges. Place refers not only to her novels' geographic locations, {{but also to the}} positions her characters hold within their social context. Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo-dominated and male-dominated places where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home. As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ramón Saldívar have described, the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas where they are subjugated to the will of male heads-of-household, {{or in the case of}} their own home, it can be an empowering place where they can act autonomously and express themselves creatively. In The House on Mango Street the young protagonist, Esperanza, longs to have her own house: [...] "Not a flat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's house. Not a daddy's. A house all my own. With my porch and my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. My books and my stories. My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody to <b>shake</b> <b>a</b> stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after." [...] An aspiring writer, Esperanza yearns for [...] "a space for myself to go, clean as paper before the poem." [...] She feels discontented and trapped in her family home, and witnesses other women in the same position. According to Saldívar, Cisneros communicates through this character that a woman needs her own place in order to realize her full potential—a home which is not a site of patriarchal violence, but instead [...] "a site of poetic self-creation." [...] One source of conflict and grief for Cisneros's Chicana characters is that the male-dominated society in which they live denies them this place. Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros's work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf's famous essay [...] "A Room of One's Own", that [...] "a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction," [...] or put another way, [...] "economic security" [...] and personal liberty are necessary for [...] "artistic production." ...|$|E
500|$|NPR writer Linda Holmes {{challenged}} the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself [...] "silly {{and full of}} bad dialogue" [...] and [...] "cheesy more than offensive", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that [...] "you can <b>shake</b> <b>a</b> Bunny tail and be empowered, no argument. It depends on what's {{going on in the}} rest of your life. But shaking a Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment if {{you have to go to}} Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time you have a problem, and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage." [...] The series, she concluded, might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement. In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, [...] "The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors—no gum chewing, constant smiling—wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe." [...] Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that [...] "The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they are nice to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninterestingm calling it a [...] "bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once." [...] Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that [...] "the truth is [...] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame." ...|$|E
