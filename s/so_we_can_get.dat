Nora Ephron stated at one question and answer session: [...] "We keep re-casting it <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> really great actresses to come for four weeks. It is really hard to get really good people to work Off-Broadway for six months {{because it does not}} pay much, but you can get them for four weeks." [...] Other well-known actresses who have performed in the Off-Broadway production include the following: Carol Kane, Debra Monk, Janeane Garofalo, Fran Drescher, Melissa Joan Hart, Brooke Shields, Victoria Clark, Tovah Feldshuh, Loretta Swit, Mary Testa, Nikki Blonsky, Donna McKecknie, B. Smith and Marla Maples. , it was the second-longest running show in the history of Westside Theatre.|$|E

Rachel and Blaine's duet of [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] was called [...] "the best number of the episode" [...] by VanDerWerff.

Harper, while she characterized it as a [...] "really cute duet", said she was [...] "not super-keen on seeing them pair up again". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair was even less enthusiastic, and gave it two stars out of five.|$|E
