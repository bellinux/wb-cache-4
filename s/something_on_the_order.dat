25|$|Settlement was sparse {{during the}} colonial period and {{transportation}} was severely limited by lack of improved roads. Towns were located on or near the coasts or navigable inland waterways. Even on improved roads, which were rare {{during the colonial}} period, wagon transport was very expensive. Economical distance for transporting low value agricultural commodities to navigable waterways varied but was limited to <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of less than 25 miles. In the few small cities and among the larger plantations of South Carolina, and Virginia, some necessities and virtually all luxuries were imported in return for tobacco, rice, and indigo exports.|$|E
500|$|Through late 1964 Bell was {{considering}} {{the role of}} an X-ray-armed Zeus missile in the Nike-X system. A January 1965 report outlines this possibility, noting that it would have to have a much larger warhead dedicated to the production of X-rays, and would have to operate at higher altitudes to maximize the effect. A major advantage was that accuracy needs were much reduced, from a minimum of about [...] for the original Zeus' neutron-based attack, to <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of a few miles. This meant that the range limits of the original Zeus, which were defined by the accuracy of the radars to about , were greatly eased. This, in turn, meant that a less sophisticated radar could be used, one with accuracy on the order of a mile rather than feet, which could be built much less expensively using VHF parts.|$|E

Since 2000, at least $106 million of the $204 million promised to Austin and smaller cities such as Manor and Leander. At the same time, however, it was spending more than $300 million on commuter rail, park-and-ride lots, a new maintenance and operations center, and other facilities. As the Great Recession spread to Austin in 2009, tax revenues dried up and Capital Metro had to stop payment on a $51 million loan owed to Austin as part of a 2001 agreement.|$|E

The introductory price for orders placed before January 1995 was $18,900 with the smallest engine.

50|$|The {{committee}} analyzed Richter's {{work and}} published separate {{reports on the}} topic on 15 September. Balseiro, in particular, was convinced nothing nuclear was taking place. His report critiques Richter's claims about how the system is supposed to work, especially the claims that the system was reaching the temperatures needed to demonstrate fusion; he stated that fusion reactions would require <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of 40 million kelvin, while {{the center of the}} electric arc would be perhaps 4,000 to 100,000 kelvin at the most. He then pointed out that Richter's radiation detectors showed large activity whenever the arc was discharged, even if there was no fuel present. Meanwhile, the team's own detectors showed low activity throughout. They reported their findings to Perón on 15 February.|$|E
50|$|In the {{traditional}} tokamak design, the confinement magnets are normally arranged outside a {{toroidal vacuum chamber}} holding the plasma. This chamber {{is known as the}} first wall, and defines the minimum distance between the magnets and plasma. In a production design, another layer, the blanket, sits between the first wall and magnets. The blanket serves two purposes, one is to protect the magnets from the high energy neutrons, which will damage them, and the other is to use those neutrons to breed tritium from lithium, producing more fuel for the reactor. However, this arrangement means there is considerable distance between the magnets and plasma, in most designs <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of a meter or more. This places significant limits on the achievable aspect ratio.|$|E
