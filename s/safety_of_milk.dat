In addition, spoiled milk is danger to health: infant mortality rate was lower in cities that had monitored milk production and sale. The Association was established in 1911 based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and there were 35 members. One of the members was from Canada, and one from Australia; the rest were from the US.

Opponents of pasteurization argue that unpasteurized milk has benefits associated with superior taste, nutritional qualities and certain health benefits over pasteurized milk. While pasteurization of milk kills off bacterial pathogens, other bacteria species with possible health benefits are also destroyed. Pasteurization of cow's milk initially destroys any potential pathogens and increases the shelf life, but eventually results in spoilage that makes it unsuitable for consumption. This causes it to assume an unpleasant odor, and the milk is deemed non-consumable due to unpleasant taste and {{an increased risk of}} food poisoning. In raw milk, the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, under suitable conditions, ferments the lactose present to lactic acid. The increasing acidity in turn prevents the growth of other organisms, or slows their growth significantly. During pasteurization, however, these lactic acid bacteria are mostly destroyed. A 2009 systematic review of the food safety of unpasteurized milk concluded that science-based data to substantiate claims of health benefits [...] "are lacking or do not exist" [...] and the risks associated with disease outbreaks as a result of raw milk consumption are [...] "considerably higher".|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to analyze}} the factors that {{influence}} urban consumers' attitudes towards food safety after the melamine scandal.

Findings – The findings suggest that: first, there is a common concern among consumers about the <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> powder after the melamine scandal; second, according to the research, the concern is in inverse relation to the level of educational attainment, consumers' awareness of food safety incidents and their opinion of governments' action after the incident.

The milk samples collected from the selected farms were poured in to 6 calabash and 6 plastic containers each with 200 ml of milk. The milk poured in to the untreated plastic and calabash containers were used as control group. Organoleptic tastes like odor and taste as well as physical attributes like temperature and pH were carried out. Standard plate count and coliform count were used for bacterial load determination. Herbal plants namely Olea europaea L, Vernonia amygdalina, Solanum schimperianum hochst, Acacia etbaica schweinf, Aoe elegans were used for milk fumigation. The data obtained were analyzed using SPSS Statistical software version 17. 0 (descriptive analysis (frequency), mean comparison T independent test, General leaner model multifactorial repeated two way ANOVA) analysis method were applied.

40|$|The {{quality and}} <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> raw cow’s <b>milk</b> is very {{important}} for dairy companies and consumers <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> products. Due to the methods of production, it is impossible to completely eliminate contamination <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> with microorganisms, therefore the microbial content <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> is a major feature in determining its quality. Other important factors to consider include somatic cells count, veterinary drug residues, milk composition and freezing point. Somatic cells represent the udder health and can be used for monitoring of subclinical mastitis. A high level of somatic cells can increase proteolysis in milk which affects technological processes. Veterinary drugs administered to cows may lead to residues in the milk which are harmful to humans. The content of fat, protein and solids-non- fat are the main indicators used by dairies for technological purposes. In this article we discuss the quality and <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> raw cow’s <b>milk</b> in Slovakia during 2011. We found that 73. 53 % of samples tested for somatic cell count, and 84. 54 % of samples tested for total bacterial count, met the European Union legislation limits.

Researchers studied 75 cattle farms belonging to three Rural Production Societies (RPS; rural cooperatives) : RPS Grijalva (RPS-G: n = 35), RPS Pomarroza (RPS-P: n = 22) and RPS Malpaso (RPS-M: n = 18). For this, researchers used as a guide the multi-criteria methodology of the Organic Livestock Proximity Index (OLPI) proposed by Mena adapting it to suit the purposes. In the current study, researchers designed a new OLPI with 35 variables which integrate 10 indicators. Information was obtained through direct observation and a questionnaire applied to producers.
