40|$|OBJECTIVE—A new {{parametric}} simulation procedure {{based on}} the negative binomial (NB) model {{was used to evaluate}} the sample sizes needed to achieve optimal <b>statistical</b> <b>powers</b> for parallel groups (with (PGB) and without (PG) a baseline correction scan). It was also used for baseline versus treatment (BVT) design clinical trials in relapsing-remitting (RR) and secondary progressive (SP) multiple sclerosis (MS), when using the number of new enhancing lesions seen on monthly MRI of the brain as the measure of outcome.  METHODS—MRI data obtained from 120 untreated patients with RRMS selected for the presence of MRI activity at baseline, 66 untreated and unselected patients with RRMS, and 81 untreated and unselected patients with SPMS were fitted using an NB distribution. All these patients were scanned monthly for at least 6 months and were all from the placebo arms of three large scale clinical trials and one natural history study. The <b>statistical</b> <b>powers</b> were calculated for durations of follow up of 3 and 6 months.  RESULTS—The frequency of new enhancing lesions in patients with SPMS was lower, but not significantly different, from that seen in unselected patients with RRMS. As expected, enhancement was more frequent in patients with RRMS selected for MRI activity at baseline than in the other two patient groups. As a consequence, the estimated sample sizes needed to detect treatment efficacy in selected patients with RRMS were smaller than those of unselected patients with RRMS and those with SPMS. Baseline correction was also seen to reduce the sample sizes of PG design trials. An increased number of scans reduced the sample sizes needed to perform BVT trials, whereas the gain in power was less evident in PG and PGB trials.  CONCLUSION—This study provides reliable estimates of the sample sizes needed to perform MRI monitored clinical trials in the major MS clinical phenotypes, which should be useful for planning future studies. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} {{the association between}} tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and duodenal ulcer (DU), but the results remain inconclusive. The {{aim of this study}} was to perform a meta-analysis to investigate a more authentic association between TNF-α SNPs and DU. METHODS: We performed the meta-analysis by searching PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from the first available year to Sep. 5, 2012. Additionally, checking reference lists from identified articles, reviews, and the abstracts presented at related scientific societies meetings were also performed. All case-control studies investigating the association between TNF-α SNPs and DU risk were included. The association was assessed by odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Publication bias was analyzed by Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression test. RESULTS: A total of sixteen studies reporting TNF-α - 308 G/A, - 1031 T/C, - 863 C/A, - 857 C/T, and - 238 G/A polymorphism were included in our final meta-analysis. There was no statistically significant association between - 308 G/A polymorphism and DU in the overall study population, as well as subgroup analyses by ethnicity, study design, and H. pylori status. As for - 1031 T/C, - 863 C/A, - 857 C/T, and - 238 G/A, results of our meta-analyses showed no statistical evidence of significant association. Power calculation on the combined sample size showed that the <b>statistical</b> <b>powers</b> were all lower than 80 % for all the meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggests that there is no statistical evidence of significant association between the studied TNF-α SNPs and DU. However, this conclusion should be interpreted with caution as low <b>statistical</b> <b>powers</b> were revealed by power calculations. In future, larger sample-size studies with homogeneous DU patients and well-matched controls are required...|$|R

Therefore we clarify that ANOM should rather {{be regarded as a}} special case of a much more universal approach known as multiple contrast tests (MCTs). Perceiving ANOM as a grand-mean-type MCT paves the way for implementing it in the opensource software R. We give a brief tutorial on how to exploit R's versatility and introduce R package ANOM for drawing the familiar decision charts. Beyond that, we illustrate two practical aspects of data analysis with ANOM: rstly, we compare merits and drawbacks of ANOM-type MCTs and ANOVA F-test and assess their respective <b>statistical</b> <b>powers,</b> and secondly, we show that the benet of using critical values from multivariate t-distributions for ANOM instead of simple Bonferroni quantiles is oftentimes negligible...|$|R
25|$|The {{true power}} of STR {{analysis}} {{is in its}} <b>statistical</b> <b>power</b> of discrimination. Because the 20 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are independently assorted (having {{a certain number of}} repeats at one locus does not change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the product rule for probabilities can be applied. This means that, if someone has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, we can say that the probability of having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1x1018) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches. Moreover, since there are about 12 million monozygotic twins on Earth, the theoretical probability is not accurate.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in fMRI signal {{in response to}} a stimulus is additive. This means that the amplitude of the hemodynamic response (HDR) increases when multiple stimuli are presented in rapid succession. When each block is alternated with a rest condition in which the HDR has enough time to return to baseline, a maximum amount of variability is introduced in the signal. As such, we conclude that block designs offer considerable <b>statistical</b> <b>power.</b> There are however severe drawbacks to this method, as the signal is very sensitive to signal drift, such as head motion, especially when only a few blocks are used. Another limiting factor is a poor choice of baseline, as it may prevent meaningful conclusions from being drawn. There are also problems with many tasks lacking the ability to be repeated. Since within each block only one condition is presented, randomization of stimulus types is not possible within a block. This makes the type of stimulus within each block very predictable. As a consequence, participants may become aware of the order of the events.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{these results}} of increased proportions of people seropositive for the parasite {{in cases of}} these neurological disorders do not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between the infection and disorder. It {{is also important to}} mention that in 2016 a population-representative birth cohort study which was done, to test a hypothesis that toxoplasmosis is related to impairment in brain and behaviour measured by a range of phenotypes including neuropsychiatric disorders, poor impulse control, personality and neurocognitive deficits. The results of this study did not support the results in the previously mentioned studies, more than marginally. None of the P-values showed significance for any outcome measure. Thus, according to this study, the presence of T. gondii antibodies is not correlated to increase susceptibility to any of the behaviour phenotypes (except possibly to a higher rate of unsuccessful attempted suicide). This team did not observe any significant association between T. gondii serpositivity and schizophrenia. The team notes that the null findings might be a false negative due to low <b>statistical</b> <b>power</b> because of small sample sizes, but against this weights that their set-up should avoid some possibilities for errors in the about 40 studies that did show a positive correlation.

Besides, confining our analyses to HWE-compliant studies did not materially alter the outcomes in all genetic models; (iii) overall methodological quality (determined by CB) of the included studies was high; (iv) aggregate case/control totals for rs 12722 and rs 13946 show that the significant findings from these two polymorphisms have <b>statistical</b> <b>powers</b> of 99 % and 96 %, respectively; (v) all controls were defined as healthy; (vi) most (75 %) tissue sources were blood; (vii) all controls were matched with cases, with 88 % based on age; and (viii) sensitivity treatment deemed the significant outcomes to be robust.|$|R
40|$|Fault {{detection}} and isolation (FDI) in automotive diesel engines {{is important in}} order to achieve and guarantee low exhaust emissions, high vehicle uptime, and efficient repair and maintenance. This paper illustrates how a set of general methods for model-based sequential residual generation and data-driven statistical residual evaluation can be combined into an automated design methodology. The automated design methodology is then utilized to create a complete FDI-system for an automotive diesel engine. The performance of the obtained FDI-system is evaluated using measurements from road drives and engine test-bed experiments. The overall performance of the FDI-system is good in relation to the required design effort. In particular no specific tuning of the FDI-system, or any adaption of the design methodology, was needed. It is illustrated how estimations of the <b>statistical</b> <b>powers</b> of the fault detection tests in the FDI-system can be used to further increase the performance, specifically in terms of fault isolability.

25|$|Controversial {{results from}} one study {{suggested}} that traumatic experiences might produce an epigenetic signal that {{is capable of}} being passed to future generations. Mice were trained, using foot shocks, to fear a cherry blossom odor. The investigators reported that the mouse offspring had an increased aversion to this specific odor. They suggested epigenetic changes that increase gene expression, rather than in DNA itself, in a gene, M71, that governs the functioning of an odor receptor in the nose that responds specifically to this cherry blossom smell. There were physical changes that correlated with olfactory (smell) function in the brains of the trained mice and their descendants. Several criticisms were reported, including the study's low <b>statistical</b> <b>power</b> as evidence of some irregularity such as bias in reporting results. Due to limits of sample size, there is a probability that an effect will not be demonstrated to within statistical significance even if it exists. The criticism suggested that the probability that all the experiments reported would show positive results if an identical protocol was followed, assuming the claimed effects exist, is merely 0.4%. The authors also did not indicate which mice were siblings, and treated all of the mice as statistically independent. The original researchers pointed out negative results in the paper's appendix that the criticism omitted in its calculations, and undertook to track which mice were siblings in the future.|$|E

Around the year 2000, prior to the introduction of GWA studies, the primary method of investigation was through inheritance studies of genetic linkage in families. This approach had proven highly useful towards single gene disorders. However, for common and complex diseases the results of genetic linkage studies proved hard to reproduce.
