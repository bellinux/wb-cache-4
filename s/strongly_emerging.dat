5000|$|The text is {{important}} {{as it is}} one of the earliest Srautasutras, next to that of the Vadhula sub-school of the Taittiriyas, which was situated a little further west than the Baudhayanas. Both belong to the late Brahmana period and share late Vedic [...] "southeastern" [...] grammatical peculiarities with the Madhyandinas, Kanvas and Jaiminiyas. Both schools (as well as some other early Sutras) agree in incorporating a number of Brahmana passages in their text. They also have some unusual similarities in quoting Mantras. However, the BSS is most important in that it clearly shows the first steps taken by late Vedic ritualists towards the Sutra style, with ever increasing degree of conciseness, culminating in the minimal style of the Katyayana Srautasutra and the short formulas of Pāṇini. This feature has been overlooked until Makoto Fushimi showed, in his recent Harvard thesis (2007), the many separate devices that were used by the Baudhayanas in creating a Sutra. They include, among others, certain 'headwords' that indicate and thus abbreviate the description of a certain ritual action or rite, and they also include a new classification of all Shrauta rituals. The result is uneven: the BSS is still a Shrautasutra in progress. In an appendix section it also discusses the opinions of ritual specialists other than Baudhayana, who is then quoted as well.It has been argued that the composition of the BSS was due to the desire of 'eastern' Vedic kings, such as those of <b>strongly</b> <b>emerging</b> Kosala and Videha, to establish proper Vedic rituals in their non-Vedic territory [...] The same orthoprax development is seen in the redaction in Kosala or Videha of the Vajasaneyi Samhita with its western three-tone recitation, as compared to its source, the two-tone Shatapatha Brahmana.|$|E

40|$|Panpsychism is {{the view}} that {{physical}} objects possess phenomenal properties. According to this view, {{as well as their}} more familiar properties such as shape, size and charge, the ‘essence’ of physical matter partly consists of mental properties at a fundamental level. The view shows great promise for providing a solution to Chalmers’ hard problem of consciousness. It will be made clear that the reasons that motivate one to adopt panpsychism are compelling. By accepting panpsychism we can recognise the world possesses micro-phenomenal properties and from here it seems we have the beginnings of how consciousness arises in our universe. -/- Many contemporary panpsychists subscribe to ‘constitutive panpsychism’. Drawing on ‘the combination problem’, I will argue that this form of the doctrine is untenable. The central claim of the piece is that ‘strong emergentist panpsychism’ should be adopted in its place. There is empirical evidence for the existence of strongly emergent properties in biochemical systems. If it is intelligible to hold that non-experiential properties can <b>strongly</b> <b>emerge</b> from (more basic) non-experiential properties, it is equally intelligible to hold that experiential properties can <b>strongly</b> <b>emerge</b> from (more basic) experiential properties. The intelligibility of strong phenomenal emergence will thus be established. This will demonstrate that strong emergentist panpsychism can provide a defendable, and a highly plausible solution to the hard problem of consciousness. Website: www. thepanpsychist. co...|$|R

But early March, after two weeks at the Folies-Bergere, moved on to the Folies-Wagram. Avoiding Paul Derval for the next three months, she appeared with Marie Dubas dancing in the finale of the first act with tall and graceful, slim ankles, shapely well molded thighs, willowy but well developed body covered in the right proportion of blue ostrich feathers. But the rumors of her affair with the Spanish Monarch began to resurface, when her German film was released in on April 12. The Spanish government offered the German producers $187, 000 to destroy the film, or at least prevent it from appearing in France and Spain. [...] She was making conquests in high society and on her string was Germany’s wealthiest bankers. She lived at the Hotel Ambassador with a fine $10,000 Hispano-Suiza driven by a chauffeur and two maids. Something she would have never accomplished in America. “Absolutely impossible,” she later remarked to a visiting journalist, “I would have never been given the opportunity. I love Paris, the German people have been very kind, and so have the folks in Spain.” After working at Floresco Bonbonniere, she spent the summer in Deauville, dancing at the seaside casinos and appearing at the racetracks with a new admirer Armand Rochefoucauld, ‘Marquis de Deauville’.

40|$|Trade and {{investment}} are topics {{central to the}} China-in-Africa discourse that has <b>strongly</b> <b>emerged</b> from the West {{in the last few}} years. Western opinion leaders, along with several African opposition parties, often characterize China's role in Africa as "colonialist," "neo-imperialist" or "predatory. " Placing China's trade {{and investment}} in the continent in comparative perspective, the paper assesses the empirical validity of such charges, by examining those issues that receive disproportionate attention in the discourse: China's importation of oil from Africa, her exports of textiles and clothing to Africa and to the world in competition with Africa, as well as her ownership of a Zambian copper mine. It is concluded that China, as part of the world capitalist economy, injures African interests in many of the same ways as the principal Western states. The racialized China-in-Africa discourse, however, is largely inaccurate, reflective of Western elite perceptions of China as a strategic competitor, and acts as an obstacle to an effective critique of exploitative links between Africa and the more developed states.

40|$|AbstractIn an era {{of human}} activities, global {{environmental}} changes, habitat loss and species extinction, conservation strategies are a crucial step toward minimizing biodiversity loss. For instance, oceans acidification and land use are intensifying in many places with negative and often irreversible consequences for biodiversity. Biodiversity hotspots, despite some criticism, have become a tool for setting conservation priorities and {{play an important role}} in decision-making for cost-effective strategies to preserve biodiversity in terrestrial and, to some extent, marine ecosystems. This area-based approach can be applied to any geographical scale and it is considered to be one of the best approaches for maintaining a large proportion of the world’s biological diversity. However, delineating hotspots includes quantitative criteria along with subjective considerations and the risk is to neglect areas, such as coldspots, with other types of conservation value. Nowadays, it is widely acknowledged that biodiversity is much more than just the number of species in a region and a conservation strategy cannot be based merely on the number of taxa present in an ecosystem. Therefore, the idea that <b>strongly</b> <b>emerges</b> is the need to reconsider conservation priorities and to go toward an interdisciplinary approach through the creation of science-policy partnerships...|$|R

Late in 2012, two electronic prototype units, newly developed for the CPS one-turn-feedback, were programmed with a firmware designed to satisfy the transverse feedback (TFB) requirements in both planes. The main achievements were to automatically adapt the loop delay to the particles’ time-of-flight variation within a nanosecond precision and to compensate the changing betatron phase advance between pick-up and kicker during the entire accelerating cycle. With the power equipment limited to the modest bandwidth of 23 MHz and 2 x 800 W per plane, encouraging results were obtained such as fast damping of injection oscillations caused by injection errors, reduction of beam losses along the cycle and damping of instabilities at all CPS energies...|$|R

And volunteer groups can help to localize the new agenda by providing new spaces of interaction between governments and people for concrete and scalable actions.” At the seventieth session of the UN General Assembly, the Secretary-General presented a proposed Plan of Action {{for the next decade}} and beyond (2016-2030). This plan aims at integrating volunteering in peace and development policies and programmes through a strategic and collective long-term approach that matches the period of SDG implementation.|$|R
