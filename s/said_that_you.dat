This is {{demonstrated in the}} opening lines: [...] "You know I hate sleepin alone, but you <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will soon be home. But baby, {{that was a long}} time ago." [...] As the song progresses, she also wonders: [...] "What about my body, body?/You don’t want my body, body." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the female protagonist [...] "literally packs up her pussy" [...] and leaves the man who no longer seems interested in her, shown in the chorus lines: [...] "Let's go, little kitty kat / I think it's time to go / He don't want you anymore." [...] Similarly, Makkada B. Selah of The Village Voice noted that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was a threat for [...] "jetting" [...] and John Boone of E! Online commented that it was about Knowles' sex organ. Eb Haynes of AllHipHop commented that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] warns all restless boys that they too, become restless. Elysa Gardner of USA Today commented that the lyrics of the song include raw feelings for an unfaithful lover which are sung with [...] "sass".|$|E
500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself out is that I said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always <b>said</b> <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E

And you have <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can pay for this by rolling back the president's tax cut on the upper two percent.

Astill and Akingbola filmed [...] "technical" [...] fight scenes which followed, which resulted in Dan having noticeable injuries to his face. At this point Holby City played out the first possible reveal moment. Chrissie tried to find out why they had fought, with Malick nearly telling the truth. Hobley <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think, [...] "Oh my God, he’s going to tell her!" [...] Malick blackmailed him to keep quiet or he would tell Chrissie the truth. They both prevented director of surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry), from finding out the truth.

2500|$|Attiya was {{similarly}} instrumental {{in keeping the}} young Ovadia Yosef in the Torah world. At one point, the promising young scholar suddenly stopped coming to yeshiva for several days. Attiya {{paid a visit to}} his home and was shocked by the poverty he saw there. Ovadia's father explained that he owned a small grocery store and needed his son to work for him. Attiya's efforts to convince the father of the importance of Torah learning fell on deaf ears. The next morning, when the father entered his store, he found Attiya standing there wearing a work apron. The rosh yeshiva explained that he had come to the store early that morning when Ovadia was opening up. He had told the boy that he had found a substitute worker who would work without pay, and sent him back to yeshiva. [...] "You <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> needed someone to help and could not afford to pay. I am that someone. Your son's learning is more important than my time!" [...] The father finally conceded and allowed his son to continue learning.|$|E
2500|$|... "This begs many questions. First, {{is there}} such a thing as 'the {{international}} community'? Do people in China, which accounts for a fifth of the world's population, and the Buddhists, who account for another fifth—among others—really want the U.S. and its client states to bomb the Serbs or Iraqis? And who exactly, and when, deputed the U.S. to act on behalf of this 'world community'? ... Secondly, can the blunt weapon of force, of whose use U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright boasted, balance conflicting and competing ethnic, religious, economic and political interactions over this wide and conflictive region? Can the U.S. raise the expectations of the Albanians and Slav Moslems without affronting Macedonians, Greeks, Italians, Bulgars and Croats, as well as Serbs? ... Thirdly, can force be a substitute for policy? It was a wise German who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can do anything with bayonets except sit on them. The same goes for gunships, the modern equivalent of gunboat diplomacy. Bomb and rocket once, and it has an effect.

Lü Bu asked him, [...] "Hao Meng was instigated by Yuan Shu. Who else {{is involved in the}} plot?" [...] Cao Xing replied, [...] "Chen Gong is an accomplice." [...] At that time, Chen Gong was nearby and he gave an obvious angry expression when his name was mentioned. Lü Bu felt that Chen Gong was his key adviser so he refused to believe the accusation. Cao Xing said, [...] "Hao Meng often urged me to rebel, but I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you,</b> General, are like a god and cannot be defeated. Unfortunately, Hao Meng refused to believe what I told him." [...] Lü Bu then exclaimed, [...] "You're a true soldier!" [...] He treated Cao Xing well and placed him in charge of Hao Meng's men after he had recovered.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} is a transcript provided by [...] from a [...] in which John Mueller of Google speaks about the Title tag {{and its relation to}} SEO:DANIEL PICKEN: I had a quick question. And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but you <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I was just wondering what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search. Help says pretty much the same things, as does Matt Cutts, in one of this [...]|$|E
