In 2004, a U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) investigation found that Cracker Barrel discriminated against minority customers; patrons complained of racially segregated <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> service quality. In an agreement with the USDOJ, Cracker Barrel implemented non-discrimination policies and pledged to focus on improving minority representation and civic involvement, particularly in the black community. Company shareholders added sexual orientation to the company's non-discrimination policy in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Heublein {{promoted}} Michael A. Miles to run {{the chain}} in 1977 and Miles is credited with saving the ailing company by instituting its back-to-basics formula. Miles refurbished the stores, and introduced indoor <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> drive-thru windows. Electronic tills produced daily customer counts, inventories and profit and loss statements, so that problems could be identified quickly. KFC expanded internationally in the 1970s and 80s, particularly in Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom. Miles also lured Sanders back, and listened to his recommendations for the business. Subsequent changes resulted in 30 months of consecutive per store sales increases by late 1980.|$|E

5|$|Service on the Lake Shore Limited {{consists}} of reserved coach <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> Viewliner sleepers, {{as well as}} amenities like a dining car service. As the Erie station is not equipped with a ticket office, nor Amtrak's Quik-Trak ticket machines, all tickets from the station have to be pre-paid. The station is, however, equipped with a waiting room and public restrooms. The Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority's Route 20A, the downtown circulator, provides service between the station and downtown Erie. The bus only operates, however, at the scheduled arrival time of the eastbound Lake Shore Limited.|$|E

5|$|Local {{opinion was}} heavily against Thornton. Pamphlets were sold {{purporting}} to show Thornton's guilt, and poems were composed {{with the same}} theme.

On 8 August 1817, people filled {{the street in front of}} County Hall in Warwick, where the trial was to take place. When the judge, Sir George Sowley Holroyd (a justice of the Court of King's Bench) began proceedings at 8a.m., people rushed to fill the available <b>seating,</b> <b>and</b> the public benches remained full throughout the one-day trial.

Three were rebuilt for use on the Montrealer, an overnight train between Washington, D.C. and Montreal. Booths and lounge seating replaced the coach <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> club seats. These were later rebuilt as all-table dinettes. Most clubs were rebuilt as club-dinette cars, with one half given over to booths and the other having 2×1 seating. Others were rebuilt as full-length business class cars, with 62 seats. Still others were converted to 72-seat coaches.|$|E

5|$|Sport England {{wished to}} avoid {{creating}} a white elephant, so they {{insisted that the}} City Council agree to undertake and fund extensive work to convert CoMS from a track and field arena to a football stadium, thereby ensuring its long-term financial viability.

However, Manchester City Council {{did not have the}} money to facilitate movable <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> Manchester City were lukewarm about the idea. Stadium architects Arup Sport believed history demonstrated that maintaining a rarely used athletics track often does not work with football – and cited examples such as the Stadio delle Alpi and the Olympic Stadium with both Juventus and Bayern Munich moving to new stadiums less than 40 years after inheriting them.|$|E
