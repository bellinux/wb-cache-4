5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The <b>storage</b> <b>standard</b> set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E

50|$|Polaroids {{have the}} same <b>storage</b> <b>standards</b> under ISO 18920:2000 as any other photograph. Regular storage {{conditions}} should be less than 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 50% and 30% relative humidity (RH). Cold storage (0 degrees Fahrenheit optimum) is not helpful unless RH can be controlled and cold storage RH is generally drier than required.

Due to the higher requirements for capacity and integrity in data backups, a computer-grade DAT was introduced, called DDS (Digital Data Storage). Although functionally similar to audio DATs, only a few DDS and DAT drives (in particular, those manufactured by Archive for SGI workstations) are capable of reading the audio data from a DAT cassette. SGI DDS4 drives no longer have audio support; SGI removed the feature due to [...] "lack of demand".|$|E

50|$|Fuel {{bladders}} or fuel storage bladders are collapsible, flexible storage bladders (also {{known as}} tanks) that provide temporary or long term storage for industrial liquids (e.g. fuels). These pillow shaped tanks {{are designed for}} large volume liquid transport, industrial chemicals, potable water, sludge, and fuel <b>storage.</b> <b>Standard</b> fuel bladder tanks sizes range from 100 gal to 200,000 gal capacities and larger and custom fuel storage bladders and cells are available, although at sizes exceeding 50,000 gal there is an increased spill risk. To {{minimize the risk of}} leakage, {{and for the sake of}} containing a catastrophic spill, all fuel bladders should be housed in secondary containment. The use of fuel bladders without precautionary measures is risky and should not be undertaken. The fines involved with fuel spills are well known and the EPA has set clear guidelines for the use of secondary containment concerning fuel bladders.|$|E
