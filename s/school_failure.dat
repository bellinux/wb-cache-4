40|$|An {{approach}} to <b>schooling</b> <b>failure,</b> within {{the sphere of}} contemporary pathologies, requires placing the social relationships in a historical dimension, characteristic of an epoch. When we refer to the aphorism: the unconscious is the social (ASSOUN, 1994); we disengage ourselves from readings that place the individual versus society and think <b>schooling</b> <b>failure</b> to be the reflex of contingencies, historical transformations and unconscious determinations that carry the initials of the social symptom, which is structured as the reflection of discourse production dominant of the period. It is therefore necessary to place discourse and pedagogical practice, which emerged in the Modern era, {{in order to understand}} <b>schooling</b> <b>failure,</b> an expression that directly opposes the ideals expected of schooling in terms of excellence of the learning function. What truth is depicted from <b>schooling</b> <b>failure</b> if the symptom results from repressed truth? It refers to the return and insistence stemming from the destination that civilization confers to the discomfort lived by humans. Thus, <b>schooling</b> <b>failure,</b> the return of a truth, attaches itself to a historical contingency or belongs to present day pathologies, wherein, the ideal to transform and to better society with scientific progress and improvement of technique persist as conditions for liberty and happiness. The execution of such an assignment is aligned to a forged model that imprisons the child in a technical childhood. Finally, <b>schooling</b> <b>failure,</b> as it reveals subjective truth, insinuates itself into the wrong direction to social demands that impose equality and cut out expressions of singularity excluded from spaces established by the dominant discourse, which give priority to orthopedics forms in order to sustain the ideal of perfect men...|$|R

50|$|Initially, {{participants}} in TIP were first-time truants {{referred to the}} program {{as a result of}} a referral from the Fulton County Juvenile Court, but now, every child who is referred to the court for truancy is paired with a TIP volunteer. Since 2001, TIP has also served children at the school level through its Early Intervention initiative, pairing children and families with volunteers to assist in rectifying the attendance issues before a court referral becomes necessary. Providing children at risk of <b>school</b> <b>failure</b> with volunteer advocates increases their exposure to many social services and other resources, increasing their opportunity for success. Along with preventing <b>school</b> <b>failure,</b> these efforts combat the consequences that go along with it as well. Teen pregnancy, crime, and welfare dependence are all addressed through the mentoring and enrichment programs that TIP provides.
