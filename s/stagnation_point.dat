25|$|Evidence that Prandtl's {{scenario}} occurs for bluff {{bodies in}} flows of high Reynolds numbers {{can be seen}} in impulsively started flows around a cylinder.

25|$|According to {{the theory}} of aerodynamics, a flow is {{considered}} to be compressible if the density changes along a streamline. This means that – unlike incompressible flow – changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the Mach number in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the <b>stagnation</b> <b>point</b> (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows.|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} a {{groundwater}} flow {{is characterized by}} aquifer features and the number, type, and distribution of <b>stagnation</b> <b>points</b> (locations where the flow rate is zero) in the flow domain. We identify a condition denoting flow pattern changes in two-dimensional groundwater flow obeying Darcy’s law by examining changes in <b>stagnation</b> <b>points,</b> using the Taylor series expansion of the discharge vector to repre-sent the flow about such points. We find that the three standard types of <b>stagnation</b> <b>points</b> (minimums, maximums, and saddle points) are completely characterized by the first-order term containing the discharge gradient tensor. However, when the de-terminant of the tensor becomes zero, <b>stagnation</b> <b>points</b> of other types characterized by higher-order terms may come into existence: they may emerge suddenly, split {{to a set of}} new <b>stagnation</b> <b>points,</b> or disappear from the flow, resulting in transitions of flow patterns. Thus, the condition of zero-determinant of the discharge gradient tensor is a condition denoting flow pattern changes. We illustrate the usefulness and significance of this condition in understanding groundwater flows through several examples of steady and transient flows. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{pipe organ}} {{is another example}} of a {{potentially}} dipole sound source being driven as a monopole source. An air jet is directed at a sharp edge setting up flow oscillations as in the edge tone. The edge is part of a generally cylindrical tube of length L. An example is shown in the figure on the right. The unstable jet drives fluid alternately into the tube and out. The streamlines clearly are distorted from those of the free edge tone. There is a <b>stagnation</b> <b>point</b> opposite the source. The dashed lines, colored in red, are those most strongly modified.

40|$|International audienceWe {{show the}} {{existence}} of a flow at the surface of strongly adhering giant lipid vesicles submitted to an external shear flow. The surface flow is divided into two symmetric quadrants and presents two <b>stagnation</b> <b>points</b> (SP) {{on each side of the}} vesicle meridian plane. The position of these <b>stagnation</b> <b>points</b> depends strongly on the adhesion strength, characterized by the ratio of the contact zone diameter to the vesicle diameter. Contrary to the case of non-adhesive vesicles, streamlines do not lie in the shear plane. By avoiding the motionless contact zone, streamlines result in three-dimensional paths, strongly asymmetric away from the SP. Additional shearing dissipation may occur on the membrane surface as we observed that the mean rotational velocity of the membrane increases towards the vesicle SP, and is mainly determined by the adhesion induced vesicle shape...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} small amplitude periodic internal waves traveling at the boundary region between two rotational and homogeneous fluids with different densities. Within a period, the waves we obtain have the property that the gradient {{of the stream}} function associated to the fluid beneath the interface vanishes, on the wave surface, at exactly two points. Furthermore, there exists a critical layer which is bounded from above by the wave profile. Besides, we prove, without excluding the presence of <b>stagnation</b> <b>points,</b> that if the vorticity function associated to each fluid in part is real-analytic, bounded, and non-increasing, then capillary-gravity steady internal waves are a priori real-analytic.

Five pairs of Taylor-Proudman vortex columns with opposite rotation are generated, which arrange alternatively parallel to the axis of rotation across the middle in the equatorial plane of the spherical shell. These vortex columns retrograde at a constant angular velocity. The flow field is steady in a frame rotating with this angular velocity.

Two kinds of nontrivial closed streamlines which turns once around the rotating axis of the spheres and seven different kinds of non-trivial <b>stagnation</b> <b>points</b> of velocity are found in the steady flow frame.
