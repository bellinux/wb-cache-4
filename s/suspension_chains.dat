2500|$|Brunel {{recognised}} that {{a circular}} cross-section tubular girder – a shallow [...] "bow", excellent in compression and tension – could be strung by <b>suspension</b> <b>chains</b> {{to form a}} stiff, self-supporting structure very much lighter (thus less expensive) than a Stephenson-type box girder. Instead of hanging the chains from towers and suspending the bridge deck from them, Brunel used the chains to stress and slightly bow the tubes, which were braced against the chains using struts. The bridge deck was rigid, because it was effectively clamped against the tubes by the chains. Brunel solved the problem in his own way, and for more than 100 years, the Chepstow and subsequently the Royal Albert Bridge were the only suspension bridges on the British railway system.|$|E
