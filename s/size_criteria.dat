40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The binding {{of eleven}} polycyclic, {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons to the acid form of poly A has been investigated. The hydrocarbons {{were chosen to}} test a <b>size</b> <b>criterion.</b> Model building showed that some hydrocarbons could intercalate in the helix and be well protected from contact with the aqueous solvent. Experimentally {{it was found that}} those hydrocarbons which were small enough to be protected were bound to poly A. Hydrocarbons which were too large to be so protected did not bind. A <b>size</b> <b>criterion</b> for the binding of hydrocarbons to poly A therefore exists. The flow dichroism of four poly A-hydrocarbon complexes was measured. The flow dichroism measurements were consistent with the intercalation model. The dissociation energy of several hydrocarbons is found to occur in an order that is different from that given by the <b>size</b> <b>criterion.</b> There was no correlation between the binding of individual hydrocarbons to poly A and the energy of dissocation of individual hydrocarbons from the crystalline state. The <b>size</b> <b>criterion</b> for poly A, together with a previously examined <b>size</b> <b>criterion</b> for DNA, and the flow dichroism data serve as unequivocal evidence that hydrocarbons intercalate in polynucleotides...|$|R

50|$|Despite this ibis’s {{infrequent}} {{occurrence in}} its savannah habitat, the population {{appears to have}} remained stable since the early 20th century; There have been no trade records of this species, and the global population is {{not considered to be}} threatened generally. The world population has been estimated at 10,000-25,000 individuals, with 6700-17000 of these being mature. The sharp-tailed ibis has been evaluated by the IUCN as Least Concern since 2004 because this bird does not approach Vulnerable under the population trend and range <b>size</b> <b>criteria.</b> Nevertheless, this species could potentially decline unnoticed due to its solitary lifestyle and hence the potential difficulty in detecting individuals during population monitoring.

5000|$|The under-occupancy penalty (also {{known as}} the under {{occupation}} penalty, under-occupancy charge, [...] under-occupation charge or <b>size</b> <b>criteria)</b> is a reform contained in the British Welfare Reform Act 2012 whereby public-housing (also called council or social housing) tenants with rooms deemed to be [...] "spare" [...] face a reduction in Housing Benefit, resulting in them being obliged to fund this reduction from their incomes or face rent arrears and potential eviction by their landlord (be that the local authority or a housing association). The under-occupancy penalty has been widely branded the Bedroom Tax, especially by critics of the changes who argue that they amount to a tax {{because of the lack}} of social housing (or in some areas, any rented accommodation) for affected tenants to downsize to (and the refusal to accept the risk of taking lodgers in). The penalties are also criticised as having a disproportionate impact on disabled people.|$|E
50|$|In 1971 Gatton {{became a}} College of Advanced Education and control passed to a College Council. The then Director, Neil Briton, quoted Prime Minister John Gorton in declaring {{the aim of}} the College to be to produce a new {{end-product}} - a liberally-educated technologist. The first women students enrolled in 1969 on a non-residential basis, and residential women students were accepted in 1971. The College began to confer its own degrees in 1973 and continued to diversify the courses on offer. The next major change came as a result of new Commonwealth government education policy in 1988, which required tertiary institutions to have a minimum student population of 2000 full-time enrolments. Gatton did not meet the <b>size</b> <b>criteria</b> and like many other smaller colleges, consolidated with a larger institution.

Using standard <b>size</b> <b>criteria,</b> sensitivities on MRI are low, ranging from 29 to 86 % [46, 59, 66, 85]. CT and MRI {{are unable to}} detect micrometastases in normal-sized nodes, and to differentiate reactive enlargement from malignant infiltration. The performance of MRI is greatly improved by use of lymph-node-specific MRI contrast agents, such as ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIOs). These are intravenously administered to the patient {{at the time of}} the staging MRI. The contrast agent is transported via the interstitial space to lymph nodes, where they are taken up by normal macrophages. The presence of USPIOs within normal, macrophage-laden nodes results in loss of signal on T 2 -weighted sequences. In lymph nodes replaced by tumour deposits there is no loss of signal. The use of USPIOs improves the sensitivity of MRI (using standard <b>size</b> <b>criteria</b> of nodes) from 29 % to 82 - 93 %, whilst maintaining a high specificity at 97 % [46].|$|E

40|$|Since the 1970 s, {{relatively}} uncommon {{species of}} non-enteric gram-negative bacilli {{have emerged as}} nosocomial colonizers and pathogens. Among them, {{one of the most}} significant genera is Acinetobacter, which has given rise to an increasing number of reports of nosocomial infections. The introduction of new broad-spectrum antimicrobials in the hospitals has been one of the main factors responsible for this development. In addition leading to a move from more susceptible towards more resistant pathogens. This occurred both between and within genera. Owing to the unpredictable antimicrobial susceptibility of Acinetobacter spp., it is prudent to test each isolate for its susceptibility profile to guide in the proper treatment of infections caused by Acinetobacter. The disk diffusion method is the technique most widely used by microbiology laboratories for the routine assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The zone diameters obtained by this technique for individual antimicrobials are reported as susceptible, intermediate or resistant by referring to an interpretative chart. Most laboratories use interpretative charts (zone <b>size</b> <b>criteria)</b> supplied by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) for this purpose. In our laboratory we have noted discrepancies between sensitivities as determined by the NCCLS zone <b>size</b> <b>criteria</b> and the local minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results obtained for Acinetobacter species, especially for cefepime (CPIM) and ceftazidime (CT AZ).
