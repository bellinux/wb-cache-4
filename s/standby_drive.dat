500|$|The tram is {{propelled}} by three independent drive systems. The primary drive is a 450 kilowatt (600 hp) variable-frequency electric motor. Two hydrostatic diesel engines are {{also part of}} the design: one is a <b>standby</b> <b>drive,</b> permitting operation during a power outage; the other is an emergency evacuation drive. [...] A 40-ton counterweight offsets the weight of the cars. [...] The tram is capable of operating at speeds up to 22 miles per hour (35km per hour).|$|E
40|$|Harmonic drives allow {{redundancy}} {{and high}} out put torque in small package. If main drive fails, <b>standby</b> <b>drive</b> takes over and produces torque along same axis as main drive. Uses include power units in robot for internal pipeline inspection, manipulators in deep submersible probes or other applications in which redundancy protects against costly failures...|$|E
5000|$|Some Parallel ATA (PATA) and Serial ATA (SATA) {{hard disk}} drives support {{power-up}} in <b>standby</b> (PUIS): each <b>drive</b> does not spin {{up until the}} controller or system BIOS issues a specific command to do so. This allows the system {{to be set up}} to stagger disk start-up and limit maximum power demand at switch-on.|$|R
40|$|The NCP 1250 is {{a highly}} {{integrated}} PWM controller capable of delivering a rugged and high performance offline power supply in a tiny TSOP− 6 package. With a supply range up to 28 V, the controller hosts a jittered 65 kHz or 100 kHz switching circuitry operated in peak current mode control. When the power on the secondary side starts to decrease, the controller automatically folds back its switching frequency down to a minimum level of 26 kHz. As the power further goes down, the part enters skip cycle while limiting the peak current. Over Power Protection (OPP) is a difficult exercise especially when no−load <b>standby</b> requirements <b>drive</b> the converter specifications. The ON proprietary integrated OPP lets you harness the maximum delivered power without affecting your standby performance simply via two external resistors. An Over Voltage Protection input is also combined on the same pin and protects the whole circuitry in case of optocoupler failure or adverse open loop operation. Finally, a timer−based short−circuit protection offers the best protection scheme, letting you precisely select the protection trip point irrespective of a loose coupling between the auxiliary and the power windings...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this interim staff {{guidance}} (ISG) is to clarify the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff guidance for review of Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) Designs using a Gas Turbine <b>Driven</b> <b>Standby</b> Emergency Alternating Current (AC) Power system. This ISG, while providing new staff guidance on the topic, also revises and updates the guidance previously provided in the cited Standard Review Plan (SRP) sections below related to the subject Standby Emergency AC Power System. Background Emergency diesel generators (EDGs) are widely used as the standby emergency power sources for the onsite AC power system. It is anticipated that new reactor designs will incorporate gas turbines to supply the standby emergency AC power system. This ISG provides guidance on the implementation of emergency gas turbine generators (EGTGs) used as AC power sources to supply power to safety-related equipment or equipment important to safety for all operational events and during accident conditions. Only EGTG systems that are air cooled and diesel oil fueled are considered in this guidance. This ISG provides new guidance for applicants submitting a combined license (COL) or design certification (DC...|$|R
