40|$|This {{article is}} aimed at {{people who suffer from}} muscular {{dystrophy}} or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A webcam captures images of the user’s head, and the computer then processes these images to calculate and transform the swinging direction and distance of the user’s head into the position of the mouse cursor and into the action of clicking the mouse. To accurately and quickly recognize these features, this article used a round sticker with a diameter of 1 [*]cm as an <b>identification</b> <b>label,</b> which is stuck on the user’s forehead. After the webcam captures the images, the program can recognize the positions of the <b>identification</b> <b>label</b> and move the mouse cursor. Through Windows API, this article determined the user’s intention and action of clicking the mouse {{on the basis of a}} series of movements to control the mouse cursor. As confirmed by the experimental results, the proposed assisted computer entry device for muscular atrophy patients is applicable and gives good results for the e-book reading program, use of the web browser, and the execution of the application software and mini-games developed by this system structure...|$|R

50|$|For {{items that}} are {{under the control of}} the Department of Defense and subject for marking, there are many {{specifications}} that must be met for a proper mark.

Additionally, the marking may even be applied directly to the surface of the item itself - provided of course it can still meet the requirements described below.|$|R

40|$|Drawing on {{a variety}} of {{research}} domains and traditions, this article presents a contemporary and evidence-led model for understanding the development of gifts and talents. In so doing and arguing largely – but not exclusively – from within the stance of social-constructivism, it is suggested that accounts of gift-development that emphasise the role of innate capacities lead frequently to tired debates around <b>identification,</b> <b>labelling</b> and resourcing, and away from the more vital discourses around gifted provision and gift-creation. The implications for classroom practice deriving from traditional and emerging ontological and epistemological conceptualisations of giftedness are presented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{probabilistic}} approach for appearance-based person reidentification in non-overlapping camera networks. It accounts for varying illumination, varying camera gain and has low computational complexity. More specifically, {{we present a}} graphical model where we model the person’s appearance in addition to camera illumination and gain. We analytically derive the solutions for the person’s appearance and camera properties, and use a novel constant time Gibbs sampling scheme to estimate the <b>identification</b> <b>labels.</b> We validate our algorithm on two indoor datasets and perform a comparative analysis with existing algorithms. We demonstrate significantly increased re-identification accuracy in addition to significantly reducing the computational complexity on our datasets...|$|R
50|$|Thermal Transfer is {{a popular}} print process {{particularly}} used for the printing of <b>identification</b> <b>labels.</b> It is {{the most widely used}} printing process in the world for the printing of high quality barcodes.The thermal transfer print process utilises three main components: a non-movable print head, a carbon ribbon (the ink) and a substrate to be printed, which would typically be paper, synthetics, card or textile materials. These three components effectively form a sandwich with the ribbon in the middle.A thermally compliant print head, in combination with the electrical properties of the ribbon and the correct rheological properties of the ribbon ink are all essential in producing a high quality printed image.|$|R
