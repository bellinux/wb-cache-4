2500|$|North American AT-6 TexanThe Texan trainer found a {{new life}} in Korea as a forward air control aircraft. To meet an urgent {{operational}} need for close air support of ground forces, the Texans flew [...] "mosquito" [...] missions, spotting enemy troops and guns and marking them with <b>smoke</b> <b>rockets</b> for USAF fighter attack. The T-6s of the 6147th Tactical Control Group performed invaluable work.|$|R
50|$|A {{successor}} operation, code-named Palace Dog, began replacing this original Butterfly {{effort in}} 1966. Central Intelligence Agency agent James William Lair recommended {{the use of}} Lao interpreters flying in the rear seat of light aircraft flown by American pilots, thus establishing the Ravens. The Ravens were airborne fighter pilots in unarmed light aircraft who flew observation missions, marked enemy targets with <b>smoke</b> <b>rockets,</b> directed air strikes onto them, and observed and reported bomb damage assessment post strike. They were based in five Lao towns: Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Pakse, Savannakhet, and at Long Tieng.|$|R
5000|$|Maverick D {{replaced}} the electro-optical guidance with an imaging infrared system which doubled the practical firing distance and allowed {{for its use}} at night and during bad weather. A reduced <b>smoke</b> <b>rocket</b> engine was also introduced in this model. It achieved its initial operation capability in 1983.|$|E
50|$|During Operation Protea, at {{the battle}} of Xangongo, Captain Danie Laubscher of 42 Squadron was awarded the Honoris Crux {{decoration}} for bravery. Battle Group 20's attack on Xangongo was held up by ZU-23-2 AA guns. Two attacks by Dassault Mirage aircraft failed to destroy the site and a third attack by artillery was not successful either. Captain Laubscher's smoke rockets had failed to narrow the Mirages' attack so he decided to attempt a direct hit with smoke rockets to accurately mark the target for the Mirages. He dive bombed the target firing one <b>smoke</b> <b>rocket</b> directly into the gun position but the Mirages were out of ordnance and fuel. The ground attack had resumed by this time without any enemy ZU-23-2 fire. It was later found that his <b>smoke</b> <b>rocket</b> had hit the operator of the gun.|$|E
50|$|In December, 1966, they {{acquired}} {{the use of}} an O-1 Bird Dog assigned to the Royal Lao Air Force at Savannakhet; unlike the borrowed Air America planes, the O-1 had additional radios and <b>smoke</b> <b>rocket</b> tubes for improved communications and target marking. A de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver and a Helio Courier were also acquired, but seemed not to be used for directing air strikes.|$|E
50|$|Using this method, a Bosbok {{was once}} {{credited}} with destroying an entire 37 mm anti-aircraft gun position with a lucky direct hit {{from one of}} its <b>smoke</b> marker <b>rockets.</b>|$|R
50|$|On September 13, 1944, the US {{military}} is redeploying its {{troops on the}} front line, to concentrate its attack on the fortifications. But fatigue and stress disorient {{the men of the}} 2nd Infantry regiment, which are ultimately relieved on September 14. The 1st Battalion Task force, hard hit by the shelling of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division and specific small arms fire, had to withdraw with difficulty behind a screen of <b>smoke</b> <b>rockets,</b> more than five hundred meters from Amanvillers. Around 14:00, an air strike on Amanvillers does not allow the infantry to advance, the village being too close to the fortifications of the sector to be taken in full.|$|R

5000|$|Project Nike, (Greek: Νίκη, [...] "Victory", {{pronounced}} nǐːkɛː), was a U.S. Army project, {{proposed in}} May 1945 by Bell Laboratories, {{to develop a}} line-of-sight anti-aircraft missile system. The project delivered the United States' first operational anti-aircraft missile system, the Nike Ajax, in 1953. A great number of the technologies and rocket systems used for developing the Nike Ajax were re-used {{for a number of}} functions, many of which were given the [...] "Nike" [...] name (after Nike, the goddess of victory from Greek mythology).The missile's first-stage solid rocket booster became the basis for many types of rocket including the Nike Hercules missile and NASA's Nike <b>Smoke</b> <b>rocket,</b> used for upper-atmosphere research.|$|E
5000|$|When Holmes and Watson arrive, a {{group of}} jobless men meander {{throughout}} the street. When Adler's coach pulls up, Holmes enacts his plan. A fight breaks out between {{the men on the}} street over who gets to help Adler. Holmes rushes into the fight to protect Adler, and is seemingly struck and injured. Adler takes him into her sitting room, where Holmes motions for her to have the window opened. As Holmes lifts his hand, Watson recognizes a pre-arranged signal and tosses in a plumber's <b>smoke</b> <b>rocket.</b> While smoke billows out of the building, Watson shouts [...] "FIRE!" [...] and the cry is echoed up and down the street.|$|E
50|$|In many cases, {{the forward}} air control system {{began with the}} forward air {{controller}} being pre-briefed on a target. He then planned his attack mission. In other cases, an immediate air request came in requiring a rapid response; the FAC might have to divert from a pre-briefed target. In any case, the FAC would rendezvous with the strike aircraft, preferably out {{of view of the}} targeted enemy. Once permission to strike was verified, the FAC marked the target, usually with a <b>smoke</b> <b>rocket.</b> Once the strike aircraft identified the marked target, they were directed by the FAC. Once the strike was complete, the FAC would make a bomb damage assessment and report it.|$|E
50|$|T-62E Mark II: Mid 1990s Egyptian {{refurbishment}} {{and modernization}} program. The tanks were {{fitted with a}} license-built German MTU engine developing 880 hp (656 kW). The tanks are armed with a license-built 105 mm M68 tank gun, an Italian fire control system with ballistics computer, infrared vision device, laser rangefinder, gun stabilizer, additional armor including reactive armour, armored side skirts, modernized suspension and six smoke grenade launchers {{on each side of}} the turret. It has an upgraded NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical) protection system. The T-62E Mark II carries two Egyptian-made two-round anti-tank missile launchers, or two 2-round launchers for 80 mm D-3000 <b>smoke</b> <b>rockets</b> on an encroachment extension, or a box-type launcher holding two Sakr smoke missiles {{on each side of the}} turret. The upgrade did not change the weight of the tank, which remained at 45 tons.|$|R

2500|$|Although the T-6 {{entered the}} FAC {{role as a}} [...] "hot" [...] aircraft, it was soon {{encumbered}} with numerous adaptations that degraded its performance. With a load that included a long range belly tank, smoke grenades, and a dozen <b>smoke</b> <b>rockets</b> added under each wing for marking targets adding half a ton of added weight, the T-6 was limited to {{a top speed of}} , and its service ceiling was considerably reduced. [...] The T-6's low wing restricted view and its lowered performance was a detriment to its role in forward air control. The 6147th tested the L-19, later known as the O-1 Bird Dog. However, it offered no better performance than the Texan and its lack of armor left it vulnerable to ground fire. There was also an abortive attempt to use the L-17 Navion as a FAC aircraft. The Navion's low wing design precluded much success in observation. However, the T-6s did not go unscathed, as 20 were lost in action by December 1950.|$|R
5000|$|The 2.36-inch (60mm) <b>Smoke</b> <b>Rocket</b> M10 and its {{improved}} subvariants (M10A1, M10A2, M10A4) {{used the}} rocket motor and fin {{assembly of the}} M6A1, but replaced the anti-tank warhead with a white phosphorus (WP) smoke head. WP smoke not only acts as a visible screen, but its burning particles can cause severe injuries to human skin. The M10 was therefore used to mark targets, to blind enemy gunners or vehicle drivers, or to drive troops out of bunkers and dugouts. [...] The 2.36-Inch Incendiary Rocket T31 was an M10 variant with an incendiary warhead designed to ignite fires in enemy-held structures and unarmored vehicles, or to destroy combustible supplies, ammunition, and materiel; it was not often utilized.|$|E
5000|$|Inside her home, Holmes {{pretends to}} faint and asks the maid {{to open the}} window for some air. He asks Adler if she has any smelling salts, and while she is away to get it, raises his hand and motions to Dr. Watson, who is just outside the windows waiting for his cue. Dr. Watson tosses a plumber's <b>smoke</b> <b>rocket</b> into the room through the window. While {{the smoke from the}} rocket fills in the room, Holmes raises a cry of [...] "Fire!" [...] and in the {{confusion}} that ensues Adler rushes to open a panel in the wall that reveals a button, but before she can press it she notices that Holmes is watching her do that. She immediately closes the panel probably realizing that the whole things was a ruse to get her to reveal the hiding place.|$|E
50|$|Battle Group 20 was {{tasked with}} the {{southern}} end of the town and its airfield to the west. The first trenches reached by the battle group around 13h25 were found to be empty but as they advanced further, they began to receive small arms fire and then more serious fire from 23mm anti-aircraft guns. Battle Group 20's attack on southern Xangongo was now held up by ZU-23-2 AA guns and the advance was halted as air strikes were called. Two attacks by Mirage aircraft an hour later failed to destroy the site and a third attack by artillery was not successful either. Captain Laubscher of 42 Squadron , flying an observation aircraft, had fired smoke rockets to narrow the Mirages' attack, but this failed so he decided to attempt a direct hit with smoke rockets to accurately mark the target for the Mirages. He dive bombed the target firing one <b>smoke</b> <b>rocket</b> directly into the gun position but by this time the Mirages were out of ordnance and fuel. It was later found that his <b>smoke</b> <b>rocket</b> had hit the operator of the gun. Laubscher was awarded the Honoris Crux decoration for bravery. Two and a half hours later the ground attack had resumed this time receiving limited enemy ZU-23-2 fire, attacking bunkers and trenches and eventually taking the airfield. By 18h00, Battle Group 20 was in control of its objectives, having destroyed at least four tanks and capturing vehicles, guns and ammunition. Battle Group 20's rest overnight was disturbed by an enemy truck column that advanced from the south into the group's positions and was destroyed by Ratel 90s. By the midday on 25 August, the battle group was in control of all positions south of the town but lost one soldier in the process. Later, Battle Group 20 would attack a PLAN base to the south of Xangongo towards Cuamato but this was found to be abandoned except for equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The September 13, 1944, US Staff redeploy {{its troops}} {{on the front line}} to focus its attack on the fortifications. But fatigue and stress now disorient the men of 2nd Infantry {{regiment}} and they are finally relieved of such a Hell hole, September 14, 1944. [...] The 1is Battalion Task force, hard hit by the shelling of 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division and specific small arms fire, had to withdraw with difficulty behind a screen of <b>smoke</b> <b>rockets,</b> more than five hundred meters from Amanvillers. Around 14:00, an air strike on Amanvillers does not allow the infantry to advance, the village being too close to the fortifications of the sector to be taken in full. Two regiments, reinforced by the engineering companies 90th Infantry Division, take over in the area: the 357 Infantry Regiment of Colonel Barth takes position along the woods of Jaumont, East of Saint-Privat, while 359 Infantry Regiment of Colonel Bacon takes a position east of Gravelotte.|$|R
50|$|Some {{aircraft}} types {{can carry}} {{a wide variety of}} ordnance - for example the Fairchild AU-23 Peacemaker could use forward-firing gun pods, 500 and 250 pound bombs, napalm units, cluster bomb units, flares, <b>rockets,</b> <b>smoke</b> grenades and propaganda leaflet dispensers.|$|R
5000|$|With this background, {{the need}} for forward air control was apparent. Stanford was {{assigned}} to Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base in April 1966 to ride along on forward air control missions against North Vietnamese efforts to resupply their troops in Laos. A month later, he was infiltrated into Laos in civilian clothing and with no military identification. While working in mufti, he used his Combat Controller expertise to work around restrictions forbidding the use of <b>smoke</b> <b>rockets</b> to mark targets in Laos for air strikes. Because he wasn't a pilot, he rode in the co-pilot's seat when he flew. Because no military aircraft were available, Stanford cadged rides with civilian pilots on hire by the Central Intelligence Agency. While operating predominantly from tiny hazardously substandard Lima Site airstrips {{in the wilds of}} Laos used by Air America and Continental Air Services, Stanford flew 218 combat missions. His estimation of the Lima strips: [...] "Most of them were unbelievable, 300 to 400 feet long, not in a straight line, with all sorts of inclines. Some were shaved off mountain tops and some followed curved ridgelines." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Skylanders {{are sent}} to track down Chef Pepper Jack. Meeting up with Tessa at Phoenix Psanctuary, they hold of the Chef's forces from obtaining a Phoenix Chicken egg to create a Spicy Omelet of Doom. Kaos {{intervenes}} to sabotage the plans, but his <b>smoke</b> <b>rocket</b> lets Chef Pepper Jack escape with an egg. Launching an assault on his Zeppelin, the Skylanders free all slaves on board, and trap the maniacal cook, but Flynn is injured in this action. With 3 Doom Raiders down, Dr. Krankcase and Wolfgang are set to take action, but the Golden Queen still {{wants to build a}} weapon made of Traptanium. Much to Kaos's dismay, the Queen only wants the riches, not the world. Fed up with her leadership, Kaos challenges the Queen to an [...] "evil-off", winner takes all, but he loses and has to call for help.|$|E
2500|$|A central {{timing and}} firing system was on board Atlanta to direct photo planes, <b>smoke</b> <b>rockets</b> and {{hundreds}} of recording instruments, the synchronization of which was essential. The test shots resembled a small nuclear explosion, creating a shock wave {{on the water and}} an expanding shock condensation cloud. The fireball and mushroom cloud were present (but obviously no radiation or dangerous fallout was produced). The blast created an overpressure of 10 psi on the target, a moving wall of highly compressed air with maximum wind speeds of 294mph. An overpressure blast of that magnitude is equivalent to a [...] burst at roughly 8000 feet and is sufficient to be lethal and capable of destroying reinforced concrete buildings. Knowing the yield of the blast, this also implies the Atlanta was placed around 800 feet away from ground zero for that particular test. Two blimps were also destroyed high above ground, and a life size mannequin placed on the deck facing the blast was violently thrown over. The first test Bravo also produced a large amount of rock ejecta that caused secondary damage. To solve this problem, the second shot was placed over a five-foot mound of sand, and the last shot Delta was detonated over the previous crater that was back filled with 39,000 cubic yards of sand.|$|R
60|$|There was a flash, {{a mighty}} burst of flame and <b>smoke,</b> as the <b>rocket</b> trembled {{for an instant}} on its stand; then, with an impulse that seemed irresistible, and a hissing shriek that rose above the storm, it sprang {{into the air and}} {{described}} a bright curved line of light against the black sky.|$|R
60|$|At last all is ready. The rocket, a {{large one}} made of iron, is placed in its stand, a stick and the line are {{attached}} to it, a careful aim is taken, and fire applied. Amid a blaze and burst of <b>smoke</b> the <b>rocket</b> leaps from its position, and rushes out to sea with a furious persistency that even the storm-fiend himself is powerless to arrest. But he can baffle it to some extent--sufficient allowance {{has not been made}} for the force and direction of the wind. The rocket flies, indeed, beyond the wreck, but drops into the sea, a little to the left of her.|$|R
5000|$|The Montreal Rocket were {{a junior}} ice hockey {{team in the}} Quebec Major Junior Hockey League for four seasons from 1999 to 2003, based out of Montreal, Quebec.

In others, the <b>smoke</b> trails of <b>rockets</b> used to create a calibration backdrop can be seen.|$|R
500|$|Typical of most early jets, the Thunderjet's takeoff {{performance}} left {{much to be}} desired.

50|$|In May 1971 the Aeronautical Systems Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, {{began work}} on a project to {{evaluate}} the potential use of armed light utility short takeoff and landing aircraft in Southeast Asia. The program, named Credible Chase, was designed to add mobility and firepower to the South Vietnamese Air Forces {{in a relatively short}} time. Two commercial aircraft were selected for testing: the Fairchild Porter and the Helio Stallion. Initial performance testing was conducted with leased aircraft at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and was successful enough to warrant a combat evaluation. The Porter, designated AU-23A, was fitted with a side-firing 20mm XM-197 Gatling cannon, four wing pylons and a center fuselage station for external ordnance. The 20mm cannon was essentially a three-barrel version of the M61 Vulcan 6-barrel 20mm cannon.

50|$|A {{hard wire}} {{intercom}} {{appears to have}} been provided between Sieber and the engineers in the launch bunker using a system similar to that used in the manned glider flights. Around 1100 am, the M23 was ready for take-off. Low stratus clouds lay over the Ocksenkopf. The Walter liquid-fueled rocket motor built up to full thrust and Sieber pushed the button to ignite the four solid boosters. With a roar, the M23 rose out of a cloud of steam and <b>rocket</b> <b>smoke</b> straight up, displaying its camouflage paintwork. At an altitude of about 100 to 150 m, the Natter suddenly pitched backwards into an inverted curve. Initially it climbed at about 30° to the vertical. At about 500 m the cockpit canopy was seen to fly off. The Natter continued to climb at high speed at an angle of 15° from the horizontal and disappeared into the clouds. The Walter motor stalled about 15 seconds after take-off. It is estimated the Natter reached 1500 m, at which point it nose-dived and hit the ground with great force about 32 seconds later, some kilometres from the launch site. Unknown at the time, one of the Schmidding boosters failed to jettison and its remains were dug up at the crash site in 1998.|$|R
