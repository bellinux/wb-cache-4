Models suit-able for incorporation in dynamic simulation programs used to study angle stability are analyzed. A control strategy for damping of electromechanical power oscillations using an energy function method is derived. Using this control strategy each device (TCSC and SVC) {{will contribute to the}} damping of power swings without deteriorating the effect of the other power oscillation damping (POD) devices. The damping effect is robust with respect to loading condition, fault location and network structure. Furthermore, the control inputs are based on local signals. The effectiveness of the controls are demonstrated for model power systems. Index Terms—Control <b>strategy,</b> <b>energy</b> function, interaction, local variables, POD, power swings, SVC, TCSC.

On the other hand, there is a significant unexploited bioheat potential, especially in the 10 new member states of the EU. In the small-scale heat market the reserves are associated with attracting new users and replacing heating with electricity. In the large-scale heat market segment of industrial self-producers of steam bioheating can be implemented in plants, which generate biomass fuels as by-products or residual products from their main activities. In the large-scale heat market segment of distributed heat comsumption, biomass can gain a larger share by covering new demand and/or by replacing coal, including by way of co-firing biomass with coal.

40|$|Abstract — Simultaneous {{operation}} of multiple network interfaces can benefit mobile devices with diverse network interfaces. This paper outlines an IP-level network activation strategy that aims at optimum {{use of the}} complementary features of the underlying networks. A key design issue in such strategies is the energy cost of different network interfaces. As a step towards validating and fine-tuning our strategy, we devised an experimental setting to measure the relative energy consumption of WiFi and GPRS interfaces in two modern mobile devices. The paper reports the experimental method and results. Our study indicates that the proposed strategy –in this case, reaching devices from the GPRS interface and, whenever appropriate, handing over some sessions to the WiFi interface – is plausible from energy consumption viewpoint {{and in some cases}} it outperforms the existing methods. The energy consumption model obtained will be used to make the network activation <b>strategy</b> <b>energy</b> aware.

Using standardized cost and efficiency data, we carry out a cost benefit analysis to understand the economic factors influencing the sustainability of energy production from renewable sources in light of the energy cost and demand in the Saudi market. Finally, {{we take a look at}} the Saudi petroleum industry and the existing sources of conventional energy and assess the potential of building a successful market for renewable energy under the constraints imposed by the flow of subsidized cheap oil. We show that while some renewable energy resources are well suited for distributed or grid connected generation in the kingdom, their viability is greatly undercut by the well developed and well capitalized oil industry.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a strategy {{based on the}} principal component analysis (PCA) method, which is developed to detect and diagnose the sensor faults in typical air-handling units. Sensor faults are detected using the Q-statistic or squared prediction error (SPE). They are isolated using the SPE and Q-contribution plot supplemented by a few simple expert rules. Two PCA models are built based on the heat balance and pressure-flow balance of the air-handling process, aiming at reducing {{the effects of the}} system non-linearity and enhancing the robustness of the strategy in different control modes. The fault isolation ability of the method is improved using the multiple models. Simulation tests and site data from the building management system (BMS) of a building are used to verify the PCA-based strategy for automatic validation of AHU monitoring instrumentations and detecting/isolating AHU sensor faults under typical operating conditions. The robustness of the PCA-based strategy in detecting/diagnosing AHU sensor faults is verified.

Using the Dutch province of Overijssel as a case study, this study presents a biomass resource potential assessment, based on existing statistics and a resource-focused methodology, to determine the region's theoretical and technical potential. Additionally, a methodological framework is provided to translate the outcome of this biomass resource potential assessment into the policy domain, to allow the region's bioenergy policy ambition to be evaluated. The results indicate that Overijssel's potential bioenergy target is a share of 8. 3 %, which does not match with the desired policy target of 14 %.

40|$|Perceptual {{assessment}} of speech recognition performance with cochlear implants is confronted with problems raised by patients' availability and specificity. These {{problems can be}} avoided by using objective evaluation methods based on automatic classification of speech sounds. In the present report, different tuning strategies for the Digisonic cochlear implant were evaluated by discriminant analysis. The results presented here concern the correct classification of vowels. A set of 600 vocalic items, corresponding to 10 vowel categories and produced by 20 French speakers, were processed by the Digisonic DX 10 with two different strategies. In the linear strategy, center frequencies of the 15 Digisonic channels were almost equally spaced in acoustic units (Hz). In the mel strategy, center frequencies were almost equally spaced in psychoacoustic units. For each <b>strategy,</b> <b>energy</b> levels of the frequency channels were quantified for each vocalic item and processed by statistical discriminant analysis for classification into 10 vowel categories. Results mainly show that the percent correct classification (PCC) is larger for the mel strategy and that the improvement {{is due to a}} higher concentration of frequency channels below 4 kHz. Implications of these results for the tuning of cochlear implants are discussed. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Office {{buildings}} in Santiago of Chile show a high cooling energy demand during summer. Most of these buildings {{are based on}} design patterns of developed countries {{and they do not}} consider the local climate and elemental design strategies for improving their thermal behavior in cooling periods of the year. Due to this, office buildings show overheating problems and a high cooling energy demand. For two buildings of Santiago, preliminary studies through simulations made with TRNSYS, allowed to conclude that some free cooling design strategies-such as nocturnal natural ventilation- are highly effective. Through TRNSYS, {{it is not possible to}} study the effect of wind on natural ventilation of buildings, nor can either quantify the effect caused by the opening of windows in ventilation. In this work we have used TAS, software that allows the indicated studies. This paper shows the feasibility of reaching the necessary ventilation through windows, for an efficient cooling of two buildings already constructed in Santiago. It is observed that using this <b>strategy,</b> <b>energy</b> saving is possible to be obtained. More than 50 % of energy saving respecting to the two studied buildings of Santiago, may be reached when using this effective design strategy...|$|E
40|$|Building Energy Efficiency Retrofit (BEER) is {{considered}} as a valuable way to improve energy efficiency of high-energy-consumption buildings. Sustainable BEER helps integrate sustainable development strategy into existing buildings and retrofit projects. To ensure BEER projects that can fulfill the sustainable development <b>strategy,</b> <b>Energy</b> Performance Contracting (EPC) is one possible market mechanism to deliver energy efficiency projects. Sustainable BEER under the EPC mechanism is a comprehensive system which involves the various demands of sustainable dimensions, performance criteria and groups of project success factors, making multi-criteria decisions become a challenging problem for decision makers. This paper aims to examine the interrelationships of sustainable BEER by focusing on an existing hotel building. EPC mechanism is applied in the case study and an effective Analytic Network Process (ANP) approach is also employed in the research. The result indicates that sustainable BEER in hotel buildings under the EPC mechanism is mainly determined by project control mechanism, available technology, organizing capacity of the team leader, trust, accurate Measurement and Verification (M&V), and team workers' technical skills. Decision makers should dedicate more attention to these aspects. From the research findings, several policy implications are proposed in this paper. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E
40|$|Energy plays a {{key role}} in {{achieving}} the desired economic growth. The entire fabric of developmental goals is webbed around a successful energy <b>strategy.</b> <b>Energy</b> is a pivotal prerequisite of developed economy and social structures. One of the major problems concerning its supply is the depleting nature of the extraction of fossil resources, combined with the need for transition to renewable energy supplies. The last depends on a number of scientific and technological break through. Meanwhile, energy conservation promises to fill the gap between supply and demand. Several measures for conservation of energy are very important for consideration. The conservation of energy, therefore, is using less more wisely than before. Saving a watt is nearly always cheaper than increasing the supply by a watt. The energy industry is one of the most capital intensive. Efficient utilization of energy resource is not only conservational it also saves capital investment. Thus conservation is really the cheapest of energy „resources ‟ at least until its potential is exhausted. In this paper importance of energy management and its benefits are discussed. Use of energy efficient equipments to save energy is proposed...|$|E
