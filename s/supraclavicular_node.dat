40|$|Background: Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of death from cancer in the UK. Pathological {{diagnosis}} traditionally requires invasive procedures such as bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or image guided biopsy. Ultrasound of the neck with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of enlarged but impalpable <b>supraclavicular</b> <b>nodes</b> has been used in patients with suspected lung cancer who have N 2 or N 3 disease on staging computed tomography (CT). If positive, this technique helps to both stage the patient and provide a cytological diagnosis. Methods: 101 patients were enrolled prospectively over a 1 year period. FNAC was performed on all <b>supraclavicular</b> <b>nodes</b> over 5 mm in size using the capillary aspiration technique. Results: Sixty one of the 101 patients had enlarged <b>supraclavicular</b> <b>nodes</b> and underwent FNAC. The overall malignant yield was 45. 5 % of patients scanned and 75. 4 % of patients sampled. As a result of FNAC, 43 patients (42. 6 %) avoided more invasive procedures. Conclusion: Ultrasound guided FNAC is a promising, relatively non-invasive technique for the staging and diagnosis of patients with lung cancer.

Materials and Methods: A total of 29 patients with ISLM {{in the absence of}} distant metastases were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received radical or modified radical mastectomy and systemic therapy. Thirteen patients received <b>supraclavicular</b> lymph <b>node</b> dissection surgery and the other patients were treated with radical radiotherapy. Results: At the median follow-up of 47 months, 23 patients had developed distant metastases. The 3 -year distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates were 46. 2 % for the <b>supraclavicular</b> lymph <b>node</b> dissection group and 31. 3 % for the radical radiotherapy group. The 5 -year overall survival rates were 46. 2 % for the <b>supraclavicular</b> lymph <b>node</b> dissection group and 37. 5 % for the radical radiotherapy group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Desmoplastic {{small round}} cell tumor (DSRCT) is a {{recently}} described neoplasm. This entity is well defined, with distinct clinical, pathologic and immunohistochemical features. Molecular {{studies have shown}} a specific reciprocal translocation t(11; 22) (p 13;q 12). To our knowledge, no report of DSRCT with molecular confirmation on cytologic material has been reported before. CASE: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed on an intraabdominal mass in a 37 -year-old man. A May-Gr-Giemsa-stained preparation showed clusters of small round tumor cells associated with desmoplastic stromal cells, highly suggestive of DSRCT. FNA of a <b>supraclavicular</b> <b>node</b> showed cytologic features {{similar to those of}} the primary abdominal mass, including a prominent desmoplastic reaction of the stroma. Immunocytochemical studies showed myogenic and epithelial differentiation. Molecular analysis was performed on FNA, revealing the EWS/ WT 1 chimeric transcript and thus confirming the cytologic diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Cytomorphologically, a definitive diagnosis of DSRCT may be difficult, as this tumor bears considerable resemblance to other small round cell tumors. The diagnosis can be confirmed by ancillary techniques, such as immunocytochemistry, and particularly by molecular analysis, which may also be performed on cytologic material...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the diagnostic value of fine needle aspiration cytology in the evaluation of palpable <b>supraclavicular</b> lymph <b>nodes.</b> Materials and methods: This was a retrospective study of fine needle aspiration cytology of palpable <b>supraclavicular</b> lymph <b>node</b> done between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2009. Fine needle aspiration cytology was performed on 149 patients (49 cases at Om Hospital & Research Centre and 100 cases at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital). Results: The right <b>supraclavicular</b> lymph <b>node</b> was enlarged in 55 % cases, while the left <b>supraclavicular</b> lymph <b>node</b> alone was palpable in 40. 3 % cases and in 7 of 149 (4. 7 %) cases, bilateral <b>supraclavicular</b> lymph <b>nodes</b> were palpable. Cytological diagnoses were categorized as reactive (8. 7 %), tuberculosis (41. 6 %), lymphoma (4. 8 %) and metastasis (44. 9 %). Of a total of 74 cases of malignancy, 90. 5 % were non-lymphoid and 9. 5 % were lymphoid (5 Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 2 Hodgkin lymphoma). Of the 67 cases of metastatic disease, three major types of malignancy found in <b>supraclavicular</b> lymph <b>nodes</b> were Squamous cell carcinoma (28 cases), adenocarcinoma (21 cases) and others (small cell carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma etc). Adenocarcinoma tended to metastasize to the left <b>supraclavicular</b> lymph <b>node.</b> Lung was the most common primary site (43. 3 %), followed by stomach, ovary, breast and larynx. However, in 28. 4 % cases, no primary site was found.

Aims : An endeavor was made to use CG on aspirates of breast carcinoma using Robinson&#x 2032;s grade and to correlate it with Bloom Richardsons&#x 2032; histopathological grading. Materials and Methods : A total of 59 patients of breast carcinoma, aged 28 - 57 years, were aspirated and the smears were graded using Robinson&#x 2032;s criteria. All the cases were correlated with Bloom Richardson&#x 2032;s grade on histopathology in mastectomy specimens.

This study aimed to map the location of metastatic supraclavicular lymph nodes in thoracic esophageal carcinoma patients with <b>supraclavicular</b> <b>node</b> involvement and generate an atlas to delineate the CTVn for elective nodal radiation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Patients and methods: In this study, the supraclavicular regional lymph node was further divided into four subgroups. The locations of the involved supraclavicular nodes for all patients were then transferred onto a template computed tomography (CT) image. A volume probability map was then generated with nodal volumes, and was displayed on the template CT to provide a visual impression of nodal frequencies and anatomic distribution. Results: We identified 154 supraclavicular nodal metastases based on CT image in 96 patients.

40|$|Predicting {{outcome of}} breast cancer (BC) {{patients}} based on sentinel lymph node (SLN) status without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) {{is an area of}} uncertainty. It influences the decision-making for regional nodal irradiation (RNI). The aim of the NORA (NOdal RAdiotherapy) survey was to examine the patterns of RNI. A web-questionnaire, including several clinical scenarios, was distributed to 88 EORTC-affiliated centers. Responses were received between July 2013 and January 2014. A total of 84 responses were analyzed. While three-dimensional (3 D) radiotherapy (RT) planning is carried out in 81 (96 %) centers, nodal areas are delineated in only 51 (61 %) centers. Only 14 (17 %) centers routinely link internal mammary chain (IMC) and <b>supraclavicular</b> <b>node</b> (SCN) RT indications. In patients undergoing total mastectomy (TM) with ALND, SCN-RT is recommend by 5 (6 %), 53 (63 %) and 51 (61 %) centers for patients with pN 0 (i+), pN(mi) and pN 1, respectively. Extra-capsular extension (ECE) is the main factor influencing decision-making RNI after breast conserving surgery (BCS) and TM. After primary systemic therapy (PST), 49 (58 %) centers take into account nodal fibrotic changes in ypN 0 patients for RNI indications. In ypN 0 patients with inner/central tumors, 23 (27 %) centers indicate SCN-RT and IMC-RT. In ypN 1 patients, SCN-RT is delivered by {{less than half of the}} centers in patients with ypN(i+) and ypN(mi). Twenty-one (25 %) of the centers recommend ALN-RT in patients with ypN(mi) or 1 - 2 N+ after ALND. Seventy-five (90 %) centers state that age is not considered a limiting factor for RNI. The NORA survey is unique in evaluating the impact of SLNB/ALND status on adjuvant RNI decision-making and volumes after BCS/TM with or without PST. ALN-RT is often indicated in pN 1 patients, particularly in the case of ECE. Besides the ongoing NSABP-B 51 /RTOG and ALLIANCE trials, NORA could help to design future specific RNI trials in the SLNB era without ALND in patients receiving or not PS...|$|E
40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) {{is the most}} accurate imaging modalities to detect malignancies. And it helps to take decisions regarding diagnosis, staging, recurrence, and therapeutical management. We report {{a case of a}} suspected <b>supraclavicular</b> lymph <b>node</b> relapse, diagnosed by PET-CT in a breast cancer patient. The lymph node was surgically removed in outpatient with local anesthesia. Histological findings diagnosed a benign Schwannoma. In this patient PET-CT failed to distinguish benign tumors from metastatic <b>supraclavicular</b> lymph <b>nodes.</b> This case confirms the need to investigate histologically suspected supraclavicular lesions, during breast cancer follow up...|$|R
