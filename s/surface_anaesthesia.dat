25|$|The {{efficacy}} {{profile of}} lidocaine {{as a local}} anaesthetic {{is characterized by a}} rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and <b>surface</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action. Adrenaline vasoconstricts arteries, reducing bleeding and also delays the resorption of lidocaine, almost doubling the duration of anaesthesia. For <b>surface</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations, etc. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes local numbing less painful. Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> {{is given}} by {{instillation}} of 2.5 ml xylocaine. One drop of xylocaine instilled four times after every 4 minutes will produce conjunctival and corneal anaesthesia. Paracaine, tetracaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine etc. may also be used in place of xylocaine. Cataract surgery by phacoemulsification is frequently performed under <b>surface</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Facial nerve, which supplies the orbicularis oculi muscle, is blocked in addition for intraocular surgeries. Topical anaesthesia is known to cause endothelial and epithelial toxicity, allergy and surface keratopathy.|$|E
40|$|The basic physicochemical, acidobasic and lipohilicity {{parameters}} of piperidinomethyl esters of 2 - and 3 -alkyloxyphenylcarbamic acid were estimated. For the prepared {{set of the}} compounds the experimentally obtained acidity (pKa) and lipophilicity (RM, log k´, log Pexp) outputs were correlated with those computed using the programs and the program packages based on the atom [...] additive, fragmental and artificial neural network methods (ANN).

40|$|The transdiaphragmatic {{pressure}} (Pdi) generated during bilateral supramaximal phrenic {{nerve stimulation}} at 1 Hz from surface stimulating electrodes was compared with pressures obtained from needle electrodes inserted under local <b>anaesthesia.</b> <b>Surface</b> electrodes {{were used to}} obtain diaphragmatic electromyograms and magnetometers to monitor rib cage and abdominal configuration. Twitch Pdi was recorded at functional residual capacity in three normal subjects. Mean (SD) twitch Pdi in the three subjects during stimulation with surface electrodes was 19. 4 (1. 8), 22. 5 (1. 1), and 29. 3 (2. 2) cm H 2 O compared with 12. 9 (1. 5), 17 : 4 (1. 3), and 22. 6 (3. 0) cm H 2 O with needle stimulating electrodes. Thus phrenic nerve stimulation with needle electrodes was more complicated and more invasive than stimulation with surface electrodes and resulted in lower transdiaphragmatic pressures...|$|R
30|$|External cooling by a ‘hypothermic bed’ {{decreased}} MAP, {{cardiac output}} {{and heart rate}} after isolated haemorrhagic shock [30, 49, 53]. The cardiovascular adaption to hypothermia after haemorrhage obviously consists of an early heart rate-induced reduction of cardiac output and a later decrease of MAP [30]. Under primary limited (SAP > 80  mmHg) and subsequent full (SAP > 90  mmHg) resuscitation and deep <b>anaesthesia,</b> <b>surface</b> cooling by means of ice packs to 33 °C (0.5 °C to 1 °C/h) resulted in a significantly improved survival rate compared to normothermia [45] in an isolated haemorrhagic shock model. In contrast, the same group only observed a trend towards improved survival and a transient elevation of markers of organ function after combined trauma and hypothermia induction to 34.5 °C. Possible explanations may be the shorter hypothermic period and the milder degree of hypothermia in the latter study [42].|$|R

50|$|Nearly all ocular {{surgeries}} viz keratoplasty, cataract extraction, glaucoma surgery, iridectomy, strabismus, retinal detachment surgery etc. can be {{done under}} regional anaesthesia. Conjunctiva, globe and orbicularis can be paralysed {{using a combination of}} <b>surface</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> facial anaesthesia and retrobulbar block. The advantage is that it produces less post-operative restlessness. It has less post-operative lung complications and less bleeding.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} topically applied lignocaine {{ointment}} to produce <b>surface</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> was examined in 45 preterm infants (gestational age 25 to 35 weeks) at a {{median age of}} 2 days. Two strengths of ointment, 5 % and 30 %, were tested at 30 and 60 minutes after application to the dorsum of the foot. Anaesthesia was assessed by comparing the response to skin stimulation at the test and control sites, using von Frey hairs.

30|$|Besides the technique, {{degree and}} {{duration}} of induced hypothermia, the velocity of decreasing body temperature has a significant impact as well. Takasu et al. found that under light <b>anaesthesia,</b> <b>surface</b> cooling (evaporation cooling and ice packs) during severe haemorrhagic shock without any fluid resuscitation failed to decrease core temperature and even shortened the survival time in pigs. Moreover, animals in the surface cooling group exhibited a more pronounced decline of MAP, arterial pH and cardiac index than the normothermic group [47]. It was supposed that a continual and prolonged attempt to reduce the core temperature added additional stress and reduced the survival rate [41]. However, rapid extracorporeal cooling to 34.5 °C resulted in a significantly increased survival with higher MAP and stroke volume index {{as well as a}} lower heart rate compared to normothermic animals in the same model [41]. Accordingly, Alam et al. described hypothermia to be most effective if rapidly induced with a rate of 2 °C/min (compared to 1 °C or 0.5 °C).|$|R
40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} {{working group}} from the German Society of Hospital Hygiene (DGKH) and the German Society for Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (DGAI) worked out the following recommendations for infection prevention during anaesthesia by using breathing system filters (BSF). The BSF shall be changed after each patient. The filter retention efficiency for airborne particles is recommended to be > 99 % (II). The retention performance of BSF for liquids is recommended to be at pressures of at least 60 hPa (= 60 mbar) or 20 hPa above the selected maximum ventilation pressure in the anaesthetic system. The anaesthesia breathing system {{may be used for}} a period of up to 7 days provided that the functional requirements of the system remain unchanged and the manufacturer states this in the instructions for use. The breathing system and the manual ventilation bag are changed immediately after the respective anaesthesia if the following situation has occurred or it is suspected to have occurred: Notifiable infectious disease involving the risk of transmission via the breathing system and the manual bag, e. g. tuberculosis, acute viral hepatitis, measles, influenza virus, infection and/or colonisation with a multi-resistant pathogen or upper or lower respiratory tract infections. In case of visible contamination e. g. by blood or in case of defect, it is required that the BSF and also the anaesthesia breathing system is changed and the breathing gas conducting parts of the anaesthesia ventilator are hygienically reprocessed. Observing of the appropriate hand disinfection is very important. All <b>surfaces</b> of the <b>anaesthesia</b> equipment exposed to hand contact must be disinfected after each case...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{assess the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of EMLA cream (eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics) used to induce <b>surface</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> for venepuncture in healthy preterm infants.  METHODS—Nineteen infants, median gestational age 31 weeks (range 26 - 33 weeks) were assessed in a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over trial. Changes in physiological variables (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation) and behavioural responses (neonatal facial coding system score, crying time) before and after venepuncture with EMLA cream were compared with those obtained with a placebo cream to assess efficacy. Toxicity was assessed by comparing methaemoglobin concentrations at 1 hour and 8 hours after application.  RESULTS—There {{was no significant difference}} in efficacy between EMLA and placebo creams in physiological and behavioural responses. There {{was no significant difference in}} methaemoglobin concentrations one hour after the cream had been applied. At eight hours, however, concentrations were significantly higher after EMLA than placebo (p= 0. 016). There was no evidence of clinical toxicity.  CONCLUSION—This study does not support the routine use of EMLA for venepuncture in healthy preterm infants. ...|$|E
