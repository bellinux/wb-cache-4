40|$|The project {{involves}} {{designing and}} prototyping new antennas {{adapted to the}} use of RFID technology in the processes of a shop, particularly in real-time inventory and location of all products, and antitheft control. Carry out real-time inventories and location of products reduces the processing time and costs invested in certain respects. Then, the purpose is to eliminate the maximum number of losses and make the stay of a customer in the store as comfortable as possible. Traditional RFID antennas have been designed to work in logistics and warehouse environments. In a shop, the antenna must be adapted to various commercial equipments, such as <b>shelves,</b> <b>sales</b> desks, doors, fitting rooms, etc. Moreover, distribution networks signal to the antenna must be adapted to an environment with a density of antennas higher than usual in logistic applications. This project is part of what is known as ambient intelligence, because it provides a store with a real-time knowledge of what is happening...|$|R

The gamble worked, and within 30 days, sales zoomed. In 1934, the company built a $60,000 addition to the Naugatuck plant and invested still more in new machinery to meet demand, using earnings to pay for expansion without incurring debt. In 1934, the company introduced a new product, the Dreams candy bar, named by students participating in a contest at Naugatuck High School. It consisted of diced almonds and coconut covered with dark chocolate, becoming the forerunner of the Almond Joy bar.

The third scenario is the Decentralized Coordinated Scenario where we give conditions for coordinating the channel under a buyback contract.
