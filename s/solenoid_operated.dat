40|$|A Claude cycle {{refrigerator}} with a three stage reciprocating expansion {{engine is}} described. Instead of a cam mechanism, valves are driven directly by magnetic <b>solenoids</b> <b>operated</b> {{by means of}} a micro processor control system.

5000|$|For the 1968 model year, the Volkswagen Beetle {{offered an}} {{optional}} transmission marketed as Automatic Stickshift which {{was essentially a}} three-speed manual without a clutch pedal. Application of the driver's hand to gearshift knob caused the clutch to disengage via a 12 volt <b>solenoid</b> <b>operating</b> the vacuum clutch, thereby allowing shifting between gears. Once the driver's hand was removed, the clutch would re-engage automatically. The transmission was also equipped with a torque converter, allowing the car to idle in gear, like an automatic. The torque converter was operated by transmission fluid. This would allow the car to stop in any gear and start from a standing stop in any gear. This transmission was first available on the 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and was made available on the Karmann Ghia in 1967. VW dropped the transmission option altogether in 1976.

50|$|The {{starter motor}} is a series, compound, or {{permanent}} magnet type electric motor with a solenoid and <b>solenoid</b> <b>operated</b> switch mounted on it. When low-current {{power from the}} starting battery {{is applied to the}} starter solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch, the solenoid closes high-current contacts for the starter motor and it starts to run.

40|$|The Cooler Synchrotron (COSY) {{located at}} the Forschungszentrum Jülich along with the EDDA {{scintillation}} detectors have been used with a 0. 97 -GeV/c polarized deuteron beam to demonstrate the feasibility of high efficiency polarimetry, correction of systematic errors, and long spin coherence times {{in preparation for the}} design and construction of a new storage ring to search for an electric dipole moment on the proton, deuteron, or other light nuclei. Slow extraction of the stored beam onto a 1. 5 -cm thick carbon target yielded an efficiency (usefully detected particles divided by particles lost from the beam) near 10 ‒ 3 and average 3 Ay/ 2 = 0. 67 (4). Calibration of the polarimeter’s sensitivity to geometric and rate-induced systematic errors made possible the real time correction of such errors based on combinations of the primary detector rates to the level of 10 ‒ 5 with the prospect for lower errors in the EDM search.

5000|$|Like the {{standard}} WRX, {{the third generation}} model was shortened to [...] "Subaru WRX STI", with the Japanese markets notably abstaining from this convention. To differentiate the STI from the regular WRX, Subaru opted to manufacture the STI with a wider body and therefore track—as noted by the flared wheel arches. Furthermore, Subaru utilized aluminum suspension components for the STI. Electronic modifications include a multi-mode electronic stability control with [...] "normal", [...] "traction", and [...] "off" [...] modes; Subaru Intelligent-Drive (SI-Drive) with three modes: [...] "intelligent", [...] "sport", and [...] "sport sharp"; and multi-mode driver controlled center differential (DCCD).

5000|$|In 1980, the Citation X-11 shared {{most of its}} {{powertrain}} {{with the}} standard Citation, with the model being mostly a chassis and visual upgrade. Alongside the alloy wheels and tires, the X-11 featured a trunklid spoiler, sport mirrors, body skirting, and side striping. In 1981, to better distinguish the model from standard two-tone Citations, the side striping of the X-11 was replaced in favor of large [...] "X-11" [...] door graphic, which remained in use {{for the rest of}} its production. The model is best distinguished from a standard Citation by its use of a black grille (the only exterior chrome trim on a Citation II X-11 is the Chevrolet grille bowtie and trunklid badging).

40|$|The LBNL 3 rd Generation ECR {{ion source}} has progressed from a concept to the {{fabrication}} {{of a full}} scale prototype superconducting magnet structure. This new ECR ion source will combine the recent ECR ion source techniques that significantly enhance the production of high charge state ions.

50|$|In {{most modern}} installations, an {{electronic}} device called a tachometric relay or safety switch {{is used to}} operate electrical shut-off solenoids. These work by sensing that the engine is running by detecting ignition pulses. Some systems use an engine oil pressure sensor instead. In all installations, there is a filterlock (consisting of a filter assembly and a vacuum or electric <b>solenoid</b> <b>operated</b> shut-off valve) located at the input to the converter. In European converters, {{there is also a}} solenoid in the converter to shut off the idle circuit. These valves are usually both connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. Where solenoids are fitted to the outputs of fuel tanks, these are also connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. In installations with multiple tanks, a switch or changeover relay may be fitted to allow the driver to select which tank to use fuel from. On bi-fuel, the switch used to change between fuels is used to turn off the tachometric relay.|$|E
50|$|The natural design {{progression}} from the Lotec was the Pullman combination motorcycle.

The first Austel Pullman prototype appeared in 1987 with a Mini 850cc engine, shaft drive, <b>solenoid</b> <b>operated</b> handlebar mounted gear change, drum brakes, Austel 8 spoke steel wheels and leading link anti dive front forks. The production models were revised to have 1300cc engines, full duplex frame with box section swing arm, twin front disc brakes with single rear disc and a front-mounted radiator. With the sidecar attached it was then {{possible to have a}} manual gearbox with hand gear stick although this meant the gear selection was rotated 90 degrees due the engine being positioned longitudinally in the frame. The sidecar choice was down to the customer and could be fitted with a fuel tank in the boot for greater capacity and a dummy tank on the bike that could be removed easily for engine maintenance. No two Austel motorcycles were ever the same due to design developments and customer requirements.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research in}} the area of solenoid modelling and design. It is anticipated that the model described will contribute to the design of solenoids for operation in an intrinsically safe environment Firstly, the requirements for intrinsic safety are described including an overview of the complete system. The relevant standards to be applied are highlighted and the optimum power rating for a solenoid working in an intrinsically safe system is derived. The mathematical model is then described together with the assumptions made. The model is able to determine the most efficient gauge of wire to use for a given solenoid resistance from the dimensions of a solenoid coil former, and from this data calculate the expected force generated by the solenoid. The basis of the model is the probable flux path method of solenoid analysis. The method for verifying the model are then discussed as well as a complete analysis of an existing intrinsically safe solenoids. The purpose for the analysis of an existing solenoid was undertaken so that a set of solenoid design rules may be established. The design rules will enable the user to design for the exact requirements for the pneumatic comppnents based on the <b>solenoid</b> <b>operating</b> pressure. Finally, methods for reducing the manufacturing time and improving the assembly time of the solenoid are presented...|$|R

Dynamic brakes were the service brake on all PCCs; when almost stopped, friction brakes completed the stop {{and held the}} car in [...] "park".
