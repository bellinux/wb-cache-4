5|$|There {{are large}} {{deposits}} of petroleum (as {{oil and natural}} gas) in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore {{oil and gas production}} can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead, and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage and oil may be <b>spilt.</b>|$|E
40|$|Oil <b>Spill</b> Intelligence Report (OSIR) and Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS) data {{indicate}} that similarities and differences exist in the characteristics of inland and coastal oil <b>spills.</b> This paper examines data on reported oil <b>spills</b> {{over the last few}} years, comparing inland and coastal <b>spill</b> characteristics such as the number of <b>spills,</b> <b>spill</b> sizes, <b>spill</b> sources, and the types of oil <b>spilled.</b> Previous studies indicated that vessels are a major source of inland oil <b>spills</b> and that refined petroleum products dominate inland <b>spills</b> whereas crude oil <b>spills</b> are common in coastal areas. However, our examination of data on large <b>spills</b> in recent years indicates that pipelines are a much more significant <b>spill</b> source in inland waters than vessels. Recent reports also indicate that large <b>spills</b> of crude oil often occur in inland areas. Finally, although coastal <b>spills</b> tend to be highly publicized, the majority of large oil <b>spills</b> in the United States are to inland areas. <b>Spills</b> to inland areas often affect sensitive environments and can have greater impacts to public health and welfare than <b>spills</b> to coastal areas.

On migration and during the winter, the ruff eats insects (including caddis flies, water-beetles, mayflies and grasshoppers), crustaceans, spiders, molluscs, worms, frogs, small fish, and also the seeds of rice and other cereals, sedges, grasses and aquatic plants. Migrating birds in Italy varied their diet according to what was available at each stopover site.

Oil <b>spill</b> cleanup response costs depend on a variety of factors, most notably, location, oil type, <b>spill</b> size, and cleanup strategy, making it difficult to develop a universal per-unit cost factor. This study analyzes marine oil <b>spill</b> cleanup costs on the basis of country, proximity to shoreline, <b>spill</b> size, oil type, degree of shoreline oiling, and cleanup methodology to determine how each of these factors impacts per-unit cleanup costs. The results show that oil <b>spill</b> responses in different countries and regions of the world vary considerably in their costs most likely due to differences in cultural values, socio-economic factors, and labor costs. Location, oil type, and <b>spill</b> size also factor heavily in determining cleanup costs.

5|$|Beginning in the 7th {{millennium}} BCE, {{human populations}} {{moved into the}} Chadian basin in great numbers. By {{the end of the}} 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital {{and put an end to}} the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby.

5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version {{of that kind of}} dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood <b>spilt</b> by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E
5|$|Most oil {{pollution}} in the sea comes from cities and industry. Oil is dangerous for marine animals. It can clog the feathers of sea birds, reducing their insulating effect and the birds' buoyancy, or be ingested when they preen themselves {{in an attempt to}} remove the contaminant. Marine mammals are less seriously affected but may be chilled through the removal of their insulation, blinded, dehydrated, or poisoned. Benthic invertebrates are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned, and the food chain is disrupted. In the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced, leisure activities being affected, and the livelihoods of people dependent on the sea being devastated. The marine environment has self-cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria will act over time to remove oil from the sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, where oil-eating bacteria are already present, they take only a few days to consume <b>spilt</b> oil.|$|E

The mysterious red-coated figure and its association with death has a direct parallel with an earlier film Roeg worked on as cinematographer, The Masque of the Red Death, which depicted a red clad Grim Reaper character.

5|$|Water is an {{important}} resource for colonies living in dry and arid environments, but sometimes {{it may not be}} available. To counter this, workers are able to extract a significant amount of water from the sand with 2%–4% water content and 4% from the soil. Meat ants are unable to retrieve as much water from the soil, whereas with sand they are able to attain a greater amount of water; however, the soil contains a wide variety of particles, including clay and coarse sand, which causes water to be bound firmly. Ants may retrieve it by digging or directly suck on the soil itself at a low metabolic cost. This may be an evolved response based on tested ants, but no observations show meat ants doing this. Meat ants are known to dig into moist soil to gain access to water or where water has been <b>spilt,</b> either if the site is nearby their nest or far away.|$|E

40|$|Overall, oil {{spillage}} from vessels throughout the US has decreased significantly since 1990 and {{the enactment of}} the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). Nearly 20 times more oil was being <b>spilled</b> annually by vessels in before 1990 than is currently being <b>spilled.</b> The number of <b>spills</b> of 500 gallons or more have decreased since 1990. The reporting of smaller <b>spills</b> has increased since 1985, but the incidence of these <b>spills</b> has decreased since 1990. The reasons for <b>spill</b> reductions with OPA 90 are varied and complex. There are reductions noted even before some of the prevention measures associated with OPA 90 have been implemented. There is speculation that these <b>spill</b> reductions {{may be related to the}} increasing costs of oil <b>spills</b> and unlimited liability, and the resulting greater “care ” that vessel owners and operators are exercising, as well as the higher class of vessels transiting US waters based on financial and insurance requirements.

40|$|<b>Spill</b> {{prevention}} is prudent both economically and environmentally, because <b>spills</b> increase operating costs and lower productivity. An important tool in preventing <b>spills</b> is a <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan. A <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan specifies materials handling procedures and storage requirements and identifies <b>spill</b> cleanup procedures for areas and processes in which <b>spills</b> may potentially occur. The plan standardizes process operating procedures and employee training {{in an effort}} to minimize accidental pollutant releases that could contaminate storm water runoff. <b>Spill</b> prevention should be part of a comprehensive Best Management Practice program to prevent runoff contamination. This program should also include storm water contamination assessment, flow diversion, record keeping, internal reporting, employee training, and preventive maintenance. Typically, most businesses and public agencies that generate hazardous waste and/or produce, transport, or store petroleum products are required by State and federal law to prepare <b>spill</b> control and cleanup plans. Therefore, a <b>Spill</b> Prevention and Response Plan may have already been developed as a result of other environmental regulatory requirements. Existing plans should be re-evaluated and revised to address storm water management issues. APPLICABILITY A <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan is applicable to facilities that transport, transfer, and/or store hazardous materials, petroleum products, or fertilizers that can contaminate storm water runoff. An important part of an effective <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan is establishing a method for quick notification of the appropriate emergency response teams {{in the event of a}} <b>spill.</b> In some plants, each area or process may have a separate team leader and/or response team. Figure 1 illustrates a sample <b>spill</b> prevention team roster that can help in quick identification of <b>Spill</b> Prevention team leaders and their responsibilities.
