Experiments were conducted in three different sizes {{in each of the}} geometrically similar unbaffled square and circular <b>surface</b> <b>aerators.</b> Results have shown that the P- 0 cannot be simulated singularly either with Reynolds number R or with Froude number as there are scale effects; hence {{there appears to be a}} need for incorporating the effects of both R and F.

Interestingly P- 0 values are always higher in square <b>surface</b> <b>aerators</b> than in circular <b>surface</b> <b>aerators,</b> which suggests that the circular <b>surface</b> <b>aerators</b> require less power input than the square <b>surface</b> <b>aerators.</b> The usefulness of such correlations was demonstrated in estimating the power requirement while achieving a required oxygen transfer coefficient in <b>surface</b> <b>aerators...</b>|$|R

40|$|Intensification of {{agricultural}} practices {{has led to}} the production of liquid slurries in sufficient volumes that prohibits year round application. To reduce the risk of environmental pollution from inappropriate land applications, slurry is stored along with parlour and yard washings during the winter months, resulting in the accumulation of large volumea During storage, anaerobic conditions prevail, resulting in the breakdown of biological compounds into noxious and toxic chemicals which are of primary concern in environmental pollution. The introduction of large scale anaerobic digesters on every firm is impractical, as extensive supervision of the digester is required. The problems associated with the application of anaerobically stored shiny back to land, such as noxious odours, ground and surface water pollution and crop scorching are no longer tolerated by the general public and government pollution agencies. To alleviate some of the problems faced by farmers storing large quantities of slurry, aerobic treatment systems have been devised that can reduce the risk of pollution. Slurry aeration has become a widely used method in the treatment of cattle slurry, as it is effective in reducing odours, preventing crust formation and provides a semihomogenous mixture. The aeration system can vary dramatically in design and operation, from very simple bubble diffusers consisting of holes pierced into pipes which are laid across the floor of a tank, to complex Venturi systems which rely on the generation of negative pressures from tapered nozzles to draw air into a stream of slurry. The aeration systems used in this thesis are of a fine bubble difiliser and a mechanical <b>surface</b> <b>aerator</b> design. These systems were chosen because of their low capital and running costs. Aeration efficiency was studied at three scales, laboratory (up to 1 litre), intermediate (up to 80 litres) and pilot (up to 10, 000 litres) using volumetric mass transfer coefficient, standard oxygen transfer rate and oxygenation efficiency as the testing criteria. The fine bubble diffuser used throughout all the scale up experiments was of the same principle. Air was delivered through a compressor which was isolated outside of the reaction vessel. Sufficient air was delivered to the slurry at all scales to prevent the need for an additional mixing unit to maintain the solids in suspension. However, at pilot scale the design of the diffuser layout as critical in order to prevent biological fouling of the material. The mechanical <b>surface</b> <b>aerator</b> used at pilot scale was placed within the centre of the reaction vessel and could only be accessed by removing it from the tank. The mode of operation was to thaw liquid up through a central volumetric screw and release it radially outwards above the suthce of the liquid. The ability of the mechanical suthce aerator to transfer oxygen to both water and slurry was higher than that of the fine bubble difibser, with concomitant higher kLa, SOTK and OE being recorded. The introduction of oxygen into cattle slurry had two effects, the generation of a stable microbial culture and a major reduction in physical and chemical pollutants, such as chemical oxygen demand, total solids and total suspended solids. Each aeration device generated a microbial population which was distinctive in gross morphology and settling characteristic& Both microbial populations flocculated naturally and quickly settled to a clear liquor and brown sludge. Flocs generated through violent aeration were small and compact, unlike the large feathery flocs generated by the fine bubble diffliser. The mechanical <b>surface</b> <b>aerator</b> achieved higher reductions in all the measured pollutants than the fine bubble difihiser, with reductions of 75...|$|E

This work was then validated by a numerical modeling using the commercial code Fluent, and the flow within the tank as well as the evolution of the hydrodynamic parameters was also studied. The simulation is steady state with a VOF multiphase model and the realizable k-epsilon turbulence model. We finally concluded that k(L) a decreases with the increase of the inclination angle and with the increase of the submergence of our turbine.

40|$|Dissolved oxygen {{refers to}} the mass of oxygen that is {{contained}} in water. The concentration of dissolved oxygen is an important indicator of the environments water quality. The presence of oxygen in water is desirable therefore it is a positive sign; whereas the absence of oxygen {{is a sign of}} severe pollution. An adequate supply of dissolved oxygen is important for waste water treatment processes. Many naturally occurring biological and chemical processes use oxygen, thereby diminishing the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water. The physical process of oxygen transfer or oxygen absorption from the atmosphere acts to replenish the used oxygen. This process has been termed aeration. Aeration is the primary requirement of the biological treatment of water and wastewater treatment. As reported in the literature, the aeration process consumes as much as 60 - 80 % of total power requirements in wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, it is necessary that the design and operation of aeration process should be economized in terms of their energy efficiency. The performance of surface aeration systems is rated in terms of their oxygen transfer rate; hence the choice of a particular surface aeration system depends on its performance and efficiency of oxygen transfer rates. Oxygen transfer rate and the corresponding power requirement to rotate the rotor are very vital parameters for the design and scale-up of surface aerators. Basically two types of operation are in use for surface aeration systems – batch operation and continuous operation. Batch operation involves a single vessel which is filled, aerated then completely emptied. Continuous operation method of operating a biological treatment plant is characterized by a steady input stream (in terms of chemical and biological composition and flow rate, when flow and concentration equalization is practiced), steady process conditions during the treatment steps and by a fairly consistent flow of treated material with only little variation in its composition. The work presented in this thesis consists of two parts. The first one deals with the experimental investigations on the three types of batch surface aeration tanks. A comprehensive design analysis has been worked out and presented on these types of surface aeration systems. In the second category, experimental investigations have been carried out extensively on continuous flow surface aeration systems of different sizes. Analysis has led to the formulation of optimal geometric dimension and the simulation criteria for the design purposes. As far as the first category of investigations is concerned, a substantial work has been reported on batch surface aerators on various issues, during the past several years. Still, a general methodology to scale up or scale down the process phenomena is lacking. In the present work, experiments were done on different shaped batch surface aeration system for generalizing or devising the scale up and scale down criteria for oxygen transfer coefficient and power consumption. Present work through experimental observations established that unbaffled circular tanks are more energy efficient than baffled when used as <b>surface</b> <b>aerator.</b> Power consumption in surface aeration systems is characterized by a fundamental non-dimensional parameter named power number. This number relates drag force to the inertial force in fluid flow system. Power number scaling up of unbaffled surface aerators of square, circular and rectangular shaped tanks {{is one of the most}} important contributions of the present work. Design charts have been developed for all the three shape of tanks for the installation as the batch surface aeration systems. Based on the experimental analyses in the present work, it was found that circular shape is the most efficient than any other shape and it is also established that generally a number of smaller sized tanks were more economic and efficient than using a single big tank while aerating the same volume of water. Based on the energy economy analysis, present work suggests the optimal speed range of batch systems of different shaped surface aeration tanks. Different sized rectangular aeration tanks with different aspect ratios (that is length to width ratio) were tested along with a series of square and circular tanks for comparing their relative performances. Present work by doing experiments answered this fact and found that square tank (aspect ratio = 1) was more efficient than any other aspect ratio rectangular tanks. Vortexes are inherently present in any type of unbaffled tanks. Present work analyzed the vortex behavior of unbaffled surface aeration systems to determine the critical impeller speed in unbaffled batch surface aeration systems at which oxygen transfer rates are more. The second part of the present work establishes the optimal geometrical parameters of a continuous flow surface aeration systems. These types of operations were found to be least reported in the available literature and there appears to be of no report in the literature on optimal geometrical parameters. Extensive experimental work is reported in the present thesis on the establishment of the optimal geometrical parameters of continuous flow surface aeration systems. From there, simulation criteria are established by maintaining optimal geometrical similarity in different sized continuous flow surface aeration tanks; so that the scale up or scale down criteria can be applied to predict oxygen transfer rates and power number...|$|E

Electricity forces the paddles to turn, churning the water and allowing oxygen transfer through air-water contact. As each new section of water is churned, it absorbs oxygen from the air and then upon its return to the water, restores it to the water.
