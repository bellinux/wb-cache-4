25|$|Adenosine is used {{intravenously}} for terminating <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardias.|$|E
25|$|The diving reflex {{is used in}} {{clinical}} practice {{as a means to}} treat <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia. This {{is an example of a}} vagal maneuver, whereby the vagus nerve is stimulated in order to block the atrioventricular node, which interrupts the abnormal electrical circuit taking place in a <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia. This is especially useful in infants in whom the diving reflex is well-preserved, allowing the valsalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage to be more appropriate.|$|E
25|$|Amiodarone {{has been}} used both in the {{treatment}} of acute life-threatening arrhythmias as well as the chronic suppression of arrhythmias. It is used both in <b>supraventricular</b> arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias.|$|E
25|$|Amiodarone is an {{antiarrhythmic}} medication used {{to treat}} and prevent a number of types of irregular heartbeats. This includes ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and wide complex tachycardia, as well as atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia. It can be given by mouth, intravenously, or intraosseously. When used by mouth, it can take a few weeks for effects to begin.|$|E
25|$|High-risk {{features}} {{that may be}} present during PES include an effective refractory period of the accessory pathway less than 250 ms, multiple pathways, septal location of pathway, and inducibility of <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia (AVRT, atrial fibrillation). Individuals {{with any of these}} high-risk features are generally considered at increased risk for SCD or symptomatic tachycardia, and should be treated accordingly (i.e.: catheter ablation).|$|E
25|$|Wolff–Parkinson–White {{syndrome}} (WPW) is {{a disorder}} {{due to a}} specific type of problem with the electrical system of the heart which has resulted in symptoms. About 40% of people with the electrical problem never develop symptoms. Symptoms can include an abnormally fast heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or syncope. Rarely cardiac arrest may occur. The most common type of irregular heartbeat that occurs is known as paroxysmal <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} {{is diagnosed}} on an electrocardiogram (ECG), an investigation performed routinely whenever an irregular heart beat is suspected. Characteristic findings are {{the absence of}} P waves, with disorganized electrical activity in their place, and irregular R–R intervals due to irregular conduction of impulses to the ventricles. At very fast heart rates, atrial fibrillation may look more regular, which may {{make it more difficult}} to separate from other <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardias or ventricular tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF or A-fib) is {{an abnormal}} heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atria. Often it starts as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time. Often episodes have no symptoms. Occasionally {{there may be}} heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. The disease is {{associated with an increased}} risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke. It is a type of <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|An esophogeal lead can be {{inserted}} to {{a part of}} the esophagus where the distance to the posterior wall of the left atrium is only approximately 5–6mm (remaining constant in people of different age and weight). An esophageal lead avails for a more accurate differentiation between certain cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial flutter, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. It can also evaluate the risk in people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, as well as terminate <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia caused by re-entry.|$|E
500|$|Destiny Hope Cyrus {{was born}} November 23, 1992, in Franklin, Tennessee, to Leticia Jean [...] "Tish" [...] Cyrus (née Finley) and singer Billy Ray Cyrus. Cyrus {{was born with}} <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia, a {{condition}} which causes an abnormal resting heart rate. Her birth name, Destiny Hope, reflects her parents' belief that she would accomplish great things, and she was given the nickname [...] "Smiley", later shortened to [...] "Miley", because she often smiled as an infant. She changed her name to Miley Ray Cyrus; her middle name honors her grandfather, Democratic politician Ronald Ray Cyrus.|$|E
500|$|Consuming Coprinopsis atramentaria {{within a}} few hours of alcohol results in a [...] "disulfiram syndrome". This {{interaction}} has only been known since {{the early part of the}} twentieth century. Symptoms include facial reddening, nausea, vomiting, malaise, agitation, palpitations and tingling in limbs, and arise five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol. If no more alcohol is consumed, they will generally subside over two or three hours. Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed, becoming evident when blood alcohol concentration reaches 5mg/dL, and prominent at concentrations of 50–100mg/dL. [...] Disulfiram has, however, been known to cause myocardial infarction (heart attack). The symptoms can occur if even a small amount of alcohol is consumed up to three days after eating the mushrooms, although they are milder as more time passes. Rarely, a cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation on top of <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia, may develop.|$|E
500|$|Upon consumption, both {{in humans}} and other species, the {{symptoms}} of poisoning are mainly characterized by generalized seizures. The onset of symptoms following ingestion may be as soon as 15 minutes post ingestion. Initial symptoms reported may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tremors, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and drowsiness; although the rapid onset of seizure activity {{may be the first}} sign presented following poisoning. Seizures are usually described as clonic or tonic–clonic. Complications of ongoing seizure activity include increased body temperature, decreases in the pH of the blood (metabolic acidosis), swelling in the brain, blood coagulation disorders, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), and kidney failure. Additional neurological symptoms may include hallucinations, delirium, tingling, pricking, or numbness of a person's skin, dilated pupils, [...] and coma. Cardiovascular symptoms include alternating slow or fast heart rate and alternating low and high blood pressure. Other cardiac effects may include ECG abnormalities such as widening of the PR interval, <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Symptoms of excess salivation, wheezing, respiratory distress, and absence of breathing have also been reported.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{possible}} complication is [...] "pacemaker-tracked tachycardia," [...] where a <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia is {{tracked by}} the pacemaker and produces beats from a ventricular lead. This is becoming exceedingly rare as newer devices are often programmed to recognize <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardias and switch to non-tracking modes.|$|E
2500|$|Flecainide {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of many types of <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardias, including AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and [...] Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). [...] This is because of the action of flecainide on the His-Purkinje system.|$|E
2500|$|Class II {{agents are}} {{conventional}} beta blockers. [...] They act by blocking {{the effects of}} catecholamines at the β1-adrenergic receptors, thereby decreasing sympathetic activity on the heart. [...] These agents are particularly useful {{in the treatment of}} <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardias. They decrease conduction through the AV node.|$|E
2500|$|People with WPW {{are usually}} {{asymptomatic}} when {{not having a}} fast heart rate. [...] However, individuals may experience palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, or infrequently syncope (fainting or near fainting) during episodes of <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia. The telltale [...] "delta wave" [...] may sometimes be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG).|$|E
2500|$|Adverse {{reactions}} to atropine include ventricular fibrillation, <b>supraventricular</b> or ventricular tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, loss of balance, dilated pupils, photophobia, dry mouth and potentially extreme confusion, deliriant hallucinations and excitation especially amongst the elderly. [...] Most of available ampules are carried on sulphate {{which can cause}} histamine release and anaphylaxis to susceptible patients or patients with allergy to sulpha products. These latter effects are because atropine is able to cross the blood–brain barrier. Because of the hallucinogenic properties, some have used the drug recreationally, though this is potentially dangerous and often unpleasant.|$|E
2500|$|Flecainide acetate ( [...] ) is a class Ic {{antiarrhythmic}} agent {{used to prevent}} and treat tachyarrhythmias (abnormal fast rhythms of the heart). [...] It is used to treat a variety of cardiac arrhythmias including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (episodic irregular heartbeat originating in the upper chamber of the heart), paroxysmal <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia (episodic rapid but regular heartbeat originating in the atrium), and ventricular tachycardia (rapid rhythms of the lower chambers of the heart). [...] Flecainide works by regulating the flow of sodium in the heart, causing prolongation of the cardiac action potential.|$|E
2500|$|Based on Singh's work, the Argentinian {{physician}} Mauricio Rosenbaum {{began using}} amiodarone to treat his patients {{who suffered from}} <b>supraventricular</b> and ventricular arrhythmias, with impressive results. [...] Based on papers written by Rosenbaum developing Singh's theories, physicians in the United States began prescribing amiodarone to their patients with potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in the late 1970s. [...] By 1980, amiodarone was commonly prescribed throughout Europe {{for the treatment of}} arrhythmias, but in the U.S. amiodarone remained unapproved by the Food and Drug Administration, and physicians were forced to directly obtain amiodarone from pharmaceutical companies in Canada and Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Atrial flutter (AFL) is {{a common}} {{abnormal}} heart rhythm that starts in the atrial chambers of the heart. [...] When it first occurs, it is usually associated with a fast heart rate (100 or more heartbeats per minute), and is classified {{as a type of}} <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia. [...] Although this abnormal heart rhythm typically occurs in individuals with cardiovascular disease (e.g. high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and cardiomyopathy) and diabetes mellitus, it may occur spontaneously in people with otherwise normal hearts. [...] It is typically not a stable rhythm, and often degenerates into atrial fibrillation (AF). [...] However, it does rarely persist for months to years.|$|E

50|$|Paroxysmal <b>supraventricular</b> {{tachycardia}} (PSVT) {{is a type}} of <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia. Often {{people have}} no symptoms. Otherwise symptoms may include palpitations, feeling lightheaded, sweating, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Episodes start and end suddenly.|$|E
50|$|Procainamide is {{used for}} {{treating}} ventricular arrhythmias: ventricular ectopy and tachycardia and <b>supraventricular</b> arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation, and re-entrant and automatic <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia. For example, {{it can be used}} to convert new-onset atrial fibrillation, though it is suboptimal for this purpose.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} main types of arrhythmia: extra beats, <b>supra{{ventricular}}</b> tachycardias, ventricular arrhythmias, and bradyarrhythmias. Extra beats include premature atrial contractions, premature ventricular contractions, and premature junctional contractions. <b>Supraventricular</b> tachycardias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and paroxysmal <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias include ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Arrhythmias {{are due to}} problems with the electrical conduction system of the heart. Arrhythmias may occur in children; however, the normal range for the heart rate is different and depends on age. A number of tests can help with diagnosis including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter monitor.|$|E

50|$|<b>Supraventricular</b> {{tachycardia}} (SVT) is an abnormally fast {{heart rhythm}} arising from improper electrical {{activity in the}} upper part of the heart. There are four main types: atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia (PSVT), atrial flutter, and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Symptoms may include palpitations, feeling faint, sweating, shortness of breath, or chest pain.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, <b>supraventricular</b> arrhythmias {{observed}} in MVP {{are associated with}} increased parasympathetic tone.|$|E

50|$|The proper {{diagnosis}} is important, as the misdiagnosis of <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia when ventricular tachycardia is present {{is associated with}} worse prognosis. This is particularly true if calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, are used to attempt to terminate a presumed <b>supraventricular</b> tachycardia. Therefore, it is wisest to assume that all wide complex tachycardia is VT until proven otherwise.|$|E
