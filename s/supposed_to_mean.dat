5|$|During {{most of the}} Cold War, NATO's watch {{against the}} Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact did not {{actually}} lead to direct military action. On 1July 1968, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons opened for signature: NATO argued that its nuclear sharing arrangements did not breach the treaty as US forces controlled the weapons until {{a decision was made}} to go to war, at which point the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that time, and they were not challenged. In May 1978, NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance, to maintain security and pursue détente. This was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further arms race.|$|E
500|$|An email hoax {{describes}} the attacks by the South American Blush Spider in public toilets. The alleged spider's scientific name is Arachnius gluteus, where [...] "gluteus" [...] is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "buttocks" [...] (since there are {{muscles in the}} buttocks called gluteus maximus), and [...] "arachnius" [...] is a made-up word intended to mean [...] "spider". The hoax spider shares some characteristics with the two-striped telamonia (Telamonia dimidiata), {{and there is an}} updated version of the hoax using that name for the spider's species, {{with the rest of the}} text left unchanged.|$|E
500|$|Refn chose Johnny Jewel of Desire and the Chromatics {{to score}} the film. He wanted {{electronic}} music {{and to have}} it be abstract, on occasion, so viewers can see things from the Driver's perspective. As Refn was going through mixer Jewel's catalog, he picked out [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] and [...] "Tick of the Clock" [...] because he thought of Drive being a fairy tale. During Drives climax, [...] "A Real Hero"'s keynote melody, about becoming [...] "a real human being, and a real hero", refrains because that is when the Driver displays both those characteristics. At first, Jewel worried that [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] might be too literal, but soon realized it is used in Drive [...] "in the exact same way that I was feeling it when I wrote it. He definitely got the nuance of the song, and understood what it was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean,</b> {{and he wanted to}} give that emotion to the viewer, that same feeling." ...|$|E

Blessed be God, we have nothing of this to fear in our day; therefore, the more shame for such professors who desert Christ when {{they have nothing to}} fear but the breath of reproach, a nickname, or a by-word of contempt--(Mason).|$|R

500|$|In the 1960 Lichtenstein {{characterized}} {{his inspiration}} as follows: [...] "Although I had played {{with this idea}} before, {{it started with a}} comic book image of a mad artist crossing out, with a large brushstroke 'X,' the face of a friend that was haunting him. ...Then I went on to do paintings of brushstroke alone. I was very interested in characterizing or caricaturing a brushstroke..." [...] He has also described this series as follows: [...] "t's taking something that originally was <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> immediacy and I'm tediously drawing something that looks like a brushstroke...I want it to look as though it were painstaking." [...] In the 1990s, he described his inspiration in more artistic terms ...|$|R
500|$|In 1741 and 1742, a {{total of}} £423 17s 4d was spent on the hall, which {{included}} the cost of covering the oak-beamed roof with plaster and making rooms in the original roof space. Writing in 1891, Llewellyn Thomas noted that the plaster roof was added to create attic rooms to increase the accommodation of the lodgings. He expressed {{the hope that the}} hall might soon regain its original proportions, following the enlargement of the lodgings a few years previously. This has not happened, and the plaster ceiling remains. However, in 2003, partitions between the rooms were knocked through to convert them into teaching rooms and the renovations enabled {{the upper part of the}} hall's hammerbeam roof to be seen from inside the rooms. Pevsner described the 1741 cartouche on the north wall, which contains the college crest, as [...] "large [...] rich". Tyack noted the [...] "lively Rococo plasterwork" [...] of the flat ceiling. In the early 19th century the east and west sides of the hall were crenellated, and the roof was re-slated. A clock was installed on the external wall of the hall in 1831 by the principal Henry Foulkes. There is a college tradition that students aim a champagne cork at the clock after finishing their final university examinations; hitting it is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that the student will obtain a first class honours degree. An extensive fire on 4 December 1913 threatened to destroy the hall before it was brought under control. In the rebuilding work that followed, a gallery was added to the hall, with the balustrade joining the 1634 screen. The hall contains a portrait of ElizabethI, as well as portraits of former principals and benefactors. There are also portraits by court artists of two other monarchs who were college benefactors: Charles I (by Anthony van Dyck) and Charles II (by Sir Peter Lely). It has been said to be [...] "among the most impressive of all the Oxford college halls", with its [...] "fine panelling, austere ceiling, and its notable paintings".|$|E
2500|$|The {{message was}} {{regarded}} with some reserve. There {{was only one}} set of hatches on the Ben Seyr and if the word [...] "Maughull" [...] was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> Maughold, then {{it is highly unlikely}} that it would have been mis-spelt by any member of the crew in the manner indicated. Also the position indicated in the message would have put the vessel somewhere between Langness and the Chicken Rock.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2016, in a staged joke skit {{done for}} charity, Mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio {{said he was}} on [...] "C.P. time" [...] for not {{previously}} endorsing Hillary Clinton for President. Leslie Odom Jr. then {{said he did not}} like the joke. After that Clinton [...] delivered the punch line that it was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "cautious politician time". This was criticized as racist and tasteless. In response to this, President Barack Obama, during the 2016 White House Correspondents' Dinner on April 30, jokingly apologized for being late because of [...] "running on C.P.T.", adding that this stands for [...] "jokes white people should not make".|$|E

2500|$|The second experiment, however, {{started with}} ten spools of thread on the table, and spools were {{subtracted}} {{one at a}} time. In this experiment, one speaker used hói (the word previously <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> 'one') when there were six spools left, and all four speakers used that word consistently when there were {{as many as three}} spools left. Though Frank and his colleagues do not attempt to explain their subjects' difference in behavior in these two experiments, they conclude that the two words under investigation [...] "are {{much more likely to be}} relative or comparative terms like 'few' or 'fewer' than absolute terms like 'one' [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1860s, German third-gender Karl Heinrich Ulrichs coined a {{new term}} for third-genders {{that he called}} [...] "urnings", which was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "men who like men". These [...] "urnings" [...] were [...] "females inside male bodies", who were emotionally or sexually {{attracted}} to men. Ulrichs and most self-declared members of the third sex thought that masculine men can never have sexual desires for other men. Hence, to be attracted to men, a male necessarily had to be feminine-gendered – {{had to have a}} female inside him. This was supported by Ulrichs' own experience, {{as well as by the}} fact that men only had sex with men secretively, due to the cultural climate. Ulrichs termed ordinary men (as opposed to third-genders) as [...] "diones", meaning [...] "men who like women." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eggleston {{was sent}} to the Webb School, a {{boarding}} establishment. Eggleston later recalled few fond memories of the school, telling a reporter, [...] "It had a kind of Spartan routine to 'build character'. I never knew what that was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean.</b> It was so callous and dumb. It was {{the kind of place where}} it was considered effeminate to like music and painting." [...] Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. [...] "I never had the feeling that I didn't fit in," [...] he told a reporter, [...] "But probably I didn't." ...|$|E

5000|$|Malone's {{position}} {{turned out}} to be somewhat controversial. In his revised edition in 1821, multiple notes appeared in response. The first, by George Steevens, offers an alternate reading of the passage: [...] "I suspect that the waggish Launcelot designed this for a broken sentence—and get thee—implying, get thee with child. Mr. Malone, however, <b>supposes</b> him <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> only—carry thee away from thy father's house." [...] As does another by John Monck Mason: ...|$|R

2500|$|Local {{folklore}} of the American Northeast and the American South {{hold that}} [...] "woolly bears" [...] (or [...] "wooly worms" [...] in the South) help humans predict the weather, {{similar to the}} groundhog. The forthcoming severity of a winter may be indicated {{by the amount of}} black on the Isabella tiger moth's caterpillar—the most familiar woolly bear in North America. More brown than black is said to mean a mild winter, while more black than brown is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> a harsh winter. However, the relative width of the black band varies among instars, not according to weather. The mythical qualities attributed to woolly bears in America have led to such things as the Woollybear Festival in Ohio, the Wooly Worm Festival in Beattyville, Kentucky and the Wooly Worm Festival in Banner Elk, North Carolina.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variant of}} {{redundancy}} theory is the disquotational theory {{which uses a}} modified form of Tarski's schema: To say that '"P" [...] is true' {{is to say that}} P. [...] A version of this theory was defended by C. J. F. Williams in his book What is Truth?. [...] Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and Nuel Belnap as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims. [...] They argue that sentences like [...] "That's true", when said in response to [...] "It's raining", are prosentences, expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions. [...] In the same way that it means the same as my dog in the sentence My dog was hungry, so I fed it, That's true is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> the same as It's raining—if you say the latter and I then say the former. [...] These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is not a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion [...] "P" [...] may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as [...] "that's true." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Supposing</b> Varuna <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> the heaven, we are {{not much}} advanced, for dyu also lias the same meaning; yet Dyaus and Varuna have little in common. The interpreters of the Vedas {{attempted}} to distinguish Mitra from Varuna by making the former {{the god of the}} daylight, the latter the god of the midnight vault of heaven. The distinction, like other Vedic attempts at drawing a line among the floating phantasms of belief, is not kept up with much persistency.|$|R

60|$|For, first, {{what are}} Order and Progress? Concerning Progress {{there is no}} difficulty, or none which is {{apparent}} at first sight. When Progress is spoken of {{as one of the}} wants of human society, it may be <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> Improvement. That is a tolerably distinct idea. But what is Order? Sometimes it means more, sometimes less, but hardly ever the whole of what human society needs except improvement.|$|E

[...] As she went up to bed on the Tuesday evening, Miss Macnulty doubted whether the match would go on. She never believed her friend's statements; but if spoken words might be <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> anything, Lady Eustace's words on that Tuesday betokened a strong dislike to everything appertaining to the Fawn family.
