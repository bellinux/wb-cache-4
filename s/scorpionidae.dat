40|$|The {{increase}} in the number of re-quests for an estimate of the number of taxa in lower categories in the order <b>Scorpionida</b> prompts this communica-tion. According to the following studies of the entire order the number of genera and species are as given in Table I. Since then there has been much taxonomic activity in the order and even more so with the introduction of ultraviolet light (black light) detection of scorpions (Stahnke 1972). With the growing in-terest in the ecology of scorpions a report of this type seems timely. The estimate is about 90 % correct. A more accurate accounting is not possible at this point because of the uncertainty of the taxonomic position of some taxa. To make these determinations will take considerable time and an improvement in quality and quantity of the specimen material.

40|$|Scorpions {{belong to}} class: Arachnida, order: <b>Scorpionida</b> {{represented}} now by approximately 1500 species. These {{are one of}} the most ancient group of the animals on the earth conserving their morphology almost unaltered and are the most successful inhabitants of the earth. Scorpions when stimulated secrete venom which is a cocktail of variable concentration of neurotoxins, cardiotoxins, nephrotoxins, hemolytic toxins, phosphodiesterases, phospholipases, hyaluronidase, glucosaminoglycans, histamine, seratonin, tryptophan and cytokine releasers. According to an estimate, frequency of deaths caused by scorpion sting is higher in comparison to that of caused by snake-bite. Almost all of these lethal scorpions except Hemiscorpious species belong to scorpion family Buthidae comprising 500 species. Scorpion venoms show variable reactions in envenomated patients. However, closer the phylogenic relationship among the scorpions, more similar the immunological properties. Furthermore, various constituents of venom may act directly or indirectly and individually or synergistically to exert their effects. Scorpion stings cause a wide range of conditions from severe local skin reactions to neurologic, respiratory and cardiovascular collapse. Lethal members of Buthidae family include Buthus, Parabuthus, Mesobuthus, Tityus, Leiurus, Androctonus and Centruroides. Besides their lethal properties, scorpion venoms have some unique properties beneficial to mankind. These contain anti-insect, antimicrobial and anticancer properties and thus, can play a key role in the insect pest management programmes, treatment of microbial infection and in the treatment of various cancer types...|$|R
40|$|Atol das Rocas, {{the unique}} atoll in the South-western Atlantic, is located 144 {{nautical}} miles (266 Km) northeast {{from the city}} of Natal, NE Brazil and 80 nautical miles from Arquipélago de Fernando de Noronha, with geographic co-ordinates 3 º 51 'S and 33 º 49 "W. It's of volcanic origin and coralline formation. The reef is ellipsoid, its largest axis (E-W) is approximately 3. 7 km long, and the shortest (N-S) is 2. 5 km. Inside the lagoon, there are two islands: the Ilha do Farol and Ilha do Cemitério, which comprehend 7. 2 Km² of emerged area. The Atol das Rocas lodges 143, 000 birds, mainly by Sula dactilatra, S. leucogaster, Anous stolidus, A. minuta and Sterna fuscata. Due to their remote location, the islands remain largely undisturbed by the human activities. Aiming to a first characterization of the entomological diversity and the general trophic niches of atoll's entomofauna, three collects were made (1994, 1995 and 1996) utilizing several methods for a wide sample. One thousand six hundred and six insect specimens were collected belonging to eight orders: 1. Coleoptera - 333 individuals of Dermestidae (Dermestes cadaverinus); Tenebrionidae (Phaleria testacea and morphospecies) and Curculionidae (one morphospecies); 2. Dermaptera - 50 individuals of Carcinophoridae (Anisolabis maritima); 3. Diptera - 281 individuals of Ephydridae (Scatella sp. and Hecamede sp.) and Hippoboscidae (one morphospecies); 4. Hymenoptera - 45 individuals of Formicidae (Brachymyrmex sp.); 5. Lepidoptera - 111 individuals of Microlepidoptera (one morphospecies); 6. Mallophaga - 18 individuals in birds (two morphospecies); 7. Orthoptera - 237 individuals of Acrididae (Schistocerca cancellata), Tridactylidae (one morphospecies) and Blattidae (three morphospecies); 8. Thysanoptera - 531 individuals (one morphospecies). Also were collected 112 individuals of Arachnida. The taxa of the Order Araneae were represented by the families: 1. Miturgidae (Cheiracanthium inclusum); 2. Salticidae (two morphospecies) and 3. Segestriidae (Ariadna sp.); 4. Theridiidae (Achaearanea sp. and Latrodectus geometricus). For the Order <b>Scorpionida,</b> only samples of Buthidae (Isometrus maculatus) were collected. Through field observations, it was concluded the most insects are detritophagous and/or necrophagous. It is suggested that which the dimension of ecological niches of the insects are a function of the droppings, trash and corpses of birds.

40|$|Abstract The fine {{structure}} of the book lungs in 29 species representing ten monophyletic taxa of the Scor-piones (Arachnida) was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Scorpion lungs are not homogeneous across the group. Here we describe and score three sets of phylogenetically informative charac-ters: (1) the surface ornament of the lung lamellae, (2) the distal margins of the lamellae and (3) the {{fine structure}} of the spiracle margin. Provisional results suggest that reticulation {{on the surface of}} the lung lamellae is characteristic of the Buthidae. By contrast, non-buthid scorpions maintain the air space between adjacent lamellae using projecting trabeculae. Typically they are simple struts, but the trabeculae are distally branched in all investigated <b>Scorpionidae,</b> plus at least one species belonging to the Liochelidae. Simple thorns on the lamellar margins probably represent the plesio-morphic condition, while more complex, branched, arcuate morphologies appear to be homoplastic, occur-ring sporadically in numerous scorpion sub-groups. The tightly packed, hexagonal pillars around the posterior margin of the spiracle support a close relationship be-tween <b>Scorpionidae</b> and Liochelidae, to the exclusion of the Urodacidae...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and determine the funa of Lorestan scorpions. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study five regions of Khorramabad with a 25 -kilometer distance from the city, were chosen for caching scorpion in the spring and summer. Totally 52 scorpions were caught from these regions. To determine their food habits, different arthropoda including Blatta orientalis (eastern coac roach),Blattela germanica (germany coac roach), larva of butterfly and adult house fly were provided for them in the form of laboratory feeding. Findings : According to the results from 52 caught scorpions 29 belonged to the Buthidae family and 23 belonged to the <b>Scorpionidae</b> family. Population of Buthid and <b>Scorpionidae</b> family in Khorramabad is 56 % and 44 % respectively. The scorpions, nutrition in the lab was mostly house fly.
