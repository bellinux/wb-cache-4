5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be made from the <b>satellite</b> communications. The first deduction {{that can be made}} from the <b>satellite</b> communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the <b>satellite,</b> so it {{can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E
5|$|After Rolf Skår was {{appointed}} director of NSC, plans were launched {{to try to}} win the ground station contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering locating the ground station in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at Longyearbyen. The first <b>satellite</b> to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. NSC bought SSC's ownership in TSS and Lockheed Martin's ownership in SvalSat in 2001. On 1 February 2002, NSC and Kongsberg Spacetec merged their interests in <b>satellite</b> technology and operations into Kongsberg <b>Satellite</b> Station, which became the sole owner of both SvalSat and TSS. Legally, Kongsberg <b>Satellite</b> Services is a continuation of the operating company of TSS. KSAT opened Troll <b>Satellite</b> Station in 2007.|$|E

5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 8May several <b>satellite</b> experts questioned the analysis of <b>satellite</b> pings made by Inmarsat staff because the Doppler frequency shifts measured were apparently not properly corrected against the satellite's own drift (a periodic North-South oscillation of 3° every 24hours). Without any additional data being released, the implication of this new analysis was that the northern portion of the Inmarsat <b>satellite</b> pings arc could not be ruled out.

5|$|Several {{designs for}} the exact method of {{destroying}} the target were suggested. One of these {{was to have the}} <b>satellite</b> carry out a kamikaze attack on the target, while another was to coat it with black paint, blocking its ability to see or transmit, rendering it inoperable. Yet another was for it to use a laser to disable reconnaissance or optical sensors of the target. Another suggestion was for the <b>satellite</b> to carry a nuclear missile, of up to one megaton yield, and launch it at the <b>satellite.</b> However, in July 1959, Joseph V. Charyk directed that all technical efforts were to be focused on developing the inspection function, rather than the kill function, effectively ending its role as a <b>satellite</b> interceptor, and shifting the project {{to the development of a}} <b>satellite</b> inspector.|$|E

5|$|The data/messages {{from the}} {{aircraft}} are transmitted by the aircraft's <b>Satellite</b> Data Unit (SDU) and relayed via <b>satellite</b> to a ground station, {{where they are}} routed to other communication networks to reach their destination.

When passing through the <b>satellite,</b> the signals are amplified and translated in frequency—mixed with the signal from an oscillator in the <b>satellite,</b> leaving the <b>satellite</b> at the combined frequency. Transmissions from the aircraft are made on one of several channels (frequencies) near 1.6GHz, combined with frequency of the satellite's oscillator, and transmitted to the GES at the combined frequency (one of several channels near 3.6GHz). The ground station then translates the received signal before it reaches equipment to be processed. The ground station keeps a log of transmissions and some data about them.|$|E
