40|$|In recent years, iridovirus-like {{agents have}} been {{recognized}} {{as the cause of}} several diseases in fish. An iridovirus-like pathogen isolated from catfish (Ictalurus melas) was tested in vitro on the macrophage activity and cytokine-like protein (IL- 1, IL- 6) production in carp (Cyprinus carpio L.), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and <b>sheatfish</b> (Silurus glanis L.). The influence of the iridovirus on pronephric macrophage activity was examined by studying the respiratory burst activity (RBA) and potential killing activity (PKA) as well as the production of cytokines by pronephric leukocytes stimulated by ConA. The results showed that iridovirus decreased the RBA and PKA in carp, rainbow trout and <b>sheatfish.</b> The highest inhibitory effect was observed in <b>sheatfish</b> (70 % of activity), compared to carp (35 % activity) and rainbow trout (20 % activity). The production of cytokines by pronephric leukocytes had a similar pattern. The results showed that iridovirus decreased significantly (P < 0. 05) the IL- 1 -like protein and IL- 6 -like protein production and the highest inhibitory influence in <b>sheatfish</b> was observed.

40|$|The <b>sheatfìsh</b> is {{an exotic}} species which before the eightieth was only {{sporadically}} {{found in the}} Italian waters: it is now, on the contrary, {{an important component of}} the fish fauna in the lower part of the Po river where it is fished and sold on the fish markets. The total quatity fished per year is increasing, starting from 1983, but the commercial value decreased progressively so as it is sometime captured and released. The <b>sheatfish</b> grows very rapidly in the Po river, showing a growth rate better than that observed in the original regions, probably because of a better thermic situation and the lack of competition and predation. The histological analysis of the gonads shows that the male attains thè sexual maturity at a total length of about 60 cm, while the female at a length of about 70 cm, when it is 3 years old.

40|$|Epizootic hematopoietic {{necrosis}} (EHN) is {{a systemic}} iridoviral disease of fish. The epizootic hematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV) causes EHN in redfin perch and rainbow trout.

Closely related viruses cause serious outbreaks of epizootic hematopoietic necrosis in catfish and <b>sheatfish.</b> Currently, the transmission of EHN viruses is incompletely understood. Their control is also complicated by their prolonged survival in the environment and resistance to disinfectants. Etiology Epizootic hematopoietic necrosis is a systemic disease characterized by necrosis of the liver, spleen and hematopoietic tissues within the kidney. This disease is caused by viruses of the epizootic hematopoietic necrosis group in the genus Ranavirus and family Iridoviridae. To date, the causative viruses include EHNV in redfin perch and rainbow trout, and European <b>sheatfish</b> iridovirus (ESV) and European catfish iridovirus (ECV) in catfish and <b>sheatfish.</b> Genetic studies suggest that ECV and ESV are isolates of the same virus; EHNV is a different virus. Other iridoviruses causing systemic necrotizing syndromes may also occur in fish. Species Affected In nature, EHNV has been reported only in redfin perch (Perca fluviatilis) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Species that have been infected experimentally include Macquarie perch (Macquaria australasica), mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis), silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus), mountain galaxias (Galaxias olidus), Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii), and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Other species may also be susceptible. ESV has been reported from <b>sheatfish</b> / wels catfish (Silurus glanis), while ECV can infect European catfish (Ictalurus melas), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), goldfish (Carassius auratus) and short finned eels (Anguilla australis).

Amphibian-like ranaviruses (ALRVs) are a subgroup of closelyrelated viruses within the genus Ranavirus isolated from dif-ferent amphibian, reptile, and fish host species (1).

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} effects of {{long-term}} nitrite exposure on mortality, growth rate and blood biochemistry in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Furthermore, acute toxicity tests with nitrite were performed on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and <b>sheatfish</b> (Silurus glanis). The theoretical part focuses on aquatic toxicology including toxicity evaluation of substances and preparations for water organisms. Detailed information on nitrite are summarized there, namely information on nitrite occurrence and sources in aquatic environment and the mechanism of their uptake and toxic influence on fish including factors influencing their toxicity. The practical part consists of methodology and results of acute toxicity tests on rainbow trout and <b>sheatfish</b> and sub-chronic test on rainbow trout. According to the acute toxicity tests results, 96 hLC 50 values were estimated at 11. 2 mg. l- 1 NO 2 - for rainbow trout and 15. 3 mg. l- 1 NO 2 - for <b>sheatfish.</b> Sub-chronic exposure of rainbow trout to nitrite concentrations ranging from 0. 01 to 3. 0 mg. l- 1 lasting 28 days caused an increase of glucose concentration and a decrease of potassium concentration in the blood plasma among all experimental fish compared to control. Elevated nitrite levels were found in the plasma of the fish exposed to concentrations of 0. 6 mg. l- 1 NO 2 - and greater. The plasma nitrite levels did not reach those applied in any experimental group in the present study. At highest nitrite concentration (3. 0 mg. l- 1 NO 2 -), 42 % growth inhibition and 65 % mortality among fish was noticed. On the basis of growth rate inhibition data, the values of NOEC and LOEC were estimated at 0. 01 mg. l- 1 and 0. 2 mg. l- 1 NO 2 -, respectively...|$|E

The pronephros lymphocytes were isolated from 20 <b>sheatfish</b> and 20 catfish, respectively. Mitogens, ConA at concentration of 64 µg/ml or LPS at concentration of 160 µg/ml were used for stimulation of lymphocytes. The plates were incubated for 72 h at 20 °C and 30 °C without CO 2. The MTT method {{was used for the}} study of proliferative responses of lymphocytes stimulated by mitogens. The plates were read on a microreader, using the test wavelength of 620 nm.
