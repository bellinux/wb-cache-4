The storyline had Matt Cappotelli introduce her to the ring {{as a way to}} taunt Hennigan. Melina, however, turned on Cappotelli and aligned herself with Hennigan, who later changed his ring name to Johnny Nitro. Soon after, the duo began teaming with Joey Matthews, later known as Joey Mercury. The trio became known as MNM and on November 10, Melina managed Mercury and Nitro to win the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship, holding it for over two months. During her time in OVW, Melina, Nitro, and Steven Adkins came up with Melina's trademark <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> entrance.|$|E

In the metamaterial literature this became known as artificial transmission-line media. At that time it had the added advantage of being more compact than a unit made of wires and <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> resonators. The network was both scalable (from the megahertz to the tens of gigahertz range) and tunable. It also includes a method for focusing the wavelengths of interest.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the resonant frequency of split-ring resonators and double-bar resonators used to create artificial magnetic response at terahertz and optical frequencies. It is known that geometrical scaling of the resonant frequency of <b>split</b> <b>rings</b> breaks down at high frequencies (in the visible) due to electromagnetic properties of metals at those frequencies. Here we will discuss this phenomenon in terms of equivalent inductance and capacitance of the ring, derive an approximate formula for the resonant frequency of <b>split</b> <b>rings</b> in the visible and show how the limiting value of the resonant frequency of extremely small <b>split</b> <b>rings</b> and double bars depends on particle shape...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} time {{harmonic}} Maxwell's equations in a geometry containing perfectly conducting <b>split</b> <b>rings.</b> We derive the homogenization limit {{in which the}} typical size of the rings tends to zero.

The frequency dependent effective permeability of the medium can be large and/or negative...|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, when wires {{are added}} symmetrically between the split rings, a {{passband}} occurs within the previously forbidden {{band of the}} <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> dispersion curves. That this passband occurs within a previously forbidden region indicates that the negative εeff for this region has combined with the negative μeff to allow propagation, which fits with theoretical predictions. Mathematically, the dispersion relation leads to a band with negative group velocity everywhere, and a bandwidth that is independent of the plasma frequency, within the stated conditions.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, for {{the first}} metamaterial, {{the nuts and bolts}} are one split-ring {{resonator}} electromagnetically combined with one (electric) conducting post. These are designed to resonate at designated frequencies to achieve the desired values. Looking at the make-up of the <b>split</b> <b>ring,</b> the associated magnetic field pattern from the SRR is dipolar. This dipolar behavior is notable because this means it mimics nature's atom, but on a much larger scale, such as in this case at 2.5 millimeters. Atoms exist on the scale of picometers.|$|E

40|$|Novel band-stop active {{frequency}} selective surfaces (FSS) {{capable of}} modifying their response for different polarizations are proposed. Geometries based on full <b>rings,</b> and <b>split</b> <b>rings</b> are employed. The designs using full rings {{are able to}} tune over a wide frequency range while designs using <b>split</b> <b>rings</b> tune in a narrow frequency band. Both structures use a new biasing methodology which allows independent control of rows and columns of FSS arrays, therefore permitting independent modification of the transmission responses at the vertical and horizontal polarizations.

40|$|Surface {{enhanced}} resonance Raman spectroscopy (SERRS) is {{a powerful}} molecular sensing tool {{that can be applied}} to a number of applications in the field of molecular diagnostics. We demonstrate that by using electron beam lithography to manipulate the nanoscale geometry of Ag split-ring resonators we can tune their optical properties such that they exhibit two independently addressable high frequency plasmon resonance modes for SERRS. This tailored multimodal, polarization dependent activity enables the <b>split</b> <b>rings</b> to act as discriminating sensors, with each resonance tuned for a particular sensing purpose. The structures are used as multiwavelength, multianalyte DNA SERRS sensors, with each resonance tuned to both the absorption wavelength of a differently colored Raman reporter molecule and its corresponding laser excitation wavelength. The ability of each resonance to independently sense small concentrations of a single DNA type from within a mixed population is demonstrated. Also shown is the effect of the <b>split</b> <b>ring's</b> dichroic response on the SERRS signal and the sensor's limit of detection of each resonance mode (switching its sensory reaction "on" and "off" depending on the orientation of the exciting light) ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{metamaterial}} {{was constructed}} as a periodic array of [...] copper <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> and wire conducting elements deposited onto a circuit-board substrate. The design {{was such that}} the cells, and the lattice spacing between the cells, were {{much smaller than the}} radiated electromagnetic wavelength. Hence, it behaves as an effective medium. The material has become notable because its range of (effective) permittivity εeff and permeability μeff values have exceeded those found in any ordinary material. Furthermore, the characteristic of negative (effective) permeability evinced by this medium is particularly notable, because it has not been found in ordinary materials. In addition, the negative values for the magnetic component is directly related to its left-handed nomenclature, and properties (discussed in a section below). The split-ring resonator (SRR), based on the prior 1999 theoretical article, is the tool employed to achieve negative permeability. This first composite metamaterial is then composed of split-ring resonators and electrical conducting posts.|$|E
2500|$|Research in the {{microwave}} range continues with split-ring resonators and conducting wires. Research also continues in the shorter wavelengths with this configuration of materials and the unit cell sizes are scaled down. However, at around 200 terahertz [...] issues arise which make using the <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> resonator problematic. [...] "Alternative materials become more suitable for the terahertz and optical regimes." [...] At these wavelengths selection of materials and size limitations become important. For example, in 2007 a 100 nanometer mesh wire design made of silver and woven in a repeating pattern transmitted beams at the 780 nanometer wavelength, {{the far end of}} the visible spectrum. The researchers believe this produced a negative refraction of 0.6. Nevertheless, this operates at only a single wavelength like its predecessor metamaterials in {{the microwave}} regime. Hence, the challenges are to fabricate metamaterials so that they [...] "refract light at ever-smaller wavelengths" [...] and to develop broad band capabilities.|$|E

40|$|There is recent {{interest}} in the inter and intra element interactions of metamaterial unit cells. To calculate {{the effects of these}} interactions which can be substantial, an ab initio general coupled mode equation, {{in the form of an}} eigenvalue problem, is derived. The solution of the master equation gives the coupled frequencies and fields in terms of the uncoupled modes. By doing so, the problem size is limited to the number of modes rather than the, usually large, discretized spatial and temporal domains obtained by fullwave solvers. Therefore, the method can be considered as a numerical recipe which determines the behavior of a complex system once its simpler ingredients are known. Besides quantitative analysis, the coupled mode equation proposes a pictorial view of the <b>split</b> <b>rings</b> hybridization. It can be regarded as the electromagnetic analog of molecular orbital theory. The solution of the eigenvalue problem for different configurations gives valued information and insight about the coupling of metamaterials unit cells.
