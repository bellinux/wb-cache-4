5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of darts in many superfamilies of the Stylommatophora, it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> love darts appeared during the early evolution of the Pulmonata, and that the ancestors of the Stylommatophora possessed darts already.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the {{presence}} of these non canonical bases in DNA is not known. It <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> {{at least part of the}} {{reason for the}}ir presence in bacterial viruses (phages) is to avoid the restriction enzymes present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses.|$|E

5|$|While poorly documented, {{chemical}} communication {{is believed to}} be important to the group. Anal secretions are produced in the hindgut, and released along the posterior setae as predator deterrents In Australia, aggregations of male common blossom thrips have been observed on the petals of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Gossypium hirsutum; females were attracted to these groups so it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the males were producing pheromones.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald came to {{the throne}} {{on the death of}} his father on 24 February 616, or {{possibly}} 618. Although Æthelberht had been Christian since about 600 and his wife Bertha was also Christian, Eadbald was a pagan. Bertha died some time before Eadbald's accession, and Æthelberht remarried. The name of Æthelberht's second wife is not recorded, but it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> she was a pagan, since on his death she married Eadbald, her stepson: a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church.|$|E
5|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Urbicus planned his {{campaign}} of attack from Corbridge, advancing north and leaving garrison forts at High Rochester in Northumberland and possibly also at Trimontium as he struck towards the Firth of Forth. Having secured an overland supply route for {{military personnel and}} equipment along Dere Street, Urbicus very likely set up a supply port at Carriden for the supply of grain and other foodstuffs before proceeding against the Damnonii.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, it does <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Marr was {{influenced}} by Ernst Haeckel, a professor who popularized the notion of Social Darwinism among Germany's educated classes.|$|R

5|$|Most historians {{agree that}} Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, {{but what exactly}} he {{achieved}} {{is a matter of}} some confusion. As has been discussed, some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC. Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him to the status of subject ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that,</b> under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands {{provided}} William Bruce {{with many}} of his influences. He was in the Low Countries {{at a time when}} Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.|$|E
5|$|The lumber {{used in the}} {{construction}} of Fort Jackson was either sold for salvage or scavenged by squatters, most of whom were freed slaves traveling north in a search for new lives following the ending of slavery in the United States. Many settled {{in the area of the}} former Fort Runyon, and it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the lumber of Fort Jackson would have been a ready source of firewood.|$|E

50|$|As the {{property}} was owned by Samuel Figgis in November 1878, it would <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Rehoboth is the real estate that was left in his will and valued at ¢600 in September 1879.|$|R
5|$|Kentish {{manufacture}} before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. Kentish jewellers {{were highly}} skilled, {{and before the}} end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the Loire. It is not known what Kent traded for all of this wealth, although it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> there was a flourishing slave trade. It may well be that this wealth was the foundation of Æthelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.|$|E
5|$|The lightest {{isotopes}} were synthesized {{by direct}} fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 262Rf; heavier isotopes {{have only been}} observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers, of which only 267Rf has been confirmed. The heavy isotopes 266Rf and 268Rf have also been observed as electron capture daughters of the dubnium isotopes 266Db and 268Db, but have short half-lives to spontaneous fission: it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> {{the same is true}} of 270Rf, a likely daughter of 270Db. While the isotope 264Rf has yet to be observed, it is predicted to have a short half-life of 5s.|$|E
5|$|The nearby vicarage {{dates from}} 1638. The Reverend White Kennett (1660–1728) was vicar of Ambrosden from 1685 until 1708. During his incumbency, Kennett became tutor and vice-principal at St Edmund Hall, Oxford and {{published}} {{a number of}} scholarly works. Kennett was also Rector of St Botolph's Aldgate in London from 1700, Archdeacon of Huntingdon from 1701 and Dean of Peterborough from 1707. It therefore <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Kennett may have been largely absent from Ambrosden in the latter years of his tenure. He relinquished the living of Ambrosden in 1708. Kennett was consecrated Bishop of Peterborough in 1718.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{designated}} equestrian trails {{within the}} wilderness. While mountain bike usage {{is currently a}} matter of debate as the CPSLMP is updated, and not specifically prohibited, it does not <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> it will be allowed.|$|R

5|$|The {{production}} of each colossal head {{must have been}} carefully planned, given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available; it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to mobilise such resources. The workforce would have included sculptors, labourers, overseers, boatmen, woodworkers and other artesans producing the tools to make and move the monument, {{in addition to the}} support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers. The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the {{production of}} the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Norse {{tradition}} {{states that}} Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation {{for the death}} of his son in battle in Scotland, and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty. Sigurd's line barely survived him and it was Torf-Einarr, Rognvald's son by a slave, who founded a dynasty that controlled the Northern Isles for centuries after his death. He was succeeded by his son Thorfinn Turf-Einarsson and during this time the deposed Norwegian King Eric Bloodaxe often used Orkney as a raiding base before being killed in 954. Thorfinn's death and presumed burial at the broch of Hoxa, on South Ronaldsay, then led to a long period of dynastic strife. Whatever the historical details, it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Orkney and Shetland were being rapidly absorbed into Norse culture by this time.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{political}} structures of late Middle Ages Italy have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed {{the emergence of}} a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller city states and territories: the Kingdom of Naples controlled the south, the Republic of Florence and the Papal States at the center, the Milanese and the Genoese to the north and west respectively, and the Venetians to the east. Fifteenth-century Italy {{was one of the most}} urbanised areas in Europe. Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.|$|E
50|$|Referring to {{predator}} finds, {{who lived}} {{at the time of}} the Australopithecus in Africa, Clarke joined the view of Jordi Sabater who in 1997 had argued sleeping on the ground at night was too dangerous for Australopithecus. It <b>seemed</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Australopithecus slept in the trees, similar to today’s living chimpanzees and gorillas that make sleeping nests. Due to the features of the fossil, it also <b>seemed</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Australopithecus searched for food in the trees during the day.|$|R
25|$|Kendall's third spell {{as manager}} ended in June 1998 {{when he was}} sacked, and it <b>seemed</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> {{chairman}} Peter Johnson would turn to Manchester United assistant manager Brian Kidd as his successor, but the job went to Walter Smith instead.|$|R
5000|$|It does <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Halsey was {{strongly}} influenced by his Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral Robert [...] "Mick" [...] Carney, who was also wholeheartedly in favor of taking all Third Fleet's available forces northwards to attack the Japanese carrier force.|$|R
5|$|The young William showed artistic promise from {{an early}} age, drawing in chalk on the wooden floor of his father's shop. From the age of four he {{attended}} local schools in York, before being sent {{at the age of}} 10 to Mr. Hall's Academy, a boarding school in nearby Pocklington, which he left two years later. On 8October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of Hull, publisher of the Hull Packet. While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant, he continued to draw in his spare time, and his job gave him the opportunity to broaden his education by reading books. It <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> it was working as a printer that led him to realise {{for the first time that}} it was possible for someone to make a living drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|Thucydides gives {{only the}} barest of details for this battle; the most {{reliable}} detailed account is given by Plutarch. According to Plutarch, the Persian fleet was anchored off {{the mouth of the}} Eurymedon, awaiting the arrival of 80 Phoenician ships from Cyprus. Cimon, sailing from Phaselis, made to attack the Persians before the reinforcements arrived, whereupon the Persian fleet, eager to avoid fighting, retreated into the river itself. However, when Cimon continued to bear down on the Persians, they accepted battle. Regardless of their numbers, the Persian battle line was quickly breached, and the Persian ships then turned about, and made for the river bank. Grounding their ships, the crews sought sanctuary with the army waiting nearby. Some ships may have been captured or destroyed during the naval battle, but it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> most were able to land.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{relatively}} {{certain that}} the Persian fleet was sent out to block the exit from the Straits the evening before the battle. Herodotus clearly believed that the Persian fleet actually entered the Straits at nightfall, planning to catch the Allies as they fled. However, modern historians have greatly debated this point, with some pointing out the difficulties of maneuvering in this confined space by night, and others accepting Herodotus's version. There are thus two possibilities; that during the night the Persians simply blocked the exit to the Straits, and then entered the straits in daylight; or that they entered the straits and positioned themselves for battle during the night. Regardless of when they attempted it, it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the Persians pivoted their fleet off the tip of Cape Vavari, so that from an initial east-west alignment (blocking the exit), they came round to a north-south alignment (see diagram). The Persian fleet {{seems to have been}} formed into three ranks of ships (according to Aeschylus); with the powerful Phoenician fleet on the right flank next to Mount Aigaleo, the Ionian contingent on the left flank and the other contingents in the centre.|$|E
50|$|As to {{why such}} a problem has arisen with regard to food supply, {{above and beyond the}} current rise in prices, it would <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> lack of food {{production}} is due to EU agricultural policies and /or mal-administration at the state and/or county levels.|$|R

50|$|In 1866 it <b>seemed</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> coal {{from the}} Ogmore Valley would be {{conveyed}} {{on a new}} line across the L&TVJR area, and powers were obtained to build the line, but the opportunity passed and when the line was finally built, in 1886, but its potential traffic had almost vanished.|$|R
