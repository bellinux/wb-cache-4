2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed grinding wheels matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool,</b> except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as centerless grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|E
5000|$|A shaper {{is a type}} {{of machine}} tool that uses [...] {{relative}} motion between the workpiece and a <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> to machine a linear toolpath. Its cut is analogous to that of a lathe, except that it is (archetypally) linear instead of helical.|$|E
5000|$|A planer {{is a type}} of {{metalworking}} {{machine tool}} that uses [...] relative motion between the workpiece and a <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> to cut the work piece. A planer is similar to a shaper, but larger, and with workpiece moving, whereas in a shaper the cutting tool moves.|$|E
5000|$|Linear <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> include <b>tool</b> bits (<b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools)</b> and broaches. Rotary <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> include drill bits, {{countersinks}} and counterbores, taps and dies, milling cutters, reamers, {{and cold}} saw blades. Other <b>cutting</b> <b>tools,</b> such as bandsaw blades, hacksaw blades, and fly cutters, combine aspects of linear and rotary motion ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{tools for}} shaping/planing are usually made of {{high speed steel}} or carbide tipped. Except for some slight angle difference, <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> {{resemble}} those used in facing and turning. Some advantages of using <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> over multipoint tools {{is that they are}} more easily sharpened and fabricated. Internal shapes can be made by using a special extension tool.|$|R
50|$|The turning {{processes}} are typically {{carried out on}} a lathe, {{considered to be the}} oldest machine tools, and can be of four different types such as straight turning, taper turning, profiling or external grooving. Those types of turning processes can produce various shapes of materials such as straight, conical, curved, or grooved workpiece.In general, turning uses simple <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools.</b> Each group of workpiece materials has an optimum set of tools angles which have been developed through the years.|$|R
50|$|Shaping or {{slotting}} {{is largely}} used for cutting keyways {{that do not}} extend through {{the full length of}} the part. Like keyseating, shaping uses a <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> for cutting, however, shapers are not guided through the cut on a fixed post. As such, shaper cuts are generally more susceptible to deflection than keyseater cuts.|$|E
50|$|A {{tool bit}} is a non-rotary cutting tool used in metal lathes, shapers, and planers. Such cutters are also often {{referred}} to by the set-phrase name of <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool,</b> as distinguished from other cutting tools such as a saw or water jet cutter. The cutting edge is ground to suit a particular machining operation and may be resharpened or reshaped as needed. The ground tool bit is held rigidly by a tool holder while it is cutting.|$|E
50|$|The various angles, shapes, {{and sizes}} of a <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> have direct {{relation}} to the resulting surface of a workpiece in machining operations. Different types of angle such as rake angle, side rake angle, cutting-edge angle, relief angle, nose radius exist and may be different {{with respect to the}} workpiece. Also, there are many shapes of single-point cutting tools, such as V-shaped and Square. Usually, a special toolholder is used to hold the cutting tool firmly during operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} disadvantage is {{the difficulty}} in machining such a thread. The <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> or taps and dies used to cut the thread cannot have efficient rake and relief angles (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult. Square threads also cannot carry as much load as a trapezoidal thread, because {{the root of the}} square thread is smaller. Also, {{there is no way to}} compensate for wear on the nut, so it must be replaced when worn out.|$|R
5000|$|When {{deciding}} what feed rate {{to use for}} a certain cutting operation, the calculation is fairly straightforward for <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools,</b> {{because all of the}} cutting work is done at one point (done by [...] "one tooth", as it were). With a milling machine or jointer, where multi-tipped/multi-fluted <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> are involved, then the desirable feed rate becomes dependent on the number of teeth on the cutter, as well as the desired amount of material per tooth to cut (expressed as chip load). The greater the number of cutting edges, the higher the feed rate permissible: for a cutting edge to work efficiently it must remove sufficient material to cut rather than rub; it also must do its fair share of work.|$|R
40|$|Advanced surface {{engineering}} technologies {{have been successfully}} applied to high speed steel drills and carbide <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools,</b> but, as yet, limited benefits have been realized when applying the same technologies to multi-point <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> of commercial quality. This paper discusses the factors that have limited the benefits of advanced {{surface engineering}} treatments when applied to high speed steel circular saw blades. Common manufacturing defects have been identified on {{the teeth of the}} blades. Tests which evaluate the blade performance throughout its useful life and examination by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have shown that these defects adversely affect the performance and wear resistance of surface engineered blades. Further investigations suggest that significant improvements in coating integrity can be achieved through the careful preparation of the substrate surface and refinement of the cutting edge geometry prior to treatment. For this application, the need for refinement and enhancement of current manufacturing practices is demonstrated if the full benefits of advanced surface engineering are to be realized...|$|R
5000|$|In machining, boring is {{the process}} of {{enlarging}} a hole that has already been drilled (or cast) by means of a <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> (or of a boring head containing several such tools), such as in boring a gun barrel or an engine cylinder. Boring is used to achieve greater accuracy of the diameter of a hole, and can be used to cut a tapered hole. Boring can be viewed as the internal-diameter counterpart to turning, which cuts external diameters.|$|E
5000|$|Lathe boring is {{a cutting}} {{operation}} {{that uses a}} <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> or a boring head to produce conical or cylindrical surfaces by enlarging an existing opening in a workpiece. For nontapered holes, the cutting tool moves parallel to the axis of rotation. For tapered holes, the cutting tool moves {{at an angle to}} the axis of rotation. Geometries ranging from simple to extremely complex in a variety of diameters can be produced using boring applications. Boring {{is one of the most}} basic lathe operations next to turning and drilling.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{need for}} high quality {{machining}} of composite materials is rising {{due to the}} increased utilisation of these materials across several applications. This paper presents experimental findings of orthogonal cutting of unidirectional {{glass fibre reinforced plastic}} (UD-GFRP) composites using HSS <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools.</b> Key process indicators including cutting forces, chip formation and surface integrity were evaluated. Full factorial design is employed with fibre orientation, depth of cut, cutting speed and rake angle as process control variables. Fibre orientation and depth of cut were found to be the most significant factors affecting the investigated responses. Lower cutting forces and better surface quality were obtained at 0 o fibre orientation and lower depth of cut. Cutting at 45 o fibre orientation generated extremely damaged surfaces with relatively high average surface roughness values and should be avoided in practical applications...|$|R
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|R
40|$|Committee 2 on Single-Point Tools and Tool Posts. This {{committee}} developed American Standard Single-Point Tools and Tool Posts (ASA B 5. 22 - 1950), Section 1 {{of which}} covered terminology and definitions for <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools.</b> Late in 1955, Technical Committee 2 was subdivided into Groups A, B, and C, with Group C {{being responsible for}} nomenclature of Single-Point Tools. This Group became Technical Com Committee 16 on Nomenclature of Single-Point Tools in 1957, but remained inactive until January, 1962, when work on formulation of the present standard, as a revision of Section 1 of ASA B 5. 22 - 1950, was started. Later in 1962, ASA Sectional Committee B 94 on Cutting Tools, Holders, Drivers, and Bushings was formed as an off-spring of Committee B 5, and TC 16 was included in its area of responsibility. In 1963, B 94 Technical Committees were renumbered and TC 16 became TC 3. At the same time, its scope was broadened to cover “nomenclature of edges, faces, tool angles and their reference system, working angles and their reference system, for the working parts of <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> ” {{and the name of}} the committee was changed to Technical Committee 3 on Basic Nomenclature of Cutting Tools.

40|$|In this paper, {{the study}} of {{material}} removal mechanism is focused on a non-linear quasi-static analysis of the elastoplastic interaction between a <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> and the material being cut. An updated Lagrange procedure is applied to solve the large strain elastoplastic deformation problem which generates part of the irregularities observed on machined surfaces. A unique three-dimensional finite element model is developed to simulate the single-point metal cutting process. The effects of cutting parameter settings and workpiece material on the elastoplastic deformation of machined surfaces are investigated. The validity of this analysis is verified by experiments. The results of this analysis can be applied as a surface texture modification model to enhance the accuracy of a computer-aided surface texture simulator, {{an important part of}} a computer integrated manufacturing system...|$|E
40|$|There {{could be}} {{different}} procedure variants of chip removal by the applied kinematic relations in turning operations. Recently, some research {{and analysis of}} these variants {{have come to the}} front since turning can replace grinding in precision machining operations due to the development of tools with geometrically defined <b>cutting</b> edge(s) and <b>tool</b> materials, even in machining of hardened surfaces. This frequently occurs in finish machining, therefore the application of the topography meeting the functional requirements best and also the procedure leading to that has become crucially important. Some of the technological issues of one of the variants – rotational turning – {{is the subject of this}} work. Rotational turning does the cutting with a long, oblique and spatial positioned cutting edge instead of the <b>single-point</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> applied in traditional turning. The slow rotation of the cutting edge on a large diameter causes a skiving-like material removal mechanism. In order to calculate the cutting parameters as well as to determine the machining times and the productivity, the rotation angles of the tool needed for the run-in, run-out and the constant phases must be known. In this paper the rotation angles based on geometrical conditions are determined and a method for their calculation is given. The structure of the applied tool and the applicable technological parameters are described and in addition, the high productivity of this procedure is shown. Finally, the method for determining the cutting parameters is described...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{objective}} is to study game-theoretic approaches for concurrent decision-making in engineering systems when well-defined, quantitative models are available to represent the different stages in the product life-cycle. The design and operation of a <b>single-point</b> metal <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> is used as an illustrative case-study and explicit models are developed for the design and manufacturing stages of the life-cycle of the tool. Monotonicities in these two models have been evaluated symbolically and numerically, leading to the deduction of active constraints and the convenient computation of the rational reaction sets of the two players. Cooperative (Pareto), non-cooperative (Nash) and leader-follower (Stackelberg) solutions are obtained which show that the unique Pareto solution coincides with the Stackelberg strategy when Design is the leader but this is not necessarily the case when Manufacturing is the leader.

30|$|Large-scale {{molecular}} dynamics simulation is performed to study the nano-cutting process of single crystal copper realized by <b>single-point</b> diamond <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> in this paper. The centro-symmetry parameter is adopted to characterize the subsurface deformed layers and the distribution and evolution of the subsurface defect structures. Three-dimensional visualization and measurement technology are {{used to measure the}} depth of the subsurface deformed layers. The influence of cutting speed, cutting depth, cutting direction, and crystallographic orientation on the depth of subsurface deformed layers is systematically investigated. The results show that a lot of defect structures are formed in the subsurface of workpiece during nano-cutting process, for instance, stair-rod dislocations, stacking fault tetrahedron, atomic clusters, vacancy defects, point defects. In the process of nano-cutting, the depth of subsurface deformed layers increases with the cutting distance at the beginning, then decreases at stable cutting process, and basically remains unchanged when the cutting distance reaches up to 24  nm. The depth of subsurface deformed layers decreases with the increase in cutting speed between 50 and 300  m/s. The depth of subsurface deformed layer increases with cutting depth, proportionally, and basically remains unchanged when the cutting depth reaches over 6  nm.|$|R
