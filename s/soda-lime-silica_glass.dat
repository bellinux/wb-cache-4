As the iron content increases more of the iron ions are in adjacent sites and this manifests itself as changes in the optical and Mössbauer spectra. For example an absorption peak in the visible region which appears with increasing iron content can be assigned to Fe 2 +–O 2 −–Fe 3 + interactions. Mössbauer parameters indicate that, as Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + ions cluster, their co-ordination becomes more tetrahedral although the iron concentration {{has no effect on}} the Fe 2 +/ΣFe ratio in the glasses studied.

40|$|International audienceThe bubble {{removal from}} molten glass is an {{important}} problem in glass melting process. In this paper, the mass transfer undergone by a bubble rising in molten glass is studied, the multicomponent feature being taken into account. In order to identify the time scaling of the bubble shrinkage, a careful dimension analysis is performed. A characteristic time to describe the mass transfer for each gaseous species in a bubble is introduced with an alternative expression of the permeability. This new permeability has the dimension of a diffusion coefficient, which is useful to compare to other transport phenomena. From the physical data known for <b>soda-lime-silica</b> <b>glasses,</b> a fast equilibrium state of water between a bubble and molten glass is determined. The opposite situation is observed for nitrogen. Experimental results giving the bubble size versus time with a dimensionless form leads to a good match at short time whatever the glass nature and the temperature.

Dilatometry, beam-bending viscosity, and sonic resonance experiments were performed on the glasses to determine the role of tin on the thermal expansion, glass transition temperature, ditatometric softening temperature, annealing temperature, strain temperature, and elastic modulus of the glass. Mossbauer spectroscopy was used to determine the presence and relative amount of Sn 2 + and Sn 4 + in the glasses. The data suggest that the substitution of relatively small amounts of tin for a modifier species in the glass composition results in an increase in the network connectivity.

Furthermore 28 samples from real archaeological samples were analysed by XANES and optical spectroscopy as a case study. The Fe 2 +/ΣFe values obtained were compared and demonstrated that the two techniques were in good agreement with each other. Optical spectroscopy can be applied in situ with moderate sample preparation to determine the concentration of Fe 2 +. To investigate the redox conditions, especially as a first screening approach, this methodology is an important tool to take into consideration before applying more sophisticated techniques such as XANES, which is more elaborate and requires high-tech resources...|$|R
