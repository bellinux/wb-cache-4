For each humidity value, a sorption isotherm indicates the corresponding water content value at a given, constant temperature.

Because {{of the complexity of}} sorption processes, the isotherms cannot be determined by calculation, but must be recorded experimentally for each product.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> of radiata pine {{has been}} {{investigated}} by weighing small specimens continuously during isothermal step changes in relative humidity. The use of wood specimens shorter in the longitudinal direction than the average tracheid length of radiata pine ensures that all tracheids in a specimen are exposed, reducing the effect of wood structure on bound water transport. The small size also allows the specimens to be prepared from a single band of earlywood or latewood. Using the dynamic sorption platform developed at Scion, a number of sorption experiments were undertaken comparing dynamic <b>sorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> of individual bands of earlywood and latewood, which had been heat treated to mimic the chemical changes that occur during high temperature drying. Diffusion coefficients and surface emission coefficients have been calculated from the sorption data, and are presented here. Earlywood and latewood had different <b>sorption</b> <b>behaviour,</b> but no measurable changes in <b>sorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> were seen with the different heat treatments. Diffusion coefficients were strongly dependent on moisture content...|$|E
30|$|Three {{adsorption}} mechanisms were indicated, which effected the (P)HCA adsorption {{over the}} whole pH range, albeit with different importance: electrostatic interaction as primary mechanism at low pH, hydrophilic interactions, i.e. hydrogen bonding, dominating at intermediate pH, and inner-sphere complex formation, including ternary complex formation, at high pH. Sorption in two stages pointed to the involvement of different sorption sites and different sorption mechanisms. At low pH, <b>sorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> of GLU was {{comparable to that of}} polycarboxylic acids, but the suggested mechanisms were different. In the alkaline pH range, the <b>sorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> of GLU differed from polycarboxylic acids but was similar to that of polyols, suggesting a significant contribution of partially deprotonated hydroxyl groups to the sorption process. Thus, we conclude that the <b>sorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> of GLU and of structurally related (P)HCA is best described by a combination of the adsorption properties of (poly)carboxylic acids at acidic pH and polyols at alkaline pH.|$|E

30|$|Numerical {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out to study the nitrogen species transport in an agricultural field in the presence of various <b>sorption</b> <b>behaviours</b> such as linear, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Generally, the parameters of each sorption model are depending on adsorbent type and type of contaminant. However, the present numerical experiments of nitrogen species transport in the presence of various sorption isotherms could not be performed with the same adsorbent due to unavailability of laboratory or field data in the literature. The linear and Freundlich parameters for ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen were selected {{such a way that the}} adsorbent soil has relatively high sand content (Lee et al. 2006; Ranjbar and Jalali 2013), whereas the Langmuir parameters were selected from the soil which has high clay content (Buragohain et al. 2013). Generally, the availability of manganese, sulphur and iron in the soil environment can act as electron donors to autotrophic bacteria (Korom 1992; Ayraud et al. 2006; Tesoriero and Puckett 2011) during denitrification process. Hence, the denitrification due to autotrophic bacteria is also to be considered for more realistic field condition. Hence, the results achieved in this study are based on the chosen parameters. However, it is possible to perform the transport of nitrogen species in an agricultural field in the presence of sorption by using the generalized developed model when the different sorption parameters are estimated from same adsorbent.|$|R

40|$|The work is {{concerned}} with the <b>sorption</b> and desorption <b>behaviour</b> of lindane on four humic acid fractions (HAs) and two humin fractions, sequentially extracted from Ludas lake sediment. All sorption isotherms, fitted to a Freundlich model, were nonlinear. The isotherm linearity increased from 0. 757 for the first extracted HA to 0. 944 for the ninth HA showing a positive correlation with atomic H/C ratio, while a negative correlation between sorption coefficient and aliphaticity of the isolated HAs was observed. It has been shown that the sorption processes may be strongly influenced by the physical conformation of and accessibility to sediment organic matter (SOM), as demonstrated by high Koc and low n values of humin samples. Despite exhibiting the most nonlinear sorption isotherms, humin samples did not show a pronounced sorption-desorption hysteresis, while the most significant hysteresis was observed for three HA samples.

Sorption affinity of pharmaceuticals for all sediments was found to increase in the order mefenamic acid <cimetidine <atenolol <amitriptyline <diltiazem. Comparison of the experimental observations with predictions from an existing model for estimating sorption revealed the model worked poorly for the study pharmaceuticals. Multiple linear regression analysis was therefore used to develop new models for estimating sorption of individual pharmaceuticals based on sediment properties. The analyses indicated that sorption is related to properties such as Log Dow of a compound in the sediment (lipophilicity corrected for the sediment pH), cation exchange capacity, clay%, organic carbon content and exchangeable Ca 2 +, although, with the exception of atenolol, robust relationships between sediment properties and sorption were not obtained.

40|$|The {{water vapour}} {{sorption}} properties of several commercial tropical hardwoods and temperate softwood species {{as well as}} thermally modified wood and acetylated wood has been studied. A dynamic vapour sorption apparatus was used for this investigation to give data on the sorption isotherms under equilibrium conditions as well as <b>sorption</b> kinetic <b>behaviour.</b> Small differences in the sorption isotherms {{were found between the}} wood species, but modification resulted in substantial changes to the sorption isotherms. The sorption isotherms were analysed using the Hailwood-Horrobin model. <b>Sorption</b> kinetics <b>behaviour</b> was found to be accurately described using the parallel exponential kinetics (PEK) model. This model has only recently been applied to wood and this work represents a much more comprehensive study of the applicability of the model. Until now the favoured approach has been based upon Fickian models. The conventional interpretation of the PEK model relies upon the idea of different types of sorption sites, but his work has shown (partly based upon Hailwood-Horrobin analyses of the isotherms) that this interpretation is not applicable. Instead, an interpretation based upon relaxation limited kinetics has been adopted. These ideas are commonly employed in the polymer science literature, but have hardly been used in wood science. The model employed was that involving two Kelvin-Voigt elements in series, from which cell wall moduli and viscosities have been determined. The values of the moduli appear sensible, but the model is only tentative at this stage.

The immobilization process of IL was achieved via the ultrasound-assisted physical impregnation method. The structural and morphological characterization of the adsorbents was investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The thermal stability of the ionic liquid impregnated nanoparticles was also characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effect of the loading ratio (LR) and the sonication time (tD) on the sorption performance of the modified nanoparticles were investigated. The efficient adsorption was obtained by using the particles containing IL at the loading ratio (mL-IL/g-part) of 0. 5 : 1.

40|$|PurposeThe aims of {{this thesis}} were: 1. To study {{the effect of}} water and pH on {{composite}} resin materials in vitro by assessing sorption, solubility, monomers eluted and flexural properties. 2. To study adverse effects on the skin in dentists possibly caused by acrylic resin-based materials. Materials and MethodsProprietary composite resin materials {{were used for the}} in vitro experiments. The tests were performed according to the ISO 4049 (1988) with exception of McIlvaine´s solution used in Study II and the storage times. The analysis of eluted monomers was performed using HPLC. The flexural properties were tested in a three-point bending equipment. The secant modulus and deflection at break were calculated for description of the viscoelastic behaviour of the material tested. To study the adverse effects on skin in dentists, a questionnaire was sent to 3500 randomly selected Swedish dentists. A response rate of 88 % was achieved and the data were statistically analysed and compared to the results of two studies on skin symptoms among the general Swedish population. Dentists living in the three main cities in Sweden who had experienced hand eczema during the last 12 months were invited to a clinical examination in which a patch test was included. ResultsA wide range in sorption and solubility over the test period was found, with low sorption values observed for materials containing hydrophobic matrix monomers. A maximum concentration of monomers eluted was found after 7 days of storage, and TEGDMA was the main monomer released. pH affected the <b>sorption</b> and solubility <b>behaviour</b> for two of the three materials tested. The flexural strength and modulus of the composite resin material were lowered after water storage and the secant modulus and deflection at break could describe the viscoelastic behaviour. The prevalence of dry skin and hand eczema was high in dentists compared to two age-matched general population samples investigated using identical questions. The most important predictor for adult hand eczema was found to be childhood eczema. At the clinical examination, irritant contact dermatitis was the predominant diagnosis. Seven per cent reported skin symptoms when working with acrylic resin-based material but the true prevalence of hand eczema caused by acrylates was below 1 %. Contact allergy was diagnosed, however, in 50 % of the dentists, mainly due to other allergens such as nickel, perfumes or rubber chemicals. ConclusionsThe matrix composition was shown to be important for the <b>sorption</b> and solubility <b>behaviour</b> of the composite resin materials tested and a maximum release of monomers occurred after 7 days of storage. pH affected the water <b>sorption</b> and solubility <b>behaviour.</b> Calculation of the secant modulus and the deflection at break allowed the plasticising effect of water on composite resin material to be observed.

40|$|The {{uncontrolled}} {{release of}} landfill leachate poses a significant {{threat to the}} environment and is prevented in part by the landfill liner. The attenuation of contaminants by the liner material may be crucial in limiting environmental damage should the containment of the landfill fail. While the sorption of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) to clay materials is well documented in the literature in terms of the organic carbon content of the sorbent in a variety of solution phases, a knowledge gap exists in respect to the influence of landfill leachate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the attenuation of HOCs. A laboratory based batch sorption study was undertaken, using leachates with five differing DOC characters and origins, at various dilutions, to establish the influence that DOC present in landfill leachates had on the attenuation of the HOCs toluene and naphthalene by Oxford Clay. The aim of this work was to increase the understanding of attenuation of toluene and naphthalene to Oxford Clay in the presence of leachate DOC and to elucidate the role of DOC chemical composition and concentration in landfill leachates on the sorption of HOCs to the Oxford Clay. The objective of this work was to provide more reliable data for predicting the contribution of attenuation of HOCs by sorption in the risk assessment of landfills and recommending updates to the selection process of Kd values for landfill risk assessment models such as LandSim. The chemical character of the DOC was found to affect how the DOC interacted with the solid phase and humic substance-like (HSL) DOC was observed to preferentially sorb to the Oxford Clay. The sorption of DOC was reversible, indicating that DOC, and so DOC-HOC complexes, had the potential to desorb from the clay. The addition of DOC to the aqueous phase resulted in deviation from the sorption and desorption isotherms in a DOC free leachate in the case of both toluene and naphthalene. While DOC effects on toluene <b>sorption</b> and desorption <b>behaviour</b> were not clear cut, with both increases and decreases in sorption and desorption observed with the addition of DOC; a uniform decrease in sorption and an increase in desorption relative to the DOC free leachate was observed for naphthalene <b>sorption</b> and desorption <b>behaviour.</b> No desorption was observed for toluene in three of the leachates. In all other DOC containing leachates sorption was reversible and exhibited hysteresis. The alteration in <b>sorption</b> and desorption <b>behaviour</b> of HOCs due to DOC could not be explained solely by the maturity or the concentration of DOC in solution, and was attributed to a complex interaction of both factors. Increasing the hydrophobicity of the HOC resulted in increased sorption (naphthalene > toluene). Recommendations were made for the selection of a Kd value to model HOC attenuation {{on the basis of a}} ‘worst case’ scenario. Implications for the post closure monitoring and containment of the landfill and the relevance of commercially available humic acid as a leachate DOC surrogate are also presented...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{assessment}} of field-like <b>sorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{is critical to}} predict the fate and transport of organic compounds, especially when long time periods are considered. We compared field-derived sorption isotherms for diuron from a 4 -year database collected in a Mediterranean catchment with adsorption and desorption isotherms from classical batch studies. In addition, a new technique of drying the slurry samples in-between various desorption steps was applied in order to reflect the recurrent drying of the topsoil under Mediterranean climate conditions. Our results show first that the field-derived isotherms indicated a larger sorption capacity of the soil at small diuron concentrations (larger Kf and smaller exponent for the Freundlich parameters) than those derived from standard batch experiments. Second, when the soil was dried before desorption, chemical release was reduced by up to 29 % as compared with normal desorption, resulting in isotherms that were in line with results from the field experiment. These {{results suggest that the}} drying-wetting cycles are a key factor in the long-term adsorption and desorption processes under field conditions.

The microporous framework displays helical {{arrays of}} ipo ligands holding the Cu atoms in 2 D sheets, whilst {{the coordination of}} pyz molecules acts to arrange these sheets into a microporous 3 D structure. Remarkable selective <b>sorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> (> 5) for H- 2 over N- 2 is observed and explained with molecular dynamics simulations. © 2011, Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E
40|$|Positron {{lifetime}} and gravimetric measurements of iodine <b>sorption</b> and diffusion <b>behaviour</b> in electron-irradiated polycarbonate and un-irradiated polycarbonate are investigated. The increase in ortho-positronium lifetime on electron-irradiation shows that scission of carbonate {{groups in the}} main-chain and formation of free radicals is the predominant process. The UV absorption measurement supports this. The free volume in polycarbonate after electron-irradiation seems to be not composed of independent pores but of interconnected channels. The positron results on iodine diffusion in un-irradiated polycarbonate shows a slower diffusion rate, whereas in electron-irradiated polycarbonate faster diffusion is observed. The gravimetric measurement of iodine diffusion attains an early saturation in electron-irradiated polycarbonate as compared to un-irradiated polycarbonate although {{in both cases the}} diffusion is nearly Fickian. An exponential type of correlation has been observed between fractional free volume and diffusion coefficient validating Fujita's free volume theory for un-irradiated and electron-irradiated polycarbonate.

40|$|AbstractClosed-loop {{nutrient}} cycling is a simple, persuasive {{and elegant}} approach to realize efficient natural resource management, improved human well-being and long-term food security. In {{the spirit of}} sustainable sanitation through nutrient cycling, this study proposes a new pathway to realize resource recovery from anthropogenic waste fractions by the application of physico-chemical separation processes. Microwave Activated Carbon (MAC) prepared from coconut shells (agro-waste) were immobilized on etched glass bead supports and utilized within a continuous flow packed-bed column. Physical adsorption experiments were performed by passing human urine through the column to strip and recover more than 80 % of the intrinsic urea. Backwashing of the column was performed to demonstrate the ease of urea-N desorption, reusability of MAC over multiple cycles and the reversible nature of the process. Further nutrient recovery was realized by dephosphatizing the column overflow with MgO to allow phosphate precipitation (> 90 %) as struvite. <b>Sorption</b> kinetics, <b>behaviour</b> and influence of process parameters were studied by testing the experimental data against Yoon-Nelson, Thomas and Adams-Bohart models. The column adsorption was also numerically optimized using Response Surface Methodology to determine the optimal parameters as: sorbate flow rate – 8. 5 L. h- 1, urea concentration – 100 %, support size – 1 cm and consequently, column capacity of 21. 58 g. Nutrient recovery, concentration and recycling from diverted human urine {{can be seen as}} a synergistic and circular solution to the issues of sanitation, hygiene, water, and food security...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{hydrogenation}} and dehydrogenation behaviours of the YNi 3. 5 Al 0. 5 Mg compound {{were studied}} by in situ X-ray diffraction under hydrogen pressure and at room temperature. The changes of (i) the lattice parameters, (ii) the crystallite size and (iii) the lattice strain during the sorption process (i. e. along the PC isotherms) were studied. These {{results indicate that}} the crystallite size decreases by a factor of 2. The micro deformations increase at first and then tend to almost zero {{at the end of the}} <b>sorption</b> cycle. This <b>behaviour</b> is explained in terms of co-existence of the metal (i. e. greek small letter alpha phase) and metal hydride (i. e. β phase) phases. The change in crystallinity is consistent with the hydrogen induced amorphisation process existing in a lot of AB 2 compounds. No anisotropic effects can be highlighted on this pseudo-AB 2 compounds in contrary with what could be observed in AB 5 compounds...|$|R
