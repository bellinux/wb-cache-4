It blew the front roof plate and the center face plate off the turret, killed or wounded everyone in the turret, and started a fire that smouldered, despite efforts to put it out that had been thought to have been successful. Accounts of subsequent events differ, but the magazine doors had been closed and the magazine flooded when the <b>smouldering</b> <b>fire</b> ignited the eight full propellant charges in the turret working room at 4:28. They burned violently, with the flames reaching as high as the masthead, and killed most of the magazine and shell room crews still in the lower part of the mounting.

Royal Marine Major Francis Harvey, the mortally wounded turret commander, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for having ordered the magazine flooded.|$|E
500|$|On 31 May 1916, Princess Royal was the {{flagship}} of the 1st BCS, {{under the command}} of Rear-Admiral Osmond Brock. The squadron had put to sea {{with the rest of the}} Battlecruiser Fleet, led by Beatty in Lion, to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the British ships to their west by mid-afternoon and turned about to fall back on the German battleships, then about [...] behind him. Beatty turned to cut him off, but was out of position to do that and had to settle for a pursuit.

Fire from both German ships was very accurate, and both Lion and Princess Royal were hit twice within three minutes of the Germans' opening fire. Lion scored her first hit on Lützow two minutes later, but one of Lützows 305mm (12in) shells hit 'Q' turret at 16:00. It blew the front roof and the centre face plates off the turret, killed or wounded everyone inside, and started a fire that continued to smoulder despite efforts to put it out. Accounts of subsequent events differ, but the magazine doors had been closed and the magazine flooded when the <b>smouldering</b> <b>fire</b> ignited the propellant charges in the turret working room at 4:28. They burnt violently, with the flames reaching as high as the masthead, and killed most of the magazine and shell room crews still in the lower part of the mounting. The gas pressure severely buckled the magazine doors, and it is probable that the magazine would have exploded, sinking the ship, if it had not already been flooded. At 16:30 the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. After confirming the sighting himself, Beatty ordered his ships to turn around and fall back upon the oncoming Grand Fleet. During the Run to the South Princess Royal was hit a total of six times by Derfflinger, but none of them were serious.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{argues that}} {{smouldering}} combustion leads to megafires as {{measured in terms}} of the total organic material consumed. The chapter reviews the current knowledge on <b>smouldering</b> <b>fires</b> in the Earth system regarding combustion dynamics and chemistry, while highlighting differences with flaming fires. It shows that smouldering combustion of natural ground fuels, like peatlands, leads to the largest and longest burning fires on Earth, and shows that they create a positive feedback mechanism to climate change. It is therefore absolutely crucial for us to expand our limited knowledge of not only flaming, but also particularly of <b>smouldering</b> <b>fires.</b> Flaming wildfires have received much more attention than <b>smouldering</b> <b>fires</b> hitherto; this chapter aims at reversing that trend and contributing new forward-looking ideas to the important study of flameless fires. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPeatland {{ecosystems}} are valued as natural archives of past climatic and vegetation changes {{and as such}} their study is essential for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions over millennia. Fires in peatlands are dominated by smouldering combustion which is the self-sustained, slow, low temperature, flameless form of burning. Most studies on peat fires to date have focused on ignition conditions, C losses or atmospheric emissions, {{but there is a}} significant gap in the understanding of the evolution of organic matter (OM) following smouldering. A key feature of <b>smouldering</b> <b>fires</b> is that they consume most of the pyrogenic char produced. Consequently, it may be that most <b>smouldering</b> <b>fires</b> are simply not visible using standard palaeontological techniques. Here we present the possibility of identifying palaeofires by following their physical and chemical signature along a peat profile. We have undertaken laboratory experiments on Sphagnum peat columns and measured physical, chemical and spectroscopic changes of OM features induced by smouldering on samples of varying moisture content. We reveal that there is a higher production of aromatic and condensed molecules, an increase of the total N and a decrease of the C/N ratio, besides significant variations of pH, electrical conductivity and ash content. Several of these changes have, in previous studies, been taken to be indicative of alterations in atmospheric dust deposition and climate-driven changes (e. g., vegetation, water table fluctuation, decomposition and mineralization processes), but are also produced by <b>smouldering</b> <b>fires.</b> Our results imply that <b>smouldering</b> <b>fires</b> should therefore also be considered in climatic and floral reconstructions drawn from peat cores and that these additional physical and chemical changes may serve to enhance our understanding of palaeofire histories...|$|R

25|$|Peat has a {{high carbon}} content and can burn under low {{moisture}} conditions. Once ignited {{by the presence of}} a heat source (e.g., a wildfire penetrating the subsurface), it <b>smoulders.</b> These <b>smouldering</b> <b>fires</b> can burn undetected for very long periods of time (months, years, and even centuries) propagating in a creeping fashion through the underground peat layer.|$|R
50|$|Subsurface fires: Fires {{occurring}} many meters {{below the}} surface are a type of smouldering event of colossal magnitude. Subsurface fires in coal mines, peat lands and landfills are rare events, but when active they can smoulder for very {{long periods of time}} (months or years), emitting enormous quantities of combustion gases into the atmosphere, causing deterioration of air quality and subsequent health problems. The oldest and largest fires in the world, burning for centuries, are <b>smouldering</b> <b>fires.</b> These fires are fed by the oxygen in the small but continuous flow of air through natural pipe networks, fractured strata, cracks, openings or abandoned mine shafts which permit the air to circulate into the subsurface. The reduced heat losses and high thermal inertia of the underground together with high fuel availability promote long-term smouldering combustion and allow for creeping but extensive propagation. These fires prove difficult to detect, and frustrate most efforts to extinguish them. The dramatic 1997 peatland fires in Borneo caused the recognition of subsurface <b>smouldering</b> <b>fires</b> as a global threat with significant economic, social and ecological impacts. The summer of 2006 saw the resurgence of the Borneo peat fires.|$|R

Often this led to serious service interruptions and major business and community impacts. Longer-term, insidious damage was often caused by corrosion from the HCl vapours being emitted from overheated PVC cable insulation.|$|R
