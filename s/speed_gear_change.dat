40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the classification of}} acoustic signatures using features extracted at multiple scales from hierarchical models and a wavelet transform. In the model-based approach, multiscale spectral features are extracted with hierarchical autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) models. The modeling approach is also used for monitoring vehicular activities from an AR spectrogram. The AR spectrogram shows engine <b>speed,</b> <b>gear</b> <b>changes,</b> and other vehicular activities well, because it represents dominant spectral peaks better than a short-time Fourier transform. In the wavelet-transform based approach, multiscale features are obtained with a wavelet transform. Multiscale classification methods were applied to acoustic data collected at different test tracks under various testing conditions. In this experiment, about 92 percent of vehicles were correctly identified.

5000|$|The Skannerz Racerz is {{the third}} in the Skannerz series, where you can scan barcodes, and race cars from three classes: [...] "Off-Road", [...] "Drag", and [...] "Street".There are 120 cars in total, which {{consists}} of 40 cars per class. The game also has 64 optional parts you can install onto any of your vehicles to upgrade them. You start {{the game with a}} basic vehicle known as the [...] "Gizmo" [...] and you must win a certain amount of races to progress in rank, from Rookie to Amateur to Pro. Cars and parts can be obtained by scanning barcodes and either receiving a car from the dealership or beating your opponent in a Pink Slip style race. Parts are also obtained the same as dealership cars, but are received from the Garage. Only one of each car and car part can be obtained. Hindrances can pop up anytime you scan a barcode in the form of losing your car to the police, being impounded or a modified car crashing into a tree and losing a part. Races involve beating the other opponent and also involve 5 <b>Speed</b> <b>Gear</b> <b>changes.</b> Each track has its own obstacles: Off-road has bumps you have to avoid, drag involves your car swaying from side to side along the track and street involves your car slowing and sliding around turns.|$|R
50|$|During normal {{driving it}} is {{possible}} to use either the paddles or the joystick but if the driver tries to use paddles during joystick mode the joystick has higher priority. The <b>speed</b> of the <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> depends on the engine revs, if the engine has more than 5000 rpm and the throttle is pressed more than 60% the change is faster. The system also has a rev limiter to avoid over revving, (in GTA models this behaviour is removed). Downshift are accompanied with automatic rev-matching. This gearbox is made for sportive driving but the city-mode allows using it like an automatic gearbox in city driving.|$|R

5000|$|Alexandre Darracq, using {{part of the}} {{substantial}} profit he had made from selling his Gladiator bicycle factory to Adolpe Clément, set up a plant in 1897 in the Paris suburb of Suresnes. The company to own the business was formed in 1897 and named A Darracq et Cie. Production began with a Millet motorcycle powered by a five-cylinder rotary engine. It was supplemented shortly after by an electric brougham. In 1898 Darracq et Cie made a Léon Bollée-designed voiturette tricar. The voiturette proved a débâcle: the steering was problematic, the five-speed belt drive [...] "a masterpiece of bad design", and the hot tube ignition crude, proving the £10,000 Darracq et Cie had paid for the design a mistake.Darracq et Cie produced its first vehicle with an internal combustion engine in 1900. Designed by Ribeyrolles this was a [...] voiture legére powered by a single-cylinder engine of [...] and it featured shaft drive and three <b>speed</b> column <b>gear</b> <b>change.</b> While not as successful as hoped, one hundred were sold. In 1902 Darracq & Co {{signed a contract with}} Adam Opel to jointly produce, under licence, vehicles in the German Empire with the brand name [...] "Opel Darracq". Opel soon moved on to building their own vehicles.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Surge is a {{dangerous}} instability that can occur in compressors. It is avoided using a valve that reduces the compressor pressure. The control of this valve {{is important for the}} compressor safety but it also has a direct influence on the acceleration performance. Compressor surge control is investigated by first studying the surge phenomenon in detail. Experimental data from a dynamic compressor flow test bench and surge cycles measured on an engine is used to tune and validate a model capable of describing surge. A concept named time to surge is introduced and a sensitivity analysis is performed to isolate the important characteristics that influence surge transients in an engine. It is pointed out that the controller clearly benefits from a feed-forward term due to the small time frames associated with the transition to surge. In the next step this knowledge is used in the design of a novel surge controller. This surge controller is then compared to two other controllers and it is shown that it avoids surge and improves the acceleration performance by delivering both higher engine torque and turbo shaft <b>speed</b> after a <b>gear</b> <b>change...</b>|$|R

50|$|This {{arrangement}} is also sometimes {{known as a}} direct shift gearbox or powershift gearbox. It seeks to combine the advantages of a conventional manual shift with the qualities of a modern automatic transmission by providing different clutches for odd and even <b>speed</b> selector <b>gears.</b> When changing gear, the engine torque is transferred from one gear to the other continuously, so providing gentle, smooth <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> without either losing power or jerking the vehicle. Gear selection may be manual, automatic (depending on throttle/speed sensors), or a 'sports' version combining both options.|$|R

50|$|The {{front wheel}} drive {{prototype}} was unstable, however, {{because of the way}} the engine was set far ahead of the front axle, and high above the front-wheel drive power train, in what was a relatively light weight car. Setting the engine further back in relation to the front wheels would have involved a level of re-engineering for which neither time nor money were available. The decision was therefore taken to switch to a rear wheel drive configuration. The late decision led to issues with the gear box, however, which could not be redesigned at this stage and was simply switched round to allow for the fact that the drive shaft pointed in the opposite direction to that previously envisaged. For the driver, this gave rise to a back to front <b>gear</b> <b>change,</b> with first and third <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> level positions nearer the driver and second and fourth positions facing the front of the car.|$|R
