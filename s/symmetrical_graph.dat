50|$|This second {{branch of}} {{algebraic}} graph theory {{is related to}} the first, since the symmetry properties of a graph are reflected in its spectrum. In particular, the spectrum of a highly <b>symmetrical</b> <b>graph,</b> such as the Petersen graph, has few distinct values (the Petersen graph has 3, which is the minimum possible, given its diameter). For Cayley graphs, the spectrum can be related directly to the structure of the group, in particular to its irreducible characters.|$|E
40|$|A Hamilton {{cycle is}} a cycle which passes through every vertex of a graph. A Hamilton cycle {{decomposition}} of a k-regular graph {{is defined as}} the partition of the edge set into Hamilton cycles if k is even, or a partition into Hamilton cycles and a 1 -factor, if k is odd. Consequently, for 2 -regular or 3 -regular graphs, finding a Hamilton cycle decompositon is equilvalent to finding a Hamilton cycle. Two classes of graphs are studies in this thesis and both have significant symmetry. The first class of graphs is the 6 -regular circulant graphs. These are a king of Cayley graph. Given a finite group A and a subset S ⊆ A, the Cayley Graph Cay(A,S) is the simple graph with vertex set A and edge set {{a, as}|a ∈ A, s ∈ S}. If the group A is cyclic then the graph is called a circulant graph. This thesis proves two results on 6 -regular circulant graphs: 1. There is a Hamilton cycle decomposition of every 6 -regular circulant graph Cay(Z[subscript n],S) in which S has an element of order n; 2. There is a Hamilton cycle decomposition of every connected 6 -regular circulant graph of odd order. The second class of graphs examined in this thesis is a futher generalization of the Generalized Petersen graphs. The Petersen graph is well known as a highly <b>symmetrical</b> <b>graph</b> which does not contain a Hamilton cycle. In 1983 Alspach completely determined which Generalized Petersen graphs contain Hamilton cycles. In this thesis we define a larger class of graphs which includes the Generalized Petersen graphs as a special case. We call this larger class spoked Cayley graphs. We determine which spoked Cayley graphs on Abelian groups are Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we determine which are 1 -factorable...|$|E

40|$|AbstractS. Ulam has conjectured {{that every}} graph {{with three or}} more points is uniquely {{determined}} by its collection of point-deleted subgraphs. This has been proved for various classes of graphs, but progress has generally been confined to very <b>symmetrical</b> <b>graphs</b> and graphs with connectivity zero or one. Although the algorithms used in those cases do not generalize to graphs with higher connectivity, they do employ methods which might be applied more widely. In this paper, maximal outerplanar graphs are reconstructed by an algorithm which exploits their special structure. In fact it is shown that such a graph is determined by its set of non-isomorphic point-deleted subgraphs...|$|R

As an {{introduction}} we discuss the coloring of the complete graphs K 2 m+ 1 for m> 1, but {{the focus is on}} the <b>graphs</b> resulting from <b>symmetrical</b> perspective projections of the edges of the regular 4 -dimensional polytopes into 3 -space. The goal is to color all edges in these graphs with multiple congruent copies of Hamiltonian cycles exhibiting as much symmetry as possible.

50|$|The second {{branch of}} {{algebraic}} graph theory involves {{the study of}} graphs in connection to group theory, particularly automorphism groups and geometric group theory. The focus is placed on various families of graphs based on symmetry (such as symmetric graphs, vertex-transitive graphs, edge-transitive graphs, distance-transitive graphs, distance-regular graphs, and strongly regular graphs), and on the inclusion relationships between these families. Certain of such categories of graphs are sparse enough that lists of graphs can be drawn up. By Frucht's theorem, all groups can be represented as the automorphism group of a connected graph (indeed, of a cubic graph). Another connection with group theory is that, given any group, <b>symmetrical</b> <b>graphs</b> known as Cayley graphs can be generated, and these have properties related {{to the structure of}} the group.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{investigation}} is first motivated by showing two examples of simple regular <b>symmetrical</b> <b>graphs,</b> which have the same structural parameters, such as average distance, degree distribution and node betweenness centrality, but have very different synchronizabilities. This demonstrates {{the complexity of the}} network synchronizability problem. For a given network with identical node dynamics, it is further shown that two key factors influencing the network synchronizability are the network inner linking matrix and the eigenvalues of the network topological matrix. Several examples are then provided to show that adding new edges to a network can either increase or decrease the network synchronizability. In searching for conditions under which the network synchronizability may be increased by adding edges, it is found that for networks with disconnected complementary graphs, adding edges never decreases their synchronizability. This implies that better understanding and careful manipulation of the complementary graphs are important and useful for enhancing the network synchronizability. Moreover, it is found that an unbounded synchronized region is always easier to analyze than a bounded synchronized region. Therefore, to effectively enhance the network synchronizability, a design method is finally presented for the inner linking matrix of rank 1 such that the resultant network has an unbounded synchronized region, for the case where the synchronous state is an equilibrium point of the network...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLet Γ be a connected, 4 -valent, G-symmetric graph. Each normal {{subgroup}} N of G {{gives rise to}} a natural symmetric quotient ΓN, the vertices of which are the N-orbits on V Γ. If this quotient ΓN is not itself 4 -valent, then it was shown in [1] that either (i) N has at most two orbits on vertices of Γ, or (ii) N has r ⩾ 3 orbits on vertices and the quotient ΓN is a circuit of length r. In the case in which N is elementary abelian, the graphs which can occur in (i) were classified in [1]. This paper classifies the most <b>symmetrical</b> <b>graphs</b> which can occur in (ii). We show that if N is a minimal normal elementary abelian p-subgroup of G and ΓN is a circuit, then if p = 2, Γ = C (2; r, s), and if p is odd then provided that the stabilizer of a vertex is as large as it can possibly be, Γ must be one of the graphs C(p; r, s), C± 1 (p; st, s) or C±ε(p; 2 st, s) (Theorem 1. 1). We also obtain a complete classification in the non-extremal case when p is odd and |N| ⩽ p 2. For all other cases we obtain much detailed information about Γ and G, but this does not appear sufficient to allow a general classification of possible pairs (Γ, G) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine how}} a {{flexible}} process structure might {{be designed to}} allow the production system to better cope with fluctuating supply and demand, and to match supply with demand in a more effective manner. We argue that good flexible process structures are essentially highly connected graphs, and use the concept of graph expansion (a measure of graph connectivity) to achieve various insights into this design problem. A number of design guidelines are {{well known in the}} literature. Principles such as “a long chain performs better than many short chains, ” and that one should “try to equalize the number of plants (resp. products), measured in total units of capacity (resp. mean demand), which each product (resp. plant) in the chain is directly connected to, ” can now be interpreted from this new angle as a development of different ways in which the underlying network can achieve a good expansion ratio. The same principle extends to other new design guidelines- trying to equalize the number of plants (measured in total number of units) assigned to each pair (or even triplet) of products, or vice versa, can also help the decision maker to arrive at a good process structure. We analyze the worst-case performance of the flexible design problem under a more general setting, which encompasses a large class of objective functions. We show that whenever demand and supply are balanced and <b>symmetrical,</b> the <b>graph</b> expander structure (a highly connected but sparse graph) is within...|$|R
30|$|As a result, a {{large corpus}} of work about the {{theoretical}} concepts on good visualization practices, especially for dynamic graphs, has been {{produced in the}} last two decades. Besides the work done in defining efficient update operations on graphs [32], [33], several principles about good graph visualizations have been proposed and explored in different studies. Friedrich and Eades [34] defined high-level guidelines for a good visualization of graph evolution with animations, including uniform, smooth and <b>symmetrical</b> movement of <b>graph</b> elements, with minimization of edge crossings and overviewing some techniques that make the visualization more enjoyable, such as fadeout deletion of nodes. Graph readability has been measured in user studies in relation to several tasks [35]–[37]; the experimental findings highlight the importance of visualization criteria such as minimizing bends and edge crossings and maximizing cluster separation in facilitating the viewer’s interpretation and understanding of the graph. A general concept that has been studied for long in relation to the quality of dynamic graph visualization is the mental map[38]–[40] that the viewer has of the graph structure. In practical terms, the placement of existing nodes and edges should change as little as possible when a change is made to the graph [41], under the hypothesis that if the mental map is preserved the parsing of the visual information is faster and more accurate. More recent work [42] has reappraised the importance of the mental map in the comprehension of a dynamic graph series, while identifying some cases in which it may help [43], [44] (e.g., memorability of the graph evolution, following long paths, recognition of recurrent patterns, tracking a large number of moving objects).|$|R
