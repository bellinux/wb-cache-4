On the basis of a detailed qualitative study of networks in the field of national security in Australia, this article aims to advance our knowledge of the internal properties of <b>security</b> <b>networks</b> and conditions shaping their performance.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{underlying}} relational properties of <b>security</b> <b>networks</b> by focusing specifically on the relationship between formal and informal ties, and interpersonal and inter-organisational trust. Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on 20 qualitative interviews with senior members of police and security agencies across the field of counter-terrorism in Australia. Findings – The findings suggest that the underlying relational properties of <b>security</b> <b>networks</b> are highly complex, making it difficult to distinguish between formal and informal ties, interpersonal and inter-organisational trust. The findings also address the importance of informal ties and interpersonal trust for the functioning of organisational <b>security</b> <b>networks.</b> Research limitations/implications – The research is exploratory in nature and extends to a number of organisational <b>security</b> <b>networks</b> in the field of counter-terrorism in Australia. While it is anticipated that the findings will be relevant in a variety of contexts, further research is required to advance our knowledge of the implications and properties of informal social networks within defined network boundaries. Practical implications – The findings suggest that the functioning of <b>security</b> <b>networks</b> is likely to be highly dependent on the underlying social relationships between network members. This has practical implications for those responsible for designing and managing <b>security</b> <b>networks.</b> Originality/value – The paper calls attention to a very understudied topic by focusing on the dynamics of informal ties and interpersonal trust within organisational <b>security</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Security</b> <b>networks</b> are {{organisational}} forms involving public, {{private and}} hybrid actors or nodes that {{work together to}} pursue security-related objectives. While we know that <b>security</b> <b>networks</b> {{are central to the}} governance of security, and that <b>security</b> <b>networks</b> exist at multiple levels across the security field, we still do not know enough about how these networks form and function. Based on a detailed qualitative study of networks in the field of ‘high’ policing in Australia, this article aims to advance our knowledge of the relational properties of <b>security</b> <b>networks.</b> Following the organisational culture literature, the article uses the concept of a ‘group’ as the basis with which to analyse and understand culture. A group can apply to networks (‘network culture’), organisations (‘organisational culture’) and sections within and between organisations (‘occupational subcultures’). Using interviews with senior members of security, police and intelligence agencies, the article proceeds to analyse how cultures form and function within such groups. In developing a network perspective on occupational culture, the article challenges much of the police culture(s) literature for concentrating too heavily on police organisations as independent units of analysis. The article moves beyond debates between integrated or differentiated organisational cultures and questions concerning the extent to which culture shapes particular outcomes, to analyse the ways in which security nodes relate to one another in <b>security</b> <b>networks.</b> If {{there is one thing that}} should be clear it is that security nodes experience cultural change as they work together in and through networks...|$|R
