40|$|Climate {{change is}} one of the major {{problems}} in today’s world and shipping has a direct influence on climate change by the amount of energy consumed and volume of emission generated during <b>shipping</b> and <b>port</b> operations. Energy efficiency and port operation relationship have been widely mentioned in the existing literature under the term of energy efficiency management. However, there is still a need for detailed research on the ship-port interface development regarding holistic energy efficiency. The complex logistic processes should comprise with port performance to avoid the inevitable delays and to obtain a more energy efficient transport system. Therefore, ports and fleet can be managed together within a conceptual communication framework. The primary purpose of this research is to enhance the scientific understanding of <b>port</b> and <b>ship</b> operation inter-operability based on energy efficiency interactions. A theoretical framework is developed to investigate how <b>ports</b> and <b>ships</b> could work together to reduce energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. The integrated shipping system is analysed to create a unique Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model aiming to support the operational optimisation of the <b>ship</b> and <b>port</b> <b>interface.</b> In this research, the BBN theory is applied to an oil tanker case study in order to examine the energy efficiency of the voyages between two ports. The study aims to provide a guide to the holistic energy efficiency of the oil/product tanker shipping operations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the way of}} detailed modeling and simulation for a new container-handling concept [...] The simulation-study {{is part of the}} European project `Improved Port/Ship Interface'. Simulation was asked for at a moment in the project where lots of decisions had to be made yet. Therefor the emphasis of the simulationstudy was on conceptual modeling followed by a programming phase divided over several parties. The simulation supported decision-making, proved the feasibility of the concept and contributed to a detailed cost-calculation. Introduction During the last three years a new terminalconcept has been developed for short-sea containershipping, the so-called Improved <b>Port</b> <b>Ship</b> <b>Interface</b> (IPSI) [1]. In this concept Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGV's) are being used for transport of containers between stack and ship. Thereby AGV's move into the ship to get or put the containers; so no quaycranes are needed. Special ships will be needed to accommodate AGV-traffic; they have a capa [...] ...|$|R
