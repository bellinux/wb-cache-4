5|$|The expedition, {{named after}} its supply ship, {{was a private}} venture, financed by public {{contributions}} augmented by a government grant. It had further backing from the Admiralty, which released experienced seamen to the expedition, and from the Royal Geographical Society. The expedition's team of scientists carried out a comprehensive <b>scientific</b> <b>programme,</b> while other parties explored Victoria Land and the Western Mountains. An attempted landing and exploration of King EdwardVII Land was unsuccessful. A journey to Cape Crozier in June and July 1911 was the first extended sledging journey {{in the depths of}} the Antarctic winter.|$|E
25|$|After independence, other {{buildings}} were excavated, including the Temple of Caracalla’s victory in Germany. During the same period, the last {{inhabitants of the}} site were evicted and relocated to a village located on the plain several kilometres from the antique site, which is named New Dougga. In 1991, the decision was taken to make the site into a national archaeological park. A cooperative <b>scientific</b> <b>programme</b> aims in particular to promote {{the study of the}} inscriptions at the site and the pagan temples. In 1997, Dougga was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.|$|E
500|$|A {{substantial}} private donation and {{a government}} grant finally allowed the National Antarctic Expedition to proceed. A new ship, the Discovery, was built, and a mainly naval crew of officers and crewmen appointed, along with a scientific staff which was later described as [...] "underpowered". Discovery sailed on [...] 1901, after an inspection by King EdwardVII, at which Markham was present to introduce Scott and the officers. The ship was gone for just over three years during which time, from a base in the Ross Sea area, significant explorations of this sector of Antarctica were carried out, along with an extensive <b>scientific</b> <b>programme.</b> Although it was reported by the Times as [...] "one {{of the most successful}} [...] that ever ventured into the Polar regions, north or south," [...] it was largely ignored by the government of the day. Markham was criticised in official quarters for privately sanctioning a second season in the Antarctic, contrary to the original plan, and then being unable to raise funds for the expedition's relief in 1904. The cost for this had to be borne on the Treasury.|$|E

500|$|To head his <b>scientific</b> <b>programme,</b> Scott {{appointed}} Edward Wilson {{as chief}} scientist. Wilson was Scott's closest confidant among the party; on the Discovery expedition he had accompanied Scott on the Farthest South march to 80°S. As {{well as being}} a qualified medical doctor and a distinguished research zoologist, {{he was also a}} talented illustrator. His scientific team – which Scott's biographer David Crane considered [...] "as impressive a group of scientists as had ever been on a polar expedition" [...] — included some who would enjoy later careers of distinction: George Simpson the meteorologist, Charles Wright, the Canadian physicist, and geologists Frank Debenham and Raymond Priestley. T. Griffith Taylor, the senior of the geologists, biologists Edward W. Nelson and Dennis G. Lillie, and assistant zoologist Apsley Cherry-Garrard completed the team. Cherry-Garrard had no scientific training, but was a protege of Wilson's. He had, like Oates, contributed £1,000 to funds. After first being turned down by Scott, he allowed his contribution to stand, which impressed Scott sufficiently for him to reverse his decision. Scott's biographer David Crane describes Cherry-Garrard as [...] "the future interpreter, historian and conscience of the expedition." [...] Herbert Ponting was the expedition's photographer, whose pictures would leave a vivid visual record. On the advice of Fridtjof Nansen, Scott recruited a young Norwegian ski expert, Tryggve Gran.|$|E
