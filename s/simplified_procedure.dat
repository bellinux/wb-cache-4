25|$|After the 2006 FIFA World Cup, {{a revised}} {{calculation}} procedure for the FIFA rankings was introduced, with a significantly <b>simplified</b> <b>procedure.</b> The new rankings were compiled {{in response to}} criticism from the media. Meetings were attended by FIFA staff and external experts and {{a large amount of}} research was conducted by this group, resulting in the new ranking system. The new system was confirmed in Leipzig on 7 December 2005 by a committee of FIFA executives. Notable changes include the dropping of the home or away advantage and number of goals from the calculation, and the simplification of many aspects of the system.|$|E
25|$|Before 2002, Russian law allowed {{residents}} of former Soviet Union {{to apply for}} citizenship {{if they had not}} become citizens of their newly independent states. The procedure was extremely complex. The new citizenship law of Russia adopted on 31 May 2002 introduced a <b>simplified</b> <b>procedure</b> of citizenship acquisition for former citizens of the Soviet Union regardless of their place of residence. In Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the application process was simplified even further, and people could apply even without leaving their homes. Russian nationalist non-governmental organisations with close ties to Russian officialdom simply took their papers to a nearby Russian city for processing.|$|E
25|$|Under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Canadian {{citizens}} can legally {{work in the}} U.S. under <b>simplified</b> <b>procedure,</b> known as TN status, if their professions are under NAFTA regulations {{and they have a}} prearranged full-time or part-time job with a U.S. employer. Obtaining TN status does not involve getting a physical visa, instead the applicant is required to apply and receive TN status with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry. The TN status is good for three years once approved and can be renewed indefinitely if working for the same employer, however it may be reviewed and possibly revoked each time the applicant enters the U.S. TN status also does not facilitate the process of obtaining lawful U.S. permanent residency and cannot be used to live in the U.S. permanently.|$|E

2500|$|Heroin {{is widely}} {{preferred}} {{because of increased}} potency. One study in postaddicts found heroin to be approximately 2.2 times more potent than morphine by weight with a similar duration; at these relative quantities, they could distinguish the drugs subjectively but had no preference. Heroin was also found to be twice as potent as morphine in surgical anesthesia. Morphine is converted into heroin by a simple chemical reaction with acetic anhydride, followed by a varying degree of purification. Especially in Mexican production, opium may be converted directly to [...] "black tar heroin" [...] in a <b>simplified</b> <b>procedure.</b> This form predominates in the U.S. west of the Mississippi.

40|$|Compared {{with other}} {{diagnostic}} techniques, which {{are limited to}} the local investigation, the structural dynamic monitoring allows to obtain information about seismic response and vulnerability of structures, in their whole. The experimental modal analysis evaluates the dynamic parameters such as frequencies, vibration modes and damping coefficients. For historic buildings, due to their heterogeneity and complexity, these data are not yet readily available. The possibility of applying the <b>simplified</b> <b>procedures</b> for the dynamic identification of the different historic structural typologies is, therefore, strategic to obtain useful information to apply the design criteria and the structural verifications in the seismic field. Besides the <b>simplified</b> <b>procedures</b> allow an optimization both on the execution time and on the costs.
