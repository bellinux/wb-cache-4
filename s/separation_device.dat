50|$|A {{vortex breaker}} is a device used in {{engineering}} {{to stop the}} formation of a vortex when a fluid (liquid or gas) is drained from a vessel such as a tank or vapor-liquid separator.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{detecting}} and separating CTCs {{can play a}} key role in early cancer detection and treatment. In recent years, there has been growing interest in using deformability-based CTC separation microfilters due to their simplicity and low cost. Most of previous studies in this area are mainly based on experimental work. Although experimental research provides useful insights in designing CTC <b>separation</b> <b>devices,</b> there is still a lack of design guidelines based on fundamental understandings of the cell separation process in the filers. While experimental efforts face challenges especially microfabrication difficulties, we adopt numerical simulation here to study conical-shaped microfilters using deformability difference between CTCs and blood cells for separation process. We use liquid drop model for modeling a CTC passing through such microfilters. The accuracy of the model in predicting the pressure signature of the system is validated by comparing with previous experiments. Pressure-deformability analysis of the cell going through the channel is then carried out in detail in order to better understand how a CTC behaves throughout the filtration process. Different system design criteria such as system throughput and unclogging of the system are discussed. Specifically, pressure behavior under different system throughput is analyzed. Regarding the unclogging issue, we define pressure ratio as a key parameter representing the ability to overcome clogging in such CTC <b>separation</b> <b>devices</b> and investigate the effect of conical angle on the optimum pressure ratio. Finally, the effect of unclogging applied pressure on the system performance is examined. Our study provides detailed understandings of the cell separation process and its characteristics, which can be used for developing more efficient CTC <b>separation</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{breakthrough}} for the MBR came in 1989 with Yamamoto {{and co-workers}} idea of submerging the membranes in the bioreactor. Until then, MBRs were designed with the <b>separation</b> <b>device</b> located {{external to the}} reactor (sidestream MBR) and relied on high transmembrane pressure (TMP) to maintain filtration. With the membrane directly immersed in the bioreactor, submerged MBR systems are usually preferred to sidestream configuration, especially for domestic wastewater treatment. The submerged configuration relies on coarse bubble aeration to produce mixing and limit fouling. The energy demand of the submerged system can be up to 2 orders of magnitude {{lower than that of}} the sidestream systems and submerged systems operate at a lower flux, demanding more membrane area. In submerged configurations, aeration is considered as one of the major parameters in process performance both hydraulic and biological. Aeration maintains solids in suspension, scours the membrane surface and provides oxygen to the biomass, leading to a better biodegradability and cell synthesis.|$|E
50|$|The API {{separator}} is a gravity <b>separation</b> <b>device</b> designed using Stokes' law {{principles that}} define the rise velocity of oil droplets based on their density, size and water properties.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{described}} {{a new approach}} to design, fabricate, package and test three silicon based porous vertical structures for nanoparticle separations. These vertical structures stand in between two microfluidic channels. In these walls nano channels that connect the two adjacent microchannels are embedded. Fluid and small particles can penetrate the walls through the embedded nano channels while particles larger than the nano channels size will be stopped. This configuration allows particle separation with in-plane fluid flow. For a uniform and repeatable pore size, conventional silicon micromachining technology is employed to realize these structures. We use the thickness of precisely dimensioned sacrificial layers to accurately define the nanometer thick size of the pores or channels which are later formed by removing the sacrificial material by isotropic etching. Three particle <b>separation</b> <b>devices</b> are designed, fabricated and tested. The first design, based on a surface micromachining process, is more suitable for devices aimed at small flow rates. The process is simple and also suitable for non-silicon substrates. The major limitation of this design is the difficulty encountered in adapting it to high flow rate applications. The second design, based on a bulk micromachining process, overcomes the limitations experienced with the first one. It is in fact more suitable for silicon based lab-on-a-chip particle <b>separation</b> <b>devices</b> with the need for higher flow rates. The major limitation found in this design is the nanochannels may deform under high fluid pressure due to the cantilever-shape of the beams separating two nanochannels. The last design, buried bulk micromachined design, is more suitable for lab-on-a-chip devices with sensors integrated in the particle <b>separation</b> <b>devices.</b> With a membrane covering the microchannels, sensors can be directly placed above the <b>separation</b> <b>devices</b> before encapsulation. Moreover, this design is more robust as the beams are doubly supported beam structures and can withstand a significantly higher flow pressure. The nanochannels are formed by wet chemical etch and the nanofluidic devices operates under wet conditions. A drying step is therefore necessary for conventional encapsulation processes, such as wafer bonding or CVD thin film encapsulation. This drying step will likely cause stiction and air bubble entrapment problems. To avoid those problems, a new encapsulation process based on low temperature lamination of TMMF S 2030 Dry Film Resist, is developed. This process allows the encapsulation of nanofluidic devices while water can be kept inside the etched nanochannels. By eliminating the final drying step, stiction or air bubbles formation can be avoided. ECTM/DIMESElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
