This is an example of a paraphyletic group, a clade minus one or more subordinate clades.

50|$|Terrestrial {{ecosystems}} occupy 55,660,000 mi² (144,150,000 km²), or 28.26% of Earth's surface. Although {{they are}} comparatively recent {{in the history}} of life (the first terrestrial organisms appeared in the Alchi period, about 425 million years ago) and occupy a much smaller portion of Earth's surface than marine ecosystems, terrestrial ecosystems have been a major site of adaptive radiation of both plants and animals. Major plant taxa in terrestrial ecosystems are members of the division Magnoliophyta (flowering plants), of which there are about 275,000 species, and the division Pinophyta (conifers), of which there are about 500 species. Members of the division Bryophyta (mosses and liverworts), of which there are about 24,000 species, are also important in some terrestrial ecosystems. Major animal taxa in terrestrial ecosystems include the classes Insecta (insects) with about 900,000 species, <b>Aves</b> (<b>birds)</b> with 8,500 species, and Mammalia (mammals) with approximately 4,100 species.|$|R

40|$|Chromosomes were {{examined}} from five populations of Sphenodon (tuatara) using giemsa, Ag-NOR, C-, G- and RE- banding. There {{were no differences}} between species, populations or sexes, although one animal had a structural heteromorphism. Chromosome morphology homology to Testudines (turtles), <b>Aves</b> (<b>birds)</b> {{and to a lesser}} extent Crocodylia (crocodiles) allowed reconstruction ofa Reptilian proto-karyotype, dated to 300 million years ago. DNA sequence was isolated from the WT 1, AMH, DMRT 1, FoxG 1 and 28 S. No variation was present in Sphenodon 28 S, FoxG 1 or AMH sequence. 28 S could be dated to a common ancestor with Testudines, similar to the archaic karyotype. FoxG 1 and AMH reflect an Oligocene divergence, WT 1 divides north-eastern North Island and Cook Strait, and can be dated to the Pleistocene or the Pliocene, and DMRT 1 appears a recent post- pliocene divergence. FISH localised DIG-labelled probes of AMH to chromosome 11 and WT 1 to chromosome 13 or 14. Human telomeric probes localised to Sphenodon telomeric regions demonstrating the highly conserved nature of telomeric sequences. Comparative genomic hybridisation with chicken chromosomes did not produce any regions of homology, implying significant chromosomal and DNA changes since the Orders shared a common ancestor, although macrochromosome morphology has remained similar. Sphenodon chromosomal and nuclear DNA analyses demonstrate evolutionary decoupling, supporting recent mtDNA work...|$|R
2500|$|Paul's {{hypothesis}} received {{additional support}} when Mayr et al.

This paper, however, excluded all other birds and thus did not sample their character distributions.

40|$|In {{studies of}} the {{evolution}} of avian flight there has been a singular preoccupation with unravelling its origin. By contrast, the complex changes in morphology that occurred between the earliest form of avian flapping flight and the emergence of the flight capabilities of extant birds remain comparatively little explored. Any such work has been limited by a comparative paucity of fossils illuminating bird evolution near the origin of the clade of extant (i. e. ‘modern’) <b>birds</b> (<b>Aves).</b> Here we recognize three species from the Early Cretaceous of China as comprising a new lineage of basal ornithurine birds. Ornithurae is a clade that includes, approximately, comparatively close relatives of crown clade <b>Aves</b> (extant <b>birds)</b> and that crown clade. The morphology of the best-preserved specimen from this newly recognized Asian diversity, the holotype specimen of Yixianornis grabaui Zhou and Zhang 2001, complete with finely preserved wing and tail feather impressions, is used to illustrate the new insights offered by recognition of this lineage. Hypotheses of avian morphological evolution and specifically proposed patterns of change in different avian locomotor modules after the origin of flight are impacted by recognition of the new lineage. The complete articulated holotype specimen of Yixianornis grabaui, from the Early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning Province, in north-eastern China, arguably the best-preserved basal ornithurine specimen yet discovered, provides the earliest evidence consistent with the presence of extant avian tail feather fanning...|$|R

40|$|The Class <b>Aves</b> (<b>birds)</b> is {{generally}} {{divided into two}} main groups - the Palaeognathae and the Neognathae. Paleognathous birds are the flightless ratites and the tinamous, while Neognathae include all other extant birds (more than 9, 000 species). This opinion has prevailed {{for more than a}} century and is primarily based on morphological studies of the avian bony palate. In this study, the relationships between Palaeognathae and Neognathae along with other avian divergences have been investigated in phylogenetic analyses of complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes as well as in analyses of the mt cytochrome b gene. The complete mt genomes of the ostrich (Struthioniformes; Struthio camelus), the greater rhea (Struthioniformes; Rhea americana) and the rook (Passeriformes; Corvus frugilegus) were sequenced. At the time when this study was initiated and conducted, only one complete avian mt genome had been presented, that of the chicken (Galliformes; Gallus gallus), but this year four other complete avian mt genomes (representing the orders Anseriformes, Falconiformes and Passeriformes) were released. The phylogenetic analyses were carried out on the concatenated nucleotide and amino acid sequences (9, 597 and 3, 199 characters respectively) of twelve mt protein-coding genes from avian, mammalian, reptilian and piscine taxa. The results of the phylogenetic analyses did not support the most commonly accepted view of a basal divergence between paleognaths and neognaths. Instead, the earliest divergence among the taxa included was between the Passeriformes and all other birds including the ratites which were reconstructed at a more apical position in the tree as a sister group of galliforms and anseriforms. The origin of the Passeriformes was estimated to the early Cretaceous, about 120 MYBP (million years before present). A basal position of the ratites has in fact been questioned before, suggesting that ratites are not "primitive" birds but that ratite morphology includes a number of juvenile or neotenous traits (for example the downy plumage and the paleognathous palate) which have been maintained in adulthood. Because of the lack of pre-Tertiary passerine fossils (> 65 MYBP) the order Passeriformes {{is generally}} regarded as one of the most recent avian lineages. It has been proposed, however, that the order Passeriformes originated already in the Cretaceous and that a recent origin of passerines is due to a misinterpretation of the fossil record. It is probable that the discrepancies between this study and the previous ones are attributable to the considerable length of the present dataset. Most importantly, however, the inclusion of a non-avian outgroup permits a different rooting strategy than used in most studies of avian relationships to date...|$|R
