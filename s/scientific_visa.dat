It presents some of the outcomes of the conference 'ESRM 2004 : Early Stage Researcher Mobility in Europe - Meeting the Challenges and Promoting Best Practice', held in Lisbon on 25 - 27 February 2004, and provides some background information on relevant EU initiatives such as the European Researchers' Mobility Portal, the European Network of Mobility Centres, the <b>Scientific</b> <b>Visa</b> initiative, and the European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for their Recruitment, all of which were later integrated in one form or other into the European Commission's EURAXESS initiative...|$|E

While {{a growing number}} of studies examine the effectiveness of these efforts, the actual mechanisms through which policies may affect the aspirations and abilities to migrate of the highly skilled have not been questioned. This paper explores the roles of migration and higher education policies from both the origin and destination countries in the geographic mobility decisions of researchers, a highly skilled group that has been specifically targeted by such policies (e. g. <b>scientific</b> <b>visas</b> introduced by the EU). Focusing on Indian researchers and using in-depth qualitative interviews, we examine their decisions to study and/or work abroad, to stay or to return to India. More specifically, the paper asks (i) to what extent are (migration) policies driving Indian researchers’ decisions of whether and/or where to emigrate? and (ii) do policies attract or block Indian researchers from staying in their initial destination, re-migrating to another country or returning to India? In seeking to answer these questions, we consider not only the role of state migration policies, but also the institutional practices within higher education or research institutions...|$|R
