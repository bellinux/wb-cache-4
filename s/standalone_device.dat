50|$|The ASR-10 {{offered a}} {{powerful}} and flexible internal effects unit (later offered as a <b>standalone</b> <b>device</b> in the Ensoniq DP/4), offering the capability to resample an existing sound with an effect, and to process external signals through it live. Up to 62 effects were available to be used, also including a vocoder and distortion. The effects were all programmable, and flexible configurations were available for operating in multitimbral or performance modes.|$|E
50|$|Another {{controversy}} {{was caused}} by different designs and purposes of Blizzard PPC and Cyberstorm PPC boards. The Blizzard PPC was designed to fit Amiga 1200 as a <b>standalone</b> <b>device</b> which would not need installing additional software but utilised Amiga's unique AutoConfig feature. This caused problems to some 3rd party developers who developed their own PPC kernels for PowerUP cards since they could not work on Amiga 1200 without removing the PowerUP kernel first.|$|E
40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) {{approach}} to interconnected devices {{has become a}} significant topic in recent years, {{and is likely to}} be a major influence on future networking standards, such as ongoing work on 5 G. IoT introduces connectivity to a much wider range of devices than seen previously, which raises a number of challenges, both technical and ethical. This paper explores some of these challenges which IoT faces, as a result of the personal and confidential information which may be transmitted from body-worn sensors, and the inherent challenges of introducing connectivity to <b>standalone</b> <b>devices,</b> rather than to equipment operated by users...|$|R

25|$|A head-worn, {{computer}} device with a transparent display {{can be used}} to mitigate the effects of motion sickness (and spatial disorientation) if visual indicators of the wearer’s head position are shown. Such a device functions by providing the wearer with digital reference lines in their field of vision that indicate the horizon’s position relative to the user’s head. This is accomplished by combining readings from accelerometers and gyroscopes mounted in the device (US Patent 5,966,680). This technology has been implemented in both <b>standalone</b> <b>devices</b> and Google Glass. In two NIH-backed studies, greater than 90% of patients experienced a reduction in the symptoms of motion sickness while using this technology.|$|R
50|$|The {{personal}} computer was originally {{introduced to the}} workplace as a <b>standalone</b> <b>device.</b> Over time these were networked and network-attached storage was introduced to enable resources and information to be shared.A number of advancements and new technologies from software companies have extended and improved this model. Citrix provides the ability to store the desktop environment centrally and publish it to remote users. Microsoft acquired some of this technology to develop their terminal server solution.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} networking, {{a wireless}} access point (WAP), or more generally just access point (AP), is a networking hardware device that allows a Wi-Fi device to connect to a wired network. The AP usually connects to a router (via a wired network) as a <b>standalone</b> <b>device,</b> {{but it can also}} be an integral component of the router itself. An AP is differentiated from a hotspot, which is the physical location where Wi-Fi access to a WLAN is available.|$|E
50|$|Cellebrite's UME <b>standalone</b> <b>device</b> {{acts as a}} {{universal}} data channel between two mobile devices. It extracts, reads and parses data from a source mobile device and transfers it on-the-fly to a target device without storing any data on the UME device itself. The UME can automatically determine the types of phones which are connected to it, and can re-structure the data on the fly {{according to the source}} and target phone's storage formats and data fields.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{comparison}} of the results obtained between functional testing and applying the multi-VDD approach on an RF circuit. The multi-VDD approach incorporates both VDD ramp and DC ramp techniques. The VDD ramp technique has been previously evaluated on <b>standalone</b> <b>devices</b> with good results as presented in J. Pineda de Gyvez et al. (2004) and S. Ozev and A Orailoglu (2001). However, most of the work has been accomplished in the Lab. Here we present results obtained by applying the concepts in a production environment. Correlations between the functional and the multi-VDD methodologies are shown.

50|$|A {{lighting}} dimmer {{existed at}} the time, but was expensive, complicated, and necessitated the use of large rheostats, about 10 in (25 cm) in size. Though there were dimming devices already in use for theater lighting, they were far too big and bulky for use in homes. Spira successfully manipulated a thyristor, a solid-state semiconductor {{small enough to fit}} into the wall box that housed a standard light switch. Unlike theatrical dimmers, Spira's <b>standalone</b> <b>device</b> was small enough for home application.|$|E
50|$|The term DSL modem is {{technically}} {{used to describe}} a modem which connects to a single computer, through an Ethernet Port, USB port, or is installed in a computer PCI slot. The more common DSL router is a <b>standalone</b> <b>device</b> that combines the function of a DSL modem and a router, and can connect multiple computers through multiple Ethernet ports or an integral wireless access point. Also called a residential gateway, a DSL router usually manages the connection and sharing of the DSL service in a home or small office network.|$|E
50|$|Mythbuntu {{can be used}} {{to install}} a full MythTV system on a single device (acting as both a client and a server). The {{front-end}} is the software required for the visual elements (or the GUI) and is utilised by the common user to find, play, and manipulate media files. The back end is the server where the media files, tuners, and database are actually stored. A combined front-and-back-end system may have an advantage in that it has portability: it is a <b>standalone</b> <b>device</b> that is not dependent on a separate server, such as a gaming console.|$|E
5000|$|DTS Interactive: This is a {{real-time}} DTS stream encoder. On the PC, {{it takes}} multichannel audio and converts {{it into a}} 1.5 Mbit/s DTS stream for output. Because it uses the original DTS codec to transmit audio, fidelity is limited to 5.1 channel at 48 kHz, 24bit. More than 5.1 channels, a higher sampling frequency or data rate are not supported, {{due to the lack}} of support for DTS variants such as DTS 96/24. It can also be found on some <b>standalone</b> <b>devices</b> (e.g., Surround Encoder). Nearly a dozen titles on the PlayStation 2 feature the [...] "DTS Interactive" [...] real-time stream encoder, such as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.|$|R
5000|$|Ilaria Santi {{writing in}} ZDNet {{concluded}} that the Trium Mondo is a [...] "well-featured handheld/mobile phone" [...] and that the price at launch was not unreasonable {{for the type of}} device. The Register believed that the compromises in the phone and PDA functionality in order to combine them was an issue, and suggested that it was [...] "hard to see anyone replacing a PDA and a cellphone with a Mondo". In the New Straights Times, Matthew Mok highlighted the ease of having the PDA and phone features combined in one product over connecting two <b>standalone</b> <b>devices</b> but noted the lack of expansion slots compared to normal PDAs and the omission of a colour screen.|$|R
