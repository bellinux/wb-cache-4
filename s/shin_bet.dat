5|$|In August 2013 the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> {{uncovered}} a plot by Hamas members from Ramallah and Jerusalem {{to bomb the}} Mamilla Mall on Rosh Hashana; {{two of the men}} were employed as maintenance workers at the mall.|$|E
5|$|Fuad Shubaki, former {{financial}} aide to Arafat, {{told the}} Israeli security service <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> that Arafat used {{several million dollars}} of aid money to buy weapons and support militant groups. During Israel's Operation Defensive Shield, the Israel army recovered counterfeit money and documents from Arafat's Ramallah headquarters. The documents showed that, in 2001, Arafat personally approved payments to Tanzim militants. The Palestinians claimed that the counterfeit money was confiscated from criminal elements.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> has {{the names}} of 2,124 Palestinian dead.|$|E
50|$|The affair had {{significantly}} damaged the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet's</b> reputation and public image in Israel. It {{also led to}} a re-examination of censorship in Israel after it became evident that the censors had contributed to the cover-up of the affair.|$|R
50|$|During the Second Intifada, {{under the}} <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet's</b> command, Yamam forces intercepted many militants, either by arresting them or killing them. Several {{high-profile}} militants {{were killed by}} Yamam operators. Often, when the wanted Palestinian militants were barricaded inside a building, Yamam forces laid siege to it while IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozers forced them out by razing the structure.|$|R
50|$|In {{the time}} between these events two Soviet cars, one of which belonged to Sokolov, were {{observed}} exiting the Soviet Embassy separately, and heading {{in the direction of}} Tel Aviv. A member of the Soviet intelligence holding a briefcase emerged from one of them. <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet's</b> intelligence assessment was that the material in the briefcase had been photocopied and returned to Beer.|$|R
25|$|The Israeli secret service, <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet,</b> has an {{interrogation}} {{facility in}} Petah Tikva.|$|E
25|$|On 12 May 2011, <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> said: Syria {{would be}} “soaked in blood”, because Assad's {{government}} was “fighting for its life”.|$|E
25|$|The Palestinian {{security}} forces – for example, Force 17, the Palestinian police, General Intelligence, and the counter security apparatus – have lost 334 {{of its members}} during the current conflict, the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> figures show.|$|E

5000|$|... 1987: Headed the Landau Commission to {{investigate}} the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet's</b> procedures. The commission found frequent cases of perjury in court and violations of the law. The commission acknowledged that [...] "moderate physical pressure" [...] might sometimes be necessary as an interrogation tool. Israeli human rights groups maintained that the practices authorized by the commission amounted to torture. The commission's report was nullified in 1999 by a Supreme Court ruling.|$|R
2500|$|Following the decision, Katsav's family {{turned to}} a number of politicians, asking that Katsav's home, already {{surrounded}} by stone walls put up by <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet's</b> Protective Security Department, be declared a [...] "temporary prison", and that he be allowed to serve his sentence there. In a letter to Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich, Katsav's brother Lior wrote that while in prison, his brother could be exposed to convicts whose presidential pardon requests he had rejected, and claimed that he had knowledge of state secrets that could be compromised in prison. Aharonovich rejected that request, with sources close to him stating that prisoners were only permitted to serve their sentences at home in extremely rare cases.|$|R
25|$|Abu Tir {{was freed}} on 20 May 2010. He was {{subsequently}} {{stripped of his}} Israeli ID card and residency rights, and told by the Israeli <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> intelligence service that he was banned from Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|On 28 March 1996, the Shamgar Commission {{issued its}} final report into the assassination. It was {{critical}} of <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> for putting the Prime Minister at risk and ignoring threats to his life from Jewish extremists.|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} episode aired as planned, Kirschenbaum, then Director-General of the Israel Broadcasting Authority, was {{reluctant}} to screen the second episode until all three groups that interrogated prisoners—the police, the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet,</b> and the military—responded to the allegations against them. Both {{the police and the}} <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> did, but the IDF refused to respond to the charges of an anonymous young reservist, who claimed on camera to {{have been involved in the}} physical and mental abuse of prisoners. Even when it finally agreed to respond, it refused to ensure that the whistleblower's anonymity would be protected. The second episode finally aired almost eight months after the first, on 14 June 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Bayit Yehudi leader Naftali Bennett, {{commenting on}} the flood of emails from people {{claiming}} they would no longer vote for his party because of his defense of the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet's</b> Jewish Agency, which is investigating the crime, said Ben-Gvir, the suspects' Kahanist attorney, was a genius running a propaganda campaign for their release. Their interrogation, in Nahum Barnea's words, was being portrayed as 'a long and arduous physical and mental torture. The suspects' bodies were stretched and shrunk on a Procrustean bed; they were electrocuted; they were sexually harassed, suffered kicking to the chest, bruising, slapping; a female interrogator groped them.' Bennett argues that,'(T)hose who {{support the use of}} exceptional methods against Palestinian terrorism, should support the use of exceptional methods against Jewish terrorism.' ...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{evacuation}} of settlers from Hebron in December 2008, a riot ensued and a Jewish settler, Ze'ev Braude, was recorded on video shooting two unarmed Palestinians after Palestinians had hurled rocks at him. The victims were shot on their own property, which Braude had entered, and later needed surgery. The Israeli State Prosecutor's Office decided to abandon the prosecution of Braude after the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that the prosecution must give the defendant access to [...] "sensitive information". The prosecutor's office had earlier said {{that some of the}} evidence against Braude was classified for security reasons, due to [...] "the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet's</b> sources and methods of operation, and identifying details about its units and people." [...] Braude had petitioned the High Court for access.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, {{the service}} {{launched}} its first ever public recruitment drive, unveiling a [...] "slick Web site" [...] and buying on-line ads in Israel and abroad {{in a campaign}} aimed at [...] "attracting top-tier computer programmers" [...] to its [...] "cutting-edge" [...] IT division. On March 18, 2008, {{it was announced that}} Shabak's official website would also offer a blog, where four of its agents would discuss anonymously how they were recruited, and what sort of work they perform; they would also answer questions sent in by members of the public. The decision to launch the blog was made by the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet's</b> top brass, including head Yuval Diskin, and is part of an attempt to attract high-tech workers to the agency's growing IT department. According to Shabak officers, the Web site and blog are aimed also at promoting a more accessible and positive public image for the secret service, long associated with [...] "dark, undercover and even violent activity".|$|R
25|$|Following a month-long investigation, the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> {{security}} service {{announced that the}} terrorists were inspired by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Reportedly, this confirmed the assessment, previously made by Palestinian {{security service}}s {{on the night of}} the attack.|$|E
25|$|The Popular Resistance Committees claimed {{responsibility}} for the attack and presented Asheri's ID card. A <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> investigation revealed that the abduction was carried out by a Tanzim terror cell connected with the PRC in Ramallah on instruction from the PRC leadership in Gaza.|$|E
25|$|The slate was {{endorsed}} by former prime minister Ehud Barak, former prime minister and president Shimon Peres, former <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> chief Yuval Diskin, former Mossad chief Meir Dagan, head of Israel's wealthiest family Stef Wertheimer, columnist Ari Shavit, the daily Haaretz, and The Economist.|$|E
50|$|Men {{suspected}} of having borne arms were executed on the spot, in their homes or places of employment, while all males from 15 years to 60 years of age were forced to muster. Two massacres of civilians then took place. The first occurred when citizens were machine-gunned down after being forced to line {{up against the wall}} of the old Ottoman caravanserai in the city's central square. Local residents claim that the number of Palestinians shot dead in this action amounted to 100, according to oral memories collected by Joe Sacco. The other massacre took place in the Khan Yunis refugee camp. Israel's purpose was to root out the fedayin from Gaza, though the massacres were largely wrought on civilians. According to Jean-Pierre Filiu, the process of identifying 'fedayin' was inexact, it sufficing to have a picture of Nasser on one's wall to become suspect, or be arrested because one had a similar name to someone on <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet's</b> suspect list. Occasionally local children were used as human shields in areas where snipers were {{suspected of}} lying in wait, or where sites might have been booby-trapped.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Research on {{efficient}} markets {{theory has}} focused on the discovery and explanation of anomalies that appear to be inconsistent with the efficient markets hypothesis. It is now appreciated that betting markets share many characteristics with financial markets, in particular large numbers of investors (bettors), with readily available cheap sources of information, involved in the purchase of statecontingent assets (<b>bets).</b> <b>Shin</b> (1991, 1992 and 1993) has recently emphasised this affinity by developing insider-outsider models of financial markets to examine the horse-race <b>betting</b> market. <b>Shin</b> portrays the problem that bookmakers face in setting odds on the various horses in a race as being entirely one of a market-maker determining optimal prices {{in the presence of a}} (known) percentage of insider traders, who are assumed to know which horse will win, and a percentage outsiders whose preferences are distributed over all horses. The odds or prices set by bookmakers have to be s...|$|R
25|$|Many strikes {{have been}} carried out by Israeli Air Force attack {{helicopters}} (mainly the AH-64 Apache) that fire guided missiles toward the target, after <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> supplies intelligence for the target. Sometimes, when heavier bombs are needed, the strike is carried out by F-16 warplanes.|$|E
25|$|Mohamed Abu Ida, {{a former}} member of the Palestinian police force in Ramallah, was arrested by <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> in 2005. During the investigation, he {{admitted}} to having had led the two Israeli soldiers to the Ramallah police station after which he joined the other rioters.|$|E
25|$|In July 2013, the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> {{arrested a}} 46-year-old member of Neturei Karta for {{allegedly}} attempting {{to spy on}} Israel for Iran. As part of a plea deal, the man was sentenced to 4 years in prison. Neturei Karta has denied that {{he had ever been}} a member of their group.|$|E
25|$|About an {{hour after}} the shooting, <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> (Israel's {{internal}} security service) opened an investigation, focusing its efforts on the Lehi veterans group led by Menkes and Heruti. The group had been linked to various murder incidents and various actions against Kastner, and it was suspected that Menkes bore personal responsibility. In addition, Kastner delivered a description of the assassins at the hospital. After a lengthy investigation, <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> identified Eckstein, Shemer and Menkes as the assassins. Shemer was the first to confess his role, and implicated Eckstein, who subsequently confessed and implicated Menkes. In addition, police tracked down the jeep used by the assassins, which was found to contain the murder weapon and fingerprints belonging to Shemer. Subsequently, twenty members of their organization were arrested, including Heruti, and two weapons caches belonging to the group were discovered.|$|E
25|$|After the Gaza-Egypt border breach by Hamas {{during an}} Israeli {{blockade}} of Gaza, <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> officials concluded the Palestinian militant groups had smuggled {{large numbers of}} longer-ranged missiles, such as Katyushas and Grads into the strip that were capable of reaching Ashkelon, a city six times {{as large as the}} rocket-battered town of Sderot.|$|E
25|$|Marwan Ibrahim Tawfik Maadi and Yasser Ibrahim Mohammed Khatab, two Hamas members, {{were arrested}} by <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> and Israeli Police during {{the breakup of}} a Hamas network in Ramallah and the Binyamin region. During the interrogation, they confessed to {{participating}} in the lynching, and in August 2012, they were indicted before a military court.|$|E
25|$|ICTS International N.V. is a Dutch {{firm that}} {{develops}} products and provides consulting and personnel {{services in the}} field of aviation and general security. It was established in 1982, by former members of the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet,</b> Israel's internal security agency, and El Al airline security agents. The company's shares are traded on OTCQB under the symbol ICTSF.|$|E
25|$|Moshe Ya'alon, Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs, accused Turkey of {{cooperating}} with Hamas and Iran. According to the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet,</b> Hamas established a command post in Turkey and has {{used it to}} recruit operatives and oversee operations in the Middle East. David Ignatius has reported that in 2012, Turkey revealed the names of Mossad agents to Iran.|$|E
25|$|When Yousef {{was growing}} up, {{he wanted to}} be a fighter because that was {{expected}} of Palestinian children in the West Bank. Yousef was first arrested when he was ten, during the First Intifada, for throwing rocks at Israeli settlers. He was further arrested and jailed by Israel numerous times. As his father's eldest son, he was seen as his heir apparent, and became an important part of the Hamas organization. Yousef's doubts about Islam and Hamas began forming when he realized Hamas' brutality, and that he hated how Hamas used the lives of suffering civilians and children to achieve its goals. Yousef was held by <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> agents in 1996. While in prison, he was shocked by Shin Bet's interrogation methods, which he considered humane, when compared to how Hamas operatives tortured imprisoned suspected collaborators. He decided to accept a <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> offer to become an informant.|$|E
25|$|The attack {{shocked the}} Israeli public, and was {{classified}} by Amnesty International {{as a crime}} against humanity. On June 6, 2007, the IDF arrested Jihad Salah Saliman Abu Dahar, a Palestinian member of Islamic Jihad from the Khan Yunis area, who according to <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> officials admitted to several acts of violence, including the attack on Hatuel and her daughters.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the attack, Israel boosted {{security}} at El Al airport counters and around embassies across the globe, whilst flight delays of up to 5–6 hours were reported at Ben-Gurion Airport. Mossad and <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> officials convened a meeting {{on the same day}} to discuss future coordination and to assess the threat level in various countries throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli state {{apparatus}} carried out contradictory and conflicting policies that were {{seen to have}} injured Israel's own interests, such as the closing of educational establishments (putting more youths onto the streets) and issuing the <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> list of collaborators. Suicide bombings by Palestinian militants started on 16 April 1993 with the Mehola Junction bombing, carried {{at the end of}} the Intifada.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after his}} release from Israeli prison Yasin resumed his calls for attacks on Israel, using tactics {{including}} suicide bombings, thus violating the condition of his release. According to IDF and <b>Shin</b> <b>Bet</b> reports, Yassin {{was involved in the}} planning of terror attacks at the operational level. As a result, on March 22, 2004, Yassin was killed in an Israeli targeted killing.|$|E
