These methods include promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power, requiring utilities to use more renewable energy, and providing tax incentives to encourage the development and use of such technologies. It is expected that renewable energy investments will pay off economically in the long term.|$|E

The international financial community offered <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> this program, and economic growth continued.

5|$|On May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln's friends promised and {{manipulated}} {{and won the}} nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on {{his reputation as a}} moderate on the slavery issue, and his <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.|$|E

Jackson's political caution was informed by northern concerns that Texas could potentially form several new slave states and undermine the North-South balance in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} {{is the only}} living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae. It has been {{previously}} placed in the raccoon and bear families, but the results of phylogenetic analysis provide <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> its taxonomic classification in its own family, Ailuridae, {{which is part of}} the superfamily Musteloidea along with the weasel, raccoon and skunk families. Two subspecies are recognized. It is not closely related to the giant panda, which is a basal ursid.|$|E

The latter condemned his <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Algerian independence, and the UK's Eden government was agitated by Nasser's campaign against the Baghdad Pact. In addition, Nasser's adherence to neutralism regarding the Cold War, recognition of communist China, and arms deal with the Eastern bloc alienated the United States. On 19 July 1956, the US and UK abruptly withdrew their offer to finance construction of the Aswan Dam, citing concerns that Egypt's economy would be overwhelmed by the project.|$|E

In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.|$|E
5|$|The Papuan swiftlet, Aerodramus papuensis, {{has three}} toes {{instead of the}} usual four in this group. It has the ability to echolocate, but whereas other {{previously}} studied species use echolocation primarily while flying in their caves, the Papuan swiftlet appears to be nocturnal or crepuscular and uses echolocation while active outside at night. It uses single, not double, clicks. DNA sequence data provides <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> a basal relationship between A. papuensis and other Aerodramus taxa and suggest that this species and the waterfall swift Hydrochous gigas, are sister taxa, a relationship that would indicate paraphyly of the genus Aerodramus.|$|E

5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an {{apparition}} of the murdered Banquo, along with eight kings of his family, descending through Fleance. King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, was the ninth Stuart king. This scene thus suggests <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, was a tangible fulfilment of the witches' prophecy. The apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2009 of seven {{mitochondrial}} genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering {{a host of}} explanations, such as a possible hybridization (introgression) following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> a sister group relationship between fork-marked lemurs {{and the rest of}} the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs. The split between Phaner {{and the rest of the}} cheirogaleids is thought to have occurred approximately 38mya (million years ago), not long after the radiation of most of the major lemur groups on Madagascar, roughly 43mya.|$|E
5|$|Both Democrats and Republicans were {{concerned}} about the presence of S. Brewer Erwin, nominee of the newly formed Populist Party, in the race; he enjoyed <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> a third-party candidate, despite the fact that many believed his party's platform was too radical. Democrats, who were used to carrying the agrarian vote by a wide margin, were especially concerned that the Farmers' Alliance, consisting of over 125,000 members in Kentucky, would endorse Erwin. This did not occur, however, and in the general election, Brown defeated Wood by a vote of 144,168 to 116,087. Though he won the election, Brown had not won a majority of the votes; Populist Erwin captured 25,631 votes – 9 percent of the total cast – and a Prohibition candidate received 3,292 votes.|$|E

The results under the GJR-GARCH method provide <b>stronger</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> market efficiency, especially for large price shocks. For example, for the Hong Kong stock index, negative shocks of less than − 5 % but more than − 10 % generate a significant one day cumulative abnormal return (CAR) of − 0. 754 % under the OLS method, but an insignificant CAR of 0. 022 % under the GJR-GARCH.

5|$|Following his {{resignation}} as Secretary of War, Eaton returned to Tennessee. His wife suffered {{a period of}} ill health after arriving. Jackson planned to replace him in the War Department with Tennessee senator Hugh Lawson White. This would vacate White's senate seat, which Eaton would presumably fill. However, White refused the cabinet position. Eaton attempted {{to return to the}} Senate by running against incumbent Felix Grundy in 1832. Jackson officially remained neutral during the election, as Grundy was also a Democrat. Eaton was defeated. He served as a delegate to the 1832 Democratic National Convention. In a letter to Jackson before the convention, Eaton declared his <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Jackson's choice of Van Buren for vice president. He also requested that several of his friends be given appointments in the administration.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter turnout. Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout. The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> George W. Bush {{in the presidential election}} against John Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Thailand, which {{shared an}} 800-kilometer (500-mile) border with Kampuchea and has {{historically}} feared Vietnam's expansionism, demanded that Vietnam immediately remove its troops from Kampuchea so its people could elect a government free from foreign intervention. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore showed {{their support for}} Thailand's position. Furthermore, ASEAN viewed Vietnam’s invasion and subsequent occupation of Kampuchea, which received strong Soviet support, as an intolerable threat to the region’s security and stability. That view was shared by China, which {{went as far as}} accusing Vietnam of forcing Kampuchea into an Indochinese federation to serve as an outpost of Soviet global hegemony. The United States, which never maintained any form of diplomatic ties with the Khmer Rouge’s Democratic Kampuchea, showed <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the membership of their former enemy in the UN General Assembly, and echoed ASEAN's call for an immediate withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchea.|$|E
