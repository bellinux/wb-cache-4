40|$|An {{electronic}} unit denoted the Miniature Intelligent Sensor Module performs sensor-signal-conditioning functions and local processing of sensor data. The unit includes four channels of analog input/output circuitry, a processor, volatile and nonvolatile memory, and two Ethernet communication ports, all {{housed in a}} weathertight enclosure. The unit accepts AC or DC power. The analog inputs provide programmable gain, offset, and filtering as well as shunt calibration and auto-zeroing. Analog outputs include sine, square, and triangular waves having programmable frequencies and amplitudes, as well as programmable amplitude DC. One innovative aspect of the design of this unit is the integration of a relatively powerful processor and large amount of memory along with the sensor-signalconditioning circuitry so that sophisticated computer programs {{can be used to}} acquire and analyze sensor data and estimate and track the health of the overall sensor-data-acquisition system of which the unit is a part. The unit includes calibration, zeroing, and signalfeedback circuitry to facilitate health monitoring. The processor is also integrated with programmable logic circuitry in such a manner as to simplify and enhance acquisition of data and generation of analog outputs. A notable unique feature of the unit is a cold-junction compensation circuit in the back shell of a <b>sensor</b> <b>connector.</b> This circuit makes it possible to use Ktype thermocouples without compromising a housing seal. Replicas of this unit may prove useful in industrial and manufacturing settings - especially in such large outdoor facilities as refineries.

40|$|Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are {{control devices}} used in {{industry}} to control, operate and monitor plants, machines and robots. PLCs comprise input connectors, typically connected to <b>sensors,</b> output <b>connectors,</b> typically connected to actuators, and a program, which controls the behavior, computing new output values based on the input values and an internal state. Since PLCs operate in safety-critical environments, where a malfunction could seriously harm the environment, humans, or the plant, it is recommended to verify their programs using formal methods. This dissertation studies the formal methods model checking and static analysis to prove the correctness of PLC programs. For this, we developed the tool Arcade. PLC, which allow the automatic application of these methods to PLC programs written for different vendors. It extracts a model from the program by abstract simulation, which over-approximates the possible program behavior. The user is then able to verify whether the model obeys a specification, which can be written in the logic CTL or using automata. For applying model checking, we demonstrate how the model can be extracted automatically, such that the approach scales to industrial size programs. For this, we introduce two different abstraction techniques: First, we develop an abstraction refinement guided by the model checker that automatically creates an abstracted model by iteratively analyzing counterexamples. Second, we implemented a predicate abstraction that evaluates a formalized program semantics using an SMT solver. Both techniques are evaluated using different programs from industry and academia. Further, we introduce a simplified formalism to write specifications, which is influenced by an automata-based language established in industry. We implement an algorithm to check programs using this formalism and show that this technique is even able to detect errors in the specification. Finally, we detail how counterexamples generated by the model checker can be analyzed automatically to locate the actual erroneous line in the program. The static analysis we developed is able to detect program errors in a fully automatic way. We detect typical errors such as division by zero and illegal array accesses, but also PLC specific errors, e. g., during a restart.

One of its main proposed evolutions {{is to be able}} to reach the deeper ocean in order to better observe and understand the key role of the deep ocean in the climate system.

40|$|Failures of {{connectors}} used {{in radio}} frequency (RF) systems cost the telecom industry, mainly cellular phone providers, {{billions of dollars}} annually. This cost is incurred because {{the integrity of the}} connectors cannot currently be monitored in-system and failure results in catastrophic signal loss. The Smart Connector project aims to solve this problem by designing a connector with the capability to sense and report its own integrity. An integrated sensor chip has been developed that mounts on a molded inter-connect device inside of a coaxial cable connector. The current prototype system uses a direct connection to the chip to send the sensor data. However, for the system to be feasible in the target environment it must communicate sensor data wirelessly down the coaxial cable. The sensor chip uses a small loop coupler to inductively couple RF energy from the center conductor of the coaxial cable. The loop coupler is used to wirelessly receive power and to send and receive data from the sensor chip. Because the sensor chip is completely passive (it has no power source) the power available to transmit data is limited. The goal of this thesis is to develop a low power, wireless telemetry system for the Smart <b>Connector</b> <b>sensor</b> disk. This work investigates the analysis and design of an intra-coaxial cable reflected power communication system for use in the Smart Connector system. Theoretical analysis and experimentation proved the plausibility of using an intra-coaxial reflected power communication method for the telemetry system.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} with thermal insulation design in subsea equipment is to minimize the heat loss through cold spots during production shut down. Cold spots are system components where insulation is difficult to implement, resulting in an insulation discontinuity which creates by nature a thermal bridge. It is difficult to avoid cold spots or thermal bridges in items like <b>sensors,</b> valves, <b>connectors</b> and supporting structures. These areas of reduced or no insulation {{are referred to as}} cold spots. Heat is drained faster through these spots, resulting in an increased local fluid density resulting in an internal fluid flow due to gravity and accelerated cooldown. This natural convection flow is important for both heat loss and internal distribution of the temperature. This thesis is presenting both experimental work and modelling work. A series of cool down tests and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of these tests are presented. These tests and simulations were carried out {{in order to understand the}} flow physics involved in heat exchange processes caused by free convection flow in pipe exposed to cooling. Inclination of the pipe relative to the direction of gravity and temperature difference between cooling water and internal pipe water are the two main parameters investigated in this study. The experimental heat removal and temperature field is discussed and further interpreted by means of computational fluid dynamics. For prediction of the evolvement of the local temperature and heat flow, selection of an appropriate turbulence model is critical. Hence, different models and wall functions are investigated. The predicted temperature profiles and heat extraction rates are compared to the experiments for the selected turbulence models. Our main conclusions, supported by our experimental and CFD results, include: (i) Heat transfer from a localized cold spot in an inclined pipe is most efficient when the pipe orientation is close to horizontal. As the pipe becomes more and more inclined the heat transfer (heat extraction) is reduced and the flow becomes more unstable. The results indicate that heat transfer from cold surfaces, where surface normal vector being normal to the gravity vector or surface normal vector facing down, is very efficient, and if possible, both should be avoided in order to minimize local formation of wax or hydrates (crystals) which may take place and could create flow blockage during start-up. (ii) The flow in the selected geometry is complex. In the present work, large eddy simulation (LES) and RANS (Standard k __) turbulence model are compared to our measurements. Consistent with experimental observation, strong unsteadiness was clearly observed in the results of both models; however, the LES model achieved significantly better agreement with temperature and heat transfer measurements than the k __ turbulence model. Based on the results obtained in this work, further application of LES to flows of industrial complexity is recommended. (iii) On the cold spot, developing boundary layers are not in equilibrium with the outer flow, making it difficult to use wall functions.
