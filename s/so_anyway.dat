5|$|In flashbacks, Jack is in Phuket, Thailand, {{where he}} meets a local woman named Achara (Bai Ling); the two soon {{enter into a}} relationship. After finding out that she works in a tattoo parlor and claims {{to be able to}} see who people really are, Jack demands that she give him a tattoo. Achara is {{hesitant}} to give him a tattoo, but she does <b>so</b> <b>anyway</b> and tells him there will be consequences. The next morning, he is beaten up by her brother and other locals and told to leave.|$|E
5|$|OTA {{announced}} plans to include sound barriers at three points along the turnpike in April 1990. The locations were recommended by a report commissioned by OTA, using guidelines published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). While another thirteen locations were likely to have similar noise levels as the three sites selected to receive barriers, abatement was not considered at those locations {{because they did not}} meet other criteria, including minimum population density. Although OTA was not required to follow FHWA guidelines on the Creek Turnpike because it was not a federally funded project, it opted to do <b>so</b> <b>anyway.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the daughters}} of Prajapati (often {{said to be the}} youngest) was Sati or Dakshayani, who had always wished to marry Shiva. Daksha forbade it, but Sati disobeyed him and did <b>so</b> <b>anyway,</b> finding in Shiva a doting and loving husband. Daksha disliked Shiva intensely, calling him a dirty, roaming ascetic and reviling the great yogi's cohort of goblins and ghouls.|$|E

Maybe I didn't say anything of the kind,--only it suited {{you to go back}} and tell her <b>so.</b> <b>Anyways</b> I disremember it altogether. Anyways he wasn't dead. And I ain't dead now." ...|$|R
50|$|Migrant {{sex workers}} who have legal status largely do not exist for two reasons. First, governments with legal sex {{industries}} typically do not allow foreign nationals to participate legally. New Zealand and Australia are two examples that prohibit foreign individuals with various visa statuses from participating in sex work, making individuals who choose to do <b>so</b> <b>anyways</b> illegal under immigration law. Second, governments {{that do not have}} legal sex industries typically allow the entrance of foreign nationals who are currently working as prostitutes or have a history of prostitution.|$|R

25|$|A deeper {{investigation}} by the new board found additional problems. Georgine's profits from the stock trade {{were found to be}} far higher than anyone had guessed—nearly $8.8 million. Georgine and other Ullico executives also received millions of dollars in special bonuses and deferred compensation never approved by the board. O'Sullivan also disclosed that Ullico officers had loaned Georgine $2.2 million to purchase 40,000 shares of low-priced Ullico stock prior to the stock trading scheme, further enlarging his profits, and that Georgine's salary had risen from $900,000 in 1996 to $5.4 million in 2000. Ullico's compensation committee lacked the authority to approve both the loan and the salary increases but did <b>so</b> <b>anyway.</b> O'Sullivan then issued letters to Georgine and the other officers demanding that they refund this money.|$|E
25|$|While the {{enforcement}} in theory {{could lead to}} a Big Brother-style surveillance society, in practice social convention among the Minds prohibits them from watching, or interfering in, citizens' lives unless requested, or unless they perceive severe risk. The practice of reading a sentient's mind without permission (something the Culture is technologically easily capable of) is also strictly taboo. The whole plot of Look to Windward relies on a Hub Mind not reading an agent's mind (with certain precautions in case this rule gets violated). Minds that do <b>so</b> <b>anyway</b> are considered deviant and shunned by other Minds (see GCU Grey Area). At one point it is said that if the Culture actually had written laws, the sanctity of one's own thoughts against the intrusion of others would be the first on the books (Look To Windward).|$|E
25|$|From 1972 to 1975, Coombs {{served as}} a {{consultant}} to Prime Minister Whitlam, but his influence was resented by other ministers. He found the experience of the first Labor government since 1949 disappointing. He disapproved of the events that led up to the Loans Affair of 1975 and the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, which led to the dismissal of Whitlam's government by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr. He advised Whitlam not to resort to unorthodox means of financing government operations when the Senate blocked supply, but Whitlam did <b>so</b> <b>anyway.</b> Although he regarded the dismissal as scandalous, his estrangement from Whitlam meant that he took little subsequent part in politics. In 1975, he was chairman of a Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, which was tasked with examining the purpose, functions, organisation and management of Australian Government bodies and the structure and management of the Australian Public Service. Nevertheless, the Royal Commission report was largely ignored by the incoming Liberal government of Malcolm Fraser.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{discussion}} about the book, Edwin Turner declared that [...] "Flee is maybe the best novel (<b>so</b> far, <b>anyway)</b> to aesthetically and philosophically address the economic collapse of ’08." ...|$|R

500|$|Porrello {{had second}} {{thoughts}} about one scene being included in the film. This particular scene included the murder of two police officers. Porrello felt uncomfortable approaching Hensleigh, but did <b>so</b> <b>anyway.</b> Porrello said to him: [...] "if {{you are going to}} kill a cop", it is [...] "going to change the tone of the story". The scene was nevertheless included in the final cut.|$|E
500|$|McCabe {{died of a}} skull {{fracture}} {{after falling}} from a cliff {{at his home in}} Mosman, New South Wales after attempting to dispose of a dead possum. He had earlier told Dwyer of his plan to clean out his backyard, and was told to rest, but did <b>so</b> <b>anyway,</b> falling down and rolling off the steep slope in his backyard and over the ledge of the cliff abutting the rear of his house. There was innuendo that McCabe had actually committed suicide, with O'Reilly musing [...] "He had despatched the possum, but had gone overboard with it!". However, the coroner ruled that the death was accidental and his family strongly denied that he had chosen to end his life. The coroner’s investigation noted that McCabe’s hands had tufts of ripped grass in them, indicating that he had tried to grab onto vegetation in a vain attempt to stop his fall.|$|E
500|$|After a crazy New Year's Eve, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{realizes that}} {{while under the}} {{influence}} of alcohol, he left a message on the answering machine of Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), his high school sweetheart. He and NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) immediately travel to Massachusetts and break into Nancy's home while she is on vacation, hoping to erase the message. While Kenneth fumbles with the computer, Jack examines the house and finds evidence that Nancy's marriage is reaching its end. They eventually play the message, after Jack finds the voicemail code, in which Jack reminisces about their times in high school German class. In that class, [...] Jack had the name [...] "Klaus" [...] and Nancy had the name [...] "Greta"—and Jack says that he took the class to be with her. Jack decides not to erase the message, but Kenneth does <b>so</b> <b>anyway.</b> When they return to New York, Kenneth realizes that Nancy's voicemail code (55287) stands for [...] "Klaus", which means that Nancy does have feelings for Jack.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} enough to have you rising and sinking there, without your staring at all: If you're going to stay, I wish you'd lie down. I don't see why you're <b>so</b> well, <b>anyway,</b> after getting us all to come on this wild-goose chase." ...|$|R

500|$|On 29 March 1951, Boganda {{was sentenced}} to two months in prison {{following}} his arrest on 10 January for [...] "endangering the peace" [...] after intervening in a local market dispute (the [...] "Bokanga incident" [...] in Lobaye). His wife {{was sentenced to}} 15 days in prison, but neither served their terms. On 17 June, he was re-elected to the National Assembly with 48% of the vote despite the obstacles placed in his way by the administration and strong opposition by the authorities, colonists, and the missions, with two prominent French candidates seeking to oust him. At this time, he emerged as an extraordinarily popular messianic folk hero and his country's leading nationalist; MESAN became the majority party in the Territorial Assembly elections in March 1952. In this period he divided his time between his coffee plantation, his emancipation work and new political positions. In April 1954, an incident that would showcase Boganda's talent and appeal with crowds erupted at Berbérati. A white public works agent, who had recently been reprimanded for his brutality toward Africans, announced that his cook and the cook's wife had died. A riot broke out and the governor sent in parachutists while armoured vehicles patrolled the streets. Boganda hesitated to appear in a village that {{was not one of}} his strongholds, but did <b>so</b> <b>anyway</b> and declared before the rioters that justice would be the same for blacks and whites. Upon hearing Boganda's words, the crowd became calm and dispersed.|$|E
2500|$|Like Page, Harron {{also does}} not follow a strict feminist ideology, but has instead openly {{explored}} issues, instead of tying herself to a single perspective on gender. She is not aiming to create political films, but may end up doing <b>so</b> <b>anyway,</b> in her attempt to express a woman's point of view. In an interview she says: ...|$|E
2500|$|Vosill {{requests}} the King {{release her}} from her duties, which he does. [...] She leaves {{just a few days}} later on a ship for Drezen, and is seen off at the dock by Oelph. Oelph tries to suppress the urge to ask to accompany Vosill, since he knows that her answer will be in the negative, but in the end he does <b>so</b> <b>anyway.</b> The ship leaves sometime later, Vosill nowhere to be seen on board.|$|E

50|$|Stress accents {{are still}} disregarded. Arguably the K and W tiles {{should not be}} {{included}} in this Scrabble set, but they are <b>anyways,</b> <b>so</b> that loanwords can be played.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{anybody can}} {{see the kind of}} a boy that Jim Leonard was, pretty well; and the strange thing of it was that he could have such a boy as Pony Baker under him <b>so.</b> But, <b>anyway,</b> Pony liked Jim, as much as his mother hated him, and he {{believed}} everything Jim said in spite of all that had happened.|$|R
2500|$|Cleese {{allegedly}} defaced {{the school}} grounds, as a prank, by painting footprints {{to suggest that}} the statue of Field Marshal Earl Haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet. Cleese played cricket in the First XI and did well academically, passing 8 O-Levels and 3 A-Levels in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. In his autobiography <b>So,</b> <b>Anyway,</b> he says that discovering, aged 17, he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook: [...] "It was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect... I believe that this moment changed my perspective on the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{medallion}} taxicabs in {{the city}} are always yellow and boro taxis are green, car service vehicles may be any color but yellow; they are usually black and are sometimes called [...] "black car" [...] services. Despite the de jure prohibition on picking up passengers who hail on the street, some livery cabs nevertheless do <b>so</b> <b>anyway,</b> often to make extra money. When a livery cab engages in street pick-ups, it becomes known as a [...] "gypsy cab." [...] They are often found in areas not routinely visited by medallion cabs, and authorities tend to ignore the practice rather than leave sections of the city without cab service.|$|E
2500|$|Langtry did {{not have}} a jail, so all cases were settled by fines. Bean refused to send the state any part of the fines but instead kept all of the money. In most cases, the fines were made for the exact amount on the accused's person. Bean is known to have sentenced only two men to hang, one of whom escaped. Horse thieves, who were often sentenced to death in other jurisdictions, were always let go if the horses were returned. Although only {{district}} courts were legally allowed to grant divorces, Bean did <b>so</b> <b>anyway,</b> pocketing $10 for each divorce. He charged $5 for weddings, and ended all wedding ceremonies with [...] "and may God have mercy on your souls" [...] (traditionally the end of a death sentence).|$|E
6000|$|... "She reads a great deal," [...] {{admitted}} her mother. [...] "She {{seems to}} be at it the whole while. I don't want she should injure her health, and sometimes I feel like snatchin' the books away from her. I don't know as it's good for a girl to read <b>so</b> much, <b>anyway,</b> especially novels. I don't want she should get notions." ...|$|R

2500|$|Baker and the Nemesis {{had been}} {{assigned}} to enforce the blockade of naval stores to the French and Dutch dockyards, with a small squadron under his command. On 25 July he approached a convoy of six merchantmen off Ostend, that was being escorted by the 40-gun Danish frigate Freja, and announced his intention to search the merchants, as he suspected them of carrying stores to be used by the French. The commander of the Freja, Captain Krabbe, announced that he would fire on any boat that Baker sent to carry this out. Baker did <b>so</b> <b>anyway</b> and the Danish opened fire, but missed the boat. The shot hit the Nemesis and killed a man. Incensed, Baker ordered a general action and after 25 minutes fighting, subdued the Freja. The Freja and the convoy were escorted into the Downs, where the commander of the station, Vice-Admiral Skeffington Lutwidge, ordered that the Freja continue to fly the Danish colours while the matter was investigated.|$|E
2500|$|From his {{experiences}} in the Russo-Japanese War, Troubridge was aware that modern naval ordnance could devastate his squadron and that the Goebens 11-inch guns considerably outranged his own, which consisted of 9.2-inch and 7.5-inch guns. A night attack on the German force using the cruiser [...] failed when the British ship failed to make contact, so Troubridge attempted to catch the Germans in narrow waters to reduce the range. Troubridge was still unaware of German intentions, and feared they might double-back to the north east and effect a junction with the Austro-Hungarian fleet. Troubridge resolved to intercept the German squadron and headed southwards to do so, but his flag captain, Fawcet Wray, argued against seeking battle. Troubridge was reluctant to do <b>so</b> <b>anyway,</b> knowing that his ships would be both outranged and attacking in daylight, but felt {{it was the only}} honourable option. Wray argued that it would be suicide for the squadron to fight the bigger and longer-ranging guns of the Goeben and as Wray had a particular reputation in the fleet as an expert on gunnery, Troubridge allowed himself to be persuaded. In tears, Troubridge ordered the chase to be abandoned, a decision that caused Wray to say 'Sir, this is the bravest thing you have ever done.' Troubridge's signal was transmitted shortly afterwards: 4.49am, 7/8/14, to Milne:Being only able to meet Goeben outside the range of our guns and inside his, I have abandoned the chase with my squadron. Goeben evidently going to the Eastern Mediterranean. The chase abandoned, the Germans made it to Constantinople, and the ships were almost immediately turned over the Turkish Navy.|$|E
2500|$|Batista {{then became}} {{involved}} in WWE Chairman Vince McMahon and Bret Hart's rivalry in February 2010 by assisting McMahon in attacking Hart; John Cena attempted to save Hart, but was assaulted by Batista. On February 21 at Elimination Chamber, as payment for Batista attacking Hart, McMahon allowed Batista to face Cena for the WWE Championship immediately after Cena won the title in an Elimination Chamber match. Batista won the match and thus his second WWE Championship, which resulted in Batista moving back to Raw. On March 28 at WrestleMania XXVI, Batista lost the WWE Championship to John Cena in a rematch, ending his reign at 35 days. Batista received his rematch for the title in a Last Man Standing on April 25 at Extreme Rules, but was defeated by Cena after Cena duct-taped his legs around a ring post, preventing him from standing up. Batista and Cena faced off once again for the WWE Championship on May 23 at Over the Limit, but he failed again to regain the title from Cena in an [...] "I Quit" [...] match, quitting as Cena threatened {{to give him the}} Attitude Adjustment off the roof of a car. Cena did <b>so</b> <b>anyway,</b> throwing Batista off of the car and through the stage below. The following night on Raw, Batista opened the show in a wheelchair and claimed that he would be pursuing legal action against Cena and WWE for his injuries (which he revealed in 2014 to be a legitimate compression fracture of his L1 spine). His promo was interrupted by new Raw General Manager Bret Hart, who requested he face an injured Randy Orton to qualify for a shot at WWE Championship against Cena again at the new Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view. Batista refused and quit the company after Hart named Orton winner by forfeit. His profile was subsequently moved to the WWE.com alumni page. He later {{said in an interview that}} he left WWE because he [...] "did not like the direction the company was going in".|$|E
