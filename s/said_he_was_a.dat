5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles. He {{was interviewed by}} Mexican authorities and stated {{that he was not}} guilty of Fischer's murder. He admitted to having stolen cars since he was young, and stated that Garza was trying to put the blame on him to protect himself from prosecution. Olivarez justified himself by saying that he had never been arrested with a gun. He admitted going to Dallas in 1992, but stated that he only knew Garza by name. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> self-employed auto mechanic who supported his wife, mother, and uncle. Mexican officials said that Olivarez's auto theft ring extended all the way to Monterrey, as well as in Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. There was an arrest warrant for him issued by a state judge in Reynosa for being connected to about 50 car thefts. Brownsville investigators went to Mexico {{to see if they could}} talk to Olivarez, and began extradition procedings to bring him to a Texan court.|$|E

Bill Brosnan, the store owner, knew him for seven years and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fan of military books and Soldier of Fortune magazine.

25|$|Rose, who {{had begun}} to engage in {{prostitution}} by this time, explained to Owens that {{she worked as a}} masseuse when the younger woman enquired about the steady stream of men visiting her. According to Owens, Fred also <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> skilled abortionist, who was available should she ever need such a service. Owens also noted Fred talked about sex almost incessantly; her suspicions as to his sexual overtones were further heightened when Fred boasted that many of the women he claimed to have performed abortions upon were so overjoyed that they would offer him their sexual services as a reward. When Owens herself became the recipient of the Wests' overt sexual advances, she announced her intentions to leave Cromwell Street and return home.|$|E
25|$|On 20 July 1990 a bomb {{planted by}} the IRA {{exploded}} in the men's toilets behind the visitors' gallery. The area had already been evacuated and nobody was injured. About 30 minutes before the blast at 8:49a.m., a man who <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of the IRA told Reuters that a bomb had been placed at the exchange {{and was about to}} explode. Police officials said that if there had been no warning, the human toll would have been very high. The explosion ripped a hole in the 23-story building on Threadneedle Street and sent a shower of glass and concrete onto the street. The long term trend towards electronic trading had been reducing the Exchange's status as a visitor attraction and, although the gallery reopened, it was closed permanently in 1992.|$|E

They continued talking to Albert until the young man <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fan of The Vachons causing The Hellraisers to attack him. The Vachons then ran to the ring to chase off The Hellraisers setting up two singles matches between the four wrestlers later that night.

Both teams were scheduled to meet in a Dog Collar match for the GMW Tag Team Championship on March 10.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with the press in 2014, Serafín and Martínez Salinas gave their versions of the story and proclaimed their innocence. Serafín stated that the Federal Judicial Police commander Juan Benítez Ayala found Serafín guilty because he was related to Elio and Ovidio. He said he was not arrested at the ranch, but rather at Elio's in-law's house in Matamoros. He said he grew up in Houston and moved to Brownsville for college, and that he was in Matamoros visiting his family when he was taken by the police. Serafín said he had been tortured by the Mexican and U.S. police in Matamoros to confess his participation in Kilroy's murder and in the killings at Santa Elena. He said he was allegedly beaten and told that he and his family would be killed if he spoke English during his declaration. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> student of Texas Southmost College and knew who Aldrete was, but had not a relationship with her. Serafín also stated that he had never met Constanzo and had no idea his family ranch was a gathering place for his cult.

5000|$|In spring 2004, the Nebraska Hall of Fame Commission created {{controversy}} when {{it considered}} naming U.S. Senator Kenneth S. Wherry or Malcolm X {{to the hall}} of fame. Critics of Wherry <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> inappropriate inductee because of his [...] "crusade to root out homosexuals in government" [...] during his tenure in Congress {{at the height of}} McCarthyism. Critics of Malcolm X <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> inappropriate inductee because he only lived in Nebraska for a few months after his birth in Omaha. On April 27, 2004, the commission selected Wherry over Malcolm X on a four-three vote.|$|R

25|$|As {{soon as the}} Captain of the Guard {{declared}} his charge to make him prisoner, Cromwell in a rage cast his bonnet on the ground, saying to the duke of Norfolk and others of the Privy Council assembled there {{that this was the}} reward of his services, and that he appealed to their consciences as to whether he was a traitor; but since he was treated thus he renounced all pardon, as he had never thought to have offended, and only asked the King not to make him languish long. Thereupon some <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> traitor, others that he should be judged according to the laws he had made, which were so sanguinary that often words spoken inadvertently with good intention had been constituted high treason. The duke of Norfolk having reproached him with some “villennyes” done by him, snatched off the order of St. George which he bore on his neck, and the Admiral, to show himself as great an enemy in adversity as he had been thought a friend in prosperity, untied the Garter. Then, by a door which opens upon the water, he was put in a boat and taken to the Tower without the people of this town suspecting it until they saw all the King's archers under Mr. Cheyney {{at the door of the}} prisoner's house, where they made an inventory of his goods.|$|E
