5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1952–53 season, the New South Wales Cricket Association's five-man {{selection}} panel installed Miller as captain in place of Morris. This was despite Morris leading the <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sheffield Shield in the previous season. Miller did not lobby for the job, but the Sydney media had campaigned for Miller, suggesting that his flamboyant style would attract more spectators and help stem the financial losses of the NSWCA. Despite this, Morris remained the Test vice-captain ahead of Miller.|$|E

5|$|Before the murders, Kovář's family became {{worried about}} his mental <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point that they {{contacted}} authorities in connection with his possession of gun license. Just {{four days before the}} murders, Kovář had received a police request to present a new health clearance under the threat of revoking his license. Before entering the Družba restaurant, Kovář visited at least two other venues. Those, however, had fewer customers, and Kovář left them immediately after entering.|$|E
5|$|Congress overrode a Johnson veto to {{pass the}} Civil Rights Act of 1866 (also {{introduced}} by Trumbull), granting African-Americans citizenship and equality before the law, and forbidding any action by a <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contrary. Johnson made the gap between him and Congress wider when he accused Stevens, Sumner, and Wendell Phillips of trying to destroy the government.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the eight-team Atlantic Coast Conference added Florida <b>State</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> league, {{creating}} a new nine-team ACC. Though Florida State was the only school added to the conference, some league officials discussed offering one or more other schools—Navy, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, South Carolina, Miami, West Virginia, Boston College, Rutgers, or Virginia Tech—an offer to join the league. For various reasons, however, no other team was extended an offer. Throughout the 1990s, the Atlantic Coast Conference remained at nine members. Ironically, South Carolina was a charter member of the ACC that left in 1971.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-2000s, {{the route}} was reconfigured in the {{northern}} part of Medina to use Main and Commercial streets instead of Center Street and Prospect Avenue. The change was made as part of a village project known as the Pass Thru Project, and the realignment eliminated a three-block overlap with the easternmost part of NY31E on Center Street. Ownership and maintenance of NY63's former alignment was transferred from the <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village on July1, 2010, as part of a highway maintenance swap that gave Commercial Street and the northernmost block of Main Street to the state.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, group theory helps {{predict the}} changes in {{physical}} properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.|$|E
5|$|NY345 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it originally followed a different alignment south of the hamlet of Madrid. At the time, what is now NY345 between Madrid and Potsdam was part of NY56A. The NY56A designation was eliminated in 1980. NY345 was realigned two years later to follow old NY56A to Potsdam {{as a result of a}} highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and St. Lawrence County. Ownership and maintenance of NY345's original routing south of Madrid was transferred from the <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> county and the village of Canton {{as part of the}} exchange.|$|E

5|$|On April1, 1980, {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} the portion of NY210 from NY17 to the Orange–Rockland county line was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Orange County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. Two years later, the portion of the route within Rockland County was turned over from the <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> county. As a result, NY210 was truncated to the former western terminus of its overlap with NY17A in Greenwood Lake. The former routing of NY210 is now designated as CR106 in both Orange and Rockland counties.|$|E
5|$|Signatures are {{received}} at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City by authorized {{representatives of the}} state. Ratification is achieved {{with the approval of}} either or both chamber of the legislature and executive of the state. The instrument of ratification serves as the document binding the <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> international treaty and can be accepted only with the validating signature of the head of state or other official with full powers to sign it. The instrument is deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{completion}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in 1977, the government of the state of Alaska has been reliant on taxes paid by oil producers and shippers. Prior to 1976, Alaska's personal income tax rate was 14.5 percent—the highest in the United States. The gross state product was $8billion, and Alaskans earned $5 billion in personal income. Thirty years after the pipeline began operating, the state had no personal income tax, the gross state product was $39billion, and Alaskans earned $25billion in personal income. Alaska moved from the most heavily taxed <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> most tax-free state.|$|E

5|$|Some {{areas of}} the park were {{formerly}} part of the princely state of Tehri Garhwal. The forests were cleared to make the area less vulnerable to Rohilla invaders. The Raja of Tehri formally ceded {{a part of his}} princely <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East India Company in return for their assistance in ousting the Gurkhas from his domain. The Boksas—a tribe from the Terai—settled on the land and began growing crops, but in the early 1860s they were evicted with the advent of British rule.|$|E
5|$|Special {{procedures}} {{apply to}} legislation {{passed by the}} Tynwald of the Isle of Man. Before the lordship of the Island was purchased by the British Crown in 1765 (the Revestment), the assent of the Lord of Mann to a bill was signified by letter to the governor. After 1765, {{the equivalent of the}} royal assent was at first signified by the letter from the Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> governor; but, during the British Regency, the practice began of granting the equivalent of the royal assent to Manx legislation by Orders in Council, which continues to this day, though limited to exceptional cases since 1981.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is {{the first}} element in group 13 where the {{reduction}} of the +3 oxidation <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> +1 oxidation state is spontaneous under standard conditions. Since bond energies decrease down the group, by thallium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the 6s-electrons. Accordingly, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic, showing that thallium conforms to the general rule of elements being more electropositive in their lower oxidation states.|$|E

5|$|The Empire of Trebizond, {{which had}} split {{away from the}} Byzantine Empire just weeks before Constantinople {{was taken by the}} Crusaders in 1204, became the last remnant and last de facto {{successor}} <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire. Efforts by the Emperor David to recruit European powers for an anti-Ottoman crusade provoked war between the Ottomans and Trebizond in the summer of 1461. After a month-long siege, David surrendered the city of Trebizond on 14 August 1461. The Empire of Trebizond's Crimean principality, the Principality of Theodoro (part of the Perateia), lasted another 14 years, falling to the Ottomans in December 1475.|$|E
5|$|Two other swords are used. The two-handed Sword of State, made in 1678, symbolises the monarch's royal authority. It is {{also carried}} before the monarch at State Openings of Parliament.

In the centre is the royal badge of joint-sovereigns WilliamIII and MaryII, for whose coronation the sheath {{was made in}} 1689.
