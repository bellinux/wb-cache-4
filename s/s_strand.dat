5000|$|LCMV is a spherical {{enveloped virus}} with a {{diameter}} between 60 and 300 nm. The helical nucleocapsid contains an RNA genome {{consisting of two}} negative single-stranded RNA segments. The negative RNA strand, complementary to the necessary mRNA strand, indicates that it must first be transcribed into a positive mRNA strand {{before it can be}} translated into the required proteins. The L strand is ambisense RNA, encoding multiple proteins in opposite directions, separated by an intergenic region. It is approximately 7.2 kb in size and encodes a high-molecular-mass protein (L; 200 kDa) and an 11 kDa small polypeptide Z with unknown function and a ring finger motif. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is encoded by the L protein which contains conserved characteristic motifs throughout all the RNA-dependent, RNA-polymerases. The <b>S</b> <b>strand</b> is ambisense and approximately 3.4 kb in size. It encodes the two main structural proteins: nucleo-protein (63 kDa) and glycoprotein C (75kDa). [...] The latter undergoes posttranslational cleavage and results in the synthesis of two mature virion glycoproteins, GP-1 (40 to 46 kDa) and GP-2 (35 kDa). The spikes present on the virion envelope are dictated by tetramer formation of GP-1 and GP-2.|$|E
40|$|Synthetic RNA duplexes {{that are}} {{substrates}} for Dicer are potent triggers of RNA interference (RNAi). Blunt 27 mer duplexes can {{be up to}} 100 -fold more potent than traditional 21 mer duplexes (1). Not all 27 mer duplexes show increased potency. Evaluation of the products of in vitro dicing reactions using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry reveals {{that a variety of}} products can be produced by Dicer cleavage. Use of asymmetric duplexes having a single 2 -base 3 ′-overhang restricts the heterogeneity that results from dicing. Inclusion of DNA residues at the ends of blunt duplexes also limits heterogeneity. Combination of asymmetric 2 -base 3 ′-overhang with 3 ′-DNA residues on the blunt end result in a duplex form which directs dicing to predictably yield a single primary cleavage product. It is therefore possible to design a 27 mer duplex which is processed by Dicer to yield a specific, desired 21 mer species. Using this strategy, two different 27 mers can be designed that result in the same 21 mer after dicing, one where the 3 ′-overhang resides on the antisense (AS) strand and dicing proceeds to the ‘right’ (‘R’) and one where the 3 ′-overhang resides on the sense (<b>S)</b> <b>strand</b> and dicing proceeds to the ‘left’ (‘L’). Interestingly, the ‘R’ version of the asymmetric 27 mer is generally more potent in reducing target gene levels than the ‘L’ version 27 mer. Strand targeting experiments show asymmetric strand utilization between the two different 27 mer forms, with the ‘R’ form favoring <b>S</b> <b>strand</b> and the ‘L’ form favoring AS strand silencing. Thus, Dicer processing confers functional polarity within the RNAi pathway...|$|E

These nuclear monolayers incorporated [3 H]TTP into two types of viral replicative intermediates that sediment as 25 - 26 S and 22 - 23 S species, respectively, in neutral sucrose gradients. The 22 - 23 S species behaves, in dye buoyant density equilibrium gradients, as a late replicative intermediate. Examination of both species in alkaline sucrose gradients revealed the presence of two types of newly synthesized strands: (i) 4 - 7 <b>S</b> <b>strands</b> and (ii) full-length, or nearly full-length, 10 - 16 <b>S</b> <b>strands.</b> At low TTP concentrations (less than 0. 5 muM), the two size classes were found in approximately equal amounts. However, at 10 to 50 muM TTP, {{the proportion of the}} longer strands increased, with a corresponding decrease in the relative amount of the 4 - 7 S species. Thus, the joining of small, Okazaki-like fragments to the growing chain appears to require a much higher concentration of TTP than the synthesis of the fragments themselves. Replicating simian virus 40 DNA synthesized in the nuclear monolayers is is associated with "M bands", as previously demonstrated for replicating simian virus 40 DNA in cultured whole cells...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe serpin {{family of}} {{proteins}} consists primarily of proteinase inhibitors which form tight complexes with target proteinases. Inhibitor serpins are cleaved by proteinase and undergo a large conformational change {{in which the}} polypeptide segment terminating at the target reactive site, at which cleavage takes place, inserts itself as an additional <b>strand,</b> <b>s</b> 4 A, {{in the center of}} a preexisting β-sheet. This change in conformation increases the stability towards denaturation of the cleaved serpin relative to the native uncleaved form. Mutant serpins with single amino acid changes in the <b>s</b> 4 A <b>strand</b> have been identified, and in most cases these are proteinase substrates but not inhibitors. We have measured the stability to denaturation of one of these non-inhibitor substrate mutants, antithrombin-Hamilton, which has an Ala → Thr change at position P 12 in <b>strand</b> <b>s</b> 4 A. We find that it undergoes the transformation to the more stable form which is observed for inhibitor serpins, from which we conclude that the Ala → Thr change in antithrombin-Hamilton does not prevent insertion of s 4 A into β-sheet A in the cleaved form...|$|R

40|$|Optimization {{of small}} interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is {{important}} in RNA interference (RNAi) -based therapeutic development. Some specific chemical modifications can control which siRNA strand is selected by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) for gene silencing. Intended strand selection will increase potency and reduce off-target effects from the unintended strand. Sometimes, blocking RISC loading of the unintended strand leads to improved intended strand-silencing potency, but the generality of this phenomenon is unclear. Specifically, unlocked nucleic acid (UNA) modification of the 5 ′ end of canonical (i. e., 19 + 2) siRNAs abrogates gene silencing of the modified strand, but the fate and potency of the unmodified strand has not been investigated. Here, we show that 5 ′ UNA-modified siRNAs show improved silencing potency of the unmodified strand. We harness this advantageous property in a therapeutic context, where a limited target region in a conserved HIV 5 ′ long terminal repeat U 5 region would otherwise yield siRNAs with undesired strand selection properties and poor silencing. Applying 5 ′ UNA modification to the unintended sense (<b>S)</b> <b>strand</b> of these otherwise poorly targeted siRNAs dramatically improves on-target silencing by the intended antisense (AS) strand in pNL 4 - 3. luciferase studies. This study highlights the utility of 5 ′ UNA siRNA modification in therapeutic contexts where siRNA sequence selection is constrained...|$|E

This sequence was found to be 3, 308 nucleotides long. Potential ATG initiator triplets and nonsense codons were identified and used to locate regions with a substantial coding capacity. A striking similarity was observed between the organization of human hepatitis B virus and woodchuck hepatitis virus. Nucleotide sequences of these open regions in the woodchuck virus were compared with corresponding regions present in hepatitis B virus. This allowed the location of four viral genes on the L strand and indicated the absence of protein coded by the <b>S</b> <b>strand.</b> Evolution rates of the various parts of the genome {{as well as of the}} four different proteins coded by hepatitis B virus and woodchuck hepatitis virus were compared. These results indicated that: (i) the core protein has evolved slightly less rapidly than the other proteins; and (ii) when a region of DNA codes for two different proteins, there is less freedom for the DNA to evolve and, moreover, one of the proteins can evolve more rapidly than the other. A hairpin structure, very well conserved in the two genomes, was located in the only region devoid of coding function, suggesting the location of the origin of replication of the viral DNA...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between concrete compressive strength and strand bond. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop an equation that relates strand bond to concrete compressive strength at strand release (approximately 1 day of age) and at 28 days of age, and those equations are presented in this investigation. Strand bond is assessed by measuring the transfer length and development length for prestressed beams cast in the laboratory. In the U. <b>S.,</b> <b>strand</b> bond is predicted using transfer length and development length equations provided by the American Concrete Institute (ACI- 318) Building Code and American Association of State and Highway Transportation Official (AASHTO) LRFD Bridge Design Specifications which were developed based on the 1950 ´s investigations. The equations provided by both ACI and AASHTO do not address concrete strength while equations, developed in this investigation, do account for the compressive strength of concrete at release and testing time. Although there has been much research conducted in this matter, this research provides a reliability data analysis relating to transfer and development lengths of prestressed concrete beams. Unlike many of the previous programs, this research includes strands of a known quality, the largest database of test specimens, and a variety of concrete mixtures and concrete strengths.

Note that the two strands interact in opposite directions, e. g. R in 5 ′ → 3 ′ with S in 3 ′ ← 5 ′ direction. Each nucleotide is paired with at most one nucleotide in the same or the other strand. The subsequence from the ith nucleotide to the jth nucleotide in a strand is denoted by [i,j]. We refer to the ith nucleotide in R and S by iR and iS respectively. An intramolecular base pair between the nucleotides i and j in a strand is called an arc and denoted by a bullet i • j. An intermolecular base pair between the nucleotides iR and iS is called a bond and denoted by a circle iR ◦ iS. An arc iR • jR covers a bond lR ◦ kS if iR < lR < jR.

40|$|Hollows Left Behind {{comprises}} an exegesis and a postmodern, polyphonic novel which seek {{to provide}} a feminine, ‘biography’ of Zimbabwe/Rhodesia wherein female protagonists trespass into liminal spaces, exploring binaries: coloniser/colonised, black/white, male/female. The novel is framed as ‘biography’ for it offers counter memories {{as an alternative to}} orthodox, largely masculine- inscribed histories, often influenced by political and social agendas. Silence is the core of the project and the intention is to ‘unconceal’ minor voices in pursuit of ‘truth’. The novel ‘translates’ silences into three interweaving narrative strands. Each strand is set within a tumultuous era of Zimbabwe/Rhodesia and they depict the lived experiences of three female protagonists: Billie, Ruth and Clea. Billie’s (1890 <b>s)</b> <b>strand</b> re-enacts the establishment of the British colony, Rhodesia. Ruth’s strand focuses on the Liberation War of the 1970 s while Clea’s strand is set in Zimbabwe, 2015. These characters have been silenced, but they have also silenced themselves, and represent groups that have been largely written out of the historic canon: women settlers, female guerrilla fighters and birth mothers who relinquished babies. The ‘unconcealment’ (aletheia) of their stories reveals lacunae in the ‘grand narratives’. The bricolage exegesis tests the often opaque boundaries between history, biography and fiction, and interrogates the nature of ‘truth’. It investigates the complicity and resistance of women settlers to the imperial vision and engages in debates circulating the appropriation and depiction of O/other stories. The exegesis is a biography of the novel, incorporating its journey from conception to completion as it maps my personal journey into the country’s contentious history. It explores the influence of particular research methodologies –archaeology (Foucault), hauntology (Derrida) and psychogeography (Dubord, Benjamin, Holmes) and records the creative decisions which underpin the strands. I aim {{to provide a}} more nuanced interpretation of Zimbabwe/Rhodesia as well as to explore themes of personal and national importance: identity, memory/myth-making, and personal agency/complicity. However, the quest to ‘unconceal’ truth has been a lesson in humility and caution so therefore, in keeping with my feminine approach, I offer my novel and exegesis as my experience, my truth...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{the construction and}} characterisation {{of a variety of}} polymer network hydrogels based on β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) trimers and modified poly(acrylate) s. Chapter 1 extensively reviews in cyclodextrin (CD) fields from its history from beginning in 1981 until 2013. The most significant work is highlighted as well as the field of polymer hydrogel, including the novel field of CD based polymer hydrogel. In Chapter 2, a UV-vis and ¹H NMR spectroscopic study of the host-guest complexation by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), 1, 3, 5 -N,N,N-tris-(6 ᴬ-deoxy- 6 ᴬ-β-cyclodextrin) -benzene (β-CD₃bz), and 1, 3, 5 -N,N,N-tris(6 ᴬ-(2 -aminoethyl) amino- 6 ᴬ-deoxy- 6 ᴬ-β -cyclodextrin) - benzene (β-CDen₃bz) of cationic crystal violet (CV⁺) and pyronine B (PB⁺) and zwitterionic rhodamine B (RB) in aqueous phosphate buffer at pH 7. 0 and I = 0. 10 mol dm³ is described. The complexation constants and the associated ∆H₁₁ and T∆S₁₁ for all nine complexes coincide with an entropy-enthalpy compensation plot for the formation {{of a wide range of}} β-CD and modified β-CD host-guest complexes reported in the literature. Crystal violet also forms (β-CD) ₂. CV⁺, (β-CD₃bz) ₂. CV⁺ and (β-CDen₃bz) ₂. CV⁺ complexes characterized by 10 ⁻²K₂₁ (298. 2 K) = 2. 14, 4. 57 and 3. 86 dm³ mol⁻¹ and analogous (β-CD) ₂. PB⁺, (β-CDen₃bz) ₂. PB⁺ and (β-CDen₃bz) ₂. RB complexes also form, but the (β-CD₃bz) ₂. PB⁺, (β-CD) ₂. RB, and (β-CD₃bz) ₂. RB complexes were not detected. The effects of the structures of the hosts and guests on the complexation processes are discussed. In Chapter 3 the characterisation stability of constants and thermodynamic patterns in polymer hydrogels based on host-guest complexation of the linked β-CD trimers with the dodecyl (C 12) and octadecyl (C 18) 3 % randomly substituted poly(acrylate) s PAAC 12 and PAAC 18 in aqueous solution are discussed. These studies compare hydrophobic interactions of the C 12 and C 18 substituted poly(acrylate) s and their interaction with β-CD and linked β-CD trimers. The complexation processes were studied by 2 D NOESY ¹H NMR spectroscopy, ITC, dynamic light scattering and rheology. These data are used to establish the extent to which these interactions influence hydrogel formation in more concentrated solutions. In Chapter 4 the supramolecular chemistry of polymer hydrogel based on host-guest chemistry of the linked β-cyclodextrin trimers and four adamantyl substituted poly(acrylate) s with different linker tether lengths is discussed. 2 D NOESY ¹H NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry and rheological studies show that the β-CD groups of the two linked β-cyclodextrin trimers, β-CD₃bz and β-CDen₃bz, complex the adamantyl substituents and their tethers in 3. 0 % substituted poly(acrylate) s to form intra and inter-poly(acrylate) <b>s</b> <b>strand</b> cross-links in aqueous solution. The structures of the linked-β-cyclodextrin trimers and the length of the tether between the adamantly substituent and the poly(acrylate) s backbone have substantial effects on the complexation constants, K₁₁, and the associated thermodynamic parameters. This is partially shown for the complexation by β-CD₃bz of the adamantyl substituents as tether length varies from -CONH- (3. 45 × 10 ⁴) through -CONH(CH₂) NHCO- where n = 2 (2. 09 × 10 ⁵), 6 (3. 17 × 10 ⁵) or 12 (7. 46 × 10 ⁴) in 0. 13 – 0. 37 wt. % substituted poly(acrylate) s solutions and the figures in brackets are the K₁₁ in dm³ mol⁻¹ at 298. 2 K. For the same sequence of substituted poly(acrylate) s the variation of viscosity is: 0. 03, 3. 78, 3. 48, and 2. 03 Pa s⁻¹ at 500 s⁻¹ shear rate at 298. 2 K for 5. 0 wt. % substituted poly(acrylate) s solutions in which the β-CD groups of β-CD₃bz and the adamantyl substituents are equimolar at 1. 5 × 10 ⁻² mol dm⁻³. The eight data sets for the β-CD₃bz and β-CDen₃bz systems are discussed in terms of host-guest interactions between the host β-CD groups and the guest adamantyl substituents of the substituted poly(acrylate) s and are compared with those for the analogous β-CD systems. In chapter 5, the supramolecular chemistry of the poly(acrylate) s hydrogels based on host-guest complexations of the linked β-CD₃bz and β-CDen₃bz trimers with the dansyl substituent guests (DS) attached through tethers of three different lengths containing 2, 6 and 12 methylene groups in 3. 0 % randomly substituted, PAADSen, PAADShn and PAADSddn are discussed. The six systems have been characterized at the molecular level by 2 D NOESY ¹H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry, fluorescence spectroscopy and time-resolved fluorescence, and at the macroscopic level by dynamic light scattering and rheology. The data gathered are consistent with individual dansyl substituents forming aggregates and being complexed by the linked β-CD₃bz and β-CDen₃bz trimers in within poly(acrylate) s strands in dilute solutions and between poly(acrylate) s strands in hydrogels. The trends in β-CD₃bz and β-CDen₃bz complex stability constants fluorescence life times and viscosities of six systems are discussed.

The drive mechanisms are pressure depletion of the reservoir pressure, in the form of solution-gas drive, gas cap drive, natural water drive, or fluid and rock expansion, or gravity drainage. In this stage, only 10 - 30 % of the OOIP (oil originally in place) is produced (Castor et al., 1981). Secondary recovery is usually initiated when primary production is declining, adding additional energy to the reservoir in order to maintain pressure or provide a more efficient oil displacement. Gas injection and waterflooding are two secondary methods, the latter being the most common. The recovery factor after the secondary stage is usually 30 - 50 % of OOIP (Castor et al., 1981). The tertiary recovery stage, comprising miscible gas injection, chemical injection and thermal energy methods, typically takes over when secondary recovery becomes uneconomical. However, oil production does not always follow this chronological order. Therefore, the term ‘Enhanced Oil Recovery’ (EOR) is nowadays more widely used than ‘tertiary recovery’. Another term, IOR (Improved oil recovery) is also often seen, and in addition to EOR this term includes reservoir characterization, reservoir management and infill drilling (Green and Willhite, 1998). The EOR methods most commonly target the oil left in the waterflooded reservoir, which especially in carbonate reservoirs can be a substantial amount. There are five categories of EOR processes (Green and Willhite, 1998) : mobility-control (polymers, foams), chemical (surfactants, alkaline agents), miscible (hydrocarbon solvents, CO 2), thermal (steam, in-situ combustion) and other processes, such as microbial EOR, immiscible CO 2 etc. Seawater injection should perhaps be categorized under other processes, as it is a superb EOR fluid to chalk. This will be discussed later in chapter 3 [...] ...|$|R
30|$|The {{empirical}} {{literature on}} decentralization and conflict has grown since the 1990 <b>s.</b> A <b>strand</b> of this literature uses ethnic {{groups as the}} unit of analysis, mostly through the “Minorities At Risk” (MAR) and Ethno-Power Relations (EPR) databases. 29 Cohen (1997) finds that federalism is associated with less rebellion but more protest, perhaps indicative that with decentralization, conflicts shift from the center (where stakes are high) to the local level (where stakes are lower). Likewise, the estimations of Saideman et al. (2002) suggest that federalism reduces ethnic rebellion. These studies suffer, however, from endogeneity issue. As we have seen, decentralization {{is likely to be}} explained by conflict as much as the other way around. Results from simple pooled analyses should thus be taken with caution. Studies by Tranchant (2008, 2016), Christin and Hug (2012), and Cederman et al. (2015) attempt to address the endogeneity with quasi-experimental methods.|$|R

These proteins differ, primarily, in that the SHa form incorporates additional residues at the C-terminus and also includes {{a segment of the}} unstructured N-terminal region that is required for infectivity, The 1 -ns simulations have been analyzed by using a combination of dynamical cross-correlation maps, residue-residue contact plots, digital filtering, and residue-based root-mean-square deviations. The results show that the extra residues present in the SHa form at the C- and N-termini produce changes in the stability of key regions of the protein. The loop region between <b>strand</b> <b>S</b> 2 and helix B that contains part of the proposed discontinuous binding site for the chaperone, protein X, is found to be more stable in SHa than in the Mo protein; these results are consistent with the NMR data of James et al, (James et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1997; 94 : 10086 - 10091), In addition, a degree of flexibility within the region between and including <b>strand</b> <b>S</b> 1 and helix A is also shown in SHa, which is not present in the Mo form; the cross-correlation maps suggest that this is a consequence of the additional unstructured N-terminal region. Furthermore, the extra residues in the N-terminal region of SHa are found to form a beta-bridge with the beta-sheet, within which critical point mutations associated with prion diseases lie. The implications of these results for the conformational interconversion pathway of the prion protein are discussed...|$|R

MOB 1 is present in an autoinhibited form and is activated by MST 1 / 2 -mediated phosphorylation, although the precise mechanisms responsible for autoinhibition and activation are unknown {{due to lack of}} an autoinhibited MOB 1 structure. Here, we report on the crystal structure of full-length MOB 1 B in the autoinhibited form and a complex between the MOB 1 B core domain and the N-terminal regulation (NTR) domain of LATS 1. The structure of full-length MOB 1 B shows that the N-terminal extension forms a short β-strand, the SN strand, followed by a long conformationally flexible positively-charged linker and α-helix, the Switch helix, which blocks the LATS 1 binding surface of MOB 1 B. The Switch helix is stabilized by β-sheet formation of the SN <b>strand</b> with the <b>S</b> 2 <b>strand</b> of the MOB 1 core domain. Phosphorylation of Thr 12 and Thr 35 residues structurally accelerates dissociation of the Switch helix from the LATS 1 -binding surface by the "pull-the-string" mechanism, thereby enabling LATS 1 binding...|$|R

Part Two provides a comprehensive record of all HIV related storylines in Australian television drama from the first AIDS episode of The Flying Doctors in 1986 to the ongoing narrative of Pacific Drive, with its core HIV character, in 1996. Textual representations are examined alongside the agency of "cultural technicians" working within the television industry. The framework for this analysis is established in Part One of the thesis, which {{examines the}} discursive contexts for speaking about HIV and AIDS established through national health policy and the regulatory and industry framework for broadcasting in Australia. The thesis examines the dominant liberal democratic framework for representation of HIV I AIDS and adopts a Foucauldian understanding of the processes of governmentality to argue that {{during the period of}} the 1980 s and 1990 <b>s</b> a <b>strand</b> of social democratic discourse combined with practices of self management and the management of the Australian population. The actions of committed agents within both domains of popular culture and health education ensured that more challenging expressions of HIV found their way into public culture...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid- 1920 <b>s,</b> {{different}} <b>strands</b> {{of research}} used stars as "physics laboratories" for investigating {{the nature of}} matter under extreme densities and pressures, impossible to realize on Earth. To trace this process this paper is following {{the evolution of the}} concept of a dense core in stars, which was important both for an understanding of stellar evolution and as a testing ground for the fast-evolving field of nuclear physics. In spite of the divide between physicists and astrophysicists, some key actors working in the cross-fertilized soil of overlapping but different scientific cultures formulated models and tentative theories that gradually evolved into more realistic and structured astrophysical objects. These investigations culminated in the first contact with general relativity in 1939, when J. Robert Oppenheimer and his students George Volkoff and Hartland Snyder systematically applied the theory to the dense core of a collapsing neutron star. This pioneering application of Einstein's theory to an astrophysical compact object can be regarded as a milestone in the path eventually leading to the emergence of relativistic astrophysics in the early 1960 s.

Late-stage <b>S.</b> australis egg <b>strands</b> harbouring multiple embryos close to hatching were sampled from shallow (< 4 m) Tasmanian spawning grounds from early November 2000 to January 2001. Sepioteuthis australis embryos were found to develop asynchronously within individual egg strands with proximal embryos developing slower and suffering higher mortality than their distal siblings. The magnitude of asynchrony, however, differed throughout the season with greater within-strand differences observed when embryos were exposed to broader incubation temperatures. Unexpectedly, embryos developed more synchronously within biologically fouled strands and displayed a significantly lower incidence of mortality compared to those developing in unfouled strands. Embryonic mortality was initially low (4...|$|R

Two new species, S. leleji sp. n. and S. nikolskayae sp. n. from the Primorskii Territory of Russia, are described. A new synonymy is established: S. tumulorum ferripennis (Cockerell, 1929) = S. tumulorum higashi (Sakagami et Ebmer, 1979), syn. n. The taxonomic rank of S. gobiensis (Ebmer, 1982), originally described as a subspecies of S. pseudovestita (Blüthgen, 1925), is raised to specific status. The lectotypes of Halictus semitectus Morawitz, 1874; H. mongolicus Morawitz, 1880; H. confluens Morawitz, 1890 [= S. aeraria (Smith, 1873) ] and H. pjalmensis gaschunicus Blüthgen, 1935 are designated. Seven species, S. aeraria (Smith), S. argilos (Ebmer), S. gobiensis (Ebmer), S. indefinita (Blüthgen), S. petraea (Blüthgen), <b>S.</b> pjalmensis (<b>Strand)</b> and <b>S.</b> placidula (Blüthgen), are recorded from Mongolia for the first time. A total of 24 species of the genus Seladonia were found in the Eastern Palaearctic Region. A key to all species is given, except for the female of S. opacoviridis (Ebmer, 2005).

40|$|AbstractPlasminogen {{activator}} inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1), {{a member}} of the serpins, has a unique conformational flexibility. A typical characteristic is its intrinsic lability resulting in the conversion of the active conformation to a latent conformation. In the present study, we have evaluated the effect of substitution of positively charged residues located at the turn connecting <b>strand</b> <b>s</b> 4 C with <b>strand</b> <b>s</b> 3 C, either with negatively charged or with neutral residues, on the functional stability of PAI- 1. The following mutants were constructed, purified and characterized in comparison to wild-type (wt) PAI- 1 : PAI- 1 -R 186 E,R 187 E (Arg 186 →Glu and Arg 187 →Glu), PAI- 1 -H 190 E,K 191 E (His 190 →Glu and Lys 191 →Glu) and PAI- 1 -H 190 L,K 191 L (His 190 →Leu and Lys 191 →Leu). In contrast to wtPAI- 1 the mutants exhibited no inhibitory activity. Whereas latent wtPAI- 1 can be reactivated (up to a specific activity of 78 ± 19 %) by treatment with guanidinium chloride, a similar treatment applied to these mutants resulted in a significant but relatively small increase of specific activity (i. e. to 14 %). Evaluation of the functional stability (at 37 °C, pH 5. 5, 1 M NaCl) revealed a strongly decreased functional stability compared to wtPAI- 1 (i. e. 3 – 9 h for the mutants vs. > 24 h for wtPAI- 1). Further characterization by heat denaturation studies and plasmin susceptibility confirmed that removal or reversal of the positive charge on the turn connecting s 4 C with s 3 C results in PAI- 1 mutants with a highly accelerated conversion of active to latent forms. We can therefore conclude that the pronounced positive charge in the turn connecting s 4 C with s 3 C is of the highest importance for the functional stability of PAI- 1...|$|R
