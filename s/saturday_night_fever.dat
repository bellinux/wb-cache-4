5|$|By the mid-1970s, disco, a form {{of dance}} music, was {{becoming}} popular, evolving from underground dance clubs to mainstream America. Disco reached its zenith following the release of <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Fever</b> and the phenomenon surrounding the movie and the soundtrack by The Bee Gees. Disco's time was short, however, and by 1980 was soon replaced {{with a number of}} genres that evolved out of the punk rock scene, like new wave. Bruce Springsteen became a major star, first in the mid to late 1970s and then throughout the 1980s, with dense, inscrutable lyrics and anthemic songs that resonated with the middle and lower classes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, dance-oriented disco music was {{very popular in}} the United States, {{particularly}} after being featured in hit films such as <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Fever</b> (1977). Despite its popularity, disco sparked a backlash from rock music fans. This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July12 doubleheader, the Thursday preceding the All-Star break. Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP-FM, so attendees would pay 98 cents and bring a disco record; between games, Dahl would destroy the collected vinyl in an explosion.|$|E

Artists represented Donna Summer, Grace Jones, the Bee Gees, Sylvester James, A Taste of Honey, and many more. With help from a group of expert consultants (Marty Angelo, Nicky Siano, etc.) led by Vince Aletti, the first journalist to write nationally about disco in 1973, the exhibit helped to change peoples thinking about a musical genre that has been hugely important and hugely misunderstood.|$|R

According to his son Sal, [...] "We had been lookin' for a name for about three months, and we were sitting down watchin' tv and my mom saw an advertisement for <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Disco <b>Fever</b> and she says why don't you name it Disco Fever - we said, 'nah, get outta here.'

25|$|Some notable {{professional}} dance troupes of the 1970s included Pan's People and Hot Gossip. For many dancers, a key {{source of}} inspiration for 1970s disco dancing was the film <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Fever</b> (1977). This developed into the music and dance style of such films as Fame (1980), Disco Dancer (1982), Flashdance (1983), and The Last Days of Disco (1998). Interest in disco dancing also helped spawn dance competition TV shows such as Dance Fever (1979).|$|E

25|$|The anti-disco backlash, {{combined}} with other societal and radio industry factors, {{changed the face of}} pop radio in the years following Disco Demolition Night. Starting in the 1980s, country music began a slow rise in American main pop charts. Emblematic of country music's rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie Urban Cowboy. Somewhat ironically, the star of the film was John Travolta, who only three years before had starred in <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Fever,</b> a film that featured disco culture.|$|E
