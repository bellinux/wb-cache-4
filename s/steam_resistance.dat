40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{focuses on a}} new concept of high strength, high chromium (18 - 23 wt. %), fully ferritic steels on the technical basis of Crofer® 22 H for the application in high temperature energy conversion systems. Fully ferritic means, that these steels possess a ferritic matrix at any temperature below the melting point, i. e. no martensitic transformation occurs. During Crofer® 22 APU and Crofer® 22 H development, over 50 trial alloys with slight changes in chemical composition were designed. Both steels are used as interconnect materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and were developed by the Institute for Microstructure and Properties of Materials (IEK- 2) at Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH in cooperation with VDM Metals GmbH. Such steels possess potentially sufficient <b>steam</b> oxidation <b>resistance</b> up to 650 °C because of their high chromium content. In contrast the <b>steam</b> oxidation <b>resistance</b> of {{state of the art}} 9 - 12 %Cr advanced ferritic martensitic (AFM) steels is limited to temperatures of approximately 620 °C. To ensure sufficient <b>steam</b> oxidation <b>resistance</b> of AFM steels above 620 °C a higher chromium content is needed. However, this promotes Z-phase formation on the expense of the strengthening MX (M=V,Nb; X=C,N) particles, what causes a drop in long-term creep strength. Strengthening of the new fully ferritic steels is achieved by solid-solution hardening and in case of Crofer® 22 H by supplemental intermetallic (Fe,Cr,Si) 2 (Nb,W) Laves phase particles. The 22 H trial alloys possess superior creep behaviour in the temperature range from 600 °C to 650 °C and therefore may potentially provide a basis for tackling the future requirements of power plant operation, e. g. higher operational flexibility, higher conversion efficiency and thus lower CO 2 emission. In order to further optimisation of these fully ferritic alloys the investigation was performed on three various 22 H trial alloys. The investigations aimed on the identification and classification of Laves phase particles {{as well as on the}} influence of chemical composition on the presence of different Laves phases and particle size evolution in the temperature range from 600 °C to 650 °C after different annealing time utilising electron microscopy techniques. Concurrently the suitability of a commercially available thermodynamic modelling tool was checked and rated as doubtful for further in detail alloy development of such ferritic steels. Particle evolution results explain the different creep behaviour of the trial alloys and show promising thermodynamic stability of particle over the whole covered time range (e. g. approximately 40, 000 h at 600 °C and approximately 10, 000 h at 650 °C). Furthermore, investigation of microstructure evolution at 650 °C focused on sub-grain formation, the formation of particle free zones and associated dislocation density in these. Due to missing particle strengthening in these zones and consequently a drop in creep strength, the particle free zones are suspected to be a reason of premature material failure...|$|R

Non-chemical alternatives are highly desirable but difficult to implement {{to reproduce the}} benefits normally obtained by preplant fumigation of soil in strawberry production. Production of pathogen-free, high-quality planting materials using steam and other physical methods of soil disinfestation have not been perfected for large-scale runner plant production.

For a reduction of consumed primary resources higher efficiency steam cycles with increased operating parameters, pressure and temperature, are mandatory. Therefore advanced materials are needed.

These steels, originally designed for solid oxide fuel cell applications, provide favourable <b>steam</b> oxidation <b>resistance,</b> creep and thermomechanical fatigue behaviour in comparison to conventional ferritic-martensitic steels.

Generally the Laves phase particles demonstrated high thermodynamic stability during long-term annealing up to 40, 000 h at 600 °C.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{diffusion}} resistance, improve the {{energy efficiency and}} {{extend the life of}} solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC), the porosity and microstructure optimization of SOEC cathode support layer were studied. Polymethyl methacrylate(PMMA)was added into the cathode as an alternative of starch for pore formation. The experimental results show that the porosity of cathode reaches 45 % with conductivity of 6726 S/cm when the PMMA content is 10 wt%. The round micro―pores formed by PMMA are well distributed with an average diameter of about 10 &mu;m, which not only significantly reduce the gas diffusion resistance and increase the mechanical strength of cathode materials, but also improve largely the electrolysis efficiency, stability and hydrogen production performance of the SOEC. After the microstructure modification and optimization of cathode layer, the hydrogen production rate of SOEC using PMMA pore former can reach 175 mL/(cm 2 &middot;h), which is 1. 5 times of the hydrogen production rate of starch.

The use of oxidation resistant coatings on currently available materials, with high creep strength but inferior <b>steam</b> oxidation <b>resistance,</b> is being explored {{in order to accomplish}} this goal {{in the context of the}} European project “Coatings for Supercritical Steam Cycles ” (SUPERCOAT).

40|$|Abstract. The higher steam {{temperatures}} and pressures {{required to achieve}} increase in thermal efficiency of fossil fuel-fired power-generation plants necessi-tate the use of steels with improved creep rupture strength. The 9 % chromium steels developed {{during the last three}} decades are of great interest in such applications. In this report, the development of steels P 91, P 92 and E 911 is described. It is shown that the martensitic transformation in these three steels produces high dislocation density that confers significant transient hardening. However, the dislocation den-sity decreases during exposure at service temperatures due to recovery effects and for long-term creep strength the sub-grain structure produced under different con-ditions is most important. The changes in the microstructure mean that great care is needed in the extrapolation of experimental data to obtain design values. Only data from tests with rupture times above 3, 000 h provide reasonable extrapolated values. It is further shown that for the 9 % chromium steels, oxidation <b>resistance</b> in <b>steam</b> is not sufficiently high for their use as thin-walled components at temperatures of 600 C and above. The potential for the development of steels of higher chromium contents (above 11 %) to give an improvement in <b>steam</b> oxidation <b>resistance</b> whilst maintaining creep resistance to the 9 % chromium steels is discussed...|$|R

The main aim of the studies was the estimation of the potential suitability of these steels as construction materials in power plants with live steam temperatures around 600 °C. Some of the optimized trial alloys demonstrated remarkable characteristics at 600 °C. Results of constant load creep experiments and steam oxidation tests indicate the potential of these alloys as candidate materials for application in highly efficient steam power plants with steam temperatures above 620 °C.

The amount of strengthening (Fe,Si,Cr) 2 (W,Nb) – Laves phase particles is found to correlate well with the level of W- and Nb-alloying and in contrast to ferritic–martensitic steels, the formed Laves phase particles are highly stable at elevated temperature.

Diffusion of gas across liquid films between bubbles {{is thought}} to {{increase}} average bubble size in foam in porous media. It is cited as one reason why (Formula presented.) foams for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) are less resistant to flow than (Formula presented.) foams and why mixing (Formula presented.) with <b>steam</b> increases the <b>resistance</b> of <b>steam</b> foam. In porous media, diffusion can rapidly destroy bubbles smaller than a pore, but in EOR foam bubbles {{are thought to be}} larger than pores. This study examines the effect of inter-bubble gas diffusion on flowing bubbles in a periodically constricted tube and, in particular, its effect on the bubble-size distribution and capillary resistance to flow. The study is based on the solution for bubble shapes, curvatures, and pressure differences between bubbles from previous studies of bubble movement through periodically constricted tubes. It uses these results to estimate the diffusion rate between bubbles. Bubbles somewhat smaller than a pore can indeed disappear by diffusion as the bubbles move. For bubbles larger than a pore, as expected in EOR, diffusion does not affect bubble size. Instead, diffusion actually increases capillary resistance to flow, because lamellae spend more time in positions where lamella curvature resists forward movement. When fit to pressures and diffusion and convection rates representative of field application of foams, diffusion is not expected to alter the bubble-size distribution in a foam. Instead it modestly increases the resistance to flow. The reason for the apparent weakness of (Formula presented.) foam therefore evidently lies in factors other than (Formula presented.) ?s large diffusion rate through foam. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Various {{martensitic}} 9 - 12 Cr steels are utilized {{currently in}} fossil fuel powered energy plants for their good elevated temperature properties such as creep strength, <b>steam</b> side oxidation <b>resistance,</b> fire side corrosion resistance, and thermal fatigue resistance. Need for further improvements on {{the properties of}} 9 - 12 Cr steels for higher temperature (> 600 oC) use {{is driven by the}} environmental concerns (i. e., improve efficiency to reduce emissions and fossil fuel consumption). In this paper, we will discuss the results of the research done to explore new subsitutional solute solution and precipitate hardening mechanisms for improved strength of 9 - 12 Cr martensitic steels. Stability of the phases present in the steels will be evaluated for various temperature and time exposures. A comparison of microstructural properties of the experimental steels and commercial steels will also be presented. The influence of a Ce surface treatment on oxidation behavior of a commercial (P 91) and several experimental steels containing 9 to 12 weight percent Cr was examined at 650 ºC in flowing dry and moist air. The oxidation behavior of all the alloys without the Ce modification was significantly degraded by the presence of moisture in the air during testing. For instance the weight gain for P 91 was two orders of magnitude greater in moist air than in dry air. This was accompanied by a change in oxide scale from the formation of Cr-based scales in dry air to the formation of Fe-based scales in moist air. The Ce surface treatment was very effective in improving the oxidation resistance of the experimental steels in both moist and dry air. For instance, after exposure to moist air at 650 ºC for 2000 hours, an experimental alloy with the cerium surface modification had a weight gain three orders of magnitude lower than the alloy without the Ce modification and two orders of magnitude lower than P 91. The Ce surface treatment suppressed the formation of Fe-based scales and promoted the formation of more protective Cr-based scales. However, the Ce surface treatment was not effective in improving the resistance of P 91. The results are discussed in terms of synergistic effects of constituent alloying elements...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} the steam oxidation kinetics of boiler steels is required for creep rupture based remaining life assessment of high temperature components. This has significant industrial importance, {{particularly in the case}} of boiler tubing in thermal power stations. Although the oxidation behaviour of traditionally employed steels is quite well understood, there is significantly less known about the more advanced boiler alloys designed to meet the creep strength requirements of higher operating temperatures and pressures utilised in modern plants with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This research was carried out to improve {{understanding of the}} oxidation kinetics of these steels through direct comparison against traditional alloys using a novel approach designed to facilitate reliable laboratory based steam oxidation testing. Materials investigated represent both traditional and advanced variants from several of the major boiler alloy classes, including a 2. 25 % Cr ferritic steel (T 23), 9 % Cr martensitic steels (T 9, T 91, T 92), 18 - 25 % Cr austenitic stainless steels (347 H, 347 HFG, Super 304 H, HR 3 C) and an alumina-forming austenitic steel (AFA: Fe- 25 % Ni- 14 % Cr- 3. 5 % Al- 2. 5 % Nb). Alloys were subjected to long term high temperature oxidation at two specifically developed test facilities that represent considerably different approaches for studying steam oxidation. A simulated steam environment consisting of 50 % water vapour in argon carrier gas was generated in the first experimental setup, where oxidation exposures were performed at atmospheric pressure for up to 7, 510 h in the temperature range of 650 to 760 °C for all alloys. The second setup utilised pressurised steam from the hot reheat line at Loy Yang B Power Station (Victoria, Australia). Alloys were exposed to oxidation in plant steam at 4. 2 MPa for up to 12, 170 h at metal temperatures ranging from 540 °C for T 23 to 810 °C for AFA. Oxide scales were assessed using optical microscopy, non-destructive ultrasonic testing, Raman spectroscopy, SEM-EDS and mass-change measurements. Correlations describing oxide growth kinetics were determined for T 23, each of the 9 % Cr alloys and both Grade 347 stainless steel variants investigated in the study. In each case the growth rates well represented by parabolic kinetics. Distinct differences in <b>steam</b> oxidation <b>resistance</b> were observed between traditional and advanced alloys. This lends support to the argument that oxidation kinetics used for life assessment should be determined for individual alloys, rather than applied across an entire class of boiler steels. The oxide scale morphologies and growth rates observed for alloys in 50 % H₂O/Ar and plant steam were generally consistent. The exception to this was more ready breakdown of the protective Cr₂O₃ layer developed on austenitic steels and one of the 9 % Cr alloys (T 92) in plant steam, which was attributed to the higher steam pressure and moisture content. The thin and irregular oxide scales that developed on austenitic alloys could not be measured by ultrasonic thickness testing and were better suited to mass based assessment of oxide scale growth. The findings are promising for future studies involving the two steam oxidation laboratories, however further testing of additional alloy batches is required to validate the correlations for accurate life assessment...|$|R
