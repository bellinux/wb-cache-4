5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through <b>self-organizing</b> processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{claims have}} been criticized for {{ignoring}} that the second law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of <b>self-organizing</b> life.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} biologist Stuart Kauffman {{has suggested}} that self-organization may play roles alongside natural selection in three areas of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and morphogenesis. However, Kauffman {{does not take into}} account the essential role of energy (for example, using pyrophosphate) in driving biochemical reactions in cells, as proposed by Christian DeDuve and modelled mathematically by Richard Bagley and Walter Fontana. Their systems are self-catalyzing but not simply <b>self-organizing</b> as they are thermodynamically open systems relying on a continuous input of energy.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{concept of}} ecosystem {{can be traced}} back to 1864 in the published work of George Perkins Marsh ("Man and Nature"). Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted. Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form <b>self-organizing</b> patterns across different scales of time and space. Ecosystems are broadly categorized as terrestrial, freshwater, atmospheric, or marine. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are technoecosystems, which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.|$|E

50|$|In applied physics, {{the concept}} of {{controlling}} <b>self-organized</b> criticality refers to the control of processes by which a <b>self-organized</b> system dissipates energy. The objective of the control {{is to reduce the}} probability of occurrence of and size of energy dissipation bursts, often called avalanches, of <b>self-organized</b> systems. Dissipation of energy in a <b>self-organized</b> critical system into a lower energy state can be costly for society, since it depends on avalanches of all sizes usually following a kind of power law distribution and large avalanches can be damaging and disruptive.|$|R
40|$|We analyze a 15 -year {{time series}} of North American {{electric}} power system blackouts for evidence of <b>self-organized</b> criticality. Scaled window variance and R/S analysis of the time series shows moderate long time correlations. The probability distribution functions of various measures of blackout size have a power tail. Moreover, the same analysis applied to a time series from a sandpile model known to be <b>self-organized</b> critical gives results of the same form. Thus the blackout data is consistent with <b>self-organized</b> criticality. <b>Self-organized</b> criticality, if fully confirmed in power systems, would suggest new complex systems approaches to understanding and possibly controlling blackouts. 1...|$|R
40|$|A Tactical Data Link (TDL) {{system has}} been {{deployed}} in many military missions as a winning strategy. The performance of a TDL system is governed by the MAC protocol. The MAC protocol that is able to provide more flexibility and high quality of services is more desirable. However, most MAC protocols implemented in current TDL systems {{are based on a}} preprogramming TDMA protocol, in which a time slot schedule is fixed. This thesis presents the new <b>self-organized</b> TDMA protocol based on the existing <b>self-organized</b> slot assignment algorithms and the practical military scenarios as the alternative solution to the current preprogramming TDMA protocol. The <b>self-organized</b> TDMA protocol presented in this thesis is based on the Node Activation Polling Access (NAPA), Virtual Slot (VSLOT), and message based slot assignment algorithms. To evaluate the performance of the designed <b>self-organized</b> TDMA protocol over the preprogramming TDMA protocol, the simulation models for both protocols were implemented and simulated with NS- 2 under the specific study scenarios. The results show that the <b>self-organized</b> TDMA protocol offers more flexibility and higher performance than the preprogramming TDMA protocol. In addition, the aspects of stability and security for the <b>self-organized</b> TDMA protocol were discussed. The overall conclusion is that the <b>self-organized</b> TDMA protocol could be a viable alternative for a future TDL system...|$|R

40|$|A minimal {{model for}} <b>self-organized</b> {{critical}} percolation on directed graphs with activating and de-activating links is studied. Unlike classical <b>self-organized</b> criticality, {{the variables that}} determine criticality are separated from the dynamical variables {{of the system and}} evolve on a slower timescale, resulting in robust criticality. While activity of nodes percolates across the network, the network <b>self-organizes</b> through local adjustment of links according to the criterion that a link's adjacent nodes' average activities become similar. As a result, the network <b>self-organizes</b> to the percolation transition with activity avalanches propagating marginally across the graph. No fine-tuning of parameters is needed.

Network formation of WSNs are of two types, namely flat network and cluster-based network. Cluster-based network has various advantages as compare to flat network such as, efficient topology management, energy efficiency, minimized delay, better network communication, etc. Another {{important feature of}} cluster-based network is <b>self-organized</b> network. <b>Self-organized</b> enables new nodes joining to increase {{the coverage of the}} network and existing nodes leaving the network as node have limited energy.

25|$|Phenomena from {{mathematics}} {{and computer science}} such as cellular automata, random graphs, and some instances of evolutionary computation and artificial life exhibit features of self-organization. In swarm robotics, self-organization is used to produce emergent behavior.

In the field of multi-agent systems, understanding how to engineer systems that are capable of presenting self-organized behavior is an active research area. Optimization algorithms can be considered <b>self-organizing</b> because they aim to find the optimal solution to a problem. If the solution is considered as a state of the iterative system, the optimal solution is the selected, converged structure of the system. <b>Self-organizing</b> networks include small-world networks and scale-free networks. These emerge from bottom-up interactions, unlike top-down hierarchical networks within organizations, which are not <b>self-organizing.</b> Cloud computing systems have been argued to be inherently self-organising, but while they have some autonomy, they are not self-managing as they do not have the goal of reducing their own complexity.|$|E
