5000|$|<b>Sphaeropsis</b> <b>blight</b> is {{a disease}} that affects pines worldwide. This disease was {{previously}} known as Diplodia tip blight. <b>Sphaeropsis</b> <b>blight</b> {{is considered to be}} a [...] "disfiguring disease" [...] that attacks pine trees that are growing under stressful conditions. <b>Sphaeropsis</b> <b>blight</b> does not typically kill the tree, but will significantly disfigure the tree if not properly cared for or controlled. Most commonly, <b>Sphaeropsis</b> <b>blight</b> attacks Austrian (Pinus nigra), Scots (P. sylvestris), and red (P. resinosa) pine trees. This disease is a problem in the United States, nationwide, from coast to coast, and can be found worldwide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sphaeropsis</b> <b>blight</b> (Diplodia pinea) infects P.radiata in California {{and causes}} serious damage to {{plantations}} {{of the species}} in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, especially after hail damage to growing tips.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sphaeropsis</b> <b>blight</b> {{is caused}} by the fungus Diplodia pinea (=Sphaeropsis sapinea) and is known to infect the younger and healthy needles of newly formed candles. The trees that are most greatly {{affected}} by this disease are typically over 30 years of age, and rarely does it occur in the younger trees. The reason for this disease attacking older trees is due to the diseases growth from old, dying or dead seed cones. Younger trees can become infected if located near older, infected trees.|$|E
40|$|The {{symptoms}} and identification, disease cycle {{and control of}} <b>Sphaeropsis</b> tip <b>blight.</b> Browning and death of tips is quite common in older, well-established pine plantings. Such damage is often due to <b>Sphaeropsis</b> tip <b>blight,</b> a fungal disease caused by Sphaeropsis sapinea (syn. Diplodia pinea). Infection kills major branches and may even kill the entire tree under severe disease pressure. Sphaeropsis sapinea can infect young trees, but the disease becomes increasingly more common and destructive as trees approach 30 years of age. Tip blight commonly occurs in landscape, windbreak and park plantings; but is seldom found in natural pine stands. Several pine species can be infected. In this region the disease is most severe on Austrian pine (Pinus nigra) and ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), {{but it can also}} damage Scots pine (P. sylvestris) and mugo pine (P. mugo) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sphaeropsis</b> shoot <b>blight,</b> {{caused by}} Diplodia pinea and Diplodia scrobiculata, damage {{conifers}} throughout the world. In France, the first disease outbreaks were reported during the 1990 s. The {{factors associated with}} the pathogen presence in stands {{and the relationship between}} pathogen and disease distributions were analysed {{in order to understand the}} Sphaeropsis emergence. Eighty-two stands of Pinus nigra, Pinus sylvestris, Pinus pinaster and Pinus radiata were visited. Cones were collected on the ground to assess the pathogen frequency. Diplodia spp. were isolated and determined by a species-specific PCR test. The role of potential explaining factors of D. pinea prevalence on cones was analysed by logistic regression. D. pinea was the dominant species in visited stands. The main factors influencing the pathogen presence selected in the models were host species (the pathogen being less frequent on P. pinaster than on P. nigra and P. sylvestris cones), winter temperature and summer rain, which were both positively correlated with cone colonization. The climate became more favourable to D. pinea presence within the last 15 years compared with the previous 30 -year period. By contrast, future climatic changes over the next 40 years should have far less impact on the pathogen presence...|$|R

50|$|This disease causes what {{is known}} as “tip blight,” which resembles cankers that appear on the stems and {{branches}} of pine trees and can cause death, most typically in the lower branches of these trees. The cankers secrete a resin that can cause dead infected needles to stick {{to other parts of the}} tree after the dead needles have fallen. This may contribute to further infection of the tree. The most evident sign of a pine tree being infected with <b>Sphaeropsis</b> <b>blight</b> is if the tree(s) have “brown, stunted new shoots with short, brown needles”.|$|E
