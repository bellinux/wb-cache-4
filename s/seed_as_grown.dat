40|$|Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) of the Labiatae is an {{important}} culinary herb and essential oil source widely recognized worldwide, though much less in Sudan. The essential oil of 4 basil accessions were assessed for mosquito repellency were suggested. Basil seed accessions were collected <b>as</b> <b>seeds</b> and <b>grown</b> at the University of Gezira farm, Wad Medani, Sudan. All four essential oil conferred complete mosquito repellency (assayed by the human-bait technique) lasting for 1. 5 to 2. 5 h per one application of 0. 1 mL to a volunteer’s arm. Repellency generally decreased with bioassay time. The experimental results obtained from {{this study suggest that}} essential oil of basil are promising as repellents at 0. 1 % concentration against Anopheles mosquito and could be useful in the search for new natural repellent compounds...|$|R
30|$|Kyo-yasai is {{a general}} term for {{heirloom}} vegetables in Kyoto (Japan) that have been preserved <b>as</b> <b>seeds</b> and <b>grown</b> by using traditional cultivation methods, and some Kyo-yasai have many unique compounds that are not present in conventional vegetables. Katsura-uri (Japanese pickling melon; Cucumis melo var. conomon), one of the Kyo-yasai has the unique property of a strong muskmelon-like fragrance (Nakamura et al. 2008); some compounds responsible for the fragrance contribute to its effect on certain physiological functions (antimutagenic, differentiation induction in cancer cells, and antioxidative effects), which are not usually affected by mid-ripened Katsura-uri, or its conventional counterpart (Nakamura et al. 2010). Previously, we identified 6 typical fragrant ingredients of Katsura-uri including methylthioacetic acid ethyl ester (MTAE) (Nakamura et al. 2010), which is acid-hydrolyzed to methylthioacetic acid (MTA) in the stomach. However, an energy metabolism study of whole Katsura-uri fruit ingestion and MTAE/MTA {{has not yet been}} reported.|$|R
5|$|Members of the Cucurbitaceae include gourds, melons, pumpkins, and squashes.

40|$|Abstract: Irradiation of cultured {{mammalian}} cells one-by-one with a known {{number of}} ions, down to one-ion per single-cell, {{is a useful}} experimental approach to investigate the low-dose ionizing radiation exposure effects and {{to contribute to a}} more realistic human can-cer risk assessment. Mammalian cells (specifically, Chinese hamster V 79 cells) are <b>seeded</b> and <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> a monolayer on a mylar surface used as bottom of the special designed holder, having as cover an other mylar foil and allowing the cell culture to be in wet and sterile con-ditions. Manual recognition of unstained cells in bright-field is a time consuming procedure, therefore a parallel algorithm has been conceived and developed in order to speed-up this step of the irradiation protocol and increase the number of cells that can be irradiated during an accelerator run. Many technical problems have been faced to overcome the complexity of the images to be analyzed. The unstained cells have to be discriminated in an inhomogeneous background, among many disturbing bodies mainly due to the mylar surface roughness and culture medium. Additionally, cells can have various shapes depending on how they attach on the surface, which phase of the cell cycle they are in and on cell density, thus making the detection task more difficult...|$|R
