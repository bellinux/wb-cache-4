5|$|On 13 May, Wavell's {{infantry}} battalions {{began to}} concentrate at their start lines, {{followed by the}} tank regiments during {{the early hours of}} 15 May. At 06:00, the three columns began their advance, supported overhead by a <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> of Hawker Hurricane fighters.|$|E
5|$|A Company—now under Lieutenant Lawrence Clark {{following}} Chitts' wounding that afternoon—had {{only just}} succeeded in breaking contact from the Chinese, suffering a number killed and wounded during a confused withdrawal. Meanwhile, B Company {{had also been}} forced to fight its way down the hill. Both companies were now well clear of their former positions and {{would have had a}} hard time fighting their way back. Ultimately {{it was too late for}} the Australians to regain the feature in darkness, and the weight of the Chinese attack continued to mount. Only D Company on the southern right flank—which had been left unmolested—was able to regain its previous position on Hill 63. Meanwhile, the positions previously occupied by A and B Companies were occupied by the Chinese in superior numbers, and the remainder of 3 RAR concentrated at the railway crossing instead. At 22:00 Coad arranged to shell and mortar the relinquished ridge, while a <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> from the Middlesex was posted on the south-western side of the Maenjung-dong pass in anticipation of a renewed Chinese attack. However, following heavy fighting the pressure on the Australians unexpectedly ceased after midnight, and parties of Chinese were observed beginning to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Late on {{the evening}} of 17/18 February the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army {{launched}} an assault on FSB Andersen. The first attack was preceded by a heavy rocket and mortar barrage {{in the early hours of}} the morning, followed by two waves of infantry each of company size. The attack focused on the south-west of the perimeter manned by 3 RAR's echelon and mortar platoon, as well as an American medium artillery battery. The perimeter wire was subsequently breached, but the attack was repulsed by mortar counter-battery fire, Claymore mines and the heavy weight of machine-gun fire from armoured personnel carriers and the American gunners. The communist barrage had had a devastating effect, falling among the American and New Zealand gun positions, the mortar lines and the battalion echelon, as well as scoring a direct hit on an Australian engineer <b>standing</b> <b>patrol.</b> A second attack shortly after, this time from the north, was repelled by small-arms fire from the forward Australian pits. Total Viet Cong casualties were unknown, although four bodies were found on the wire at dawn, while numerous bloodstains and bandages were found during a later sweep of the perimeter and a suspected mortar base-plate location. Seven Australians and one American were killed, while 22 Australians and three Americans were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Realising {{that they}} had only faced a series of probes the {{previous}} night, rather than a major attack, and as these actions {{may have been in}} preparation for a heavier attack, a vigorous defence was subsequently prepared by the Australians with the reserve companies moved into blocking positions to strengthen the forward defences. The defenders endured steady shelling and harassing fire, while after dark The Hook was probed again, this time by a group of about 20 Chinese. The force was subsequently engaged by an Australian <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> from D Company at 21:00 and forced to withdraw, leaving behind one dead at a cost of one Australian killed and one wounded. At 21:20 the Chinese fire became more intense, and a heavy blow was launched by the Chinese against the Marines on Hill 119 shortly after. Beginning at 21:30, elements of the 1st and 7th Marines were attacked by two Chinese companies. A heavy concentration by the entire US I Corps artillery was fired in response, and the Chinese were forced to withdraw. At 23:00 the Chinese shelling intensified to thirty-rounds per minute, and was followed fifteen minutes later by another determined charge by the Chinese infantry against the US Marines on the left flank on Hill 111 and Boulder City during a furious attack. The Australian positions were not directly attacked during the night, although C Company engaged the Chinese in no man's land sporadically at long range in support of the Americans. As on the previous night, 3 RAR was not attacked. In total more than 4,200 mortar and artillery rounds were fired by the Chinese at 2 RAR during the night, and three Australians were killed and nine wounded.|$|E

50|$|No. 11 (Naval) Squadron {{was formed}} in March 1917 as a {{squadron}} of the Royal Naval Air Service. It was primarily an operational training squadron, flying single-seat fighter aircraft, mainly Sopwith Pups and Triplanes, and a few Camels. It also flew <b>standing</b> <b>patrols</b> over the British naval ships stationed in the North Sea {{off the coast of}} the Netherlands. It was disbanded in August 1917.|$|R
2500|$|Given this {{lopsided}} {{balance of}} power, fighter operations {{prior to the}} introduction of radar were generally in the form of <b>standing</b> <b>patrols</b> or [...] "sweeps", with the fighters being sent up to fly along a pre-arranged path or area in the hopes of encountering the enemy. During World War I interception missions, the vast majority of patrols returned home without ever having seen the enemy. The same was true for all forces during the Battle of France, where 30% interception rates were considered typical, and 50% excellent.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese did not invade India in 1942 as {{had been}} feared. V Force was able to {{consolidate}} itself in the wide area between the Allied and Japanese main forces. Bases and outposts were set up, <b>standing</b> <b>patrols</b> instituted and intelligence gathered and collated. By the end of 1943, the force had been reorganised into two main zones: Assam Zone, including Imphal and all the frontier north of it, and Arakan Zone to the south. Detachments in Tripura were disbanded as they were deep inside India and unlikely to be threatened. An American organisation later took over the northernmost areas around Ledo.|$|R
25|$|At {{first light}} on 15 September, a <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> of two Spitfires of No. 7 SAAF Squadron was {{maintained}} over Kos to give cover to the transport aircraft and ships bringing stores and reinforcements. Among {{these were the}} first troops of the RAF Regiment who flew from the British Mandate of Palestine with nine Hispano-Suiza HS.404 guns for anti-aircraft defence, followed two days later by a second detachment, which brought up to strength {{one of the first}} of the Regiment's Squadrons to be transported to the battlefield by air with all its weapons.|$|E
500|$|By 02:45 three Viet Cong {{soldiers}} {{had moved to}} within [...] of Brunalli's <b>standing</b> <b>patrol,</b> taking up firing positions. The Australians killed one and wounded another who was dragged away by the third, before they withdrew to another location nearby. Meanwhile, the two American tanks forward of the US 1st Brigade's headquarters were overrun and their crews killed. Having suffered heavy losses, by 04:00 some of the Viet Cong began to retreat from the battlefield, and many were now filtering past 1 RAR. As groups of Viet Cong began to move past their position the <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> was now in an untenable position, clashing briefly with one group of 15 Viet Cong. McFarlane finally ordered the patrol to withdraw, {{so that he could}} engage with artillery and mortars. Moving to achieve a clean break, the patrol engaged another group of 10 Viet Cong with a volley of small arms fire, before withdrawing [...] towards the company position in the darkness. Expecting to be followed up the Australians set up a snap ambush, killing another Viet Cong soldier before successfully completing the move back to their perimeter.|$|E
500|$|The {{speed of}} the advance forced Patton's units to rely heavily on air {{reconnaissance}} and tactical air support. The Third Army had by far more military intelligence (G-2) officers at headquarters specifically designated to coordinate air strikes than any other army. Its attached close air support group was XIX Tactical Air Command, commanded by Brigadier General Otto P. Weyland. Developed originally by General Elwood Quesada of IX Tactical Air Command for the First Army in Operation Cobra, the technique of [...] "armored column cover", in which close air support was directed by an air traffic controller {{in one of the}} attacking tanks, was used extensively by the Third Army. Each column was protected by a <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> of three to four P-47 and P-51 fighter-bombers as a combat air patrol (CAP).|$|E
25|$|With {{only two}} {{divisions}} in the Desert Column at this time, the Anzac and Imperial Mounted Divisions took turns to hold the front line. On 20 May while the Imperial Mounted Division was in reserve near Abasan el Kebir, the Anzac Mounted Division was responsible for patrolling the region {{from the direction of}} Sausage Ridge to Goz el Basal and then to the west of Goz Mabruk. The Anzac Mounted Division provided night <b>standing</b> <b>patrols</b> at important parts of the line, while one brigade held Nos. 1 to 6 defences at El Sha'uth defences, as well as the El Ghabi to El Gamli entrenchments.|$|R
2500|$|In 1927, the British Air Ministry, {{faced with}} the need to deal with {{increased}} bomber performance, issued Specification F.20/27 for a single-seat interceptor. Unlike previous fighter Specifications, the resulting aircraft were intended to be short-range (not intended to mount <b>standing</b> <b>patrols),</b> fast climbing high altitude aircraft, carrying a minimum of equipment. [...] To meet this requirement, de Havilland developed as a private venture the DH.77, designed by W.G. Carter, of Gloster Aircraft Company, in close collaboration with engine designer Frank Halford. De Havilland chose to concentrate on civilian aircraft in 1930 and the DH.77 (along with the incomplete DH.72 bomber) were turned over to Gloster.|$|R
2500|$|First {{attempts}} {{to organize and}} use Italian aircraft to fight the Austro-Hungarian aerial invaders were dismal. Italian pilots were equipped with Nieuport 10s and deployed in a [...] "scramble" [...] mode instead of <b>standing</b> <b>patrols.</b> They soon found that their French-made two-seaters could not take off and climb quickly enough to bring an invader to combat, even when burdened by only a pilot. The lack of a net of ground observers and aircraft spotters to give early warning only compounded the difficulties. By the end of 1915, Italian Nieuports had succeeded in attacking Austro-Hungarian airplanes on seven occasions. The Austro-Hungarians reported two losses for the year.|$|R
500|$|At 22:00, {{soldiers}} from B Company, 1 RAR, occupying the western {{sector of the}} Australian perimeter noticed lights [...] to their front. McFarlane subsequently requested artillery and mortar fire to target the location, but the request was declined by Preece. Meanwhile, a small Australian <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> that had deployed forward of the company main defensive position {{under the command of}} Private Walter Brunalli, observed the lights moving closer, east of the US 1st Brigade's headquarters. Two tanks had been positioned forward of the American positions, with a squad of infantry on the eastern approaches, and by midnight they had also reported sounds of movement and intermittent flashes of light through the trees. In the early morning of 24 February, just after midnight, sporadic firing was heard throughout the area. The forward American listening posts had detected small groups of Viet Cong moving outside the perimeter, killing two and forcing the remainder to withdraw into the darkness after one of the sentries opened fire. Glotzbach waited for the Viet Cong main effort, however, and withheld the bulk of the firepower at his disposal.|$|E
500|$|With their defences alerted, the Americans and Australians [...] "stood to" [...] for {{the next}} 45 minutes. The battle began at 01:45 with a heavy barrage of Viet Cong mortar and small arms fire. The Americans responded with small arms, machine-guns, tank fire, mortars and {{artillery}} {{and over the next}} hour the firing grew in intensity until, at 03:00, the Viet Cong switched their fires to the north-west side of the American perimeter, augmenting their barrage with recoilless rifles. Glotzbach expected a full-scale ground assault, but the Viet Cong had been held back by the weight of American firepower, with heavy artillery including [...] and [...] howitzers firing in support from Phuoc Vinh, in addition to the defenders' own artillery, which was now firing over open sights after lowering their tubes to fire directly at the Viet Cong positions. In total eight field batteries were available. Elsewhere, the Australian <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> had remained in position despite the proximity of the Viet Cong, and with the Americans pouring massive fire into the area they were soon caught in the crossfire. Brunalli was subsequently wounded in the arm.|$|E
500|$|As {{they had}} done previously, the communists {{continued}} to attempt to infiltrate the 1 RAR perimeter during the night, and a minor clash with an Australian <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> occurred at dawn. Over the next two days, operations to exploit the tunnels continued, with the US 173rd Brigade and the Australians involved {{in a number of}} contacts, as well as suffering from sporadic sniper and mortar fire. Significant quantities of documents, equipment and rice were captured however, and large numbers of civilians detained for questioning. On 12 January, 1 RAR continued its patrolling program and one patrol subsequently located 15 tons of rice and destroyed it after killing six Viet Cong during a 20-minute battle. The task was complicated by the presence {{of a large number of}} civilians, and many were found hiding in shelters and tunnels. They had to be coaxed out of hiding by the Australians and transported to a refugee camp which had been established nearby. Another patrol from 11 Platoon later uncovered a tunnel system just [...] from their position, and found it to be occupied by a large Viet Cong force after a dog and its handler were sent into the tunnel to investigate. Eight Viet Cong were subsequently killed after the tunnel was destroyed by Australian engineers.|$|E
50|$|No. 23 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps {{was formed}} at Fort Grange, Gosport on 1 September 1915, {{commanded}} by Louis Strange and {{equipped with a}} mixture of types. A detachment of Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2C's were deployed to Sutton's Farm to act as night fighters to oppose raids by German Zeppelins, but no successful interceptions resulted. The squadron moved to France on 16 March 1916 flying FE2b two-seat pusher fighters. The squadron used the FE2b on close-escort duties and to fly <b>standing</b> <b>patrols</b> to engage hostile aircraft wherever they could be found, helping to establish air superiority in the build-up to the Battle of the Somme.|$|R

500|$|As {{daylight}} broke, the Chinese {{now found}} themselves highly exposed {{in the open}} {{ground in front of}} the Australians. A and B Company supported by artillery, mortars and tanks poured heavy fire onto the hapless Chinese, forcing them to withdraw leaving hundreds of casualties behind on the slopes. With the Australians remaining in possession of their original defensive locations the immediate situation had stabilised, although they were now effectively cut-off [...] behind the front. Ammunition, food and medical supplies were now extremely low throughout the forward area, and with casualty evacuation increasingly difficult, the battalion was at risk of being overrun unless it could be concentrated, resupplied and supported. As such in order to avoid each company being isolated and overwhelmed in a series of Chinese attacks, at 07:15 B Company was ordered to leave its position and join the other companies on the high ground to form a defendable battalion position. The Australians subsequently withdrew as instructed, taking several dozen Chinese prisoners with them that had been captured earlier by a <b>standing</b> <b>patrol.</b> The New Zealand gunners covered their movement across the open valley, laying a smoke screen to conceal the withdrawal, while the American tanks also provided support. As they moved across the valley the Australians exchanged a number of shots with a small groups of Chinese who were still hiding in dead ground and in the riverbed, as well as numerous dead from the fighting the previous night. 173 Chinese dead were counted on the B Company perimeter by the Australians before they departed.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 July a 50-strong Chinese force probed 2 RAR's forward {{outposts}} after dark, attacking C Company on Hill 121 and surrounding a bunker on the left flank, while the US Marines had a similar contact on the left flank. A forward Australian <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> from D Company subsequently clashed heavily with the Chinese probe, losing five wounded before directing tank and artillery fire which dispersed their attackers. These attacks had been preceded by heavy artillery and mortar fire, with the Chinese subjecting C and D Companies, 2 RAR and the 2 RAR Mortar Platoon to a heavy bombardment. Waves of Chinese attacked the Australians at 20:50, penetrating between C Company on Hill 121 and the nearest US Marines on Hill 111, before being turned back amidst the driving rain. A further attack followed another barrage at 23:25, but was again repelled and faltered before reaching the wire during fierce fighting with grenades and small-arms, with the assault failing {{largely due to the}} weight of defensive artillery fire. More than 2,000 Chinese mortar and artillery rounds fell on the Australian positions during the night. Two Australians were killed and 14 wounded during the night attack which was later estimated to have been made by a Chinese regiment of up to 4,000 men. The defenders were soaking wet and exhausted, but had held their positions. Yet despite the weight of the Chinese attack against the Australians their main objective had been Hill 119, another strong point in the American sector [...] to the south-west of Hill 111, known as Boulder City, held by the US 7th Marine Regiment.|$|E
2500|$|In July, convoys of [...] {{began to}} sail {{along the south}} coast between the Thames and the Bristol Channel. The convoys were slow and in easy range of enemy {{aircraft}} flying from France but the south coast ports needed [...] of coal a week and land transport capacity was insufficient. On 25 July, Convoy CW 8 of 21 ships had a standing fighter patrol overhead but so many Luftwaffe fighters were airborne that British ground controllers were unable to tell which raids contained strike aircraft, as opposed to fighter aircraft, and the <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> was never numerous enough to prevent four dive-bomber attacks, which sank five ships and damaged two destroyer escorts and four coasters. On 26 July, E-boats sank three ships and only eleven passed Dungeness.

25|$|On 9 July Kesselring {{committed}} the Zerstörergeschwader (Destroyer Wings) to battle en masse, {{for the first}} time against the RAF. The first engagement took place when 257 Squadron damaged a Kampfgeschwader 3 (KG 3) Do 17, which crash-landed near Antwerp, Belgium with one crew member dead. A cold front generated thick cloud and caused the Luftwaffe to curtail operations. Park ordered section strength (3–4 aircraft) <b>standing</b> <b>patrols</b> over six small coastal convoys and moved 609 Squadron to RAF Warmwell, to cover Portland. A number of single-aircraft raids penetrated the defences and Do17s bombed docks at Cardiff, damaging the steamers San Felipe (5,919 GRT) and Foxglove. A local airfield was bombed and two pilots were killed on the ground.|$|R
2500|$|The {{operations}} at Gommecourt were observed by 8 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) {{and when the}} weather improved on 30 June, the squadron obtained a good set of photographs of the German defences and sent prints to VII Corps headquarters before dawn. From [...] a <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> of one B.E.2c contact patrol aircraft over each division was maintained, then reduced to one aircraft only. The British infantry carried red flares to indicate their positions to the contact aeroplanes but none was ignited; the crews had to descend low {{enough to see the}} colour of troops' uniforms. The aircraft had to fly through air disturbed by the barrage and were tossed around, then riddled with bullets when the infantry turned out to be German, three aircraft being made non-operational by small-arms fire but none shot down. An aircraft flying back from the front line to drop a message flew into the 5 Section balloon cable near St. Amand, spun down it and crashed but the crew escaped injury.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1943 the Allied {{leadership}} {{believed that}} Japanese forces could attack the Torres Strait area, and No. 84 Squadron's {{role was to}} provide air defence of the region. It initially operated alongside the Bristol Beaufort-equipped No. 7 Squadron, which conducted anti-submarine patrols to protect Allied shipping. From late April the squadron came {{under the command of}} No. 72 Wing, which was headquartered in the strategically located town of Merauke on the south coast of Dutch New Guinea. From early May, No. 84 Squadron regularly conducted patrols of the Merauke area, and it maintained a <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> over the town from the 8th of the month. However, due to the short range of the Boomerangs they could only remain over Merauke for an hour at a time. No. 84 Squadron first saw combat on 16 May, when a patrol of two Boomerangs intercepted three Mitsubishi G4M [...] "Betty" [...] bombers near Merauke. The guns of one of the fighters jammed, and the other did not score any hits during the brief engagement, which ended when the bombers escaped into clouds.|$|E
2500|$|The main Axis attack did {{not occur}} as Rommel was still waiting for Group Olbrich from Msus and towards evening he flew off in a Storch to find them. Rommel found the group about [...] short of Mechili and decided to attack without it. A mixed unit of the Ariete Division, had reached Mechili during the day, having been {{attacked}} by Bristol Blenheim bombers of 45 Squadron, 55 Squadron and the last Hawker Hurricane fighters of 3 Squadron RAAF. In the evening, Rommel sent another surrender demand, offering [...] "the full honours of war" [...] but the reply was the same. When the emissary returned to his lines, about [...] began to bombard the garrison. Machine-gun fire was received {{for more than an}} hour with no effect and just before dusk, armoured cars forced a <b>standing</b> <b>patrol</b> of the 2nd Lancers in the south-western sector near the landing ground to withdraw; later the attackers retired and the position was reoccupied. Group Streich, most of the 5th Light Division advanced force, which had been ordered to Tobruk, arrived as dark fell and Rommel ordered the attack to begin at dawn next day.|$|E

Nine 32 Squadron Hurricanes and 11 from 615 Squadron engaged more than 40 Bf109s in a dogfight near Dover and one Hurricane was badly damaged. As the battle receded, Ju87s from 11.(Stuka)/LG 1 and III./StG 1 attacked the convoy. Distress calls from the ships were answered by 54 Squadron which sent nine Spitfires but Bf109 fighters (unit unknown) shot down two Spitfires for no loss.|$|R
