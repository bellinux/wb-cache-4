And the samples of function x(t) are commonly denoted by [...] (alternatively [...] "xn" [...] in older signal processing literature), for all integer values of n. A mathematically ideal way to interpolate the sequence {{involves the use of}} sinc functions. Each sample in the sequence is replaced by a sinc function, centered on the time axis at the original location of the sample, nT, with the amplitude of the sinc function scaled to the <b>sample</b> <b>value,</b> x. Subsequently, the sinc functions are summed into a continuous function. A mathematically equivalent method is to convolve one sinc function with a series of Dirac delta pulses, weighted by the sample values. Neither method is numerically practical. Instead, some type of approximation of the sinc functions, finite in length, is used. The imperfections attributable to the approximation are known as interpolation error.|$|E

50|$|The Metropolis-Hastings {{algorithm}} {{works by}} generating {{a sequence of}} sample values {{in such a way}} that, as more and more sample values are produced, the distribution of values more closely approximates the desired distribution, P(x).

Specifically, at each iteration, the algorithm picks a candidate for the next <b>sample</b> <b>value</b> based on the current <b>sample</b> <b>value.</b> Then, with some probability, the candidate is either accepted (in which case the candidate value is used in the next iteration) or rejected (in which case the candidate value is discarded, and current value is reused in the next iteration)−the probability of acceptance is determined by comparing the values of the function f(x) of the current and candidate sample values with respect to the desired distribution P(x).|$|E

The proposed Tricolor MC method allows cell vertices with <b>sample</b> <b>values</b> which equal the threshold to lie on the surface.
