5|$|Two unusual bag-like <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> {{present on}} each pitcher, one {{on either side}} of the central wing. Similar but {{semi-circular}} <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> found on the margin of the lid. These structures exhibited strong yellow-green intrinsic fluorescence when exposed to visible light with a wavelength of 500 nm (blue-green).|$|E
5|$|As all {{buildings}} and <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> destroyed {{due to the}} high winds and flooding, the entire relief effort took place under temporary, tent-based structures. The cafe was housed in a large geodesic dome, usually found at the Burning Man festival.|$|E
5|$|Much {{more than}} a {{renovation}} project, Domitian's building program {{was intended to be}} the crowning achievement of an Empire-wide cultural renaissance. Around fifty <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> erected, restored or completed, achievements second only to those of Augustus. Among the most important new <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> an odeon, a stadium, and an expansive palace on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace, which was designed by Domitian's master architect Rabirius.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the concept}} of the image <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> made clearer, and the {{research}} on the poetic-image <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> executed. The research technique and the procedure were also established through investigating. In addition, the validity of the idea concerning the characteristic of poetic-image <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> verified. As a result, eight types of the poetic image <b>structure</b> <b>were</b> found. The type of the poetic image <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> named 'poetry pattern of the image'. The hypothesis concerning a poetic image <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> verified though not quite satisfactorily...|$|R
50|$|If a {{structure}} has a discrete moduli (if {{it has no}} deformations, or if a deformation of a <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> isomorphic to the original <b>structure),</b> the <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> said to be rigid, and its study (if it is a geometric or topological <b>structure)</b> <b>is</b> topology. If it has non-trivial deformations, the <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> said to be flexible, and its study is geometry.|$|R

5|$|A {{radioisotope}} building, a steam plant, {{and other}} <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> added in April 1946 {{to support the}} laboratory's peacetime educational and research missions. All work was completed by December, adding another $1,009,000 {{to the cost of}} construction at X-10, and bringing the total cost to $13,041,000. Operational costs added another $22,250,000.|$|E
5|$|After the earthquake, Constantine Ypsilantis {{ordered the}} {{immediate}} restoration of Bucharest.

5|$|All four <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> {{built in}} a {{simplified}} Greek Cross floor plan to signify a religious purpose. Closest to Lake Danebod stands the Folk High School, a three-story wooden building with eight gables. Next to the Folk High School stands the multipurpose Stone Hall, and across the street stands the Gym Hall with its iconic twin towers. Danebod Lutheran Church {{is located on the}} town's main street, appropriately named Tyler Street, and is {{in the shape of a}} Greek cross on the outside.|$|E
5|$|Anticholinergics {{and surgery}} (lesioning of the corticospinal pathway {{or some of}} the basal ganglia <b>structures)</b> <b>were</b> the only {{treatments}} until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid 20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim Louis Benabid and colleagues at Grenoble, France, emerged as a possible treatment.|$|E
5|$|As the {{political}} power in Norway was consolidated and {{had to contend with}} external threats, larger <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> built in accordance with military technology at the time. Fortresses, bridges, and ultimately churches and manors were built with stone and masonry. These structures followed the European styles of their time.|$|E
50|$|The first {{monosaccharide}} attached in {{the synthesis}} of O-linked glycans is N-acetyl-galactosamine. After this, several different pathways are possible. A Core 1 <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> generated {{by the addition of}} galactose. A Core 2 <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> generated by the addition of N-acetyl-glucosamine to the N-acetyl-galactosamine of the Core 1 structure. Core 3 <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> generated by the addition of a single N-acetyl-glucosamine to the original N-acetyl-galactosamine. Core 4 <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> generated by the addition of a second N-acetyl-glucosamine to the Core 3 structure. Other core <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> possible, though less common.|$|R

5|$|Damage {{was light}} in Maryland. Some sand dunes and wooden <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> damaged, and above-normal tides occurred. In New Jersey, high winds caused power outages and knocked down trees and power lines. Minor coastal {{flooding}} of streets and houses was reported. Otherwise, {{damage in the}} state was minor.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}} {{and construction of}} the park, many <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> added, redesigned or modified. These changes often resulted in budget increases. For example, the bandshell's proposed budget was $10.8million. When the elaborate, cantilevered Gehry design required extra pilings to be driven into the bedrock to support the added weight, {{the cost of the}} bandshell eventually spiraled to $60.3million. The cost of the park, as itemized in the following table, amounted to almost $500million.|$|E
5|$|During the Bronze Age fewer {{large stone}} <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> built {{although}} the great ceremonial circles continued in use as metalworking was slowly introduced to Britain from Europe over a lengthy period. There are relatively few Orcadian sites dating from this era {{although there is}} the impressive Plumcake Mound near the Ring of Brodgar and various islands sites such as Tofts Ness on Sanday {{and the remains of}} two houses on Holm of Faray.|$|E

30|$|Chromatin <b>is</b> the {{fundamental}} <b>structure</b> of the genome, which is constituted by nucleosome particles. The chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> important to gene transcription. In active transcription sites, the chromatin will be loosened, {{so that the}} DNA can be exposed to transcriptional factors for transcription initiation. This open chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> termed “euchromatin”. In contrary, some of the chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> heavily condensed and the transcriptions of those genes within those regions are inhibited. The condensed chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> termed “heterochromatin”. Thus, chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> of critical importance in regulating gene expression in a temporal and spatial dependent manner (Wang et al., 2007 a).|$|R
5|$|During the Late Preclassic <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> built using {{volcanic}} stone {{held together}} with clay, as in the Middle Preclassic. However, they evolved to include stepped structures with indented corners and stairways dressed with rounded pebbles. At the same time, old Olmec-style sculptures were moved from their original positions and {{placed in front of}} the new-style buildings, sometimes reusing sculpture fragments in the stone facing.|$|E
5|$|Eskimo was {{the first}} feature film to be shot in a Native American {{language}} (Inupiat), and the first feature film shot in Alaska. The film also incidentally documented many of the hunting and cultural practices of Native Alaskans. The production for the film was based at Teller, Alaska, where housing, storage facilities, a film laboratory, and other <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> built to house the cast, crew, and equipment.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{the resort}} {{benefited from a}} £14million (2011:£) {{investment}} and improvement scheme, following which the resort was known as Funcoast World. Around this time, many of the <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> subject to change with the demolition of many chalets and some central buildings including the Windsor dining hall and Empire theatre. The 1980s saw {{the removal of the}} miniature railway and chairlift system, but also saw {{the construction of a new}} indoor swimming pool named the Funsplash and an outdoor fun pool.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A biochip for {{building}} up self assembled ferromagnetic <b>structures</b> <b>was</b> designed. The magnetic <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> self assembling onto magnetic seeding points which {{are arranged in}} a periodic hexagonal structure {{on the bottom of}} the chip. The individual shapes of the ferromagnetic <b>structures</b> can <b>be</b> controlled by an applied external magnetic field. This periodic arrangement of adaptable ferromagnetic <b>structures</b> <b>is</b> well suited for selective and dynamic cell trapping. A biochip designed for lab experiments and a simulation model for optimizing the magnetic <b>structures</b> <b>is</b> presented...|$|R

Bermuda {{was also}} {{impacted}} by the hurricane, with strong winds blowing roofs off buildings, including {{a portion of the}} roof on the House of Assembly of Bermuda, and the sides of some <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> knocked down. Electrical light wires and telephone lines were down across the island. Kindley Air Force Base and the U.S. Naval Base received minimal damage. Damages exceeded $1million.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's {{calls to}} forgive {{and forget the}} past was a {{keystone}} of his government. He preserved various elements of the old colonial order in his administration, particularly on issues of law and order. The police and military <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> left largely intact. White Kenyans were left in senior positions within the judiciary, civil service, and parliament, with the white Kenyans Bruce Mackenzie and Humphrey Slade being among Kenyatta's top officials.|$|E

30|$|Sandwich {{structures}} generally exhibit {{an excellent}} bending stiffness at low weights. The bending stiffness to weight ratio of a panel {{can be increased}} by several magnitudes if a monolithic <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> substituted by a sandwich structure. On the other hand, sandwich structures suffer several drawbacks, which limit their use in certain applications. For example in a passenger aircraft, sandwich <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> only used in secondary <b>structures.</b> Secondary <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> characterized {{by the fact that}} their failure does not lead to a catastrophic damage to the aircraft. Typical secondary <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> for example flaps, radomes, and nacelle <b>structures.</b> An exception <b>is</b> the fuselage of the Premier Beechcraft I, where sandwich <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> applied.|$|R
