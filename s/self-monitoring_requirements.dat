40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{relationship}} between the quantity and quality of self-monitoring and per cent fat loss in overweight and obese adolescents participating in a weight-loss intervention. Participants were 55 (33 F) overweight and obese adolescents taking part in a 20 -week cognitive–behavioural intervention aimed at improving eating and physical activity behaviours. Food and physical activity self-monitoring from the first 9 weeks of the intervention was coded using 24 components assessing the quantity (20) and quality (4) of selfmonitoring. Those who completed treatment (n = 42) were split into groups: Losers (n = 30) and Gainers (n = 12) of per cent body fat as measured by DXA. Group analyses showed that Losers and Gainers could be differentiated by both quantitative and qualitative measures of self-monitoring. The strongest associations were with the classifications of food and drink items into food groups. The number of days monitored and the average number of items recorded did not differentiate the groups. Quantity and quality measures of self-monitoring completed early in treatment could also differentiate those who completed treatment and those who did not complete treatment (n = 13), and the strongest associations were with the amounts of food and drink items recorded, an association not found with treatment outcome. The results indicate that both quantity and quality of self-monitoring may be important predictors of both treatment completion and outcome. Based on these findings a framework of <b>self-monitoring</b> <b>requirements</b> is offered to reduce homework burden while maximising treatment efficacy...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the benefits of}} combining different offline and online data assimilation methodologies to improve personalized blood glucose prediction with type 2 diabetes self-monitoring data. We collect self-monitoring data (nutritional reports and pre- and post-prandial glucose measurements) from 4 individuals with diabetes and 2 individuals without diabetes. We write online to refer to methods that update state and parameters sequentially as nutrition and glucose data are received, and offline to refer to methods that estimate parameters over a fixed data set, distributed over a time window containing multiple nutrition and glucose measurements. We fit a model of ultradian glucose dynamics to {{the first half of}} each data set using offline (MCMC and nonlinear optimization) and online (unscented Kalman filter and an unfiltered model [...] -a dynamical model driven by nutrition data that does not update states) data assimilation methods. Model parameters estimated over {{the first half of the}} data are used within online forecasting methods to issue forecasts over the second half of each data set. Offline data assimilation methods provided consistent advantages in predictive performance and practical usability in 4 of 6 patient data sets compared to online data assimilation methods alone; yet 2 of 6 patients were best predicted with a strictly online approach. Interestingly, parameter estimates generated offline led to worse predictions when fed to a stochastic filter than when used in a simple, unfiltered model that incorporates new nutritional information, but does not update model states based on glucose measurements. The relative improvements seen from the unfiltered model, when carefully trained offline, exposes challenges in model sensitivity and filtering applications, but also opens possibilities for improved glucose forecasting and relaxed patient <b>self-monitoring</b> <b>requirements...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Institute of Water Resources {{has sought}} {{financial}} assistance [...] {{for some time}} {{in an attempt to}} initiate research relative to the impact [...] of mining on water quality. Attempts were made as early as 1971 by Dr. [...] Timothy Tilsworth and later by Dr. Donald Cook and Dr. Sage Murphy. [...] These investigators anticipated growth in placer gold mining and the [...] development of natural resources in Alaska during a period of national [...] and environmental concern. The subsequent energy "crisis," the major [...] increase in the price of gold on the world market, and dwindling nonrenewable [...] resource supplies have resulted in large-scale mineral [...] exploration in Alaska. This exploration, coupled with development of [...] the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, has attracted considerable capital for [...] potential investment and development in Alaska. Expected industrial [...] growth has already started and major new projects are "just around the [...] corner. " [...] Yet, as of 1976, no major research effort has occurred to determine [...] the extent of or potential for water quality impacts from mining operations [...] in Alaska. Recently a series of interdisciplinary research projects [...] have been completed in Canada; however, the application of Canadian data [...] to Alaskan problems is uncertain. Although, state and federal government [...] agencies have been advised and are aware of this potential problem [...] and lack of baseline data they have not sought out new information or [...] rational solutions. Even now, with deadlines of Public Law 92 - 500 at [...] hand, some regulatory agencies give the impression of attempting to [...] ignore the situation. Interim limitations are proposed and permits [...] are issued with no discernible rationale or basis. Data have not been [...] obtained relative to the Alaskan mining operations and thus are not [...] available for use in seeking solutions compatible with mining and environmental protection. Numbers appear to have been arbitrarily [...] assigned to permits and water quality standards. When permits are [...] issued, <b>self-monitoring</b> <b>requirements</b> are negligible or nonexistent. [...] Nor have regulatory agencies demonstrated the ability or inclination [...] to monitor mining operations or enforce permits and water quality [...] standards. [...] It was hoped that the project would bring together miners, environmentalists, and regulators in a cooperative effort to identify the [...] problems and seek solutions. The investigators recognized the political [...] sensitivity of the subject matter but proceeded optimistically. [...] Relatively good cooperation, though not total, occurred early in the [...] project. In April 1976, a symposium was held to exchange ideas and [...] determine the state-of-the-art. Although the symposium had good [...] attendance and an exchange of information occurred, the symposium [...] itself was somewhat of a disappointment. With few exceptions, the [...] participants aligned on {{one side or the other}} in preconceived fixed [...] positions. Some even chose not to attend and were therefore able to [...] avoid the issues. Little hard data was presented. [...] Optimistically, some of the miners, environmentalists, and [...] regulators are prepared to resolve their differences. This report, [...] hopefully, will be of benefit to them. It is our experience that [...] miners and environmentalists share a love of the land that is uniquely [...] Alaska. We feel that technology is available for application to this [...] problem for those who care about doing the job right in the "last [...] frontier. " Whether or not it will be effectively applied to protect [...] Alaska's water resources is a question which remains unanswered...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of a 32 -week personalized Polar weight management program (PWMP) compared with standard care (SC) on body weight, body composition, waist circumference, and cardiorespiratory fitness in overweight or obese adults. Research Methods and Procedures: Overweight or obese (29 ± 2 kg/m 2) men and women (n = 74) 38 ± 5 years of age were randomly assigned into either PWMP (men = 20, women = 21) or SC (men = 15, women = 18). Both groups managed their own diet and exercise program after receiving the same standardized nutrition and physical activity advice. PWMP also received a weight management system with literature to enable the design of a personalized diet and exercise weight loss program. Body weight and body composition, waist circumference, and cardiorespiratory fitness were measured at weeks 0, 16, and 32. Results: Eighty percent of participants completed the 32 -week intervention, with a greater proportion of the dropouts being women (PWMP: 2 men vs. 7 women; SC: 2 men vs. 4 women). At 32 weeks, PWMP completers had significantly (p < 0. 001) greater losses in body weight [6. 2 ± 3. 4 vs. 2. 6 ± 3. 6 (standard deviation) kg], fat mass (5. 9 ± 3. 4 vs. 2. 2 ± 3. 6 kg), and waist circumference (4. 4 ± 4. 5 vs. 1. 0 ± 3. 6 cm). Weight loss and fat loss were explained by the exercise energy expenditure completed and not by weekly exercise duration. Discussion: More effective weight loss was achieved after treatment with the PWMP compared with SC. The results suggest that the PWMP enables effective weight loss through tools that support <b>self-monitoring</b> without the <b>requirement</b> of more costly approaches to program supervision...|$|R
