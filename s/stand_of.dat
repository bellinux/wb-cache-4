5|$|The South <b>Stand</b> <b>of</b> the rugby ground {{formed a}} {{complete}} unit with the North <b>Stand</b> <b>of</b> the National Stadium. Now the same {{structure of the}} South <b>Stand</b> <b>of</b> the rugby ground is also physically attached to the North <b>Stand</b> <b>of</b> the Millennium Stadium. This section is known colloquially as Glanmor's Gap, after Glanmor Griffiths, former chair and President of the WRU. This came about because the WRU were unable to secure enough funding to include the North Stand in the Millennium Stadium, and the National Lottery Commission would not provide any additional funds {{to be used for}} the construction of a new ground for Cardiff RFC. The Millennium Stadium was therefore built with the old reinforced concrete structure of the National Stadium (North Stand) and the new steel Millennium Stadium structure built around it.|$|E

5|$|Any future {{renovation}} to {{the stadium}} will involve replacing the old North <b>Stand</b> <b>of</b> the former National Stadium with a new one similar to the three existing stands of the new Millennium Stadium. This will make the stadium bowl-shaped and will increase its capacity to around 80,000. It will resolve the existing problems of deteriorating concrete quality on the old structure in the north stand.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 4,000 Royalist {{soldiers}} had been killed, {{many in the}} last <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> the whitecoats, and 1,500 captured, including Lucas and Tillier. The Royalists lost all their guns, with many hundreds of weapons and several standards also falling {{into the hands of}} the allied forces.|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} <b>of</b> <b>stands</b> is a {{very important}} aspect for establishing the principles of forest planning and of its durable managing. In order to ensure the necessary stability for the stands, in different stages of development, it is necessary to set a corresponding thickness <b>of</b> these <b>stands</b> that determines the best spacing. For quantifying the thickness, density, spacing and implicitly the stability <b>of</b> <b>stands</b> it is necessary to determine some synthetic indicators afferent to the studied stands and respectively to compare them to the reference indicators. Key words: <b>stands,</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>stands,</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>stands,</b> density <b>of</b> <b>stands,</b> spacing the <b>stands,</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>stands,</b> synthetic indicators, silvic-technical analysis...|$|R

5|$|A second road in California {{was built}} by Horace Gasquet, who {{acquired}} a <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> trees at the present site of Gasquet, California— where the North and Middle Forks of the Smith River converge— in 1857. In 1881, he began to build a corduroy road from what had become Gasquet Flats to the plank road at the state line near Oregon Mountain, shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps. Tolls were charged starting in 1882, and in 1887 the road was completed. Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along the Smith River {{to the mouth of}} the South Fork, including a suspension bridge across that waterway, and Del Norte County extended it along the Smith River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City Plank Road just east of Crescent City.|$|E
5000|$|The Gearhart Mountain Wilderness {{is part of}} a continuous, dry, {{pine forest}} {{covering}} the transition zone. Differences in species are primarily dependent on water availability. The lower slopes tend to be dominated by white fir with a mix of ponderosa pine, whitebark pine, and lodgepole pines, while the higher elevations are covered with pure <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> lodgepole and whitebark pine. [...] The meadows scattered throughout the wilderness are characterized by lush, green ground cover, <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> aspen, and a multitude of wildflowers. The Gearhart Mountain Wilderness does have some <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> old growth forest. However, in recent years, a large area of the forest on Gearhart Mountain and surrounding areas have succumbed to the mountain pine beetle, and large dead <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> ponderosa and lodgepole pine can be seen.|$|R

The meiofauna densities for different macrophyte types showed a significant variation between N. peltata and C. demersum stands {{with a total of}} 15 meiofauna taxa on the macrophytes. Insect larvae, mostly Chironomidae, and Oligochaeta juveniles were the most abundant taxa recorded during the entire investigated period in all <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> macrophytes, except in P. amphibium...|$|R
5|$|After several {{seasons of}} {{struggling}} for runs, Kippax returned {{to form in}} 193334. Against Queensland at New Year, he hit 125 and shared a <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 363 in only 135minutes with Bradman. Altogether, he made four centuries and averaged almost 72 to earn selection for the 1934 tour of England. Passed over for the vice-captaincy of the team in favour of Bradman, Kippax had the confidence of knowing that the Australian Board of Control had reached {{an agreement with the}} MCC that the Australians would not have to face Bodyline during the tour.|$|E
5|$|After the First Test, Ring {{returned}} to action as Australia completed an innings victory over Northamptonshire. He took 1/31 in the hosts' first innings of 119, before making an unbeaten 16 in partnering McCool in an unbroken <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 39 as Australia declared at 8/352. In the second innings, he took {{four of the}} last five wickets and ended with 4/31 as Northamptonshire collapsed from 5/142 to be all out for 169. This was followed by a drawn match against Yorkshire, in which Ring scored three runs and was not asked to bowl in the first innings. Yorkshire were bowled out for 206 from 90.1overs; Bradman called on Ernie Toshack and Johnston to bowl 81.1overs and did not entrust the other bowlers with substantial work. Ring then took 1/22 in the second innings as the match petered out into a draw.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia were {{struggling}} when Healy {{came to the}} crease with the score at 7/63 after 14.2 overs. Three wickets had fallen {{in the space of}} 16 balls, during which only three runs had been added, and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory. Healy then struck three fours, making 15 from 9 balls before being dismissed by Nicki Shaw, ending a <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 23 from 13 balls with Sthalekar. However, Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E

5|$|Barnes took {{advantage}} of his reprieve to combine with Morris in an opening <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes {{in an attempt to}} disrupt their progress. Wright came on and bowled a no ball, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. Morris stopped shuffling, while Barnes decided to adopt a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into the leg side. He drove Laker into the pavilion and Australia were 73/0 at lunch with Morris on 40 and Barnes 25, an overall lead of 208.|$|E
5|$|Barnes was rested as Bradman’s men {{defeated}} Warwickshire by nine wickets. He {{returned as}} the tourists faced and drew with Lancashire {{for the second}} time on tour. Barnes top-scored in the first innings with 67, putting on an opening <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 123 with Morris as Australia made 321. He continued his productivity with 90 in the second innings, adding 161 for the second-wicket with Bradman. The home side managed to hang on for a draw, seven wickets down in their second innings. Barnes was then rested for the non-first-class match against Durham, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. Australia made 282 and had the hosts at 5/73 in reply when rain washed out the match after the first day.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{was given}} another life at 108 when he {{advanced}} two metres down the pitch to Jim Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 having added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed for 182, having partnered Bradman in a <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 301 in 217 minutes. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. He struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling with eight runs still needed. Harvey {{came in and}} got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. This sealed an Australian victory by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 with 29 fours in only 255 minutes.|$|E
