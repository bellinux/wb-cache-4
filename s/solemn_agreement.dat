The Siege of Lisbon lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when, after four months, the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city.

When he had spent {{nearly a quarter of}} an hour in this manner, he raised his eyes, and said very gravely: [...] "My lord, in these most melancholy documents, it is yet a comfort to see nothing which can renew the divisions in the King's councils, which were settled by the last <b>solemn</b> <b>agreement</b> between your lordship and myself. My unhappy nephew was by that agreement to be set aside, until time should send him a graver judgment. He is now removed by Fate, and our purpose in that matter is anticipated and rendered unnecessary." ...|$|E

50|$|Fearing {{what the}} {{citizens}} {{would do to}} rid themselves of his force if he chose to remain within Rayy's walls and defend against a siege, Tahir led his army along the road towards Baghdad until the intruders were in sight. After an uneasy night, Ali's force made an initial charge, which {{was followed by a}} brief truce and unsuccessful negotiations, in which Tahir's envoy reminded Ali of the <b>solemn</b> <b>agreements</b> al-Amin had torn up. Then the main battle began, with a lightning attack force of 700 Khwarazmians, backed by archers, sent to smash the centre of Ali's army, and if possible destroy its command structure. This approach was very effective, swiftly resulting in the death of Ali. How he died is not perfectly clear; one version has it that he was a victim of an arrow-storm sent by Tahir's Bukharan archers ahead of the attack. Another version claims that he was felled from his horse by a soldier named Dawud Siyah ("Black David")- again possibly with an arrow- but not killed. Tahir ibn al-Taji (not related to the commander Tahir) then approached him and asked if he was really Ali ibn Isa, following which he killed him in single combat. In either case, when he was killed his army scattered in all directions.|$|R

It was arranged that Nicholas should call upon her, at her lodgings, at eleven next morning, and soon after they parted: he to return home to his authorship: Miss Snevellicci to dress for the after-piece: and the disinterested manager and his wife to discuss the probable gains of the forthcoming bespeak, of which they were to have two-thirds of the profits by <b>solemn</b> treaty of <b>agreement.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Putting {{the verses}} {{regarding}} polygyny into the broader Qur'anic context {{by examining the}} nature of marriage in Islam helps understanding them. The Quran [...] refers to marriage as a mithaq, i.e. a <b>solemn</b> covenant or <b>agreement</b> between husband and wife, and enjoins that it be put down in writing (4:21). Marriage {{is more than just}} a [...] "solemn covenant" [...] however, with Surah 30 verse 21 stating [...] "And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs for those who reflect." [...] Love and mercy are very much a part of marriage as described in the Qur'an. Although the Qur'an may prescribe different roles for males (husbands often seen as the provider), the equality between husband and wife is promoted when it is dictated in Surah 2 verse 187 that [...] "They (your wives) are as a garment to you, and you are as a garment to them." [...] It is thus clear that there is more to polygyny in the scriptural basis of the Qur'an then simply the citation of Verse 4:3.|$|R
60|$|But, {{notwithstanding}} this <b>solemn</b> <b>agreement,</b> {{and all the}} oaths {{by which}} it was confirmed, no sooner was Philip safe in France than he commenced operations against Richard's dominions. He began to make arrangements for an invasion of some of Richard's territories in Normandy, under pretext of taking possession again of Alice's dower, which it was agreed, by the treaty made at Messina, should be restored to him. But it had also been agreed at that treaty that {{the time for the}} restoration of the dowry should be after Richard's return, so that the plans of invasion which Philip was now forming involved clearly a very gross breach of faith, committed without any pretense or justification whatever. This instance, and multitudes of others like it {{to be found in the}} histories of those times, show how little there was that was genuine and reliable in the lofty sense of honor often so highly lauded as one of the characteristics of chivalry.|$|E

With my band here I could defy your attempts to capture me for years, but I do not care to lead {{the life of a}} mountain robber. Hannibal treats his captives mercifully, and the treatment which was bestowed upon me and my companions, who were not even taken in fair fight, but were blown by a tempest into your port, was a disgrace to Rome. My demand is this, that we shall be treated with the respect due to brave men, that we be allowed to march without guard or escort down to the port, where we will go straight on board a vessel there prepared for us. We will then lay down our arms and surrender as prisoners of war, under the <b>solemn</b> <b>agreement</b> taken and signed by you and the governor of the island, and approved and ratified by the senate of Rome, that, in the first place, the garments and armour of which we were deprived when captured, shall be restored to us, and that we shall then be conveyed in the ship to Rome, there to remain as prisoners of war until exchanged, being sent nowhere else, and suffering no pains or penalties whatever for what has taken place on this island." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{signing of}} the {{constitution}} {{could be seen as}} indicating the formation of a united community, in ways similar to a federation of nomadic clans and tribes, as the signatories were bound together by <b>solemn</b> <b>agreement.</b> The community, however, now also had a religious basis. Extending this analogy, Watt argues that the functioning of the community resembled that of a tribe, such {{that it would not be}} incorrect to call the community a kind of [...] "super-tribe". The {{signing of the}} constitution itself displayed a degree of diplomacy by Muhammad, as although he envisioned a society eventually based upon a religious outlook, practical consideration was needed to be inclusive instead of exclusive of the varying social elements.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Hodson lost his nerve upon beholding the crowds. Others have suggested that the presence of the crowds suggested to him that this was a suitable arena in which to send out a clear message to the Indians and demonstrate the power and ruthlessness of the British; after all, the princes were implicated in the rebellion and the cold blooded murder of the European civilians. Yet others have suggested that Hodson had made the agreement with the old Emperor in bad faith and that he had never intended to keep his word. Since Begum Zeenat Mahal was in touch with Hodson and had been trying even before the rebellion, to ensure that the crown would go to her son instead of the step-sons, it has also been suggested that Hodson executed the princes on the basis of an understanding with the Begum. In any of these cases (which are not exhaustive), the idea that breaching a <b>solemn</b> <b>agreement</b> (guaranteeing only life), which he had made minutes before, upon his word of honour as a British army officer, to an old man much respected by these crowds, would serve to blacken the reputation of the British rather than enhance it, was clearly beyond his ken.|$|E
50|$|On the {{television}} interviews programme Porta a Porta, {{during the last}} days of the electoral campaign, Berlusconi created a powerful impression on the public by undertaking to sign a Contratto con gli Italiani (Contract with the Italians), an idea apparently conceived by his advisor Luigi Crespi and inspired by Newt Gingrich's Contract with America introduced six weeks before the 1994 US Congressional election, which was widely considered to be a creative masterstroke in his 2001 campaign bid for prime ministership. In this <b>solemn</b> <b>agreement,</b> Berlusconi claimed his commitment on improving several aspects of the Italian economy and life. Firstly, he undertook to simplify the complex tax system by introducing just two tax rates (33% for those earning over 100,000 euros, and 23% for anyone earning less than that figure: anyone earning less than 11,000 euros a year would not be taxed); secondly, he promised to halve the unemployment rate; thirdly, he undertook to finance and develop a massive new public works programme. Fourthly, he promised to raise the minimum monthly pension rate to 516 euros; and fifthly, he would suppress the crime wave by introducing police officers to patrol all local zones and areas in Italy's major cities. Berlusconi undertook to refrain from putting himself up for re-election in 2006 if he failed to honour at least four of these five promises.|$|E
40|$|Forty {{years after}} my first {{opportunity}} to teach American Indian children, Mathew’s compelling words still resonate as I work with young people who seek to become teachers. His comments on that January day in 1969 jolted me into realizing the incongruity {{of his life and}} culture with the lifestyles depicted in the textbooks we used. Like most texts of that era, Mathew’s reading book portrayed father leaving for his office each morning wearing a gray suit. Mother, dressed in her starched apron, remained at home to cook, clean, sew, and watch over children playing in the green yard surrounding the white, colonial-style family home on Cherry street. The teacher’s manual for our text prompted me to ask children if they could remem-ber a time when they needed assistance from a “community helper. ” My question met with silence. Then Mathew spoke. He told us in his own matter-of-fact way of the day his older brother was knifed in their yard. As he described the sirens screaming toward his home, the other fourth-graders nodded in <b>solemn</b> <b>agreement</b> because his words revealed a vivid memory that many shared. Mathew and his classmates struggled with the clash between what they knew to b...|$|E
