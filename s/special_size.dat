In {{order to}} make a further {{understanding}} of flow pattern and back mixing in the flotation process, the study about particle residence time distribution of collection zone in a packed column has been designed. The pulse tracer method was applied and the particle tracers were the mineral gangue in <b>special</b> <b>size</b> class. The residence time distribution curves of our experiment data shows that there are particle back mixings which were caused by fluid flow and geometry factors in the column. The tank-in-series model has a better fitting to the particle residence time distribution in the column according the comparison research between the tank-in-series model and axial dispersion model. The operation parameters have different effects on the particle residence time distribution according to our experimental study...|$|E

The steady-state and time-resolved luminescence of Se-doped CdS NCs has been studied. The long lifetime component of CdSeS NCs in PMMA is shorter than that dispersed in toluene. We have described a model for impurity doping in semiconductor CdSeS NCs based in terms ideas of low temperature and composition dependence of luminescence. The model shows that Se dopant, which are used to control emission wavelength, play another important role by affecting energy structure. By choosing a suitable composition of NCs with <b>special</b> <b>size,</b> our model can offer a route to rational optimization of doped NCs and tailor the PL spectrum of the composite devices in the visible spectral range.|$|E

40|$|Nanocomposites provide {{enhanced}} properties at low filler fractions and often-unique properties conferred by the <b>special</b> <b>size,</b> surface, or {{shape of}} the nanoparticles. The most useful assessment of these properties comes from the thermal analysis. The main thermal analysis techniques used are differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TGA), thermomechanical analysis (TMA), and dynamic mechanical spectroscopy (DMS). The application {{of each of these}} techniques to nanocomposites is reviewed with attention given to the approaches suitable for probing the structure of the nanocomposites. Nanofillers can nucleate crystallization, adsorb chain segments retarding motions, and limit phase separations these can be revealed by DSC. Increased thermal stability has been detected by TGA. TMA and DMS are used in many programmed and geometrical modes to provide a measure of many mechanical properties as well as interpretation of structural features and equilibration. Nanocomposites are of increasing interest contemporaneously with new thermal analysis techniques that can provide increased information about nanocomposites and, indeed, all polymeric materials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The limit {{behavior}} of the solutions of Signorini’s type-like problems in periodically perfo-rated domains with period ε is studied. The main feature of this limit behaviour is {{the existence of a}} critical size of the perforations that separates different emerging phenomena as ε → 0. In the critical case, it is shown that Signorini’s problem converges to a problem associated to a new operator which is the sum of a standard homogenized operator and an extra zero order term (“strange term”) coming from the geometry; its appearance is due to the <b>special</b> <b>size</b> of the holes. The limit problem captures the two sources of oscillations involved in this kind of free boundary-value problems, namely, those arising from the size of the holes and those due to the periodic inhomogeneity of the medium. The main ingredient of the method used in the proof is an explicit construction of suitable test functions which provide a good understanding of the interactions between the above mentioned sources of oscillations...|$|E
