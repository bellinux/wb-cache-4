Like its affiliate objects, the left-hand figure is portrayed with layers of white and grey paint.|$|E

Mhalsa is piercing a demon's chest with a spear, while a dog is biting his thigh and the horse is hitting his head. The other demon is grabbing the reins of the horse and attacking Khandoba with a club as Khandoba is dismounting the horse and attacking the demon with his sword. In other representations, Khandoba is seen <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> horse with the heads of demons trod under the horse's hooves or their heads under Khandoba's knees.|$|E
5|$|Many of the stelae that K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I erected became prototypes for monuments {{raised by}} his successors. The first stela raised, Stela 25, is the king's inaugural monument, and it {{established}} the precedent for the niche style. This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small hollow and seated on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I is <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> jaguar cushion, reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. The cushion itself is raised on a reed effigy. The king is covered by a canopy that is symbolic of the sky; crowning the sky is a great celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E
5|$|Only then, in April 879, did Ibn Tulun {{return to}} Egypt. Abbas fled west with his supporters, and from Barqa {{tried to take}} over Ifriqiya. Defeated by the Ifriqiyans (probably {{in the winter of}} 880–881), he retreated back east to Alexandria, where he was finally confronted and {{captured}} by Ibn Tulun's forces. After being publicly paraded <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mule, Ibn Tulun ordered his son to execute or mutilate his companions, who had driven him to rebel. Ibn Tulun reportedly secretly hoped that his son would refuse to do such a dishonourable act, but he agreed. Weeping, Ibn Tulun had Abbas whipped and imprisoned. He then named his second son, Khumarawayh, as his heir-apparent.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Tenniel drew {{a famous}} {{illustration}} of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, c. 1865. The caterpillar is <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image {{can be read}} as showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. Eric Carle's children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and the days of the week.|$|E
5|$|Six outer panels (or shutters) are hinged; when folded {{they show}} an {{exterior}} view of saints and the donors. The inner panels contain {{scenes from the}} Last Judgement arranged across two registers. The large central panel that spans both registers shows Christ <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rainbow in judgment, with his feet resting on a golden globe. Below him the Archangel Michael holds scales as he weighs souls. The panel on Christ's far right shows the gates of Heaven, that to his far left the entrance to Hell. The panels of the lower register form a continuous landscape, with figures depicted moving from the central panel to their final destinations after receiving judgement.|$|E
5|$|The Markendeya Purana praises Varahi as a granter of boons and the regent of the Northern direction, in a hymn {{where the}} Matrikas are {{declared}} as the protectors of the directions. In another instance {{in the same}} Purana, she is described as riding a buffalo. The Devi Bhagavata Purana says Varahi, with the other Matrikas, is created by the Supreme Mother. The Mother promises the gods that the Matrikas will fight demons when needed. In the Raktabija episode, Varahi is described as having a boar form, fighting demons with her tusks while <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> preta (corpse).|$|E

5|$|Two iconographical {{forms of}} Varaha are popular. Yajna Varaha - {{denoting}} Yajna (sacrifice) - is <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lion-throne and flanked by his consorts Bhudevi and Lakshmi. As Pralaya Varaha - indicative of lifting the earth {{from the stage}} of the pralaya (the dissolution of the universe), he is depicted only with Bhudevi. Varaha may be depicted with Lakshmi alone too. In such sculptures, he may be depicted identical to Vishnu in terms of iconography with Vishnu's attributes; the boar head identifying the icon as Varaha. Lakshmi may be seated on his thigh in such portrayals.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia's fate after Emesa is uncertain, since ancient historians left {{conflicting}} accounts. Zosimus {{wrote that}} she died before crossing the Bosporus {{on her way}} to Rome; according to this account, the queen became ill or starved herself to death. The generally unreliable chronicler, John Malalas, wrote that Aurelian humiliated Zenobia by parading her through the eastern cities on a dromedary; in Antioch, the emperor had her chained and <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> dais in the hippodrome for three days before the city's populace. Malalas concluded his account by writing that Zenobia appeared in Aurelian's triumph and was then beheaded.|$|E
5|$|An icon of Saints Marina and Jovan Vladimir, dated 1711, {{is part of}} the iconostasis of the Monastery of StNaum near Ohrid {{in western}} Macedonia. The icon's {{position}} on the iconostasis indicates that Vladimir was an important figure of local veneration. He was often depicted in the company of Saints Clement and Naum in Macedonian churches. A number of 18th-century painters from central and southern Albania painted the saint in churches of the region, especially in the area of Moscopole. A portable icon of the saint was created in 1739 at the Ardenica Monastery in southwestern Albania. It depicts him <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> throne, surrounded by twelve panels showing scenes of his life and miracles. Saint Jovan Vladimir is represented on frescos in three monasteries of Mount Athos: Hilandar, Zograf, and Philotheou; and three Bulgarian monasteries: Rila, Troyan, and Lozen.|$|E

5|$|In sculpture, Revanta {{is often}} {{depicted}} with the Guhyakas, whose chief he is, in scenes of hunting. Apart from the attributes described in texts like the sword, bow; he sometimes also carries {{a cup of}} wine in his hand. Revanta is often depicted wearing long boots reaching up to the calves, unlike other Hindu divinities – except Surya – who are depicted barefoot. Revanta is depicted <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> horse and accompanied by a hunting dog. Revanta's attendants are depicted with various hunting weapons like lances and swords. Some of them are shown blowing a conch or beaming drums or holding an umbrella {{over the head of}} their lord, the umbrella being the symbol of royalty. Also, some of them are depicted as flying or holding wine or water jars. Sometimes, an attendant carries a dead boar in his shoulder or the dog chasing a boar.|$|E
5|$|The Buddhist {{version of}} the Bhasmasura tale {{continues}} with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who is <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> swing, to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him back to get permission to bring a pregnant woman home. When he returns, a child is born and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a pregnant woman with a child home. This happens six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka ("eldest brother") remains intact. Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.|$|E
5|$|The mural {{painted on}} {{the dome of the}} apse (pictured right) depicts Jesus <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cloud, red and golden rays {{radiating}} out of his golden halo. God the Father, pictured as a white-bearded man with triangular halo, looks down from a cloud above Jesus. A dove with a white halo, representing the Holy Spirit, flies just below God, wings outstretched, completing the Trinity. Above Jesus fly four cherubim. Seated to Jesus' right is Mary, his mother, and to his left Saint John the Baptist. On the same cloud as Jesus, three angels flank on each side. Slightly below Jesus, Mary, and John, two more flanking angels are depicted kneeling on their own clouds and swinging censers. Under the entire scene, a banner displays Gloria in Excelsis Deo.|$|E
