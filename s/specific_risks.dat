2500|$|Specific risk is {{the risk}} {{associated}} with individual assets - within a portfolio these risks can be reduced through diversification (<b>specific</b> <b>risks</b> [...] "cancel out"). Specific risk is also called diversifiable, unique, unsystematic, or idiosyncratic risk. Systematic risk (a.k.a. portfolio risk or market risk) refers to the risk common to all securities—except for selling short as noted below, systematic risk cannot be diversified away (within one market). Within the market portfolio, asset specific risk will be diversified away to the extent possible. Systematic risk is therefore equated with the risk (standard deviation) of the market portfolio.|$|E
2500|$|The FQPA {{established}} a new safety standard (reasonable certainty of no harm) {{that must be}} applied to all food commodities. In addition to the new standard the EPA now has to consider the <b>specific</b> <b>risks</b> pesticides might have for infants and children. The FQPA required the re-testing of all existing pesticide tolerance levels within 10 years. [...] When assessing this risk the EPA is required {{to take into account}} the “aggregate risk” (the exposure to a pesticide from multiple sources) and the “cumulative exposure” to pesticides with similar mechanisms of toxicity. To do this the EPA is required to establish new science polices to assess the risks. [...] The FQPA requires the EPA to set tolerances for pesticide uses that fall under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (emergency exemptions).|$|E
5000|$|In finance, a <b>specific</b> <b>risk</b> is a {{risk that}} affects {{a very small number}} of assets. This is {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "unsystematic risk".

The individual fee for each Part C beneficiary is also uplifted or downsized slightly (approximately 1%-3% in either direction on average) from the county-specific fee based on a risk-based formula tied to the personal health characteristics of the capitated individual. The theory is that the risk-based formula will be [...] "budget" [...] neutral but in practice it almost always increases cost per beneficiary by a percent or two, either because the Medicare Advantage plan is very diligent in upcoding to a beneficiary's <b>specific</b> <b>risks</b> or because patients on Original FFS Medicare, where providers have no incentive to code at all, are undercoded ("budget" [...] is in quotes because there is effectively no Medicare budget; the Medicare Trust funds will expend whatever is required to provide earned benefits for both types—managed and FFS—of Medicare beneficiary).|$|E
2500|$|Hedge funds {{share many}} of the same types of risk as other {{investment}} classes, including liquidity risk and manager risk. Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove money. Manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds. As well as <b>specific</b> <b>risks</b> such as style drift, which refers to a fund manager [...] "drifting" [...] away from an area of specific expertise, manager risk factors include valuation risk, capacity risk, concentration risk and leverage risk. Valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate; capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy, which may lead to fund performance deterioration; and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment, sector, trading strategy, or group of correlated funds. These risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest, restrictions on allocation of funds, and set exposure limits for strategies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There are {{a number}} of {{measures}} that quantify the public health burden due to <b>specific</b> <b>risk</b> factors for <b>specific</b> diseases. Although these measures are of importance for policymakers, epi-demiologists do not often calculate them or may be unfamiliar with some of the issues involved when they do. The primary measure of interest is the attributable fraction (AF), representing the fraction of cases or deaths from a specific disease that would not have occurred in the absence of exposure to a <b>specific</b> <b>risk</b> factor either in the exposed population or the population as a whole. AFs can be multiplied {{by the total number of}} cases of a given disease to obtain a “body count”—the absolute number of preventable cases due to a <b>specific</b> <b>risk</b> factor. Two other measures of public health burden, used in conjunction with AFs, are attributable years-of-life-lost and attributable disability-adjusted life-years.
