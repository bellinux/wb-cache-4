When executed, a fault may cause an error, {{which is an}} invalid state within a <b>system</b> <b>boundary.</b> An error may cause further errors within the <b>system</b> <b>boundary,</b> therefore each new error acts as a fault, or it may propagate to the <b>system</b> <b>boundary</b> and be observable. When error states are observed at the <b>system</b> <b>boundary</b> they are termed failures. This mechanism is termed the fault-error-failure cycle [...] and is a key mechanism in dependability.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that Failures are recorded at the <b>system</b> <b>boundary.</b> They are basically Errors that have propagated to the <b>system</b> <b>boundary</b> and have become observable.Faults, Errors and Failures operate according to a mechanism. This mechanism is sometimes known as a Fault-Error-Failure chain. As a general rule a fault, when activated, can lead to an error (which is an invalid state) and the invalid state generated by an error may lead to another error or a failure (which is an observable deviation from the specified behaviour at the <b>system</b> <b>boundary).</b>|$|R

Inventory flows include inputs of water, energy, and raw materials, and releases to air, land, and water. To develop the inventory, a flow model of the technical system is constructed using data on inputs and outputs. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow chart that includes the activities {{that are going to}} be assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives a clear picture of the technical <b>system</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The input and output data needed for the construction of the model are collected for all activities within the system boundary, including from the supply chain (referred to as inputs from the technosphere).|$|E

Social {{interaction is}} also important for an individual, for without social interactions no one can survive/develop in this world. Social interaction, however, presupposes both the existence of individual persons and the ability of having interaction between them. When one person is included with the other (symbiosis) or when two are located too far from one aother, there can be no interaction. The balance of connectedness and separateness is necessary for functional interaction. From the perspective of system theory it means that having a functional <b>system</b> <b>boundary</b> is crucial for a living system to survive/develop in this world. The function of a <b>system</b> <b>boundary</b> is making a system to exchange matter-energy or information necessary for the system with other systems outside (environment) keeping its identity at the same time. The most important function of a modern family is to make an adequate/flexible <b>system</b> <b>boundary</b> of each family member through everyday interactions. No other social system can be substituted. How is it possible for a family to make an adequate/flexible <b>system</b> <b>boundary</b> of individual members? What is its mechanism?

2500|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} {{is a powerful}} tool for analyzing [...] aspects of quantifiable systems. Not every factor, however, can be reduced to a number and inserted into a model. Rigid <b>system</b> <b>boundaries</b> make accounting for changes in the system difficult. This is sometimes referred to as the boundary critique to systems thinking. The accuracy and availability of data can also contribute to inaccuracy. For instance, data from generic processes may be based on averages, unrepresentative sampling, or outdated results. Additionally, social implications of products are generally lacking in LCAs. Comparative life-cycle analysis is often used to determine a better process or product to use. However, because of aspects like differing <b>system</b> <b>boundaries,</b> different statistical information, different product uses, etc., these studies can easily be swayed in favor of one product or process over another in one study and the opposite in another study based on varying parameters and different available data. There are guidelines to help reduce such conflicts in results but the method still provides {{a lot of room for}} the researcher to decide what is important, how the product is typically manufactured, and how it is typically used.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, the <b>system</b> <b>boundary</b> for LCA {{describes}} {{the time from}} initial food waste generation at the household to its final disposal. To calculate GWP of food waste treatment options, five stages were defined and investigated; they are separate discharge, separate collection, transportation, treatment, and resource/energy production of disposal from food waste generation to final disposal. Food wastes were collected and transported to a treatment facility. An avoided impact analysis was applied to energy and resource recovery. Electricity and steam can be produced by converting waste to captured biogas; the steam was used for warming the digester. The produced steam was excluded because energy usage such as electricity or fuel for processes was already not counted as the same amount as the steam from biogas. The decision rules {{for the inclusion of}} input and output materials into the <b>system</b> <b>boundary</b> were cumulative weight, energy, and relevance to the environmental aspects, all suggested by ISO/TR 14049 [16].

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about how to start an Object-Oriented (OO) system {{development}} process. The research problem may be translated like this: "Does {{it make sense to}} postpone the drawing of the <b>system</b> <b>boundary</b> in an object-oriented system development process?" In the process of working out {{a solution to the problem}} described, we studied how the Unified Process (UP) recommends to start an OO system development process. UP is a well-known development process, which starts by identifying functional requirements by means of use cases. This may lead to setting up a fixed <b>system</b> <b>boundary</b> very early in the development process. In this thesis, we suggest an OO framework for how to avoid setting up a fixed <b>system</b> <b>boundary</b> early in the development process. The focus should be on how objects collaborate, regardless of what may be perceived as real world tasks and computerized tasks. Some objects may even be split into one part belonging to the real world, and another part belonging to the computerized system. By postponing the distribution of knowledge and responsibility between real world tasks and the computerized system, we are able to design OO models on a higher abstraction level. The objects inside our system should not be regarded as part of an OO model of the "real world", but as computerized enhancements to objects in the real world. Only after we have decided upon how knowledge and responsibility should be distributed between the two parts, we know where to draw the <b>system</b> <b>boundary.</b> The OO framework presented in this thesis may be applied to any OO development process, where we want to delay the drawing of the <b>system</b> <b>boundary...</b>|$|R
