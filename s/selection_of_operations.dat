This paper investigates the extension of such analysis to affinity chromatography both in the selection of chromatographic processes and {{in the use of the}} rate model for mathematical modelling and simulation. Two affinity systems were used: Blue Sepharose and Protein A. The extension of the theory developed previously for ion-exchange and HIC chromatography to affinity separations is analyzed in this paper. For the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> two algorithms are used. In the first, the value of h, which corresponds to the efficiency (resolution) of the actual chromatography and, S, which determines the amount of a particular contaminant eliminated after each separation step, which determines the purity, have to be determined. It was found that the value of both these parameters is not generic for affinity separations but will depend on the type of affinity system used and will have to be determined on a case by case basis. With Blue Sepharose a salt gradient was used and with Protein A, a pH gradient. Parameters were determined with individual proteins and simulations of the protein mixtures were done. This approach allows investigation of chromatographic protein purification in a holistic manner that includes ion-exchange, HIC, gel filtration and affinity separations for the first time...|$|E

The integrated steady state and dynamic modeling capabilities, where the same model can be evaluated from either perspective with full sharing of process information, represent a significant advancement in the engineering software industry. The various components that comprise HYSYS provide an extremely powerful approach to steady state modeling. At a fundamental level, the comprehensive <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> and property methods allows you to model a wide range of processes with confidence. Perhaps even more important is how the HYSYS approach to modeling maximizes your return on simulation time through increased process understanding. To comprehend why HYSYS is such {{a powerful}} engineering simulation tool, you {{need look no further than}} its strong thermodynamic foundation. The inherent flexibility contributed through its design, combined with the unparalleled accuracy and robustness provided by its property package calculations leads to the presentation of a more realistic model. HYSYS is widely used in universities and colleges in introductory and advanced courses especially in chemical engineering. In industry the software is used in research, development, modeling and design. HYSYS serves as the engineering platform for modeling processes from Upsteam, through Gas Processing and Cryogenic facilities, to Refining and Chemicals processes. There are several key aspects of HYSYS which have been designed specifically to maximize the engineerâ€™s efficiency in using simulation technology. Usability and efficiency are two obvious attributes, which HYSYS has and continues to excel at. The single model concept is key not only to the individual engineerâ€™s efficiency, but to the efficiency of an organization. Books about HYSYS are sometimes difficult to find.

40|$|The shoe {{manufacturing}} industry {{has undergone a}} revolution during the last 50 years, due {{to the introduction of}} task specific machinery. Great technological strides {{have been made in the}} areas of shoe manufacture prior to actual component assembly. Computer systems are now becoming the norm for the design of shoes for today's market place. Technological innovations have also started to be applied in the assembly and construction processes of modern shoes. Computer controlled cutting machines calculate the optimum usage of leather from any given hide, new machines allow decorative stitch patterns to be associated with a given shape and size of component and automatically stitched on to the presented workpiece. However the majority of assembly operations have remained predominantly manual with technology playing a secondary role to the human operator due to complexities either in manipulation, control or sensing. In these machines electronic and mechanical innovations have been used to add new features to often simple machines and in some cases to simplify some of the more complex operations, thus increasing productivity but reducing the required dexterity and knowledge of an operator. Modern preferences in industry are to utilise fully automated machines, that are as operator independent as possible, thus improving quality, consistency and production speed whilst at the same time reducing production costs. Due to the nature of the shoe {{manufacturing industry}} and the complex operations that have to be performed in order to construct a shoe, machinery manufacturers who have ventured into this field of automation have generally struggled to gain acceptance from the shoe makers as the machinery is generally complex and slow in operation. This together with the fact that a large proportion of the world's main footwear production is centred in the far east, with their correspondingly low labour costs, has held back the automation of the shoe  manufacturing industry. This thesis examines a <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> encountered in the construction of a typical shoe.
