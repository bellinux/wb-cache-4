30|$|In {{this study}} the {{characterisation}} and separation/discrimination of three <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> (crosses, West African Dwarfs (WAD) and West African Long Legged (WALL)] {{based on their}} physical traits (morphological characterisation) was investigated extensively with the application of discriminant analysis. The study’s main objective was specifically based on developing a variable selection criterion that can discriminate best among the three <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> and as well as obtain a reliable mathematical function/equation (discriminant functions) for provision of maximum separation among the three known <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds.</b> Data from College of Education, Mampong animal farms on various <b>breeds</b> of <b>sheep</b> (hybrid/crossed <b>breed,</b> Sahell/WALL and Djallonke/WAD) was used. Factor Analysis was employed as a variable selection criterion for selecting six sheep traits that can discriminate best among the <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds.</b> Canonical discriminant function was derived for the eight variable data set and was compared with the derived quadratic discriminant functions (QDFs) using the six extracted sheep traits. The six variable QDF distance classifier provided maximum separation after cross validation than the 8 -variable canonical discriminant functions. The derived mathematical functions (QDFs) were able to provide maximum separation among the three known <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> with a correct classification rate of 0.86.|$|R

500|$|Whitemore, {{along with}} Hagley, has {{historically}} {{had one of}} the highest concentrations of stud farms breeding pedigree livestock, in Australia. In the 1950s there were more than 100 registered studs within [...] of the town's centre. The Poll Dorset, an important breed in prime lamb production in Australia, was first bred at a Whitemore stud. Whitemore farmers, the French family, began breeding Ryeland lambs in early 21st century. The family had originally farmed this breed in the 1930s, but it had now become uncommon in Australia due to changing fashions in meat. The Heazlewood family breeds the Border Leicester, another <b>sheep</b> <b>breed</b> that is now uncommon in Australia. The family was honoured by the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania in 2013 for their involvement in the Tasmanian sheep industry over the previous one hundred years.|$|E
500|$|After {{research}} and testing were done {{to confirm that}} the Polled Dorset carried the same characteristics as the Horned Dorset and was able to pass on these traits, the Continental Dorset Club, formed in 1898, registered the very first Polled Dorset sheep in 1956. [...] Livestock scientists, the late Dr. Lemuel Goode and the late Sam Buchanan, are credited with identifying and developing the hornless sheep. The offspring of NCSU 402 were bought by other breeders and within twenty years, seventy percent of all registered Dorsets were polled. The success of the Polled Dorset has made it considered to be the second most popular <b>sheep</b> <b>breed</b> in the United States. A polled strain of Dorsets were also developed in Australia in the 1900s, however, these were not {{as a result of a}} genetic mutation but resulted from the introduction of Corriedale and Ryeland blood into the Dorset Horn.|$|E
2500|$|The Romney, {{formerly}} {{called the}} Romney Marsh sheep but generally {{referred to by}} the local farmers as the Kent, is a breed of sheep originating in England. The Romney is a [...] "long-wool" [...] breed recognized in England by 1800. Exported to other continents, the Romney is an economically important <b>sheep</b> <b>breed,</b> especially to the sheep-meat and wool export trades of New Zealand.|$|E
30|$|The {{study was}} aimed at {{establishing}} a separator/discriminating function for separating the three known <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> (hybrid/crosses, WAD and WALL <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds).</b> The derived discriminant functions provided maximum (canonical linear discriminant function) separation among the three known breeds with an overall classification rate of 78.9  %. However, factor analysis extracted six (6) traits out of the eight variables and the derived discriminant functions with the six variables provided better separation than the eight variate discriminant equation (Canonical discriminant function). Quadratic discriminant functions were derived from the six variate data and 86.2  % correct classification of <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> were achieved. The study can therefore conclude that <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> can be clearly separated based on the physical traits with minimum rate of misclassification without concentrating on only their genotypic features.|$|R
40|$|Information on the {{estimation}} of genetic distances and differentiation among <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> are needed in crossing and conservation programs. This research aims to study of utilizing behaviour characteristic variables to differentiate and estimate genetic distance between the <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds.</b> The study was conducted at Cilebut and Bogor Animal House of Indonesian Research Institute for Animal Production. Five <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> used were Barbados Black Belly Cross (BC), Garut Composite (KG), Garut Local (LG), Sumatera Composite (KS) and St. Croix Cross (SC), with total sample of 50 heads. A total of 10 variables of behavior traits were observed in this study. Analysis of variances and significance tests were applied to compare between <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> and performed for all of behavior traits using PROC GLM of SAS Program ver. 9. 0. PROC CANDISC was used for canonical discriminant analyses, the hierarchical clustering was performed using the PROC CLUSTER by Average Linkage method (Unweighted Pair-Group Method Using Arithmetic Averages, UPGMA), and the dendogram for the five <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> was described using PROC TREE. The differentiator variables for the behavior traits were standing and feeding duration. The canonical plotting based on behavioral characteristics could differentiate BC, KS and LG (with KG and SC) sheeps. Estimation of genetic distance based on the behavior traits is less accurate for grouping of <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Serum enzymes {{were studied}} in 377 {{apparently}} healthy sheep from three indigenous <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> of Ethiopia. The effect of breed, age, sex and season on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) /glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) /glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and acid phosphatase (AcP) levels was assessed. The mean serum enzymes {{levels of the}} indigenous Menz, Tukur and Wello <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> ranged from 17. 2 - 17. 7 IU l- 1, AST/GOT from 50. 4 - 56. 6 IU l- 1, ALP from 93. 2 - 103. 9 IU l- 1, and AcP from 2. 47 - 2. 56 IU l- 1, were within the normal range for sheep elsewhere. Season had significant influence on all serum enzymes except for the AcP in Menz breed. Sex had significant effect on AST/GOT for Menz and on ALP for all <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds,</b> with consistently higher values in males than in females. Age was significant only on ALP in the Menz and Tukur breeds.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to estimate genetic distance, the phylogenetic relationship, and time of divergences using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Materials and Methods: The total 216 unrelated samples were collected from native breeding tract of six Indian <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds.</b> The genomic DNA was isolated and screened for restriction enzyme polymorphisms for cytochrome b (Cyt-b) region of mtDNA with seven restriction enzymes. Results: The genetic distance among <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> was ranging between 0. 02833 and 0. 0946. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that Malpura and Chokla were found closer relationship forming distinct cluster followed by Deccani individual were clustered with Nellore sheep, whereas Nali and Sonadi were distant to each other having separate cluster. Estimated divergence time among Indian <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> were ranging about 1. 41 - 4. 73 million years ago (MYA) with an average of 3. 063 ± 0. 27 MYA. It showed that Malpura and Sonadi sheep revealed highest divergence time as 4. 73 MYA whereas Malpura and Chokla show the lowest as 1. 41 MYA. Conclusion: In conclusion, the restriction fragment length polymorphisms-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) of the Cyt-b region of mtDNA is suitable and cost effective tool for estimating the genetic variability, phylogenetic relationship, and time of divergence among Indian <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds.</b> These findings will help to formulate proper breeding strategies for conservation and utilization of <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds...</b>|$|R
