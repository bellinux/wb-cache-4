5|$|DJ Hero is {{a rhythm}} video {{game and a}} {{spin-off}} of the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by FreeStyleGames and published by Activision worldwide in October 2009 for the PlayStation 2 and 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 consoles. The game is based on turntablism, requiring {{the use of a}} special game controller that includes a turntable surface with three buttons, a crossfader bar, and an effects dial, in addition to other controller buttons used to manipulate in-game menus. In a manner similar to Guitar Hero, players use the turntable controller to mimic the actions of a disc jockey (DJ), such as scratching and crossfading between two different songs, as graphical representations of these actions <b>scroll</b> <b>down</b> on screen towards the player in time with the music. Unlike previous Guitar Hero games, there is no performance meter, and instead players are simply challenged to obtain the best score possible in order to earn stars (from zero to five for each mix) to unlock new songs, venues, and characters. The player can attempt these songs at one of four difficulties (Easy to Expert), with higher difficulties providing more actions for the player to perform within the song.|$|E

500|$|Benetton sent an {{alternative}} suggestion {{to the company}} on 10 May 1994, accepted by LDRA five days later. Tests on the car were {{to be carried out}} on 28 June 1994, but were cancelled. The tests eventually took place on 6 July 1994. LDRA found the tests unsatisfactory. Benetton therefore complied with the original request, the source code, on 18 July 1994. Analysis of the software found that it included launch control, a banned aid. Benetton stated that [...] "it can only be switched on by recompilation of the code." [...] However LDRA found this to be untrue; launch control could be switched on by connecting a computer to the gearbox control unit. Benetton conceded that this was possible but this [...] "came as a surprise to them". To switch the system on, the user is presented with a menu with 10 visible options. [...] "Launch Control" [...] was not visibly listed as an option, however, should the user <b>scroll</b> <b>down</b> to option 13, launch control could be enabled. Benetton did not make any explanation.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} in Guitar Hero: Aerosmith {{is based}} on the same gameplay elements from [...] Players use a guitar controller to hold down fret keys and strum on the strum bar in time with the note patterns as they <b>scroll</b> <b>down</b> the screen in order to complete a song. The player's performance is tracked by a Rock Meter, and if it falls too low, the song ends prematurely. Star Power can be collected by completing marked note phrases correctly, and by using the whammy bar during sustained notes; Star Power is released by lifting the guitar controller vertically or by pressing the Select button in order to double the scoring multiplier and dramatically affect the Rock Meter. The player is rated after successfully completing a song from 3 to 5stars, and can examine statistics related to their performance, and in Career mode, awarded money to be used to unlock ten bonus songs in [...] "The Vault" [...] and additional guitars, outfits, and other videos about the band. Each song can be played at one of four difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert.|$|E

500|$|Guitar Hero II is a {{music video}} game {{developed}} by Harmonix and distributed by RedOctane, {{and is a}} sequel to Guitar Hero. [...] The game was released first to PlayStation 2 in , but later released for the Xbox 360 in [...] [...] Guitar Hero II challenges players to recreate the lead guitar portions of many rock music songs using a specially designed guitar-shaped controller, based on either a Gibson SG for the PlayStation 2 version, a Gibson Explorer for the Xbox 360 version, or else a standard console controller. As notes <b>scroll</b> <b>down</b> the screen towards the player, the player must hit both the fret buttons on the guitar controller and the strum bar {{at the same time}} in order to successfully hit the notes. Successfully hitting notes improves the player's performance in the game and also raises their score, while missing notes will reduce the player's performance, and a poor performance may end the song prematurely. Each song can be played at one of four difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard and Expert. These levels reflect the number of fret buttons used and the number and frequency of the notes to be performed.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to other music and rhythm video games, in that the player must press buttons on a game controller in time with scrolling notes on the game screen to complete a song. The basic mechanics are based on Konami's Guitar Freaks. In the case of Guitar Hero, the player may use either the guitar peripheral (a 3/4-scale reproduction of the Gibson SG guitar as bundled with the game, or a third-party version) or a standard controller to play the scrolling notes. The guitar peripheral has five different-colored fret buttons near the nut of the guitar neck, and a strum bar and a whammy bar {{on the body of}} the guitar. The peripheral also has other buttons in order to navigate the game's menus. Music is displayed on screen through a series of notes, matching in color and position to the fret buttons, that <b>scroll</b> <b>down</b> the screen on a fret board. To hit or play a note, the player must hold down the fret button corresponding to the note shown and toggle the strum bar {{at the same time as}} that note passes a marked area on the screen. Faster series of notes may be played on the guitar controller using hammer-on and pull-off techniques where the player does not need to strum each note. [...] The game supports toggling the handedness of the guitar, allowing both left-handed and right-handed players to utilize the guitar controller. A player using the standard controller simply presses the buttons that correspond with the displayed notes as outlined in the game's manual.|$|E
500|$|The core {{gameplay}} remains unchanged {{from the}} other games in the series. [...] The Guitar Grip is required {{to play the game}} and comes as part of a bundle that can be purchased for each installment. The Grip is designed for the DS Lite, but features a small adapter that can be removed for use in the older Nintendo DS models. Four fret buttons are located {{on the side of the}} unit near the cartridge slot. This is one less than the normal five frets, included an orange-colored one, managed by other Guitar Hero controllers. [...] A wriststrap is attached to the underside to provide support while playing. The player holds the unit in a vertical book orientation (similar to [...] or [...] ), and uses a special guitar pick-shaped stylus to strum on the touchscreen of the DS with their free hand. The [...] "note highway" [...] and the performance of the chosen character in the band are shown on the opposite screen. [...] As notes <b>scroll</b> <b>down</b> on the note highway, the player must press the correct fret button and strum the touchscreen at the same time to successfully score points. While holding a long note, the player can also use the touch screen to apply a whammy effect by moving the stylus across the on-screen whammy bar or anywhere on the screen. [...] After the player has successfully hit a selected series of notes, he or she will gain [...] "Star Power" [...] which doubles their score until the meter has run out. This is activated by yelling or blowing into the DS's microphone, by pressing any of the face buttons on the DS, or by tapping the Star Power meter on the touchscreen.|$|E
