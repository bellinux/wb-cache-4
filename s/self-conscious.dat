5|$|Farrar has {{characterized}} the songwriting process for this album as easier than his typical work composing new lyrics as it {{allowed him to}} be less <b>self-conscious.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1989 Manning {{directed}} the Belvoir St Theatre {{production of a}} play, Black Cockatoos, {{about the relationship between}} a white woman and an Aboriginal man. The script (not by Manning) was criticised by reviewer Angela Bennie, who nevertheless described Manning's direction as delicate and perceptive in places, if also naive and <b>self-conscious.</b>|$|E
5|$|Born in 1987 to Graham (Paul Clarkson) and Christine Carpenter (Race Davies), Zoe is {{the older}} sister of Archie Carpenter (Stephen Beard). During her time at {{secondary}} school, Zoe was overweight and <b>self-conscious.</b> She sought comfort in her teacher {{and fell in}} love. The pair began an affair, which was never discovered. While at school, Zoe also {{had a relationship with}} Joe Spencer (Matt Millburn), who had arrived in Hollyoaks as a student three years before her arrival.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert {{acted as}} stage {{director}} {{for his own}} plays and operas. He sought realism in acting, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated <b>self-conscious</b> interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes. Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals. As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the overture for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting it to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier, to complete. Pinafore opened on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique.|$|E
5|$|In the Balkand {{episode of}} the {{marriage}} of the princes of Ayodhya with the princesses of Mithila, Tulsidas presents a metaphor in which the four brides are compared with the four states of consciousness – the waking state (Jagrat), sleep with dreams (Swapna), dreamless sleep (Sushupti) and the fourth <b>self-conscious</b> state (Turiya). The four grooms are compared with the presiding divinity (Vibhu) of the four states – Vishva, Taijasa, Prajna and Brahman. Tulsidas says as the four states of consciousness with their presiding divinities reside {{in the mind of}} a Jiva, so the four brides with their grooms are resplendent in the same pavilion.|$|E
5|$|Massaquoi {{spent her}} first seven years with her father's sister, Mama Jassa, in Njagbacca in the Garwula District of Grand Cape Mount County. While she was there, {{one of her}} father's six wives, Ma Sedia, seriously injured Fatima's hands for a misdemeanor. This caused her {{considerable}} pain throughout her childhood, hampering her ability to play the violin. She later became a highly competent player, though she remained <b>self-conscious</b> about the scarring even as an adult. After elementary school, she was sent to boarding school at Julia C. Emery Hall, attached to the Bromley Mission near Clay-Ashland in Montserrado County.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after giving}} birth to the younger children, Maria Theresa was confronted {{with the task of}} marrying off the elder ones. She led the {{marriage}} negotiations along with the campaigns of her wars and the duties of state. She treated her children with affection but used them as pawns in dynastic games and sacrificed their happiness {{for the benefit of the}} state. A devoted but <b>self-conscious</b> mother, she wrote to all of her children at least once a week and believed herself entitled to exercise authority over her children regardless of their age and rank.|$|E
5|$|While {{scholars}} know {{of patriarchal}} and matrifocal ancient societies, very little {{can be said}} about a society of a species, which is as remote as Australopithecus. On the basis of examples in today's chimpanzee and bonobo societies, Klaus Ebner introduced both patriarchal and matriarchal characters in the novel, Costello and Akshaya. Some of the female characters are very strong and <b>self-conscious,</b> such as Akshaya, who is so firm that even Costello s from her. While political power is controlled by the males, the social structure seems matrifocal and matrilineal, corresponding to the image of prehistoric societies exhibited by scholars.|$|E
5|$|Will {{learns that}} Emma and Carl {{attended}} a midnight screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which helped to lessen {{some of her}} obsessive–compulsive behaviors. As Emma is a fan, Will decides to direct the glee club in a production of the musical, casting co-captains Finn Hudson and Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) in the lead roles of Brad and Janet, Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) as Dr. Frank N. Furter, and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) as Rocky. While Sam is proud of his physique and secure in his own body-image, Finn feels <b>self-conscious</b> {{at the prospect of}} appearing in his underwear, as the role necessitates.|$|E
5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} <b>self-conscious</b> of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|Becoming irritated {{that no one}} {{joined in}} him in walking out on Gabe, Michael goes outside and pulls the cable connection, causing it to turn off. Hysteria erupts, and Michael becomes <b>self-conscious</b> over the commotion he has caused. He goes outside to fix the cable. There he is {{discovered}} by Erin, who throughout the evening {{has been trying to}} encourage Michael to bond with Gabe. Michael, still indignant over the idea that his office views Gabe as his boss, is initially irritated by her efforts, but eventually realizes that Erin views him as a father figure. He jokes around and tells her to go to her room, leading to a bonding moment between the two. As he leaves the party, Michael brings Gabe into the joke by threatening to kill him if he breaks Erin's heart.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{would not}} smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of {{his sense of}} smell. He found ways to train himself in mental patience, took power naps instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when {{scouting}} or traveling {{where there was no}} water, he might still be able to exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor <b>self-conscious,</b> who was extremely modest, and who seldom spoke of his many adventures.|$|E
5|$|Ethicist Tom Regan {{rejected}} Kant's {{assessment of}} the moral worth of animals on three main points: First, he rejected Kant's claim that animals are not <b>self-conscious.</b> He then challenged Kant's claim that animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make a moral judgment. Regan argued that, if a being's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgment, then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration. Regan finally argued that Kant's assertion that animals exist merely {{as a means to}} an end is unsupported; the fact that animals have a life that can go well or badly suggests that, like humans, they have their own ends.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Hepburn {{gained a}} place at Bryn Mawr College. She {{attended}} the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and recalled disliking the experience. It {{was the first time}} she had been in school for several years, and she was <b>self-conscious</b> and uncomfortable with her classmates. She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in her room. Hepburn was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly. She performed the lead role in a production of The Woman in the Moon in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career. She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people start}} {{to show up at}} the Quahog's Men's Club and Lois and her friends start to get annoyed. In order to get back at them, they enter the club. Everyone dances, except for Bonnie, because her husband is handicapped. Joe feels <b>self-conscious</b> about his disability, and decides to get surgery so that {{he will be able to}} walk again. When Joe comes out of the operation, he invites his friends to go do {{physical}} activities such as rock climbing, karate, and dance. Joe starts to not care about his friends and his wife, and finds three new jock friends that share his status. Lois and Peter are worried about Joe, and Lois suggests that Peter should find a new friend to replace him. Meanwhile, Joe realizes that he has outgrown Bonnie and leaves her. Desperate to get their friend back, Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire try to re-cripple Joe, failing miserably until Bonnie comes along with Joe's handgun and shoots (and misses) Joe's spine. Sick of waiting in pain, Joe takes the gun and shoots himself in the spine, re-crippling himself. They all then go to the Drunken Clam where Joe apologizes to Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire for how he acted and they all forgive him.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands of gray hair. This makes her extremely <b>self-conscious,</b> and soon Lois {{becomes aware of}} her lust for a younger man. After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E
5|$|Kotarou invites {{three other}} girls into the occult {{research}} society {{who are also}} heroines in the game. One is Kotori Kanbe, Kotarou's childhood friend in his class who has few friends and starts attending school regularly after joining the club. She has a playful personality and has an extremely strong pet dog named Chibi-Moth, which is actually a familiar created by Kotori {{from the body of}} her dead pet dog Pero. However, she is not affiliated with Gaia or Guardian, and instead follows in the path of an ancient sect of summoners called Druids who revered nature and protected Kagari with familiars. Another heroine is first-year student Sizuru Nakatsu, a shy girl on the public morals committee who has excellent hearing, eyesight and can read lips. She has heterochromia, though wears an eyepatch over her golden-colored right eye as she is very <b>self-conscious</b> about it; her left eye is blue. Sizuru is a member of Guardian who has the ability to produce various chemicals inside her body which can be used to heal herself and others, paralyze and cause amnesia. Sizuru joins the club with her close friend Lucia Konohana, another heroine and the class representative of Kotarou's class. Lucia is easily agitated by the antics of boys and often punches Kotarou when he annoys her. She is obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves. Like Sizuru, Lucia is a member of Guardian and has the ability to produces poisonous miasma and pus {{as a result of an}} experiment by Guardian, which she takes medication for to suppress. She can also create vibrations within the objects she touches and break glass at a distance. Both Lucia and Sizuru have superhuman speed, agility, and reflexes in addition to their other abilities.|$|E
25|$|Onstad {{has claimed}} {{in at least}} one {{interview}} that Téodor is the most autobiographical of the strip's characters, as they are both <b>self-conscious</b> cooks.|$|E
25|$|The use of self is {{fundamental}} to social work, and a practitioner needs to be <b>self-conscious,</b> and know what parts of themselves to use in practice, and which to leave out.|$|E
25|$|The {{cone-shaped}} mask {{in particular}} is identified with the Ku Klux Klan in a <b>self-conscious</b> effort to combine the hiding of personal identity with the promotion of a powerful and intimidating image.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a poem written upon a tree, or on bark, is found in several earlier {{pastoral}} poems – some critics have argued that such reference to writing {{is a reflection of}} <b>self-conscious</b> literary belatedness.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} his life, Symonds' {{homosexuality}} {{had become}} an open secret in certain literary and cultural circles. His private memoirs, written (but never completed) over a four-year period from 1889 to 1893, form the earliest known <b>self-conscious</b> homosexual autobiography.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{a review}} of {{behavioral}} studies, {{it is suggested that}} there may be selective damage to the limbic-prefrontal episodic memory system in some people with autism. Another study points to evidence of autistic deficits in the episodic or <b>self-conscious</b> memory of personally experienced events.|$|E
25|$|The 400 Blows {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the French New Wave movement, which gave directors such as Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol and Jacques Rivette a wider audience. The New Wave dealt with a <b>self-conscious</b> rejection of traditional cinema structure. This was a topic on which Truffaut had been writing for years.|$|E
25|$|While at Baltimore Lutheran School, {{a teacher}} {{convinced}} Hardesty into {{acting in the}} school's theater productions, though he was too <b>self-conscious</b> to allow his family to attend his performances. He practiced his social skills {{while working as a}} cashier at Weis Markets, a nearby grocery store where he worked on weekends and after school.|$|E
25|$|The sum and {{substance}} of cool is a <b>self-conscious</b> aplomb in overall behavior, which entails {{a set of}} specific behavioral characteristics that is firmly anchored in symbology, a set of discernible bodily movements, postures, facial expressions and voice modulations that are acquired and take on strategic social value within the peer context.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the first}} album where Mac Miller self-produced {{a large chunk of}} it under his alias Larry Fisherman. He said he was very <b>self-conscious</b> of his {{production}} on the album. The album's production was also handled by Pharrell Williams, Chuck Inglish, The Alchemist, Clams Casino, Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler, The Creator, Flying Lotus, J. Hill and Diplo among others.|$|E
25|$|Hoffmann's {{literature}} {{indicates the}} failings of many so-called artists {{to differentiate between}} the superficial and the authentic aspects of such Romantic ideals. The <b>self-conscious</b> effort to impress must, according to Hoffmann, be divorced from the self-aware effort to create. This essential duality in Kater Murr is conveyed structurally through a discursive 'splicing together' of two biographical narratives.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{his beliefs}} were well wide of the truth, {{such as his}} belief that the Milky Way was on the sphere of the fixed stars and shines by the {{reflected}} light of the Sun. Gersonides was also the earliest known mathematician to have used the technique of mathematical induction in a systematic and <b>self-conscious</b> fashion and anticipated Galileo’s error theory.|$|E
25|$|While {{the period}} is {{generally}} {{known for its}} adoption of highly regulated and stylised literary forms, some of the concerns of writers of this period, with the emotions, folk and a <b>self-conscious</b> model of authorship, foreshadowed the preoccupations of the later Romantic era. In general, philosophy, politics and literature underwent a turn away from older courtly concerns towards something closer to a modern sensibility.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} sonnet was revived in Britain, with William Wordsworth writing more sonnets {{than any}} other British poet. Other important Romantic lyric writers of the period include Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Lord Byron. Later in the century, the Victorian lyric was more linguistically <b>self-conscious</b> and defensive than the Romantic forms had been. Such Victorian lyric poets include Alfred Lord Tennyson and Christina Rossetti.|$|E
25|$|Working {{simultaneously}} in theater and film, Fassbinder created his own style from {{a fusion of}} the two artforms. His ten early films are characterized by a <b>self-conscious</b> and assertive formalism. Influenced by Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Marie Straub and the theories of Bertolt Brecht, these films are austere and minimalist in style. Although praised by many critics, they proved too demanding and inaccessible for a mass audience. Fassbinder's rapid working methods had begun by this stage.|$|E
25|$|Mata Hari {{brought a}} {{carefree}} provocative style {{to the stage}} in her act, which garnered wide acclaim. The most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled bra and some ornaments upon her arms and head. She was seldom seen without a bra as she was <b>self-conscious</b> about being small-breasted. She wore a bodystocking for her performances that was similar in color to her own skin.|$|E
25|$|Psychology of {{religion}} {{consists of the}} application of psychological methods and interpretive frameworks to religious traditions, {{as well as to}} both religious and irreligious individuals. It attempts to accurately describe the details, origins, and uses of religious beliefs and behaviors. Although the psychology {{of religion}} first arose as a <b>self-conscious</b> discipline as recently as the late 19th century, all three of these tasks have a history going back many centuries before that.|$|E
25|$|The Masses was to {{some extent}} defined by its {{association}} with New York’s artistic culture. “The birth of The Masses,” Eastman later wrote, “coincided {{with the birth of}} ‘Greenwich Village’ as a <b>self-conscious</b> entity, an American Bohemia or gipsy-minded Latin Quarter, but its relations with that entity were not simple.” The Masses was very much embedded in a specific metropolitan milieu, unlike some other competing socialist periodicals (such as the Appeal to Reason, a populist-inflected 500,000-circulation weekly produced out of Girard, Kansas).|$|E
25|$|However, Haufniensis {{mentions}} that anxiety {{is a way}} for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to <b>self-conscious</b> reflection. (Jean-Paul Sartre calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms.|$|E
