5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady a chance to recover the fortune <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, {{she will have to}} take him as her lover).

Viv reflects on this as she motors off {{at the end of the}} book, continuing her tour of America, but despite the officer's warning still devoted to the memory of the spy who loved her.|$|E

While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite the awkward meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two have a date around the kingdom. They later find out that they have much in common, and Anna agrees to Hans' marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her for engaging with someone <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> met. This raises an argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa getting angry and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests' (including Anna) horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go her powers and build an enormous ice palace.

Upon questioning her, the family learns that Pono had likewise been pushed to join the recently established Pembela Tanah Air (PETA; Protectors of the Homeland), and refused; Sri had broken off their engagement rather than marry a coward, saying that {{if she were a}} man she would have certainly joined. Aminah implies that Mahmud has likewise refused to join.|$|E

500|$|The circus folk leave. Vasek's parents [...] Mícha and Háta [...] arrive, with Kecal. Vašek {{tells them}} {{that he no longer}} wants to marry Mařenka, having learned her true nature from a beautiful, strange girl. They are horrified ("He does not want her – what has happened?"). Vašek runs off, and moments later Mařenka arrives with her parents. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> learned of Jeník's deal with Kecal, and a lively {{ensemble}} ("No, no, I don't believe it") ensues. Matters are further complicated when Vašek returns, recognises Mařenka as his [...] "strange girl", and says that he will happily marry her.

500|$|Walls open {{to reveal}} an {{audience}} applauding; Jem, Damien, and the hunters are shown to be actors. The woman is strapped to a chair, and Baxter appears and explains the facade. Her name is Victoria Skillane, and {{the girl in the}} photo is a six-year-old girl named Jemima Sykes. Victoria and her fiancé, Iain Rannoch, abducted the girl a few miles from her home. Iain tortured and killed the girl before burning her body, while Victoria recorded his actions on her mobile phone. The [...] "White Bear", originally the victim's teddy bear, became a symbol of the nationwide search and the murder investigation. The symbol on the television was identical to the tattoo that identified Iain, who committed suicide in his cell before the trial. Having tearfully pleaded guilty, insisting she was [...] "under Iain's spell", Victoria was sentenced to undergo the daily punishment <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> experienced.|$|E

500|$|The Haunting {{is notable}} for its lesbian character, Theodora. Although the character's {{lesbianism}} is subtly {{mentioned in the}} novel, the film makes it explicit. The film {{is also one of}} the few Hollywood motion pictures to depict a lesbian as feminine and not predatory. Theodora's lesbianism helps to create conflict in the picture. Had Theodora been heterosexual, Eleanor's growing attraction to Markway would not have threatened her. But with Theodora a clear lesbian, Markway becomes a threat that causes conflict between the psychic and the investigator. Originally, Gidding's script had contained a scene early in the film in which Theodora is shown in her apartment in the city. It is clear from the context that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> broken off with her female lover: [...] "I hate you" [...] is written on the mirror in lipstick. Theodora is yelling curses at her out the window and more. However, Wise decided to cut the scene, believing it to be too explicit for a film that worked hard to make things implicit. According to Harris, film censors demanded that Theo never be shown to touch Eleanor, in order to keep the lesbianism less obvious.|$|E
500|$|During a {{visit to}} a closing video store during a DVD sale, Peter decides to buy Road House and, after {{watching}} it, decides to start roundhouse kicking everything in sight including his family. While driving with Brian and using his feet on the steering wheel, Peter crashes into a young woman's car, leading Brian to ensure she is okay. The woman apologizes to Brian, and he asks her out. She accepts, but when he comes to her house to pick her up, her mother Rita says <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> left with somebody else. Brian keeps talking to Rita and finds himself attracted to her. After dating for several weeks, they sneak into the Griffin home late one night, but the family finds out the next morning and ridicules Rita behind her back. [...] Brian attempts to convince the family that Rita is a wonderful, charming woman despite the fact that she's significantly older than he is, and invites her to dinner to prove his point. It doesn't go well: they demand that she reveal her age, and she breaks down and admits that she's 50. Infuriated with the Griffins, Brian goes to console Rita, and proposes to her. Feeling guilty for how they treated him, the Griffins give Brian their blessings.|$|E
500|$|The play {{opens with}} Marjorie Taylor in bed, in 1905. [...] Wife of small town doctor Joseph Taylor, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> had a son. [...] The {{people of the}} town predict great things for Joseph Taylor, Jr., or Joe as he will {{come to be called}} (Musical number: [...] "Joseph Taylor, Jr."). [...] Joe learns what a baby learns: the comforting {{presence}} of his mother, the presence of another figure, who does not smell as nice, and who always leaves as soon as he picks up his black bag. [...] Joe is seen as a baby and then not again as a child; the audience takes his perspective. [...] Joe's Grandma notices him trying to walk, calls for Marjorie to witness the first steps, and once he takes them, as the chorus states, [...] "the world belongs to Joe" [...] ("One Foot, Other Foot"). [...] Joe grows to school age, and loses his beloved Grandma. [...] He is comforted by Jennie Brinker, a businessman's daughter. [...] The two grow to high school age and date, though Joe lacks the nerve to kiss her, to Jennie's frustration. [...] As Joe prepares to leave for college, Dr. Taylor hopes that his son will help him in his medical practice, and he and Marjorie wonder if Joe will marry Jennie ("A Fellow Needs a Girl").|$|E

500|$|Her {{involvement}} with Billy Abbott is another significant romance for Chloe, {{and the characters}} marry shortly after Delia is born. However, the marriage ended, {{paving the way for}} a reunion between Billy and his high school sweetheart, Mac Browning (Clementine Ford). In response {{to whether or not the}} Chloe and Billy pairing should be revisited, Hendrickson stated, [...] "You know what, I really hope so. I’ve definitely asked for it." [...] Chloe's next relationship is with Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll), Jill's grandson who is a virgin. Speaking of the developing romance, John Driscoll said, [...] "At this point Chloe is the object of his affection, and he is attracted to her. He is very interested in her because she has a very rocky background, but through and through <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> been herself. He respects her, and there is a spark and energy between them." [...] Chance loses his virginity to Chloe and they become engaged, though she develops into a [...] "clingy" [...] fiancé.
