5|$|Dickens {{was touched}} by the lot of poor {{children}} in the middle decades of the 19th century. In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered after seeing children working in appalling conditions.

5|$|There were at most 20,000 comfort women. None of {{them were}} {{forcibly}} recruited. Forty percent {{of them were}} from Japan, the most heavily represented nation. Many were sold to brokers by their parents. Some responded willingly to brokers' offers; others were deceived. I would add that, on the average, living conditions in the comfort stations were practically identical to those in brothels <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> American troops during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|A Six Man Tag Team {{match between}} Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, and Eric Young) {{and the team}} of Lance Hoyt and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens), who were {{accompanied}} by Jimmy Hart, was next. The match duration was 14 minutes and 44 seconds. Douglas scored a near-fall after Hoyt slammed Eric back-first to the mat. The Naturals <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> their Natural Disaster tag team maneuver on Eric, however, Roode entered and bashed Douglas and Stevens with a megaphone. Eric then covered Douglas for the win.|$|E
5|$|An {{emergency}} subscription {{fund was}} established {{by some of the}} city's wealthiest citizens. Betances and Basora had the city's unsanitary slave barracks torched and a temporary camp <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> its dwellers. A large field at a corner of the city was set aside for a supplementary cemetery, and Betances set and managed a temporary hospital next to it (which was later housed in a permanent structure and became the Hospital San Antonio, the Mayagüez municipal hospital, which still serves the city). However, the epidemic struck the city soon after; Betances' stepmother and one of his brothers-in-law would die from it. By October 1856 Betances would {{have to take care of}} the entire operation on his own temporarily.|$|E

5|$|Anti-malware {{researchers}} also exploited Heartbleed {{to their own}} advantage in order to access secret forums used by cybercriminals. Studies were also conducted by deliberately setting up vulnerable machines. For example, on April 12, 2014, at least two independent researchers were able to steal private keys from an experimental server intentionally <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> that purpose by CloudFlare. Also, on April 15, 2014, J. Alex Halderman, a professor at University of Michigan, reported that his honeypot server, an intentionally vulnerable server designed to attract attacks in order to study them, had received numerous attacks originating from China. Halderman concluded that {{because it was a}} fairly obscure server, these attacks were probably sweeping attacks affecting large areas of the Internet.|$|E
5|$|In Moscow, around 6,000 {{police were}} on duty {{to prevent a}} repeat of the 2008 UEFA Cup Final riots a week earlier, but police {{reported}} that none of the 40,000 visiting fans were arrested, due in part to public safety measures such as a ban on public drinking and no large screens being <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> members of the public to watch the game outdoors. In London, violence escalated outside Fulham Broadway tube station, near Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground; police arrested 12 people on public order offences, while one man was arrested for grievous bodily harm, drink driving and dangerous driving, after he hit a 31-year-old while attempting to drive down Fulham Broadway. Five police were also believed to have been injured in the incident.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} years of operation, THSRC {{accumulated}} debt {{due to high}} depreciation charges and interest, {{largely due to the}} financial structure <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the private company. In 2009, THSRC negotiated with the government to change the method of depreciation from depending on concessions on rights to ridership. At the same time, the government also started to help refinance THSRC's loans to assist the company so it could remain operational and profitable. In 2015, the government injected NT$30 billion as a financial bailed out, boosting the government's stake to about 64% from about 37%. The government also extended the rail concession from 35 years to 70 years and terminated the company’s build-operate-transfer business model.|$|E

5|$|Jorge Godoy Rojas, {{architect}} of the University of Chile, suggested in an January 2007 article he wrote for the online newspaper El Cachapoal that a semi-autonomous legal entity be <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> {{the management of the}} cultural center. Such a legal entity had also been suggested to the authorities previously by local cultural organizations for several years, but they had been largely ignored. On 20 November 2008, fourteen local organizations, including the Tourism Chamber of Pichilemu, the Agrupación Ciudadana por un Pichilemu Limpio (Citizens Group for a Clean Pichilemu), and Canal 3 Pichilemu, {{sent a letter to the}} Pichilemu City Council requesting the creation of the Corporación Cultural de Pichilemu (Pichilemu Cultural Corporation) for the third time.|$|E
5|$|King {{was born}} in Philadelphia in 1873. Early in his life, he worked in a linen trade. Although this was the family business, his father later allowed him to leave to enter the {{insurance}} industry. King was {{not a member of}} the aristocratic and wealthy families of Philadelphia that produced many of the era's top cricketers. King's obituary in Cricket Quarterly suggests that his career in insurance was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> him by those families to allow him to continue playing the game. In 1913 (or 1911), King married Fannie Lockhart; the marriage lasted for fifty years. King's wife died in 1963, and he died in 1965 in his native Philadelphia two days before his 92nd birthday.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{considered}} Viva Piñata {{a success}} and the sequel's development team sought to make a more definitive version of the original. The team re-used many of the development infrastructure <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> its predecessor and exhausted their gameplay ideas for the piñata gardening concept. The game released to generally favorable reviews in September 2008. Critics considered the game more accessible to newcomers and a worthwhile improvement on the original, but altogether closer to an expansion than a unique sequel. Reviewers praised its game design tweaks but were mixed on its multiplayer modes and camera integration. Critics were mixed on whether the sequel would attract new players to the franchise. Trouble in Paradise was later included in the developer's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E

5|$|The prison officer's {{role in the}} 20th century did {{not change}} much, with the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security. Officer {{training}} became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s. Training courses were <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> staff inductions and promotions, and seminars were started for senior officers. The most significant change in this period, however, was that prison officers achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers' Union. The strength of the union {{was based on the}} ability to almost cripple the prison system through strike action, first taken in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The £5,000 left in {{his estate}} was quickly taken up by expenses, mostly on his funeral. His will stipulated that £100,000 {{should be left to}} Whitby and £25,000 each to his butler, Thomas Foley, and his chauffeur; however it is unknown whether they were ever paid. A trust fund had been <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> Frederick, but his half-sisters {{received}} nothing. The House of Lords Act 1999 abolished most hereditary peers' rights; consequently, as well as having no residence at Ickworth, the 8th Marquess does not have a seat in the House.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s {{the hotel}} was {{beginning}} to lose it reputation and a slow decline in popularity began which would culminate in tragedy for Tony Pike. In 1998, Pike had put the hotel up for sale. A deal was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the sale {{which turned out to}} be a scam and Pike was swindled out of £50,000. His son, Anthony Dale Pike, flew to Miami to resolve the situation for his father. However, he was killed the same day of his arrival on 15 February 1998, shot twice in the head and dumped in a secluded forest at Virginia Key beach. Miami Dade Police detectives believed it was clear that he was killed by the people plotting to seize control of the hotel. The police arrested and questioned German tennis professional Thomas Heinz Knott over the murder, but the investigation led them to charge Italian TV producer Enrico Forti with fraud over the transfer of £50,000 from Anthony’s father. In June 2000, Forti was also convicted of murdering Anthony Dale Pike in Miami. Forti is now serving a lifetime prison sentence at the Everglades Correctional Institution in Florida.|$|E

5|$|In 1847, Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, New York {{worked to}} expand telegraphic {{communication}} through the New York and Lake Erie Railroad right-of-way with the Western Union Telegraph Company, saving a telegraph line he built from New York City to Fredonia. The new telegraph {{was an instant}} hit, and was commonly used for gossip and casual chatting. The then-superintendent of the New York and Lake Erie, Charles Minot, looked to expand this new technology with the railroad. He developed a system using telegraphs for train dispatches, for use when trains would want to pass one another along the line, such as at stations. Two-letter telegraph codes were designated, and the new modern system was <b>set</b> <b>up.</b> <b>For</b> the ten years of the new railroad's existence, passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train had to pass them. This new system would relieve this issue.|$|E
5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E
5|$|On 13 January 2006, English club Arsenal {{confirmed}} that the club had signed Diaby on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee, later revealed to be £2million. Prior to joining Arsenal, the player had reportedly turned down an offer to join Arsenal's London rivals Chelsea. Upon joining Arsenal, Diaby was given the number 2 shirt, which was left vacant since the retirement of Lee Dixon. He made his club debut on 21 January 2006 appearing as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat to Everton. Three days later, {{he made his first}} start in a 2–1 Football League Cup victory over Wigan. On 21 February, Diaby made his UEFA Champions League debut appearing as a substitute in the team's Round of 16 first leg victory over Spanish club Real Madrid. Two weeks later, Diaby assisted on a goal in Arsenal's 4–0 win over Fulham. After dealing with an injury in the month of March, he returned to play in April scoring his first goal for the club in a 5–0 victory over Aston Villa on April Fools' Day 2006. He was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the goal by fellow club newcomer Emmanuel Adebayor.|$|E
