5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{recollections}} {{throw some}} light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much <b>speculation.</b> Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels. Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women. By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel {{was in love with}} Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange. Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary <b>speculation</b> that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual. Such <b>speculation</b> recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.|$|E
