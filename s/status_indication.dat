Instead of using in-band signalling, like the Smartmodem, the J-CAT passed the on/off-hook control, carrier detect and phone <b>status</b> <b>indication</b> to the computer through otherwise unused pins in the RS-232C connector. The computer could pulse the hook line to simulate pulse dialing or hang up, and read the status pin to look for line signals like ringing or busy (any noise on the line was reported as [...] "1").

For each concept, two prototypes of simple-tone signals were designed based on existing guidelines about sound characteristics affecting urgency and evaluation by users. The temporal characteristics of the signals indicated how much or how fast drivers should adapt their speed. The concepts were evaluated by having users drive in a driving simulator. Objective measurements indicated that there was no difference in effectiveness between the two concepts. Subjective evaluation indicated that users preferred the Toggle concept...|$|E
40|$|Mobile {{communication}} {{is one of}} the most ubiquitously used technologies in contemporary world, evolving towards its fifth generation (5 G). In day-to-day scenarios, many vehicular users avail broadband cellular services while traveling. The density of such vehicular users change dynamically in a cell and at certain sites (e. g. signal lights), traffic jams would arise frequently. Such conditions would pose high load situation to respective serving base station. As a consequence, the cell site would experience high dropping and blocking rates and subject its users to poor Quality of Experience (QoE). In this work, mobility behavior of vehicular users are analyzed and an algorithm is designed to predict traffic status of a cell. The proposed traffic prediction algorithm is a coalition strategy consisting of schemes to predict user cell transition, vehicular cluster/moving network detection, user velocity monitoring etc. The traffic <b>status</b> <b>indication</b> provided by the algorithm could be used to design efficient radio resource management (RRM) techniques. In the presented paper, this context information about traffic severity is used to pro-actively initiate load balancing at corresponding site and release resources.

The simulation results exhibit substantial reductions in dropping and blocking of users, demonstrating improved QoE of users...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{timing of}} bowel {{preparation}} for colonoscopy influences {{the quality of}} bowel cleansing {{and the success of}} the procedure. AIM We aimed to determine whether the interval between the end of bowel preparation and the start of colonoscopy influences preparation quality. METHODS We retrospectively analysed 1785 colonoscopies performed between January 2010 and January 2011. The quality of bowel cleansing was compared between those who had a less than 8 -h interval between the end of bowel preparation {{to the start of the}} procedure versus those who had a greater than 8 -h interval. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses evaluated quality of bowel cleansing, preparation to procedure time, age, gender, hospital inpatient or outpatient <b>status,</b> <b>indication</b> for colonoscopy, caecal intubation rate, and segmental polyp detection. RESULTS Fifty-three per cent of the cohort was male. Eighty-nine per cent were outpatients. Bowel cleansing was reported as satisfactory/good in 87 % and poor in 13 %.

40|$|Aeronautical ground {{lighting}} (AGL) {{systems have}} been developed to deliver warnings and <b>status</b> <b>indications</b> to pilots and maneuvering area vehicle drivers on runways. Their role in preventing the hazard of runway incursions, present in the aviation industry, is therefore crucial. AGL systems basically consist of a primary series lighting circuit, which is supplied at constant current and high voltage (e. g., 5 kV), and AGL transformers supplying ground lights at their secondary sides. Protection of persons against electric shock in AGL systems cannot be conveyed by disconnection of supply as ground faults would cause the out-of-service of the lighting system, thereby compromising the safety of aerodromes; alternative protective measures are therefore employed. In this paper, the authors examine the electrical safety issues present during maintenance of AGL systems, often performed live in order to guarantee the continuity of the service. Experimental measurements on AGL isolating transformers have been also reported in this paper, and possible solutions to improve the electrical safety of operators are propose...|$|R
