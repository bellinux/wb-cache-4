50|$|Interest-only {{loans are}} {{sometimes}} generated artificially from <b>structured</b> <b>securities,</b> particularly CMOs. A pool of securities (typically mortgages) is created, and divided into tranches. The cashflows that are {{received from the}} underlying debts are spread through the tranches according to predefined rules, an Interest-only (IO) loan is one type of tranche that can be created, it is generally created in tandem with a principal only (PO) tranche. These tranches will cater to two particular types of investors, {{depending on whether the}} investors are trying to increase their current yield (which they can get from an IO), or trying to reduce their exposure to prepayments of the loans (which they can get from a PO). The investment returns on IOs and POs depend heavily on mortgage prepayment rates and permit investors to benefit from different prepayment expectations.|$|E
50|$|Author Roger Lowenstein {{summarized}} some of {{the regulatory}} problems that caused the crisis in November 2009:"1) Mortgage regulation was too lax {{and in some cases}} nonexistent; 2) Capital requirements for banks were too low; 3) Trading in derivatives such as credit default swaps posed giant, unseen risks; 4) Credit ratings on <b>structured</b> <b>securities</b> such as collateralized-debt obligations were deeply flawed; 5) Bankers were moved to take on risk by excessive pay packages; 6) The government’s response to the crash also created, or exacerbated, moral hazard. Markets now expect that big banks won’t be allowed to fail, weakening the incentives of investors to discipline big banks and keep them from piling up too many risky assets again."A 2011 documentary film, Heist: Who Stole the American Dream? argues that deregulation led to the crisis, and is geared towards a general audience.|$|E

But with the 2008 economic crisis and Ecuador's looming default on $510 million of bonds, there was rumour of a possible rift. The drop in the price of Ecuador's biggest export, oil, forced the country to use a 30-day grace period to decide whether to make a $30 million interest payment that was due on November 15. Venezuela apparently owns <b>structured</b> <b>securities</b> tied to Ecuador's bonds that would then force Venezuela to pay $800 million if Correa does not make the payment.

40|$|Diversification {{has been}} a {{frequently}} stated benefit of structured securitizations. However, {{in the course of}} the subprime credit crisis CDOs and especially ABS CDOs turned out to be risk concentrations. In this article, we examine different diversification patterns of <b>structured</b> <b>securities</b> which were deemed beneficial by investors. We find that name diversification is largely ineffective and may even increase the risk of tranches. Similarly, factor or sector diversification in the pool may not have the anticipated effect. Positive effects are only achievable for senior tranches while for mezzanine tranches the risks may even increase. These results shed new light on the diversification potentials of CDOs. They are important in terms of both risk management as well as valuation...|$|E

30|$|One of {{the visible}} effects of the crisis was {{the decline in the}} market for complex {{derivative}} instruments. Hybrid products, fancy exotic options, and cross-asset <b>structured</b> <b>securities</b> lost most of their appeal, both because they were often seen as unnecessary and excessively risky by clients, and because they became uneconomical for banks, as capital, funding, and regulatory compliance eroded profits. However, Figs.  1 and 2, which also comprise papers on these topics, seem to suggest there has been only a moderate decline in research on derivatives pricing. This is because volatility, smile dynamics, and correlation modelling have been inspiring new ideas, such as modelling swap rates’ volatility (Rheinlaender, 2015) and local or stochastic correlation models (see, for example, Langnau, 2010 and Zetocha, 2015) and the trend is unlikely to end soon.|$|E

Additionally, new <b>structured</b> <b>securities</b> have been developed, e. g., MBS, CDOs, and CDS, which have acted as instruments of risk transfer. We {{show that there is}} a certain non-robustness in the pricing of these instruments and we create a model in which their role in the recent nancial market meltdown, and in which the mechanism by which they exacerbate leverage cycles, is explicit. We rst discuss the extent to which complex securities can amplify boom-bust cycles. Then, we propose a model in which distinct nancial market boom-bust cycles emerge naturally. We demonstrate the interaction of leveraging and asset pricing in a dynamical model and spell out some implications for monetary policy...|$|E

40|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} (CRAs) play {{an integral part}} in today's financial markets. Through ratings they express considered opinion about future creditworthiness of an obligor and thus lower information asymmetry in the capital markets. Recently, CRAs have been brought in the spotlight as they are often blamed for being the triggers of the recent market turmoil. Critics often argue that ratings of tranches of structured finance instruments, backed by subprime mortgages, were unjustifiably high, downgrades were too late and the overall integrity of the rating process was compromised through numerous conflicts of interests CRAs face. However, in this thesis I argue that CRAs were put in this position rather through external factors than their own actions. Massive regulation usage of ratings, rapid growth of <b>structured</b> <b>securities</b> market, overdependence on the rating and the overall ignorance {{of the meaning of}} rating itself are the actual causes to blame...|$|E
