40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the ionic conductivity of the drugs under certain conditions and also to compare the ionic conductivities of drugs determined by <b>single</b> <b>surface</b> sensors and parallel plate sensors. The ionic conductivity of various materials at their pre-melt and melt states are studied {{in order to further}} study a recently discovered phenomenon. Polar solids like Lidocaine, Ketoconazole, Procainamide and Nifedipine were examined in this study. Experimental studies show an increase in ionic conductivity in both pre-melt (20 - 30 °C below melting temperature) and melt transition regions. Results of ionic conductivity of both parallel plate and <b>single</b> <b>surface</b> sensor at different frequencies are compared. At 1000 Hz, all the samples show an increase in ionic conductivity with both parallel plate and <b>single</b> <b>surface</b> sensor, but at 0. 1 Hz frequency, no increase in ionic conductivity is observed with parallel plate sensor except for Nifedipine...|$|R
