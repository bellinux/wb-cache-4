40|$|At {{the peak}} of the {{financial}} crisis in October 2008, the IASB amended IAS 39 to grant companies the option of abandoning fair value recognition for <b>selected</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets.</b> Using a comprehensive global sample of publicly listed IFRS banks, we find that banks use the reclassification option to forgo the recognition of fair value losses and ultimately the regulatory costs of supervisory intervention. Analyses of stock market reactions suggest that a small subset of the most troubled banks benefit from such reclassifications. However, analyses of related footnote disclosures reveal that two-thirds of reclassifying banks do not fully comply with the accompanying IFRS 7 requirements. These banks experience a significant increase in bid-ask spreads in the long run. Bank Regulation, Fair Value Accounting, Financial Crisis, IAS 39, IFRS 7...|$|E
40|$|At {{the peak}} of the {{financial}} crisis in October 2008, the IASB was put under strong political pressure and allowed financial companies to suspend fair value accounting for <b>selected</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets.</b> Using a comprehensive global sample of publicly listed IFRS banks, we examine the economic consequences of this amendment to IAS 39. Our results suggest that the reclassification option produces both intended and unintended consequences. In the short-run, the amendment has served to provide relieve to most troubled banks avoiding fair value losses and ultimately regulatory costs from supervisory interventions. However, analyses of longterm effects on capital market show that the suspension of fair value measurement leads to a significant increase in information asymmetry, supporting claims that fair value measurement of financial assets provides useful information for capital markets...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurpose We will {{demonstrate}} {{the importance of}} taking into account reversion in asset prices and will show {{that this type of}} modeling leads to a high share of equities in pension funds' asset allocations. Design/methodology/approach Firstly, we will study the long-run statistical characteristics of <b>selected</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> during the 1895 - 2011 period. Such an analysis corroborates the fact that, for long holding periods, equities exhibit lower risk than other asset classes. Moreover, we will provide empirical evidence that stock market returns are negatively skewed in the short term, and show that this negative skewness vanishes over longer time horizons. Both these characteristics favor the use of a semi-parametric methodology. Findings Our empirical study led us to two major findings. Firstly, we noticed that the distribution of stock returns is negatively skewed over short time horizons. Secondly, we observed that the fat-tailed shape of the returns distribution disappears for time periods longer than five years. Finally, we demonstrated that stock returns exhibit -reversionĊonsequently the optimization program should not only take into account the non-Gaussian nature of returns in the short run, but also incorporate the speed at which volatility reverts to its long-run mean. Originality/value To simulate portfolio allocation, we used a CF VaR criterion with the advantage of providing an allocation that is independent of the saver’s preferences parameters. A backtesting analysis including a calculation of replacement rates shows a clear dominance of the “non-Gaussian” strategy, as the retirement outcomes under such a strategy would be positively affected...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{theoretical}} and empirical evidence for a relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and financial characteristics. An empirical analysis is performed to examine the Australian evidence for such a relationship, from a <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> perspective. CSP data provided by Corporate Monitor Pty. Ltd. {{are used in the}} analysis. Specifically, available measures of environmental, social and governance performance of 237 Australian companies are compared with <b>selected</b> <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> characteristics, including firm size, book-to-market value, financial performance and risk, covering the period between July 1997 and August 2003. Evidence of relationships is sought using bivariate correlations, group comparisons and multivariate regression models. The analysis allows for heterogeneity in CSP-financial characteristics relationships, related to firm size, trading history and industry. Findings indicate that governance performance is most strongly related to characteristics, followed by social performance, whereas environmental is in general not strongly or consistently related to financial characteristics. Very strong and consistent evidence is found of a negative relationship between risk and all categories of CSP, although such relationships are again strongest for corporate governance. Strong evidence is found of a positive relationship between financial performance and governance performance (and to a certain extent social-performance), which is concentrated among recently listed companies, large companies and constituents of an industry group containing banks, diversified financials, insurance companies and telecommunication companies. Environmental and social performance is found to be contingent on size and industry, whereas governance performance is found to be contingent predominantly on size. However, the causes of the relationships between environmental and social performance and size are suggested to be different from the causes of the relationships between governance performance and size...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{financial}} {{institutions in the}} country accept valuable asset (real estate and financial) as security for loans with greater preference for real estate. However, consequent upon rising cases of loan default and bad debt arising from non-performance of security assets and the attendant problems associated with sales of real estate, there is a gradual shift towards <b>financial</b> <b>assets.</b> Against this background, this paper examines the relative performance of real estate and <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> as security for loans {{with a view to}} ascertain whether or not the drift towards <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> is justified. Using a sample of Forty six transactions involving landed and <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> and test of difference between two population means, the study reveals that although, the banks still prefer <b>financial</b> <b>asset,</b> however, both real estate and <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> provided cover for the secured loans but real estate has a superior performance on the long run.

40|$|In this paper, we try {{to build}} an {{efficient}} portfolio among four possible portfolios based on the some 31 Casablanca listed shares. Our analysis concerns the risk which arises from the Markowitz mean-variance approach. Our work method will be implemented as following: first of all, we will test the normality and the stationarity of 31 shares which have composed our sample; secondly we will review a theoretical literature about the optimal portfolio choices (based on the Markowitz mean-variance analysis). Thirdly and related to the practical part, we enumerate and emphasize the steps {{that lead to the}} construction of efficient portfolio. The presented modelling is used in order to optimally allocate the <b>selected</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets.</b> The different methods of measurement of return, risk and the other statistical properties constitute, in fact, the pillars of companies sample listed analysis in the case of Casablanca Stock Exchange. Our purpose ends with the assets selection which allows us to choose the efficient portfolio. The selection process of efficient portfolio can be summarized in the following stages: the collection of data to be able to constitute our sample; the estimation of returns, of beta sensibility coefficients and risky assets of investment; the selection of efficient and profitable assets according to some criteria; the weighting coefficients allocation presenting the efficient border of portfolios. In this article and under the choice of companies sample composing our portfolios, we shall take into account, the shares monthly returns, the rate of dispersal around the average of returns, the covariance between assets (degree of interdependence between assets) and the type of sector that each company sets up (in order to highlight an analysis based on a disparity in achievement yields). ...|$|E
40|$|The first essay {{explores the}} dynamic {{behaviors}} of mortgage-backed stock returns and their volatility spillovers {{within the framework}} of time-varying symmetric, asymmetric and multivariate GARCH-family models. The focus of the chapter is on the dynamics of volatility of the U. S. real estate investment trusts (REITs) and volatility spillovers within the REITs subdivisions as well as between the REITs and the Fannie Mae (FNM) and theFreddie Mac (FRE) mortgage-backed stocks. We analyze risk-return linkages using the GARCH-in-mean (GARCH-M) model. The presence of asymmetric effects of 2 ̆ 2 bad 2 ̆ 2 news and 2 ̆ 2 good 2 ̆ 2 news on conditional financial volatilities is evaluated using the Threshold ARCH (TARCH) model and the exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model. Volatility spillovers and comovements within REITs subdivisions; REITs with FNM and FRE and other <b>selected</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> are examined using the multivariate GARCH (MGARCH) model. The second essay investigates factors behind the existence of time-varying conditional volatilities of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). This is done by analyzing the impacts of economic volatilities on mortgage-backed financial markets 2 ̆ 7 performance. The relationship between conditional volatilities of the MBS and conditional volatilities of the key economic fundamentals in the housing sector and the macroeconomy are explored. The sensitivity of mortgage-backed stocks to the underlying time-series changes in economic fundamentals, {{and the extent to which}} economic volatilities explain the variation in mortgage-backed stocks 2 ̆ 7 volatilities are investigated. Particularly, we examined whether changes in the REITs, FNM and FRE volatilities are linked to and driven by time-varying volatilities of the housing sector economic activity and set of key macroeconomic variables. Thus, the chapter analyzes the impacts of conditional economic volatilities on the conditional volatilities of the REITs, FRE and FNM stocks. The GARCH (p, q) process is used to find conditional volatility dynamics for the economic variables in the study. Then we employ multivariate GARCH (p, q) model to investigate the spillovers and comovements among the conditional economic fundamentals 2 ̆ 7 volatilities and the conditional volatilities of the MBS. The third essay explores the impacts of foreign sector of the economy on the mortgage-backed financial markets and the housing sector. There is large surge of foreign capital flows to the U. S, particularly since late 1990 s. The net foreign holdings of U. S. financial assets have become very significant in the U. S. Treasury notes and bonds. Foreign investors also hold a growing share of securities of the U. S. agencies and government sponsored enterprises (GSEs). Similarly, foreign direct investment in the U. S. real estate as well as real estate equities in the form of REITs has grown sharply. To this end, a multivariate vector autoregression (VAR) model is the main tool of analysis. Based on the VAR model, generalized impulse response functions and generalized variance decompositions are employed to evaluate the responses of mortgage interest rates and Treasury yields to the changes in net foreign ownership of U. S. Treasuries and agency bonds...|$|E

40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on the {{so-called}} “asset meltdown hypothesis”, which postulates a direct link between demographic developments {{and the level of}} asset prices.

Revisiting this hypothesis, there is some support for a link between demographics and <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices, although the link may not be strong. A number of mitigating factors exist, so that “other things” will not be equal. A major question in this context is to what extent demographic developments and their implications for other variables affecting <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices are already reflected in <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices and how fast any additional pressures on <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices will play themselves out. ...|$|R
