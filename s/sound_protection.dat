40|$|International audienceExponentiation over {{a finite}} {{group is a}} central {{operation}} for most public key cryptosystems. It is used extensively in the generation/verification of electronic signatures (e. g. using DSA or its elliptic curve variant) and in the encryption/decryption phases of RSA or (EC) DL-based algorithms. In general, data manipulated during these computations should be kept secret, as even {{a small amount of}} information may be maliciously exploited by an attacker, for example for forging one’s signature or for acquiring some confidential information. Over the past fifteen years, an extensive variety of constant-time, highly regular exponentiation algorithms have been proposed.

40|$|Abstract. Emerging {{applications}} such as the Internet of Things require security solutions that are small and low cost, yet feature solid protection against {{a wide range of}} sophisticated attacks. Lightweight cryptographic schemes such as the Speck cipher that was recently proposed by the NSA aim to solve some of these challenges. However, before using Speck in any practical application, <b>sound</b> <b>protection</b> against side-channel attacks must be in place. In this work, we propose a bit-serialized implemen-tation of Speck, to achieve minimal area footprint. We further propose a Speck core that is provably secure against first-order side-channel at-tacks using a threshold implementation technique which depends on se-cure multiparty computation. The resulting design is a tiny crypto core that provides AES-like security in under 45 slices on a low-cost Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA. The first-order side-channel resistant version of the same core needs less than 100 slices. The security of the protected core is validated by state-of-the-art side-channel leakage detection tests. ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} method is to achieve fast and <b>sound</b> <b>protection</b> against accidental and intentional contaminate injection into the water distribution system. The method is achieved first by properly imposing a sliding window onto simultaneously updated online monitoring data collected by the automated spectrometer. The PPCA algorithm is then executed to simplify {{the large amount of}} spectrum data while maintaining the necessary spectral information to the largest extent. Finally, a monitoring chart extensively employed in fault diagnosis field methods is used here to search for potential anomaly events and to determine whether the current water-quality is normal or abnormal. A small-scale water-pipe distribution network is tested to detect water contamination events. The tests demonstrate that the PPCA-based online monitoring model can achieve satisfactory results under the ROC curve, which denotes a low false alarm rate and high probability of detecting water contamination events...|$|E

Six groups of male Wistar rats were employed in this study, wherein five groups were fed with a high cholesterol diet (stock diet supplemented with 1 % cholesterol) for 30 days, among which, two groups of rats were also treated with EPA-DHA rich sterol ester in two doses (25 and 50 mg/rat/day, oral gavage) and two groups were treated with ALA rich sterol ester also in two doses (25 and 50 mg/rat/day, oral gavage). The remaining one group served as control. Abnormal increases in the levels of malondialdehyde, as well as depressed antioxidants status, were observed in hepatic tissue of hypercholesterolemic control group. Hypercholesterolemia induced abnormal elevation in the activities of marker enzymes in liver (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and alkaline phosphatase) and was accompanied by increased hepatic cholesterol level and altered fatty changes in the histology of liver. These changes were restored partially in the groups administered with lower doses (25 mg/rat/day) of sterol esters. However, the higher doses (50 mg/rat/day) of sterol esters almost ameliorated the hypercholesterolemic-oxidative changes in the hypercholesterolemic rats.

40|$|Serious {{environmental}} problems are {{emerging in the}} River Nile basin and its groundwater resources. Recent years have brought scientific evidence of climate change and development-induced environmental impacts globally as well as over Egypt. Some impacts are subtle, like decline of the Nile River water levels, others are dramatic like the salinization of all coastal land in the Nile Delta – the agricultural engine of Egypt. These consequences have become a striking reality causing a set of interconnected groundwater management problems. Massive population increase that overwhelmed the Nile Delta region has amplified the problem. Many researchers have studied these problems from different perspectives using different methodologies, following different objectives and, consequently, arrived at different findings. However, they all confirmed that significant groundwater salinization has affected the Nile Delta and {{this is likely to}} become worse rapidly in the future. This article presents, categorizes and critically analyses and synthesizes the most relevant research regarding climate change and development challenges in relation to groundwater resources in the Nile Delta. It is shown that there is a gap in studies that focus on sustainable groundwater resources development and environmentally <b>sound</b> <b>protection</b> as an integrated regional process in Nile Delta. Moreover, there is also a knowledge gap related to the deterioration of groundwater quality.

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of {{building}} acoustics is the prediction of airborne sound insulation between rooms to determine the quality of <b>sound</b> <b>protection.</b> In many practical cases, however, the objective measures of the airborne sound insulation using procedures in standards are not {{in agreement with the}} subjective assessment. This paper, therefore, after reviewing the conventional model to calculate airborne sound insulation, introduces a calculation scheme based on loudness level linked with specific fluctuation strength, yielding a weighted normalised loudness level difference, Lnor,w. By analysing the difference between standard airborne sound insulation values and the introduced weighted normalised loudness level difference, it is revealed that the sound pressure level that is transmitted through a partition decreases with increasing frequency, and this is independent of the type of signal and of the airborne sound insulation values (View the MathML source-values), whereas if the transmitted signal is converted into a loudness level, it tends to rise with increasing frequency. Moreover, it is found that, whereas a simple level difference does not exhibit the effect of a given signal to the frequency-dependent airborne sound insulation curve, using Lnor,w, a significant change can be observed, in terms of both computed and measured results. Furthermore, the frequency-dependent results allow more details to be investigated for a certain sound insulation. A comparison between the measured and predicted airborne sound insulation with no obvious malfunction suggests that at some frequency ranges, a hypothetical subjective related failure might occur. Overall, the proposed Lnor,w could reveal detailed insights into the in situ measured airborne sound insulation compared with standard airborne sound insulation values. The frequency-dependent values discussed in this paper form a basis for developing a single-number index...|$|E

Without clear diagnostic criteria, it is difficult to compare the results of these studies, as the inclusion criteria for the patient group differ between the studies. This thesis is a review of articles about tests of Eustachian tube function. Methods: Literature review of articles about Eustachian tube function tests. Search performed in PubMed in April 2016, 1229 abstracts were reviewed and 129 articles included in the thesis. All articles with a test of ET function and clear methodology were included, as well as review papers. Results: 129 articles on several types of tests were evaluated. The included papers had limitations. The methods were often either complicated or too simplified. Few authors list bias or test accuracy. The instruments described were not always commercially available. There are tests that can diagnose tuba aperta with a high level of sensitivity and specificity, but there currently exists no gold standard test in the diagnosis of Eustachian tube dysfunction. Promising new tools include the Eustachian tube dysfunction questionnaire (ETDQ- 7) and the Eustachian tube score (ETS- 7). Conclusion: There is no gold standard on diagnosing Eustachian tube dysfunction, but tuba aperta can in most cases be diagnosed with a simple test battery. In Eustachian tube dysfunction, several tests need to be combined to increase the accuracy of diagnosis until further research is conducted...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and migration {{patterns of the}} fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) in the Mediterranean Sea are largely unknown. This species is mostly at risk of ship strike, it is therefore essential to develop synoptic tools to derive its habitat at large scale. We describe a foraging habitat model for fin whales in the western Mediterranean Sea relying on species ecology for the choice of predictors. The selected environmental variables are direct and resource predictors available at daily and large scales. The feeding habitat was mainly processed from the simultaneous occurrence of large oceanic fronts of satellite-derived sea surface chlorophyll content (CHL) and temperature (SST). A specific range of surface chlorophyll content (0. 11 - 0. 39 mg m- 3) and a minimum water depth (93 m) were also identified to be important regional criteria. Daily maps were calibrated and evaluated against independent sets of geo-located fin whale presence data. The main predictor of feeding environment was specific CHL fronts, therefore the derived habitat is potential and functionally-linked. The model performs well with 80 % of presence data closer than 8. 8 km of the predicted potential habitat. The computed monthly, seasonal and annual maps of potential feeding habitat from 2000 to 2010 generally correlate with current knowledge on fin whale ecology. Overall, the size of potential habitat of fin whales is ca. 11 % of the western Mediterranean Sea surface and seasonal recurrent areas were clearly shown. The results also displayed a strong seasonality in habitat size and locations as well as high year-to-year variations (40 % to 50 %), which is essential to assess migration patterns and suggest <b>sound</b> <b>protection</b> measures.

Differences in energy structures, geographical settings and regional climate features lead to a large variety {{of air pollution}} sources from place to place. To understand the seasonality of air pollution sources is critical to precise emission inventories and a <b>sound</b> <b>protection</b> of human health. Based on a year-round dataset, the sources of PAHs in the air of Guangzhou were drawn by principal factor analysis (PCA) in combination with diagnostic ratios, and the seasonality of these sources were analyzed by PCA/MLR (multiple linear regressions) and discussed. The average total gaseous and particulate PAHs concentrations were 313 and 23. 7 ng m- 3, respectively, with a higher concentration of vapor PAHs in summer and particulate PAHs in winter. In addition to vehicle exhaust, which contributed 69 % of the particulate PAHs, coal combustion was still an important source and contributed 31 % of the particulate PAHs. Relatively constant contribution from coal combustion was found through the year, implying that coal combustion in power plants was not a seasonally dependent source. Evaporation from contaminated ground {{may be an important}} source of light PAHs in summer, providing an average contribution of 68 % to the total PAHs in this study. By comparing the PAH concentrations and meteorological parameters, we found that higher concentrations of particulate PAHs in winter resulted from enhanced vehicle exhaust under low temperature and accumulation of pollutants under decreased boundary layer, slower wind speed, and long-term dryness conditions. It is suggested that the typical subtropical monsoon climate in South China, cool and dry in winter, hot and humid in summer, may {{play a key role in}} controlling the source seasonality (by enhancing vehicle exhaust in winter, ground evaporation in summer), and hence the ambient concentrations of PAHs in the air.
