Entitlement to paid holidays was also extended from four to five weeks.

In England and Wales by 2000 pubs could legally open from 11am (12 noon on Sundays) through to 11pm (10:30pm on Sundays). That year {{was also the first}} to allow continuous opening for 36 hours from 11am on New Year's Eve to 11pm on New Year's Day. In addition, many cities had by-laws to allow some pubs to extend opening hours to midnight or 1am, whilst nightclubs had long been granted late licences to serve alcohol into the morning. Pubs near London's Smithfield market, Billingsgate fish market and Covent Garden fruit and flower market could stay open 24 hours a day since Victorian times to provide a service to the <b>shift</b> <b>working</b> employees of the markets.|$|E
2500|$|Work {{hours and}} sleep loss {{were shown to}} impact {{performance}} in a [...] evaluation by Rogers et al. A total of 393 registered nurses logged scheduled hours worked, actual hours worked, time of day worked, overtime, days off, and sleep/wake patterns. Questions concerning errors and near-errors were also included. Analysis showed that work duration, overtime, and number of hours worked per week significantly affected the number of errors. The likelihood of making an error increased with longer work hours, and was three times higher when the nurses worked shifts lasting 12.5 hours or more. Working overtime increased the odds of making at least one error, regardless of the originally scheduled length of the <b>shift.</b> <b>Working</b> more than 40 and more than 50 hours per week significantly increased the risk of making an error.|$|E

The review makes clear that there are strong differences between child psychopathological groups and controls on these EFs.
