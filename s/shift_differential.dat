40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 48) Shift differentials are {{a form of}} bonus typically paid {{to employees}} who work "premium" shifts such as evenings (3 PM- 11 PM) and nights (11 PM- 7 AM). This practice was introduced in hospitals when individual organizations began to {{find it difficult to}} recruit and place prospective employees for night and evening coverage, and now payment of <b>shift</b> <b>differential</b> is commonplace in hospitals in the San Fernando Valley. An inflationary economy, rapid changes in technology, spiraling costs, and shortages in many allied health resources, have forced many hospitals to compete for declining employee resources by providing more attractive benefits, employment bonuses, and even larger shift differentials for employees working night and evening shifts in an attempt to attract and retain qualified personnel. Consequently, increased demand for allied health professionals has led to a gradual escalation of salary and incentive programs directed at employee recruitment and placement. Concern over the increasing use of shift differentials and bonuses inspired one local hospital to more closely review the uses and effects of shift differentials in an attempt to gain greater insight into the need for shift differentials and the effectiveness of dollar oriented bonuses in the placement and retention of night duty personnel. A study was implemented to survey prevailing administrative attitudes in area hospitals relative to the need for shift differentials, and a second survey of registered nurses in a local hospital was conducted to identify the effect shift differentials have on the recruitment, placement and longevity of night nursing personnel. Study results, although not conclusive, seem to indicate that payment of <b>shift</b> <b>differential</b> is necessary due to the reduced supply of and increasing demand for qualified personnel in the labor market, as well as increased inter-institutional competition for available resources. This was observed even though night nurses ranked dollar oriented incentives secondary to job oriented motivators in the selection of night duty. Based on preliminary study, it was concluded that hospitals should not discontinue use of shift differentials, but should explore alternative incentives that will improve the quality of the job...|$|E

Based on a fourteen-month study of Kenyan manufacturing, the basic question of the thesis is: why should rational entrepreneurs capital which, they plan to use for less than the maximum number of hours per week. Two behavioural models are examined: the <b>shift</b> <b>differential</b> model, in which it is assumed that here are extra costs associated with operating outside normal daytime working hours to be weighed off against the savings in capital cost, gained by using capital more hours; and the minimim size of plant model, which assumes that one cannot buy less than a certain amount of capital, and because of limits on the demand for output, the firm's chosen output is less than the output of the capital when used the maximum number of hours. The major conclusion learnt in Kenyan utilisation rates and therefore the ratios of output and labour to capita stock are sensitive to the factor-price ratio even in the case where coefficients are fixed ex ante and ex post. In the case of the minimum siae of plant model, the most important reason for market limitation is trade policy which favours import substitutes and discourages exports...|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{compensating}} differentials asserts that night shift workers should receive compensating wage differentials due to undesirable work conditions. In weak local economies, workers {{may have difficulty}} finding jobs; thus, these workers might {{be more likely to}} accept night shift work and be less concerned with the size of the compensating differential for night shifts. Using CPS data from 2001, this paper employs maximum likelihood estimation of an endogenous switching regression model to analyze wages of day and night shift workers and shift choice. The findings indicate the presence of selection bias, thus emphasizing the importance of correcting for self-selection into night shifts. The average of the estimated wage differentials for night shift work is negative for the overall sample, with differentials varying by worker characteristics. The <b>shift</b> <b>differential</b> is found to be a statistically significant predictor of shift choice, indicating that shift premiums {{play an important role in}} motivating individuals to select night shift work. Using two measures of local economic conditions and a new method of analyzing interaction effects in the context of an endogenous switching regression model, this paper finds limited evidence that weak local economic conditions lessen the impact of compensating differentials on shift choice...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the nucleon-nucleon interaction {{by using the}} meson exchange model and the two body Dirac equations of constraint dynamics. This approach to the two body problem has been successfully tested for QED and QCD relativistic bound states. An important question we wish to address {{is whether or not}} the two body nucleon-nucleon scattering problem can be reasonably described in this approach as well. This test involves a number of related problems. First we must reduce our two body Dirac equations exactly to a Schrödingerlike equation in such a way that allows us to use techniques to solve our two body Dirac equations already developed for Schrödinger-like systems in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Related to this we present a new derivation of Calogero’s variable phase <b>shift</b> <b>differential</b> equation for coupled Schrödinger-like equations. Then we determine if the use of nine meson exchanges in our two body Dirac equations give a reasonable fit to the experimental scattering phase shifts for n − p scattering. The data involves seven angular momentum states including the singlet states 1 S 0, 1 P 1, 1 D 2 and the triplet states 3 P 0, 3 P 1, 3 S 1, 3 D 1. Two models that we have tested give us a fairly good fit. The parameters obtained by fitting the n − p experimental scattering phase shift give a fairly good prediction for most of the p − p experimental scattering phase shifts examined (for the singlet states 1 S 0, 1 D 2 and triplet states 3 P 0, 3 P 1). Thus the two body Dirac equations of constraint dynamics presents us with a fit that encourages the exploration of a more realistic model. We outline generalizations of the meson exchange model for invariant potentials that may possibly improve the fit. 1...|$|E

40|$|Conversion of {{historical}} tomodern forest management regimes can have profound effects on understorey diversity and composition, because overstorey changes affect environmental {{conditions in the}} herbaceous layer. Management-driven changes (1957 / 1967 – 2005) in the overstorey of two temperate, deciduous forests generated nine conversion types {{in a set of}} 255 semi-permanent plots formerly managed as coppice-with-standards. Dominant canopy cover shifted from the shrub to the tree layer in all conversion types. Tree and shrub richness decreased significantly for most conversion types. Differences in forest structure (uneven-aged vs. even-aged), changes in litter quality and overstorey permeability for light characterised each conversion. We determined temporal changes in herb layer cover, species richness and Shannon–Wiener diversity for each conversion. We tested if herbaceous species composition for each conversion type changed between 1957 / 1967 and 2005 in terms of among plot variability in species composition (multivariate dispersion) and directional changes in average composition (composition <b>shift).</b> <b>Differential</b> changes in richness, cover, litter quality and shade casting ability of the overstorey were related to changes in herb layer species or ecological groups of species across conversions. Total herb layer cover increased (mainly related to Anemone nemorosa, Hyacinthoides non-scripta or Rubus fruticosus agg.), except where Beech was planted on poor soils. Richness increased where litter quality increased and decreased only on strongly shaded poor soils. Decreased/increased multivariate dispersion coincided with decreased/increased richness and Shannon–Wiener diversity. Furthermore, only conversions to even-aged stands, except for Oak on poor soils, had strong composition shifts which were reflected by an increase of indifferent/acidophilous species and species with wide amplitude. For gradual conversions to uneven-aged high forest, the edaphic changes caused by altered overstorey composition were reflected in the understorey. In the absence of incentives to reinitiate traditional management, conserving the understorey community is best achieved by a continuation of former overstorey species composition and unevenaged high forest management. Beech plantations caused strong and negative effects, but as it is a climax species, Beech could still be used in spatiotemporal mixtures with soil improving species. Favouring or introducing the latter species can improve edaphic conditions of acid-sensitive poor soils due to their high-litter quality. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Libraries and Information Centres 2 ̆ 7 {{services}} in Nigeria are being regarded as humanitarian services and therefore issue of compensation and benefits {{are not well}} defined. However, other forms of financial assistance embedded in the Nigeria civil service rule include things like Monetization, National Health Insurance Scheme, Contributory Pension, and Pension Benefits; all of which staff of Libraries and Information Centres also benefit from. Aside this is the Annual Appraisal Form (Aperform) that contains basic requirements expected of an employee before he can be promoted. Nigerian Universities also makes use of this to assess staff {{in order to determine}} their remuneration as at when due. For corporate body organizations where special libraries and information centres form part of the organization, compensation and benefits will depend on the annual appraisal or job satisfaction based on criteria spell out in their organization 2 ̆ 7 s handbook. Evaluation forms also contains inter alia: what you are expected to do according to your job descriptions, your relationship with staff, creativity, sense of direction, delegation of duty, which will be rated as either fair, good, very good, satisfactory and excellence. All these indices hinges on employees 2 ̆ 7 performances. Though an employer compensates his employee with motivation and benefits based on job performance, there is need for job satisfaction. Every employer expects certain degree of result oriented services that would fall in line with his vision and mission while every employee demands job satisfaction. Ordinarily, the management of people at work {{is an integral part of}} the management process, put differently, managers need to understand the critical importance of people in their organizations so as to recognize that the human element and the organization are synonymous (Tella, Adeyemi, and Popoola, 2007) Therefore, it is imperative to compensate an employee with benefits if he merits it. Cascio (2003) opines that because of the importance that compensation holds for people 2 ̆ 7 s lifestyle and self esteem, individuals are very concerned about what they are paid – a fair and competitive wage, while organizations are also concerned about what they pay because it motivates important decisions of employees about taking a job, leaving a job and on the job performance. Compensation as a concept according to (Bernadin, 2007) refers to all forms of financial returns and tangible benefits that employee receives as part of employment relationship. Compensation as it were is divided into two parts and these are cash compensation which is the direct pay provided by employer for work performed by the employee and fringe compensation which refers to employee benefit programs. Cash compensation has two elements which include base pay and pay contingent. Base pay has to do with hourly or weekly wages plus overtime pay, <b>shift</b> <b>differential</b> and uniform allowance while pay contingent is concerned with performance allowances such as merit increases, incentive pay bonuses and gain sharing. Fringe compensation on the other hand refers to employee benefits programs. Fringe compensation also has two parts to it which are legally required benefit programs and discretional benefits. Legally required benefit programs include social security, workers compensation while discretional programs include health benefits, pension plans, paid time off, tuition reimbursement, recognition award, foreign service premiums, responsibility allowance, child care, on campus accommodation, promotion, annual increment and a host of others (Cascio, 2003; Dessler, 2005; Bernadin, 2007). Benefits, in a nutshell are the indirect financial and non financial payments employees receive for continuing their employment with an organization. The concept of employee compensation and benefits cannot be discussed in a vacuum. Various studies have established that salaries and benefits are closely related to job satisfaction (St. Lifer, 1994); and job satisfaction can bring about motivation which in turn affects employee job performance and organizational commitment...|$|E
