25|$|The IPL line {{fundamentally}} {{changed the}} pricing of Alberta oil {{to make it}} sensitive to international rather than regional factors. The wellhead price reflected {{the price of oil}} at Sarnia, less pipeline tolls for shipping it there. IPL is by far the longest crude oil pipeline in the western hemisphere. Looping, or constructing additional lines beside the original, expanded the Interprovincial system and allowed its extension into the American midwest and to upstate New York. In 1976, it was 3,680 kilometres through an extension to Montreal. Although it helped assure <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> in the 1970s, the extension became a threat to Canadian oil producers after deregulation in 1985. With Montreal refineries using cheaper imported oil, there was concern within the industry that a proposal to use the line to bring foreign oil into Sarnia might undermine traditional markets for Western Canadian petroleum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{examined}} a mangrove ecosystem in northern Taiwan {{to determine how}} the various components of ecosystem function, ecosystem services and human wellbeing are connected. The overall contributions of mangrove services to specific components of human wellbeing were also assessed. A network was developed and evaluated by an expert panel consisting of hydrologists, ecologists, and experts in the field of culture, landscape or architecture. The results showed that supporting habitats was the most important function to human wellbeing, while water quality, habitable climate, air quality, recreational opportunities, and knowledge systems were services that were strongly linked to human welfare. <b>Security</b> <b>of</b> continuous <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> services appeared to be the key to a comfortable life. From a bottom-up and top-down perspective, knowledge systems (a service) were most supported by ecosystem functions, while the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> continuous <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> services (wellbeing) had affected the most services. In addition, the overall benefits of mangrove services to human prosperity concentrated on mental health, <b>security</b> <b>of</b> continuous <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> services, and physical health...|$|R
25|$|The {{price of}} Neodymium {{went through a}} price bubble due to Chinese export {{restriction}} in 2010–11, rising from $50/kg {{at the start of}} 2010 to $500/kg by the summer of 2011. This resulted in 'demand destruction' as many producers quickly turned to substituting induction motors in their cars to defend their production line. This was in spite of such motors inferior 'power to weight' ratio attributes significantly impacting all but the most powerful (energy guzzling) motor sizes, e.g. those used in the Tesla. As of April 2014 there are other non-Chinese producers of Neodymium and its price/kg is not much more than it was in 2010. Cutting edge U.K. motors that are now being produced are using Neodymium Permanent Magnet technology. As <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> returns, it is certain that there will accordingly be a return to superior motor designs that NdFeB Permanent Magnets enable.|$|E

2500|$|Ireland {{relies on}} {{imported}} fossil fuels for over 80% of its energy. [...] Ireland {{for many years}} in the middle twentieth century limited its dependence on external energy sources by developing its peat bogs, building various hydroelectric projects, including a dam at Ardnacrusha on the River Shannon in 1928, developing offshore gas fields, and diversifying into coal in the 1970s. As gas, peat, and hydroelectric power have been almost fully exploited in Ireland, there is a continuously increasing need for imported fossil fuels at a time of increasing concerns about <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and global warming. One solution is to develop alternative energy sources, including wind power and, to a lesser extent, wave power. Wind,however, is not a panacea as it needs to have conventional plants to augment it.|$|E
40|$|Recent oil and {{gas price}} rises coupled with Russia – Ukraine gas supply interruptions have again {{focussed}} attention on <b>security</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>supply.</b> <b>Security</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>supply</b> {{is not always a}} well-defined or understood term. It is a multi-faceted phenomenon and may be classified in terms of physical (quantity) risks and price (economic) risks. It may also be treated in different timeframes, with short-term risks typically having different characteristics and impacts than long-term risks. This paper investigates the issues associated with <b>security</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>supply</b> using Ireland a case study for the analysis. The focus is on the electricity rather than thermal or transport energy markets. This provides a direct linkage to renewable energy policy, which in Ireland has been concentrated principally on in creasing renewable energy penetration in the electricity market. This in turn results in the focus of this paper being on <b>security</b> <b>of</b> gas <b>supply,</b> as gas is account for 72 % of Ireland’s electricity generation fuel mix in 2020. The paper examines a number of concerns regarding the existing gas supply system and explores options to address these. These include the short term risks associated with the single point of failure on the Scottish Interconnector and low pressure gas supply in the Cork area. The long term issues are linked to the increasing geographical concentration from which imports are drawn coupled with delays in harnessing the gas from the Corrib Gas Field. While options do exist for improving the gas supply infrastructure, a key component <b>of</b> improving Ireland’s <b>security</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>supply</b> is the increased penetration of renewable energy, in particular wind energy in the short term. The key advantages of renewable energy in this regard are related to the indigenous nature of renewable resources and that absence of fuel price volatility...|$|R

Part I deals with the quantitative and objective approach that attempts to measure aspects <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>supply</b> to identify threats and vulnerabilities as well as set benchmarks and create inventories. Part II deals with international relations theory and elaborates on two worldviews, Regions and Empires and Market and Institutions, which influence the perception of threats {{and the role of}} actors. Part III integrates the objective and subjective approaches and identifies how the worldview can influence the design or interpretation of quantitative metrics.

2500|$|Due to the {{uncertainty}} over renegotiation of contracts, foreign firms have practically stopped {{investing in the}} gas sector. Foreign investment virtually came to a standstill {{in the second half}} of 2005. Shortages in supply [...] – very similar to those observed in Argentina after the 2001 price-fixing – are deepening in diesel, LPG, and begin to be apparent in natural gas. The May–June social unrest affected the supply of hydrocarbons products to the internal market, principally LPG and natural gas to the occidental region. Brazil implemented a contingency plan – led by the Energy and Mines Minister – to mitigate any potential impact from gas export curtailment. Although the supply was never curtailed, the social unrest in Bolivia created a strong sensation that <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> could not be guaranteed.

If it receives less (between 254mm and 762mm), 2 or 3 of these 300 gallon tanks can be placed (so that more rain can be gathered at times when it does rain). Also affecting tank size is predicted rainfall and rainfall variability; the higher prices for larger tanks; intended use of rainwater and typical consumption for these uses; the area of roof draining into the tank; <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> desired.|$|E
