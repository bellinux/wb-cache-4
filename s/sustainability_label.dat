30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to empirically apply and test the TAM as a basis to explain how PEOU and PU are {{associated}} with consumer’s Att toward use of <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> and PI. This study also identifies whether consumers who currently use sustainability labels (“label users”) as part of purchasing decisions exhibit higher PEOU, PU, Att, and PI than non-users. In this study, <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> users are defined as those who have used a <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> when they shop. Lastly, this study investigates whether or not the different path relationships exist between <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> users and non-users in regard to their acceptance of sustainability labels.|$|E
30|$|Finally, the {{relationships}} among the research variables in the path model were further compared between <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> users and non-users. Findings from multi-group path model comparison analysis revealed that the roles of PEOU and PU in determining Att and PI of a sustainability labelled apparel product were not different {{whether or not they}} were a <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> user. As discussed above, although they have different level of PEOU, PU, Att and PI across groups, there was no difference between <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> users and non-users in how those perceptions shaped Att and PI. Overall, the findings provide evidence of the applicability of TAM to this specific research context. Moreover, the model invariance provides empirical support for the critical roles that PEOU and PU of sustainability labels exhibited in shaping positive Att and greater PI of a sustainability labelled apparel product, whether they are active <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> users or not.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sustainability</b> <b>labeling</b> {{originated}} from {{a need to}} protect the identity of alternative systems of food production and to increase market transparency. From the 1980 s onwards <b>sustainability</b> <b>labeling</b> has changed into a policy instrument replacing direct government regulation of the food market, and a marketing instrument to raise consumer demand and competition in conventional and mainstream retail channels. These different functions of <b>sustainability</b> <b>labeling</b> originate from theoretically distinct conceptions {{of the market and}} represent radical different conceptions of the information. Market transparency is based on descriptive information, government regulation on normative information, and marketing on persuasive or strategic information. The combination of these different informational demands reduces the effectiveness of existing <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels.</b> In order to fulfill these different functions effectively a different conception of <b>sustainability</b> <b>labeling</b> schemes is required...|$|R
30|$|While {{information}} contained in <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> can help consumers and marketers alike, challenges exist. Consumers’ increased interest in environmentally and socially friendly products has been predicted to be a precursor {{to the growth of}} <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> in the marketplace (Case 2009), but the presence of multiple labels with unclear meanings can be challenging for consumers to interpret and may ultimately create a barrier to purchases. Consumers have reported confusion with the <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> “EU Eco-Label,” although the label had been supported with educational campaigns for many years (Horne 2009). Additionally, some consumers distrust the <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels.</b> British consumers expressed scepticism of fair trade clothing labels and asked for more objective, credible proof of environmentally and socially sound practices (Goworek et al. 2012).|$|R
30|$|Findings {{confirmed}} all {{paths in}} TAM, revealing that PEOU and PU are affirmative predictors of favourable Att toward {{the use of}} the label, which, in conjunction with PU, determined greater willingness to purchase a <b>sustainability</b> <b>labelled</b> apparel product. Consumers’ self-efficacy related variables, such as how consumers perceive the <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> that are often filled with technical symbols and jargons in terms of competence and usefulness, are significant to understand in order to comprehend and predict their responses on the labels for the purchase decision making process. A consumer will use <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> when the labels are easy to understand and useful. The findings are also consistent with those of previous studies that examined the use of new technology in apparel shopping (Cho and Wang 2010; Kim et al. 2009; Kim and Forsythe 2008). Therefore, the new approach with TAM variables establishes an important contribution to the <b>sustainability</b> <b>labelling</b> in apparel products.|$|R

30|$|This study {{examined}} the difference in adoption of sustainability labels for apparel products between <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> users and non-users. When a new technology is introduced, there are individuals who adopt the technology at the early stage; it is these early adopters who often {{support the use of}} innovations (Rogers 1983). In this study, it was found that <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> users demonstrated higher levels of PEOU, PU, Att, and PI of a sustainability labelled apparel product than those who have never used sustainability labels before. The results indicated that consumer’s label usage experiences (i.e., <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> users vs. non-users) are related to their current label use and perceived ease of, Att toward and intentions to use sustainability labels.|$|E
30|$|These studies {{support the}} general use of <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> but point to further {{questions}} to be answered if effectiveness is to be increased. A deeper understanding of impetuses for and intentions for consumers to purchase apparel with <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> can help business marketers and managers tailor their sustainability messages {{in ways that will}} appeal to their target customer and encourage purchase.|$|R

30|$|This study {{approached}} label reading behaviour as {{a process}} of using a new media for the decision making process. As such, TAM (Davis et al. 1989) was applied and tested to the research context of <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> by viewing label using behaviour as similar to the way consumers use new sources of technology. The selection of this model is appropriate as two specific beliefs in TAM, PEOU and PU, were explored to see how they determine consumer Att and PI associated with <b>sustainability</b> <b>labelled</b> apparel products. The TAM model suggests that PU and PEOU are preceding variables to increase the efficacy of the label. Consumers today often experience information “overload,” which can influence purchase decisions in both positive and negative ways, depending on the context. Acquiring sustainability information on a label requires further effort in a consumer’s thought process to purchase apparel products. As current criticisms of existing <b>sustainability</b> <b>labelling</b> include credibility, consistency and uniformity, understanding how consumers approach to <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> as an information acquiring tool is vital.|$|R

Empirical studies reported that consumers have struggled with understanding {{information on}} {{the different types of}} sustainability labels in making a responsible purchase (D’Souza 2004; Horne 2009). Therefore, it would be meaningful to explore the role of PEOU in the context of <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> usage behaviours, positing the following hypotheses: [...]...|$|E
40|$|Several product labels provide {{information}} to the consumer on different product characteristics. Nowadays, a huge variety of labels give information on ecological and/or social aspects of products. Unfortunately, only {{some aspects of the}} product 9 ̆ 2 s sustainability are represented by those labels. Most of them are mere 9 ̆ 3 Eco-labels 9 ̆ 4, discounting social aspects, aspects of quality, or of life cycle costing. A 9 ̆ 3 Sustainability-label 9 ̆ 4, addressing all aspects of sustainability, does not yet exist. The potential of a <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> {{was the subject of a}} study commissioned by the German Federal Ministry of nutrition, agriculture and consumer protection. Four different conceptual approaches have been identified in the framework of this study that would be applicable to a broad(er) set of product groups. The following article summarises the findings of this study. First, a review of the most important background information on labelling is given, resulting from the analysis of scientific conceptual approaches to sustainable labelling and a broad survey of existent national and international product labelling schemes. Furthermore, the need for an overarching <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> is exemplified on the basis of three case studies. The three selected domains for these case studies were food, toys and financial investments. Then, the requirements a <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> has to fulfil and the identified conceptual approaches of a <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> are described. The weaknesses and strengths of all approaches are discussed before general recommendations are made...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} young people’s {{awareness of}} and attitudes towards environmental <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> on food products {{as a basis}} for suggesting recommendations to promote a more widespread use of such labels in the future. To achieve this aim, a survey was conducted on a sample of 400 university students in Naples (South of Italy). The data were processed in two different stages. First, we performed descriptive analysis to determine: (i) socio-demographic aspects; (ii) students’ propensity to read labels before consuming food products; (iii) the degree of knowledge regarding <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels.</b> A multivariate analysis approach was then implemented. We adopted a segmentation approach, performing factorial and cluster analysis to identify different segments of students based on their attitude to using <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels...</b>|$|R
30|$|Finally, Ma, Gam and Banning’s article, “Perceived Ease of Use and Usefulness of <b>Sustainability</b> <b>Labels</b> on Apparel Products: Application of the Technology Acceptance Model,” {{utilizes}} the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) {{to investigate}} consumers’ perceptions of <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> on clothing {{and the effectiveness}} of labels in determining purchase intentions. The study demonstrates that the primary variables within TAM, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitudes and purchase intentions are all {{associated with the use of}} <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> on clothing by consumers (with label users scoring higher on all four variables compared to nonusers). This study supports the idea that labels can communicate the TBL practices of a business when the labels are noticed and easy to understand by consumers. Therefore, TBL clothing brands should design their labels with care, ensuring they are aesthetically pleasing, and easy to read.|$|R
30|$|A {{variety of}} <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> exist for textile and apparel products, but the labels have not {{experienced}} the same success {{as those in}} other product categories, such as organic food (Aspers 2008; Meyer 2001). The trend for fast-fashion {{and the lack of}} standardization in the industry may contribute to the failure for <b>sustainability</b> <b>labelling</b> to be widely adopted (Aspers 2008; Kunz and Garner 2011). Furthermore, the terms or technical jargon used in marketing claims for sustainability apparel products, such as all natural, organic, recyclable, and recycled, and the symbols and logos are sometimes too vague for consumers to understand without specific definitions included (Kim et al. 2012; Morris et al. 1995). Because term meanings on labels may vary by company, even with efforts by federal and state governments to standardize use of labelling terms, terms are often misinterpreted by consumers (Chen and Burns 2006). In summary, given complicated production processes, globalized production, and the variety of standards and certifications that are followed, little explanation and understanding make utilizing <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> for apparel products very difficult. These factors raise the question whether or not consumers will expend time and effort to read <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels,</b> which in turn may influence their purchase decisions.|$|R
30|$|The TAM {{model in}} the context of <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> use {{consisting}} of one exogenous variable (PEOU) and three endogenous variables (PU, Att, PI) was tested by path analysis with the maximum-likelihood estimation procedure using AMOS 21.0. Descriptive statistics and correlations among research constructs for the path model are shown in Table  3.|$|E
30|$|Perceived usefulness, in particular, had {{the largest}} {{positive}} impact on the consumers’ Att toward <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> use and PI, respectively. PU is defined as a person’s belief of benefits from using a particular system (Davis 1989). This result might be interpreted as whether a consumer’s original desire for obtaining sustainability information is a critical antecedent in using a <b>sustainability</b> <b>label.</b> This study’s findings imply that future directions in improving sustainability labels for apparel products should focus on motivation and incentive for using sustainability labels in making a purchase decision. This could be accomplished by increasing awareness of sustainability issues. Developing a “reading labels” for environment or person’s wellbeing campaign and educating consumers of the benefits from using/reading information on sustainability labels can be recommended. As PEOU also impacts on the positive Att and PI, developing easy to read and informative sustainability labels by utilizing standardized systems for apparel products will be essential to appeal {{to a wide range of}} consumers.|$|E
30|$|This study {{applied and}} tested TAM to {{understand}} <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> usage behaviours for apparel products. A nation-wide {{random sample of}} U.S. general consumers was used, and participants were filtered by {{whether or not they}} had purchased sustainable products previously. The findings are thus limited to U.S. consumers and may not apply to non-sustainability consumers. In order to enhance the generalizability, it is necessary to validate the model with non-sustainable product consumers and consumers in other countries and cultures. Despite similarity within most demographic characteristics of early respondents and late respondents, current employment status exhibited the significant difference in the non-response bias test. Therefore, a possible response bias may need to be considered in respondents’ employment status. Furthermore, future studies may extend the <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> adoption model by including other external variables that may influence consumers’ perception of the labels such as self-efficacy and knowledge regarding sustainability labels in general and/or for apparel products. Adding consumers’ sustainable consumption behaviours and social influence to the model is recommended as well. The current study tested the model invariance across groups, <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> users and non-users. A moderating or mediating effect of being a label user, such as age or knowledge level related to sustainable products, should be explored in a future research. It would also be meaningful to investigate why consumers adopt sustainable apparel labels by identifying expected benefits from their use. This study focused on sustainability labels and apparel product shopping, thus the findings may not be applied to other product categories.|$|E

30|$|The {{adoption}} of new media for purchasing new products shares similarities with the {{adoption of}} new technology for decision making. As with new technology, a new product must have PEOU and PU to the intended consumer. These antecedents shape users’ Att and BI towards the new product. In a study of an application of TAM, Benamati and Rajkumar (2002) applied the TAM to a non-technology based context, outsourcing decisions. In their study, TAM was successfully applied to organizational level decisions. Furthermore, the applicability of TAM to a non-technology context of outsourcing decisions was validated and confirmed in their later study (Benamati and Rajkumar 2008). In particular, as argued by Benamati and Rajkumar (2002), TAM was based on TRA, which has been extensively used {{in a wide range}} of consumer studies that depict the relationships between attitudes and intentions, in that it may be plausible to apply TAM to consumers’ label acceptance behaviours. It is for this reason that we tested and validated the TAM in the context of consumers’ use of <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> to further explore the influences on the use of <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> for apparel products. When consumers perceive that it is easy to read <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> and find usefulness in making an informed sustainability purchase decision by understanding the meaning of terms and/or symbols in the label, it is presumable to expect more use of <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels,</b> and subsequently more purchases of sustainable products.|$|R

30|$|Sustainable {{practices}} in the apparel industry are evolving, making it critical to assist consumers with sustainable purchases through effective tools and education. Sustainability labels can be an ideal communication tool when consumers notice and use {{the information on the}} labels. The use of sustainability labels for apparel products, however, has not been fully explored. Therefore, the current study has unique contributions to the limited body of research on <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> usage behaviours of apparel product consumers, with implications for marketers and managers.|$|E
30|$|Efforts should {{therefore}} be made to address such problems and increase consumer demand for sustainable apparel products (Chen and Burns 2006; Nelliyat 2004). One barrier to this effort is that consumers experience challenges in identifying sustainable products and practices in the marketplace (Goswami 2008). An increased number of companies have added marketing claims focused on their environmentally responsible practices within product advertisements (Kim et al. 2012). Overall, however, sustainable practices related to apparel products are perplexing for general consumers to identify, due to the many aspects of production {{that need to be}} considered. From fibre and fabric production and garment manufacturing and finishing, to usage and disposal of the apparel products after use, the apparel life cycle is complicated (Chen and Burns 2006). This reality is further challenged by the more than 300 different <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> being used in consumer products in general (Case 2009). While <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> aid consumers in making responsible choices (Carrero and Valor 2012), the wide variety of <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> present in the marketplace may become a barrier to SRC purchases if labels cannot be understood (D’Souza 2004; Horne 2009).|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 1657 {{respondents}} {{participated in the}} survey, resulting in {{a response rate of}} 16.6 %. After deleting responses with significant amounts of missing values and those without a purchase experience, 903 responses from participants who had purchased a sustainable product previously were deemed usable for data analysis. The reason we used the data only from those who had a previous purchase experience of a sustainable product is that PEOU and PU in our model were measured based on their purchase experience of a general sustainable product. A majority of the respondents had used <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> when they shopped (71.8 %), while about 28 % never used <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> during their shopping. The top five most purchased items with <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> were food (72.1 %), cleaning products (54.7 %), electronics (47.2 %), energy (41.2 %), and health and beauty products (28.3 %). The age of the respondents ranged from 18 to 84  years with the mean age of 44.6  years. A majority of participants were white or European American (79.7 %), married (51.1 %), employed (56.1 %), and female (54.1 %). Nearly 30 % earned a four-year college degree, followed by some college education (28.2 %), and a master’s degree (12.9 %). A majority of the respondents earned $ 25, 000 – 49, 999 (28.6 %) and $ 50, 000 – 74, 999 (24.2 %). Approximately 30 % had purchased apparel products four to six times during the past 12  months. On average, respondents had spent approximately $ 877 on apparel products during the past 12  months.|$|R

Private supply chains have utilized COSA {{to assess and}} measure {{the impact of their}} sustainability efforts, fostered by development agencies such as the International Finance Corporation, USAID, or the Swiss Government (SECO), and include firms such as Nespresso, Lindt and Sprungli, Mars Drinks, Cargill, ECOM Trading and Mondelez International.|$|R
30|$|Findings of {{this study}} offer {{practical}} implications for business marketers and managers of sustainable apparel products. Both <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> users and non-users demonstrated the same approach process from perceptions to purchase intentions of sustainability labelled apparel products. This implies that {{whether or not a}} consumer is a <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> user, once they access the label and perceive it to be easy to read and useful, they are likely to utilize the information on the label. Therefore, this study suggests that marketers should also focus on the physical appearance of label as much as the contents of label. For example, marketers need to use more user-friendly terms such as using “made by” instead of using “ethical production” as it is a vague term to consumers and/or symbols on labels, and a design layout that consumers feel comfortable accessing. In addition, taking into consideration that non-users appeared to have lower levels of PEOU and PU from sustainability labelling than did <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> users, it is important to develop sustainable apparel labels that appeal to label non-users by enhancing practical aspects of the labels in that they can feel easy and useful from the labels. Therefore, an educational campaign encouraging consumers to read labels for purchasing sustainable products should be implemented. This suggestion confirms Beltramini’s study (1988), which found that the warning information itself in the label of cigarettes had no significant effect on respondents’ smoking behaviour. Rather, consumers exhibited higher belief toward warning labels that they had seen over time as they became familiar with labels. Further, their belief affected their attitude toward the hazards of smoking. Utilizing visual elements such as graphics or distinct colours may draw general consumers’ attention and increase positive perceptions of the label information. In addition, utilizing communication technologies or techniques that are familiar to the target consumers would be an effective strategy. Implementing an educational campaign through a variety of social media platforms or using a commonly recognizable buzzword such as “eco chic” or “up-cycled fashion” on sustainability labels may attract young adult non-users.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose ¿ The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine whether sustainability labels like Fair Trade have a spin-off effect to mainstream products in the consumer perception: do consumers perceive mainstream products and brands more negatively in the presence of a product with a <b>sustainability</b> <b>label?</b> Design/methodology/approach ¿ Five scientific experiments were conducted to test the spin-off effect of products with sustainability labels on evaluations of mainstream products. Experiments vary with respect to product category, label, respondents, and stimuli. Next, a focus group study was conducted to further explain the findings. Findings ¿ The results show that a spin-off effect of sustainability labels in the consumer perception is unlikely. None of the experiments shows a significant spin-off effect, neither directly, nor under the conditions of quality differences between supermarkets, search behaviour of consumers, presence of competing labels, and different involvement categories. Also, a variety of different types of stimuli (scenarios and visual) and research designs (experiments and focus group interviews) did not reveal the hypothesized effect. Research limitations/implications ¿ The results imply that retailers¿ fears for a negative spin-off effect of products with sustainability labels to the rest of the assortment hold little ground. Although the evidence is consistent over different designs, stimuli, contexts, and dependent variables, only a limited range of stimuli-method combinations is tested. Originality/value ¿ This study is the first to investigate the existence of a spin-off effect from products with a <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> to mainstream products.

30|$|Specific claims {{included}} on sustainability labels have been explored as well; {{researchers have found}} that consumers respond differently to sustainability labels, depending on the claim being made. The “No Sweat” label, highlighting working conditions of the producer of a garment, encouraged purchase decisions for a small group of consumers (Dickson 2001). For that group of consumers, however, the <b>sustainability</b> <b>label</b> was more influential in the ultimate purchase decision than any other label information, including price, quality, colour, and fibre content. In a more recent study, consumers appeared to value environmental sustainability and animal welfare claims more than they did certified organic wool claims in a study about the efficacy of sustainability labels on wool gloves (Peterson et al. 2012).|$|E

30|$|As a {{response}} to increasing demand from environmentally and socially conscious consumers, leaders in the textile and apparel industry have begun to apply sustainable business strategies, such as presenting <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> or marketing claims {{at the point of}} sale (Etsy and Winston 2009; Marquardt 2010). Clothing hang tags and product packages are common places to display sustainability messages to communicate with consumers (Phau and Ong 2007). Studies examining the general effectiveness of <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> and marketing claims on apparel products, recommend continued use of such labels. Hyllegard et al. (2012) examined the use of hang tags in advertising companies’ sustainable practices and found that the use of hang tags containing detailed information and a third party logo increased participants’ positive attitudes toward apparel brand and also influenced their patronage intentions. Similarly, work by Kim et al. (2012) advised that critical factors for marketers to include in sustainability messages were related to environmental concerns and knowledge, as well as social influences. The team employed environmental marketing claims (intrinsic versus extrinsic claims) as the moderating variables in their study that explored how norms and environmental concerns influence purchase intentions. While the extrinsic marketing claims involving social norms were more effective in influencing consumers’ purchase intention, the intrinsic claims were more effective when personal environmental concerns were presented in the claims.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between consumer motivation, understanding and use of <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> on food products (both environmental and ethical labels), which are increasingly appearing on food products. Data was collected {{by means of an}} online survey implemented in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Poland, with a total sample size of 4408 respondents. Respondents expressed medium high to high levels of concern with sustainability issues at the general level, but lower levels of concern in the context of concrete food product choices. Understanding of the concept of sustainability was limited, but understanding of four selected labels (Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, Carbon Footprint, and Animal Welfare) was better, as some of them seem to be self-explanatory. The results indicated a low level of use, no matter whether use was measured as self-reported use of different types of information available on food labels or as use inferred from the results of a choice-based conjoint analysis. Hierarchical regression indicated that use is related to both motivation and understanding, and that both motivation, understanding and use are affected by demographic characteristics, human values as measured by the Schwartz value domains, and country differences. The results imply that <b>sustainability</b> <b>labels</b> currently do not {{play a major role in}} consumers’ food choices, and future use of these labels will depend on the extent to which consumers’ general concern about sustainability can be turned into actual behaviour...|$|R
