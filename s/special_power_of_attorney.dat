40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is an attempt to}} {{determine}} the legal nature of establishing a proxy, or giving a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney,</b> and in particular to identify the recipient <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> granted by way of a statement of will of the person establishing a proxy. Further, the role of a proxy in the creation <b>of</b> an effective <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is analyzed. Issues such as the form, contents, legal effects <b>of</b> a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> granted, or its active or passive legitimization are not discussed.

Accepting the granted <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is an intrinsic element of the proxy being established and effective. Such an acceptance consists in an inclusion in the statement of will of the person establishing a proxy of the consent of the recipient of the proxy to receive the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> so given.
