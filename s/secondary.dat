5|$|Dhaka has {{the largest}} number of schools, colleges and {{universities}} of any Bangladeshi city. The education system is divided into 5 levels: Primary (from grades 1 to 6), Junior (from grades 6 to 8), <b>Secondary</b> (from grades 9 to 10), Higher <b>Secondary</b> (from grades 11 to 12) and tertiary. The five years of Primary education concludes with a Primary School Completion (PSC) Examination, the three years of Junior education concludes with Junior School Certificate (JSC) Examination, and next two years of <b>Secondary</b> education concludes with a <b>Secondary</b> School Certificate (SSC) Examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years of Higher <b>Secondary</b> or intermediate training, which culminate in a Higher <b>Secondary</b> School Certificate (HSC) Examination. Education is mainly offered in Bengali, but English is also widely taught and used. Many Muslim families send their children to attend part-time courses or even to pursue full-time religious education alongside other subjects, which is imparted in Bengali and Arabic in schools, colleges and madrasas.|$|E
40|$|Cosmic-ray <b>secondaries</b> and tertiaries {{have been}} studied {{in a series of}} experiments. It has been shown that the <b>secondaries</b> from lead have little power to produce {{detectable}} tertiaries or showers from lead or aluminum. The <b>secondaries</b> from aluminum have been found to produce more showers in lead than the <b>secondaries</b> from air. The absorption coefficient of the <b>secondaries</b> from aluminum {{has been found to be}} 0. 7 cm- 1 Pb and the absorption coefficient of their lead tertiaries 2. 0 cm- 1 Pb. The values for <b>secondaries</b> from air and a heavy roof, and their lead tertiaries were previously found to be 0. 5 cm- 1 Pb and 2. 58 cm - 1 Pb. The values obtained from Rossi's and Funfer's data are 0. 32 cm- 1 Pb for the air <b>secondaries</b> and 1. 18 cm - 1 Pb for their lead tertiaries. It follows that the air <b>secondaries</b> and their lead tertiaries have greater energies than the aluminum <b>secondaries</b> and their lead tertiaries. It has been found that a component of the cosmic rays even softer than the corpuscular component is probably the chief source of the <b>secondaries</b> producing the showers. There is some evidence that non-ionizing particles produce a portion of the showers and that possibly non-ionizing <b>secondaries</b> are produced in lead and that these particles can produce ionizing particles in aluminum...|$|R

30|$|The {{potential}} trouble-making <b>secondaries</b> to {{the crater}} chronology are a subgroup of distant <b>secondaries</b> {{that do not}} occur in obvious clusters or chains and have identical plane morphology with similar-sized primaries. These <b>secondaries</b> are termed as background <b>secondaries</b> or field <b>secondaries</b> (e.g., McEwen and Bierhaus 2006). The high efficiency {{in the production of}} distant <b>secondaries</b> have been noticed on Mercury (Strom et al. 2011; Xiao 2016), the Moon (e.g., Hirata and Nakamura 2006; Dundas and McEwen 2007; Robinson et al. 2015), Mars (e.g., McEwen et al. 2005; Robbins and Hynek 2014), and Europa (Bierhaus et al. 2005). However, whether or not background <b>secondaries</b> dominate crater populations within their diameter ranges (e.g., <[*]~ 1  km on the Moon and Mercury; <[*] 8  km on Mercury) has been a debate {{for more than half a}} century (e.g., Shoemaker 1962; Neukum and Ivanov 1994; McEwen and Bierhaus 2006; Hartmann 2007; Werner et al. 2009; Strom et al. 2011; Xiao and Strom 2012; Williams et al. 2014; Xie et al. 2017). The resolution of this debate is critically important to both the crater chronology and the application of crater statistics, because: (1) crater counts at the Apollo and Luna landing sites are dominated by sub-kilometer or kilometer diameter crater populations, so that possible contamination by background <b>secondaries</b> might have caused larger crater densities than those of the primary crater populations; (2) geological study for small planetary surface units are recently being enabled with more and more high-resolution images obtained, but only small craters are visible on small geological units, thus the effect of potential background <b>secondaries</b> cannot be ignored. Although new observations on Mercury suggest that background <b>secondaries</b> do abundantly exist outside of impact rays (Xiao 2016), solid observations for populations of background <b>secondaries</b> and their SFD are still lacking, since in theory, background <b>secondaries</b> are not distinguishable from primaries in terms of morphology and spatial distribution. Therefore, there have been three different schools in this debate: (1) Background <b>secondaries</b> dominate small crater populations on Mercury (Strom et al. 2011), the Moon (e.g., Shoemaker 1962; Dundas and McEwen 2007; Xiao and Strom 2012), Mars (McEwen et al. 2005; Robbins and Hynek 2014), and Europa (Bierhaus et al. 2005); (2) Background <b>secondaries</b> are not abundant on planetary surfaces so they have negligible effect on crater statistics (e.g., Neukum and Ivanov 1994; Ivanov 2006; Werner et al. 2009; Xie et al. 2017); (3) Background <b>secondaries</b> do exist in populations of small impact craters, but the current crater chronology have integrated both primaries and background <b>secondaries,</b> so the effect of background <b>secondaries</b> has already been bracketed (Hartmann 2007; Hartmann and Daubar 2017). A full understanding of the spatial dispersion and SFD of impact fragments during the cratering process is required to investigate the heterogeneity of background <b>secondaries</b> in terms of diameter ranges and spatial locations, which may settle down the debate (Xiao 2016).|$|R

In addition, we find that 80 % of ZACVs with BD <b>secondaries</b> have orbital periods less than 78 minutes. This implies that 15 % of the present-day ZACV population should have orbital periods shorter than the observed orbital period minimum for CVs. We also investigate the dependence of the present-day formation rate of CVs with BD <b>secondaries</b> on the assumed value of the common envelope efficiency parameter, αCE, for three different assumed mass ratio distributions in ZAMS binaries...|$|R
