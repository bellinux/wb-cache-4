60|$|Rachel {{said that}} she was <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt,</b> and was turning to go.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{wondered}} if you would still be here, Christian. I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> you--I was not aware that you knew Mr. Herr--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> you, my dear sir, and I {{am still}} more {{sorry for the}} cause. My good, my worthy friend, I am deceived.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Kenton {{noted the}} 'we' and was <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> be here <b>interrupted.</b> 'We shall do nothing with him till we get him alone,' she said. 'We must have {{him apart from}} Mr. Burford.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's about Philoctetes, {{the lame}} man I {{was telling you}} of yesterday," [...] he answered, resting his head on his hand, and looking {{at her as if}} he were not at all <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> be <b>interrupted.</b> Maggie, in her absent way, {{continued}} to lean forward, resting on her arms and moving her feet about, while her dark eyes got more and more fixed and vacant, as if she had quite forgotten Philip and his book.|$|R
60|$|This, of course, was {{considered}} a very natural and proper state of things by the two young people, for they were both considerate by nature, {{and would have been}} <b>sorry</b> indeed <b>to</b> have <b>interrupted</b> the old man in his regular work.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> you, sir," [...] she said, [...] "but I had {{to follow}} Father Brown at once; it's nothing less than life or death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> my brother," [...] {{said the}} Crown Counsel, rising; [...] "but I am in your Lordships' judgment, whether this be not a leading question?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> {{this little}} feast," [...] Mr. Cullen said, [...] "but I {{shall have to}} trouble you both {{to come with me}} for a short time." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{she entered}} his chamber, he was {{thinking}} partly of her, {{and he was not}} <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> be thus <b>interrupted.</b> She carried a candle in one hand, and in the other a bouquet of fresh flowers, which she quietly laid among his papers. Robespierre either had, or affected a taste for flowers, and, {{as long as they were}} to be gotten, he was seldom seen without them, either in his hand or on his coat.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} useless <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> me. I {{have it on}} my {{conscience}} to tell you--and I will tell you--that I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> see how this intimacy is growing. I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> see a secret understanding established already between you and Mr. Francis Clare." ...|$|R
6000|$|My Dear Sir,--I am truly <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> a {{connection}} with so old and respected a contributor. But I think you will acknowledge, on reading the proof of your article on the Academy, which I enclose, {{that the time has}} arrived when public criticism is no longer your province. I do not so much refer to the old- fashioned tone of your observations on modern art. I know little about it, and care not much more. But you have entirely forgotten, {{towards the end of the}} notice, that the [...] "Newcome Independent," [...] as becomes its name, is a journal of Liberty and Progress. The very proper remarks on Lord Spencer's portrait elsewhere show that you are not unacquainted with our politics; but, at the close (expressing, I fear, your true sentiments), you glide into language which makes me shudder, and which, if printed in the [...] "Independent," [...] would spell ruin. Send it, by all means, to the [...] "Sentinel," [...] if you like. Send your Tory views, I mean. As for your quotation from the [...] "Lady of Shalott," [...] I can find it nowhere in the poem of that name by the author you strangely style [...] "young Mr. Tennyson." [...] {20} ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> you at your dinner, Mr. Parker," [...] he said, {{his eyes}} {{traveling}} {{all over the}} table as though taking in its appointments and condition.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> you," [...] he said, gravely, [...] "but Lord Redford {{has sent}} {{me out to}} look for you and to send you at once into the library. Something rather serious has happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> a {{counsel in}} such a case as the present," [...] said, the {{presiding}} Judge; [...] "but I must remind the learned gentleman that he is travelling out of the case before us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> say,' said Mrs Griffith, {{with some}} asperity, feeling the doubt almost an affront <b>to</b> her--'I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> say that I know they're real.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> appear indiscreet," [...] {{our young}} man returned; [...] "I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> have upset {{you in any}} way. But I can't {{overcome}} my anxiety--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Her friends {{must all}} be <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> lose her; {{and will not}} Colonel and Mrs. Campbell be <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> find that she has engaged herself before their return?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir,--As I {{should be}} very <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> your Sunday's engagement, if Monday, or any other day of the ensuing week, would be equally {{convenient}} to yourself and friend, I will then have the honour of accepting his invitation. [1] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> you, Pecksniff,' remarked Mr Spottletoe, {{with his}} {{whiskers}} {{in a very}} portentous state; 'but you are assuming too much to yourself, sir. Who do you imagine has it in contemplation to confer a distinction upon YOU, sir?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will but {{dispose of}} this young fellow," [...] said Claverhouse, {{from the other side}} of the hall, [...] "and then, Lord Evandale--I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> again your conversation--but then we must mount.--Bothwell, why do not you bring up the prisoner? and, hark ye, let two files load their carabines." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are all <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> {{have her}} go," [...] said the Sand Lady, [...] "and <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> see her wearing that doleful gray garb, which my brother {{allowed her to}} assume this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No offence, I hope, sir! <b>Sorry</b> <b>to</b> offend. I'm always respectful. Madam! I hope I don't {{inconvenience}} you; I {{should be}} <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> do that. We sailors, you know, are {{always ready to}} accommodate the ladies.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} stop him, Copperfield, if you can,' cried Uriah, {{with his long}} {{forefinger}} pointing towards me. 'He'll say something presently--mind you!--he'll be <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> have said afterwards, and you'll be <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> have heard!' ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{they began}} a {{backward}} tracing of the calamities of France; and, as Louis's words came {{with more than}} usual slowness and deliberation, they had only come to Cardinal de Richelieu, when Captain Lonsdale exclaimed, 'I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> you, Lord Fitzjocelyn, but may I ask whether {{you can afford to}} lose any more blood?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nuttie! Nuttie! my dear,' and a {{head with}} the snows of {{more than half a}} century {{appeared}} on the other side of the wall, under a cap and parasol. 'I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> you, but it is cool enough for your mother to go into the town, and I wish you to go with her.' ...|$|E
60|$|MABEL (apologetically). I am so <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> you, Jack; {{but please}} {{wait a moment}} before you kiss her again. Excuse me, Joanna. (She quietly draws the curtains, thus {{shutting}} out the garden and any possible onlooker.) I {{did not want the}} others to see you; they might not understand how noble you are, Jack. You can go on now.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> hear this, Mr. Bragg; for, {{being an}} Episcopalian myself, and having great {{reliance}} on the antiquity and purity of my church, I should be <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> find it put in the wrong by any other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have changed}} since you were last here," [...] she said, looking at him with disapproval. [...] "Perhaps you really are a little <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> leave me, but I think that is all. At least, {{you will not be}} <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> get back to the ca√±on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "`Then {{you would}} be <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> give her pain, I know, and your present course of conduct is sure to do that if you don't mend. You would be <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> see your mother take handfuls of her small income and fling it into the sea, would you not?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> this {{interesting}} conversation," [...] she said; [...] "but I have stupidly forgotten {{one of my}} domestic duties. You will allow me to return, and listen with renewed pleasure, when my household business is off my mind. I shall hope to find you both more polite to each other than ever when I come back." [...] She {{was in such a}} frenzy of suppressed rage that she actually kissed her hand to them as she left the room! ...|$|E
60|$|It was the stranger,--slightly apologetic {{and still}} humorous, but firm and self-confident withal. She was <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> their family council, but {{the fire was}} going out where she sat, and she would like {{a cup of tea}} or some refreshment. She did not look at Jack, but, {{completely}} ignoring him, addressed herself to Zuleika with {{what seemed to be a}} direct challenge; in that feminine eye-grapple there was a quick, instinctive, and final struggle between the two women. The stranger triumphed. Zuleika's vacant smile changed to one of submission, and then, equally ignoring her brother in this double defeat, she hastened to the kitchen to do the visitor's bidding. The woman closed the door behind her, and took Zuleika's place before the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal', child, I didn't ask him, but I shouldn't be surprised, {{from all}} I know of their ways, if they was," [...] said the Captain, who had now got so wholly {{into the spirit}} of his fiction that he no longer felt embarrassed by the minister's presence, nor saw the look of {{amusement}} with which he was listening to him in his chimney-corner. [...] "But, as I was sayin', he came up to me, and made the politest bow that ever ye see, and says he, 'Cap'n Kittridge, I presume,' and says I, 'Yes, sir.' 'I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> your reading,' says he; and says I, 'Oh, no matter, sir.' 'But,' says he, 'if you would only be so good as to move your anchor. You've cast anchor right before my front-door, and my wife and family can't get out to go to meetin'.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Streek's last {{status update}} on Facebook read: [...] "So... I guess that's it... thanks everyone... I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> those I should be <b>sorry</b> <b>to,</b> I love you {{to those that}} I love, and I will see you all again soon (not too soon though)... Let the stories begin." ...|$|R
50|$|ELIZA: I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> {{hear you}} are depressed.|$|R
6000|$|Tintoret, Titian, Veronese, Rubens, and Vandyck, {{would be}} very <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> part with their figured stuffs and lustrous silks; and sorry, observe, exactly {{in the degree of}} their picturesque feeling. Should not we also be <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> have Bishop Ambrose without his vest, in that picture of the National Gallery? ...|$|R
