2500|$|The Georgetown II Water Supply & Sewer System Program was a US$30m project {{approved}} in 1999 that aimed [...] "to improve sanitary conditions in Georgetown and reduce {{current levels of}} environmental degradation by {{improving the quality of}} the water supply and sewerage services". The three program components were: (a) further improving the availability and quality of potable water and the reliability of the distribution system; (b) improving the sewerage system; and (c) strengthening the Georgetown Sewerage and Water Commissioners (GS), the service provider for Georgetown {{at the time of the}} project's approval and one of the two predecessors of GWI. After a cancellation of part of the funding as part of a debt relief package for Guyana, the size of the project was reduced to US$ 16.4million. [...] The project closed in 2010 after achieving only some of its objectives: Water pressure increased from 2 pound per square inch (psi) to 6 psi, short of the target of 10psi; the iron content of drinking water declined after two water treatment plants were commissioned in 2010; non-revenue water apparently declined, although exact numbers are not available; <b>sewage</b> <b>pumps</b> stations were built, but it is too early to determine if they will be properly operated and maintained; a septic tank disposal facility has been built, but was not operational; water metering in Georgetown was increased to 50%, short of the target of 80%; and no significant improvements were reached in terms of collection efficiency and cost recovery. The IDB is preparing two new water and sanitation projects in Guyana, a US$10million Georgetown sanitation improvement project and a US$12m+ project to rehabilitate the water system of Guyana's second largest town, Linden.|$|E

2500|$|According to Friedkin, {{the most}} {{important}} scene in the film was [...] "the bridge-crossing sequence, wherein the two trucks have to separately cross an old wooden suspension bridge that appears completely unstable". He also deemed it the most arduous scene he has ever filmed. The bridge was designed by John Box using carefully hidden hydraulic components allowing control of {{the movements of the}} bridge and the trucks alike. Its first iteration was constructed in the Dominican Republic over a period of three months, and it required $1 million to complete. However, {{as soon as it was}} finished, Friedkin's crew faced a problem of abnormally low rainfall. During the construction process, the river's water level decreased dramatically, and by the time the bridge was assembled, the river had become completely dry, despite the assurance of local engineers that there had not been any recorded fluctuations in water level during the dry season. Studio executives suggested Friedkin devise a less sophisticated scene, but instead he continued to realize his vision in different locations. Thus, John Box went to scout locations in Mexico and found that the Papaloapan River possessed similar characteristics. The previously constructed bridge had to be disassembled and re-anchored. Friedkin's crew's arrival caused a major disturbance in the vicinity among the locals because of his reputation as a director of The Exorcist. However, a part of the population offered help to finish the structure. Ultimately, this river also became stricken with drought, which forced the application of some practical effects to complete the scene. In order to create artificial rain, Friedkin employed <b>sewage</b> <b>pumps</b> draining water from the river and diverting it to a sprinkler system. This scene alone, which lasts 12 minutes, took several months to complete and cost approximately three million dollars. The director has claimed that during this sequence, the truck teetering against the ropes actually tipped over into the river several times, causing numerous retakes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sewage</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are almost}} always end-suction {{centrifugal}} pumps with open impellers and are specially designed with a large open passage {{so as to avoid}} clogging with debris or winding stringy debris onto the impeller. A four pole or six pole AC induction motor normally drives the pump. Rather than provide large open passages, some pumps, typically smaller <b>sewage</b> <b>pumps,</b> also macerate any solids within the sewage breaking them down into smaller parts which can more easily pass through the impeller.|$|E

5000|$|More modern pumping {{stations}} do {{not require}} a dry well or pump house and usually consist only of a wet well. In this configuration, submersible <b>sewage</b> <b>pumps</b> with closely coupled electric motor are mounted within the wet well itself, submerged within the sewage. Submersible pumps are mounted on two vertical guide rails and seal onto a permanently fixed [...] "duckfoot", which forms both a mount and also a vertical bend for the discharge pipe. For maintenance or replacement, submersible pumps are raised by a chain off of the duckfoot and up the two guide rails to the maintenance (normally ground) level. Reinstalling the pumps simply reverses this process with the pump being remounted on the guide rails and lowered onto the duckfoot where {{the weight of the}} pump reseals it. As the motors are sealed and weather is not a concern, no above ground structures are required, excepting a small kiosk to contain the electrical switchgear and control systems.|$|E
50|$|Some areas lost water {{pressure}} because pumps lacked power. This {{loss of pressure}} caused potential contamination of the water supply. Four million customers of the Detroit water system in eight counties were under a boil-water advisory until August 18, {{four days after the}} initial outage. One county, Macomb, ordered all 2,300 restaurants closed until they were decontaminated after the advisory was lifted. Twenty people living on the St. Clair River claim to have been sickened after bathing in the river during the blackout. The accidental release of 140 kg (310 lb) of vinyl chloride from a Sarnia, Ontario, chemical plant was not revealed until five days later. Cleveland also lost {{water pressure}} and instituted a boil water advisory. Cleveland and New York had sewage spills into waterways, requiring beach closures. Newark, New Jersey, and northern cities had major sewage spills into the Passaic and Hackensack rivers, which flow directly to the Atlantic Ocean. Kingston lost power to <b>sewage</b> <b>pumps,</b> causing raw waste to be dumped into the Cataraqui River {{at the base of the}} Rideau Canal.|$|E

On 1 October 2011, it adopted 40,000 km - an additional 60% - of private sewers and lateral drains to add to its then stock of 68,000 km giving a new network of 108,000 km. By 2015, this figure had grown to 109,400 km managed sewerage mains. Before 1 October 2016, it is obliged to adopt 5,000+ private <b>sewage</b> <b>pumping</b> stations to add to its current stock of 2530 managed <b>sewage</b> <b>pumping</b> stations [...] Again, Thames Water treats and disposes bulk sewage on behalf of some inset companies.|$|R
5000|$|The 2009 {{breakdown}} {{was caused}} by what Tim Bousquet of The Coast called [...] "a perfect storm" [...] of technical errors. A Nova Scotia Power electrical outage spurred a technician to activate two backup generators to maintain operation of the plant. But the electrical load was unevenly distributed between the two generators and one became overloaded and failed. A floodgate, designed to close in emergencies to isolate the plant's [...] "wet well" [...] from the deep pipe feeding sewage to the plant, was powered by the overloaded generator. A switch designed to allow the second generator to power the floodgate happened to fail. Owing to the failed generator, {{only one of the}} four <b>sewage</b> <b>pumps</b> could convey sewage out of the wet well, and the volume of sewage began to rise, shorting out the electrical junction boxes placed above the pumps. With the floodgate jammed partially open and all four pumps inoperable, the 85-foot-deep wet well filled with sewage. The electrical control room above the wet well then also filled with sewage, destroying all the equipment there.|$|E
5000|$|A Marathon Oil {{refinery}} in Melvindale, near Detroit, {{suffered a}} small explosion from gas buildup, necessitating an evacuation within 1 mi around {{the plant and}} the closure of Interstate 75. Officials feared the release of toxic gases. Heavy rains on Friday coupled {{with the lack of}} <b>sewage</b> <b>pumps</b> closed other expressways and prompted urban flood warnings. Untreated sewage flowed into local rivers in Lansing and Metropolitan Detroit as contingency solutions at some sewage treatment plants failed. In the midst of a summer heat wave, Michiganders were deprived of air conditioning. Several people, mostly elderly individuals, had to be treated for symptoms of heat stroke. In the Detroit area, local television stations' news helicopters were told by each station's management to [...] "stay above the cars' headlights" [...] at night, and to not venture into Downtown Detroit (due to the hazard of flying into an unlit skyscraper). During the days immediately after the blackout, many stations were back on the air, with limited resources. (In one case, WXYZ-TV's news anchor was wearing a T-shirt and shorts, as opposed to his normal news suit, and apologized to viewers for the [...] "rather warm conditions" [...] in the station, as they only had one air conditioner and a couple fans working.) The Downriver communities had to contend with basements flooded with sewage-laden water on the weekend immediately after the blackout, with water and <b>sewage</b> <b>pumps</b> off from a lack of power, much to the general annoyance of residents in the areas. News crews of the areas broadcast notices during their coverages of the blackouts to the Downriver residents, explaining why the pumps had shorted out, as well as to limit water usage. ("Most places have water pressure, some have low pressure...some have none, and some even have negative pressure. That means in the next few hours, people in the downriver communities should expect flooded basements from, so move all your valuables high {{up and out of the}} basements," [...] as WDIV-TV warned.) West Michigan, including the communities of Grand Rapids, Muskegon, and Holland were mostly unaffected, although a large portion was within [...] "seconds" [...] of joining the blackout according to local U.S. Representative Fred Upton. Although right across the border from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan was unaffected by the outage, as the two cities are not electrically connected.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional sewage pumping {{stations}} incorporate both a {{wet well}} and a [...] "dry well". Often {{these are the}} same structure separated by an internal divide. In this configuration pumps are installed below ground level on the base of the dry well so that their inlets are below water level on pump start, priming the pump and also maximising the available NPSH. Although nominally isolated from the sewage in the wet well, dry wells are underground, confined spaces and require appropriate precautions for entry. Further, any failure or leakage of the pumps or pipework can discharge sewage directly into the dry well with complete flooding not an uncommon occurrence. As a result, the electric motors are normally mounted above the overflow, top water level of the wet well, usually above ground level, and drive the <b>sewage</b> <b>pumps</b> through an extended vertical shaft. To protect the above ground motors from weather, small pump houses are normally built, which also incorporate the electrical switchgear and control electronics. These are the visible parts of a traditional sewage pumping station although they are typically smaller than the underground wet and dry wells.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the much}} reduced {{health and safety}} concerns, and smaller {{footprint}} and visibility, submersible <b>pump</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>pumping</b> stations have almost completely superseded traditional <b>sewage</b> <b>pumping</b> stations. Further, a refit of a traditional pumping station usually involves converting it into a modern pumping station by installing submersibles in the wet well, demolishing the pump house and retiring the dry well by either stripping it, or knocking down the internal partition and merging it with the wet well.|$|R
