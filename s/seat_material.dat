2500|$|... 1976 {{brought about}} a few changes on the Electra. The {{front-end}} was reworked, including the grille and bumper. The new plastic grille featured 17 vertical bars and covered much of the radiator. The grille did not extend under the headlights in 1976, but instead Buick moved the running lights and turn signal lights underneath the headlights, where the 1975 grille had once been. The bumper no longer housed running lights. [...] There were also some minor interior differences. The brake release handle was black instead of chrome, the <b>seat</b> <b>material</b> was slightly different, on the limited, notch-back diamond pattern seating. The 1975 material appeared in a [...] "corduroy" [...] form, but the actual material was not corduroy. The 1976 diamond pattern seating material did not have this appearance. [...] The engine air cleaner {{did not have a}} [...] "cold-air" [...] ram air intake hose like the 1975 model did, and there were some carburetor changes and camshaft changes to meet EPA standards. The rear end ratio also was higher than the 1975 standard, at 2.56:1 instead of 2.73:1. The Park Avenue and leather seating in 1975 and 1976 were the same. Once again, there was the base 225, the Limited, and the luxurious Park Avenue. The Park Avenue Deluxe vanished for 1976 due to poor sales. The 1976 Electra is about {{the same size as the}} 1975 at , making them among the biggest Buicks ever.|$|E

5000|$|The A2's {{interior}} was very upmarket {{in comparison with}} other superminis. In both the UK and Europe, there were several choices of <b>seat</b> <b>material</b> and colour, comprising the standard Cirrus cloth, optional Matrix cloth, optional Alcantara/leather, or full pearl Nappa leather seat coverings. Sport models received sport seats with electrically adjustable lumbar support as standard in jacquard satin cloth. Seat materials were available in a choice of red, blue, beige ("jive" [...] or [...] "twist", code 4QC), pale grey ("platinum", code EC3), dark grey ("swing", 24S) or black ("soul", 6PS). Individual options were also available such as vivid yellow, red or blue seats, steering wheels, gear lever, handbrake lever and door armrests. The color.storm models introduced in 2003 brought bright colours to both the outside and inside of the A2, including [...] "papaya" [...] orange.

5000|$|The Mark IV monorails {{were the}} first of the [...] "Learjet" [...] styled monorails used by Disney (long, sleek white trains with mid-level windows). The design was also used for the Mark V (Disneyland), Mark VI (WDW) and {{inspired}} the look of other systems such as the Las Vegas Monorail as well as systems in Asia. Each car featured brown interiors (<b>seat</b> <b>material</b> and carpet) with four double sided and two single (at the front and rear) bench seats which stretched the entire width of the car. The cars were accessed by doors which were automatically opened using a pneumatic system (a loud clunk would be heard and the doors would swing open at the press of a control button {{on the outside of the}} monorail near the driver door) and manually closed by a Cast Member who would walk from one end of the train to the other with his hand out, pushing the doors shut as he walked by). Unlike the current Mark VI trains in use at Disney World, Mark IV's were shorter, the cabins were somewhat narrower, and had no standing room capability. Although the trains were equipped with air conditioning and heating, to help with ventilation, each window could be cracked open with a latch. The pilot's compartments (cabs) were not heated. Passengers in wheel chairs were boarded in the middle door of the third car. The door included an opposite hinged side that allowed the passenger to remain in their chair while boarding. Guests in chairs were boarded using a metal ramp (the floor of the train was several inches higher than that of the station) and one bench seat folded up allowing the chair to be anchored securely for travel without inconvenience to the guest.|$|E

40|$|The seal {{configuration}} tester (SCT) {{developed at}} the Stennis Space Center (SSC) was designed to replicate the intended application of different <b>seat</b> and seal <b>materials</b> in a high pressure oxygen system and assess the wearibility of those materials. Statistical models were {{used to test the}} reliability of the SCT in its intended application, and the tests showed very consistent measurements over time, indicating that the device was working as intended. Other statistical designs were used to test different O-ring materials in a high-pressure oxygen system. Those tests indicated that the SCT could be used to rank the performance of O-ring materials in certain environments. The results indicated that some cheaper materials performed as well as, if not better than, other more expensive materials. Different lubrications were integrated in the testing as well and {{had a significant impact on}} the performance of the <b>materials.</b> Testing of <b>seat</b> <b>materials</b> is the next stage of this project.

40|$|Aim of the study: To {{determine}} whether 3 fixed positions of seat-subject interface temperature measurement offer {{more information than}} a single point of measurement. Materials and methods: Temperature data was simultaneously acquired (sampling frequency 1 Hz/sensor) from each of three sensor positions (right & left mid-thigh and coccyx), from the subject-seat interface. The data was acquired whilst subjects (6 males, 5 females: 21 - 40 yrs: BMI 19. 3 - 26. 4) sat for 20 min on each of three types of <b>seat</b> <b>material</b> (foam, gel mould and solid wood). Data collection was performed {{at the same time}} of day for each subject: ambient temperature between 21. 1 and 21. 2 °C, ambient relative humidity 50. 9 %. Results: Analysis of data from the sensors, post mathematical smoothing, for each subject (n = 11; ANOVA, followed by post-hoc t-tests) revealed each of the measurement positions to have a significantly different recorded temperature (p 0. 99) between subjects, a consistent finding across all 11 subjects regardless of <b>seat</b> <b>material</b> selected. Conclusion: Use of 3 positions of measurement (3 sensors) appears necessary when performing detailed studies of temperature change at the seat-subject interface. The high level of comparability of results between subjects supports potential of this method to resolve quantitative components of qualitative measurements, e. g., thermal comfort...|$|E

40|$|The work {{to correct}} several design {{deficiencies}} {{present in the}} bearings used in the orbital extravehicular spacesuit is reported. These deficiencies included: difficult stitch-on interface between fabric and outer race; a tendency for the clamping threads to seize; and, most importantly, {{the failure of the}} sealing surfaces (Teflon seat, Delrin seal) to maintain integrity with cycling. The first problem was corrected by raising the stitch-on holes so as to be more accessible. The seizing was eliminated by changing to a coarser thread, from 32 /inch to 24 /inch. The solution to the sealing problem required a materials evaluation, candidate material selection, and adhesive evaluation (for bonding the <b>seat</b> <b>material</b> to the outer race) and bench-cycling of candidate seal/seat combinations.

40|$|The Office of Waste Processing, {{within the}} Office of Technology Innovation and Development, is funding the {{development}} of an enhanced solvent for deployment at the Savannah River Site for removal of cesium from High Level Waste. The technical effort is collaboration between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), and Argonne National Laboratory. The first deployment target for the technology is within the Modular Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU). Deployment of a new chemical within an existing facility requires verification that the chemical components are compatible with the installed equipment. In the instance of a new organic solvent, the primary focus is on compatibility of the solvent with organic polymers used in the facility. This report provides the data from exposing these polymers to the Next Generation Solvent (NGS). The test was conducted over six months. An assessment of the dimensional stability of polymers present in MCU (i. e., PEEK, Grafoil, Tefzel and Isolast) in the modified NGS (where the concentration of LIX{reg_sign} 79 and MaxCalix was varied systematically) showed that LIX{reg_sign} 79 selectively affected Tefzel and its different grades (by an increase in size and lowering its density). The copolymer structure of Tefzel and possibly its porosity allows for the easier diffusion of LIX{reg_sign} 79. Tefzel is used as the <b>seat</b> <b>material</b> in some of the valves at MCU. Long term exposure to LIX{reg_sign} 79, may make the valves hard to operate over time due to the <b>seat</b> <b>material</b> (Tefzel) increasing in size. However, since the physical changes of Tefzel in the improved solvent are comparable to the changes in the CSSX baseline solvent, no design changes are needed with respect to the Tefzel seating material. PEEK, Grafoil and Isolast were not affected by LIX{reg_sign} 79 and MaxCalix within six months of exposure. The initial rapid weight gain observed in every polymer is assigned to the finite and limited uptake of Isopar{reg_sign} L/Modifier by the polymers probably due to the polymers porosity and rough surfaces. Spectroscopic data on the organic liquid and the polymer surfaces showed no preferential adsorption of any component in the NGS to the polymers and with the exception of CPVC, no leachate was observed in the NGS from any of the polymers studied. The testing shows no major concerns for compatibility over the short duration of these tests but does indicate that longer duration exposure studies are warranted, especially for Tefzel. However, the physical changes experienced by Tefzel in the improved solvent were comparable to the physical changes obtained when Tefzel is placed in CSSX baseline solvent. Therefore, there is no effect of the improved solvent beyond those observed in CSSX baseline solvent...|$|E
