With one day until Blackquill's planned execution, his sister Aura takes several people hostage, including Phoenix's adopted daughter Trucy, demanding that a re-trial of the case is held to convict Athena for Metis's murder. Upon receiving a letter from Maya Fey, Phoenix decides to hold the trial in the courtroom destroyed in the earlier bombing.

With the assistance of Edgeworth, Blackquill, Apollo and Athena, Phoenix manages to break the normally emotionless Phantom, after which the Phantom is shot by an unseen sniper. After proving the Phantom's guilt and Athena's innocence and bringing an end to the dark age, the Wright Anything Agency sees Solomon off as he heads into space.|$|E
