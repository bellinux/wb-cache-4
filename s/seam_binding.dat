Recently, we showed that two human pathogens expressed a derivative of PSA containing de-N-acetyl sialic acid residues (NeuPSA). Here we show that an epitope identified by the anti-NeuPSA monoclonal antibody, SEAM 3 (SEAM 3 -reactive antigen or S 3 RA), is expressed in human melanomas, and also intracellularly in a human melanoma cell line (SK-MEL- 28), a human T cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat), and two neuroblastoma cell lines (CHP- 134 and SH-SY 5 Y). <b>SEAM</b> 3 <b>binding</b> induced apoptosis in the four cell lines tested. The unusual intracellular distribution of S 3 RA was similar to that described for the PSA polysialyltransferases, STX and PST, which are also expressed in the four cell lines used here. Interestingly, suppression of PST mRNA expression by transfection of SK-MEL- 28 cells with PST-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in decreased <b>SEAM</b> 3 <b>binding.</b> The results suggest further studies of th...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{microtubule}} ends {{serve as}} transient binding platforms for essential proteins that regulate microtubule dynamics and {{their interactions with}} cellular substructures. End-binding proteins (EBs) autonomously recognize an extended region at growing microtubule ends with unknown structural characteristics and then recruit other factors to the dynamic end structure. Using cryo-electron microscopy, subnanometer single-particle reconstruction, and fluorescence imaging, we present a pseudoatomic model of how the calponin homology (CH) domain of the fission yeast EB Mal 3 binds to the end regions of growing microtubules. The Mal 3 CH domain bridges protofilaments except at the microtubule <b>seam.</b> By <b>binding</b> close to the exchangeable GTP-binding site, the CH domain is ideally positioned to sense the microtubule's nucleotide state. The same microtubule-end region is also a stabilizing structural cap protecting the microtubule from depolymerization. This insight supports a common structural link between two important biological phenomena, microtubule dynamic instability and end tracking...|$|R
40|$|Microtubule-associated {{proteins}} (MAPs) {{are essential}} for regulating and organizing cellular microtubules (MTs). However, our mechanistic understanding of MAP function is limited {{by a lack of}} detailed structural information. Using cryo-electron microscopy and single particle algorithms, we solved the 8 Å structure of doublecortin (DCX) -stabilized MTs. Because of DCX’s unusual ability to specifically nucleate and stabilize 13 -protofilament MTs, our reconstruction provides unprecedented insight into the structure of MTs with an in vivo architecture, {{and in the absence of}} a stabilizing drug. DCX specifically recognizes the corner of four tubulin dimers, a binding mode ideally suited to stabilizing both lateral and longitudinal lattice contacts. A striking consequence of this is that DCX does not bind the MT <b>seam.</b> DCX <b>binding</b> on the MT surface indirectly stabilizes conserved tubulin–tubulin lateral contacts in the MT lumen, operating independently of the nucleotide bound to tubulin. DCX’s exquisite binding selectivity uncovers important insights into regulation of cellular MTs...|$|R

This coatdress incorporates an androgynous look of design elements of redingote: a feminine silhouette of cowl design of the skirt combined with a large notched collar and a single-breasted front closure. Asymmetrical line of the skirt and the fitted bodice creates informal balance. For the surface design, an inspiration came from The Water Lilies: Setting Suns by Claude Monet. Twisting and tying resist techniques and natural dyes (alkanet, annatto, cutch, and sandalwood) were used to emulate the painter 2 ̆ 7 s dappled brushstrokes and the color schemes.

The strip's fibers, being at 45 degrees {{to the length of}} the strip, makes it stretchier as well as more fluid and more drapeable {{compared}} to a strip that is cut on the grain.

Bias tape is used in making piping, <b>binding</b> <b>seams,</b> finishing raw edges, etc. It is often used on the edges of quilts, placemats, and bibs, around armhole and neckline edges instead of a facing, and as a simple strap or tie for casual bags or clothing.|$|R

40|$|My {{recent study}} of Inca Period {{clothing}} has involved textile collections from three south coastal areas of Peru (Figure 1) : Pachacamac, a large Inca center and temple complex just south of Lima (Uhle 1903 / 1991 : Ch XXI: 89 - 96); Rodadero, a storage facility overlooking the Inca center of Tambo Viejo in the Acari Valley (Katterman and Riddell (1992 : 141 - 167); and Burial House # 2, the western hillside cemetery affiliated with the Inca outpost of Quebrada de La Vaca in the Chala Drainage (Katterman 2003 b). From the burial house (Figure 6), Dorothy Menzel and Francis Riddell collected and documented 120 burials plus an additional 140 items of clothing without burial associations (1954; Von Hagen 1956 : 204). Gold flakes (Figure 7) over the eye orbits of many individuals in the burial chamber, including women and children, attested to their relatively high status. In spite of this, only a few burials at Quebrada de la Vaca West contained clothing of the quality identified as the fine and colorful weft faced garments of the Inca elite (A. Rowe 1997 : 6 - 11; 1978 : 6 - 7). Most garments from the burial chamber were very plainly woven in warp-faced tan cotton yarn. The typical outfit for a male consisted of a large cloak, a tunic (unku), loincloth (wara), small coca bags, and perhaps, a sling or two (Figure 8 a- 8 e). Decoration on male garments was generally confined to seams and embroidered edges. Plain cross looping (Figure 29 a) bound both ends of loincloths. Blanket stitching (Figure 29 d) or overcast (Figure 29 f) served as the base for carrying pairs of colorful yams that crossed between stitches to form attractive patterns {{around the edges of}} cloaks. Exceptions to the plain male garments from the burial chamber appeared in the form of colorful tunics. One of these was a finely woven dark brown tunic (M- 54), Accompanying it in the burial were a plain tan cotton manta woven in two webs (120 x 70 + 70 cm) and bordered with decorative red and yellow yarn carried on blanket stitched base (Figure 29 d); a loincloth (56 x 44 cm) woven in one web like the one in Figure 8 c; and two slings. Bands of red, yellow and brown yarn in close figure- 8 stitching (Figure 29 e) joined the two panels of the dark brown tunic together in the center and under the arms openings. Damage to the tunic did not allow measurements to be taken beyond ascertaining that it had been about 60 cm wide and more than 70 cm long. A rendering of this once handsome tunic appears as Figure 12. A large fragment of another colorful tunic from Quebrada de La Vaca West (X- 5) displayed a pattern of two sets of yellow stripes between less frequent pairs of blue-green stripes on a bright red ground (Figure 5). While only the bottom, lower sides and part of the reinforcement under an armhole remained, this was sufficient to ascertain the construction of the tunic. It was of finely woven camelid yarn, weft-faced, and composed of two long panels seamed together up the center and under the arms. The <b>seams</b> and edge <b>bindings</b> were overcast in colorful bands of red, yellow and blue-green yarn. A decorative band about 0. 7 cm wide clung to parts of the bottom edge. The tunic measured 83 cm across the bottom and 77 cm up to the broken area slightly above the reinforcement under the arm opening Remnants of another camelid tunic with similar striping on a red ground was collected from the nearby site of Pueblo Viejo, and the style must have been somewhat common to the region...|$|R
