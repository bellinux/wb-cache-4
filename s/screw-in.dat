5|$|The {{connectors}} at {{the back}} of the Stage allow the connection of a sustain pedal, a swell pedal for organ, a footswitch to select the rotary speaker emulation speed, and a control pedal to modify effects such as wah-wah. A set of <b>screw-in</b> legs are an available option for the 88 and 76 note models and a custom designed soft case is also available from Clavia. A third party company, Ocean Beach Digital, has manufactured a set of MIDI controlled drawbars for the Nord Stage, for users who prefer to use real drawbars instead of the buttons provided as standard.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions. England's Oldham Athletic, who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing in red and white shirts borrowed from a local rugby league club, and Scotland's Clyde wore khaki. In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with V-necks replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy natural fibres. The first boots to be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by Adidas in 1954. Although they cost {{twice as much as}} existing styles the boots were a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with <b>screw-in</b> studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions. Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war, and Eastern European teams continued to wear kits that were deemed old-fashioned elsewhere. The FC Dynamo Moscow team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew almost as much comment for the players' long baggy shorts as for the quality of their football. With the advent of international competitions such as the European Cup, the southern European style spread {{to the rest of the}} continent and by the end of the decade the heavy shirts and boots of the pre-war years had fallen entirely out of use. The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which looked good under the newly adopted floodlights. Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Screw-in</b> {{moorings}} are {{a modern}} method. The anchor in a <b>screw-in</b> mooring is a shaft with wide blades spiraling around {{it so that}} it can be screwed into the substrate. The advantages include high holding-power-to-weight ratio and small size (and thus relative cheapness). The disadvantage is that a diver is usually needed to install, inspect, and maintain these moorings.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Philips {{introduced}} its model SL, {{which was a}} <b>screw-in</b> or bayonet mount lamp with integral magnetic ballast. The lamp used a folded T4 tube, stable tri-color phosphors, and a mercury amalgam. This was the first successful <b>screw-in</b> replacement for an incandescent lamp. In 1985, Osram started selling its model EL lamp, {{which was the first}} CFL to include an electronic ballast.|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone {{is used in}} transvenous <b>screw-in</b> cardiac pacing {{leads to}} {{minimize}} the inflammatory response of the myocardium. The steroid is released into the myocardium {{as soon as the}} screw is extended and can {{play a significant role in}} minimizing the acute pacing threshold due to the reduction of inflammatory response. The typical quantity present in a lead tip is less than 1.0mg.|$|E
25|$|Fibers are {{terminated}} in connectors {{that hold}} the fiber end precisely and securely. A fiber-optic connector is basically a rigid cylindrical barrel surrounded by a sleeve that holds the barrel in its mating socket. The mating mechanism can be push and click, turn and latch (bayonet mount), or <b>screw-in</b> (threaded). The barrel is typically free to move within the sleeve, and may have a key that prevents the barrel and fiber from rotating as the connectors are mated.|$|E
25|$|The DIN fitting {{is a type}} {{of direct}} <b>screw-in</b> {{connection}} to the cylinder. The DIN system is less common worldwide, but has the advantage of withstanding greater pressure, up to 300 bar, allowing use of high-pressure steel cylinders. They are less susceptible to blowing the O-ring seal if banged against something while in use. DIN fittings are the standard in much of Europe and are available in most countries. The DIN fitting is considered more secure and therefore safer by many technical divers.|$|E
25|$|Dump valves {{are used}} to release air from the bag when in the water. They can be {{operated}} manually at the valve by a diver or may be remotely operated by a pull-cord, which may be operated by a diver or attached to a weight which will automatically open the valve if the weight is lifted off the bottom. Some dump valves can be operated in both these ways. One system operates by pressing on the top or pulling a line attached to the bottom to actuate the spring-loaded valve. The dump valve may be a <b>screw-in</b> quick change system, and the spring tension may be adjustable.|$|E
2500|$|In modern archery with <b>screw-in</b> points, {{right-hand}} rotation is generally preferred {{as it makes}} the points self-tighten. [...] In traditional archery, some archers prefer a left rotation because it gets the hard (and sharp) quill of the feather {{farther away from the}} arrow-shelf and the shooter's hand.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chinstrap}} is {{secured to}} {{each side of the}} cap with a silver-colored, <b>screw-in,</b> metal button bearing an updated and simplified version of the [...] "Hap Arnold emblem" [...] first designed by James T. Rawls for use by the Air Force's predecessor, the Army Air Forces, in 1942. Apart from the screw-back, the buttons are of the same design as those used to secure the uniform coat's epaulets and pockets.|$|E
2500|$|Early K-M20 {{models from}} 1939 {{were made from}} {{standard}} civilian parts {{with the addition of}} military fittings, such as a [...] large 8-inch Lucas DUl42 headlight (fitted with a black out mask), a timing-gear cover with a <b>screw-in</b> plug for access to the magneto drive-pinion nut and special filler caps for the petrol and oil tanks. These early military M20 models were also fitted with a long spiked prop stand on the rear nearside pivoted from a lug brazed on to the rear frame tube. Factory ledgers show that BSA exported K-M20 models to Sweden, South Africa and India, as well as civilian dealers and distributors.|$|E
2500|$|Table lamp wire is {{typically}} #18, while extension cords are #16, with #14 common on cords grounded for outdoor use, and #12 available. [...] Mini Christmas lights were mostly #24 through 1997, when that gauge was arbitrarily de-rated from 3 to 2.5 amps, preventing manufacturers from getting UL certification {{for the same}} products which had already been approved {{for more than two}} decades. [...] They were forced to use the formerly heavy-duty standard of #22 wire (itself de-rated from 5 to 4 amps), plus thicker insulation, which in turn caused them to shortchange customers by drastically shortening the light socket spacing and usable length of sets. [...] This change also made light strings stiff and unsightly. [...] Heavy-duty mini lights are now 20 AWG, with larger <b>screw-in</b> bulbs having sockets on 18 AWG lamp wire.|$|E
50|$|A {{more secure}} lens cap is the metal <b>screw-in</b> lens cap which cannot pop off a lens accidentally. Although a <b>screw-in</b> cap takes {{more time to}} remove {{in order to take}} a {{photograph}} than a standard lens cap, it is stronger than plastic and therefore more protective.|$|E
50|$|Freshwater {{aquarium}} {{lighting is}} commonly provided by <b>screw-in</b> incandescent bulbs, fluorescent tubes and LED lamps. Incandescent lighting is becoming less popular because it uses much more energy and produces more heat {{than the other}} lighting types. Compact fluorescent lighting with a compatible <b>screw-in</b> base is frequently used as a direct replacement for incandescent bulbs.|$|E
50|$|Bonnets provide {{leakproof}} closure for {{the valve}} body. Gate valves {{may have a}} <b>screw-in,</b> union, or bolted bonnet. <b>Screw-in</b> bonnet is the simplest, offering a durable, pressure-tight seal. Union bonnet is suitable for applications requiring frequent inspection and cleaning. It also gives the body added strength. Bolted bonnet is used for larger valves and higher pressure applications.|$|E

50|$|<b>Screw-in</b> studs {{have been}} banned in some Australian rules {{football}} leagues since the 1990s due to the frequency of severe injuries to players {{as a result of}} contact with the metal. In football, referees must now check all boots prior to kick off to check for damage to studs, to prevent injury. Before this time, preference between the <b>screw-in</b> stud was based primarily on weather conditions.|$|E
50|$|Wheel studs are {{replaceable}} {{and come}} in two basic kinds: press-in and <b>screw-in.</b> Welded-in studs are possible but unlikely to be encountered.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Screw-in</b> insert nuts have an {{external}} thread and hex head and are screwed {{in with a}} Flat Blade Screwdriver or an Allen wrench. The <b>screw-in</b> insert nuts come in various sizes and take different screw sizes. For example, a [...] "1/4-20" [...] insert nut will take a 1/4-20 inch bolt. The pre-drilled hole must be as deep as {{the length of the}} insert nut plus any portion of the bolt that may be screwed past the end of the nut in the work piece.|$|E
50|$|An {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} SPR100 has a nickel-plated receiver, walnut stock and fore-end, and <b>screw-in</b> choke tubes. This variant is a 12 gauge with a -inch barrel.|$|E
5000|$|... 1940-1960: After the Second World War, {{the designs}} of the {{football}} boot changed dramatically and really started {{to make an impact}} on the game. The South Americans designed a lighter and more flexible boot. This design was focused on increasing good control and better kicking power rather than a more protective boot. In 1954 Adi Dassler introduced <b>screw-in</b> studs which gave the Mannschaft a tangible advantage during a rain-lashed World Cup that year. That Adolf was the first to come up with <b>screw-in</b> studs is disputed by his older brother, Rudolf Dassler, founder of Puma.|$|E
50|$|A common low-budget {{pyrotechnic}} flash pot {{is built}} using modified <b>screw-in</b> electric fuses {{in a common}} light fixture. The fuses are intentionally blown, acting as ignitors for a pyrotechnic material.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, {{the studs}} on Australian rules {{football}} boots are traditionally {{referred to as}} [...] "stops". [...] Prior to modern molded plastic soles, these were often replaceable <b>screw-in</b> wooden studs.|$|E
50|$|The bonnet {{provides}} a leakproof closure for the valve body. The threaded {{section of the}} stem goes through a hole with matching threads in the bonnet. Globe valves may have a <b>screw-in,</b> union, or bolted bonnet. <b>Screw-in</b> bonnet is the simplest bonnet, offering a durable, pressure-tight seal. Union bonnet is suitable for applications requiring frequent inspection or cleaning. It also gives the body added strength. A bonnet attached with bolts is used for larger or higher pressure applications. The bonnet also contains the packing, a wearable material that maintains the seal between the bonnet and the stem during valve cycling.|$|E
