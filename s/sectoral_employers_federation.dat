40|$|The {{first section}} of this article recalls the most {{important}} organisational features of the cross-industry players in the European social dialogue (UNICE, UEAPME, CEEP). Four <b>sectoral</b> <b>employer</b> <b>federations</b> (WEM, Euratex, FIEC, EuroCommerce), selected on grounds of the specific nature of their profile, are also analysed here {{in view of the}} increasing importance currently taken on by the sectoral social dialogue. The second part of the article reports on the achievements of the social dialogue as seen by the employers. This dialogue has seen at least two salient events: in 1991, when the cross-industry social partners signed an agreement laying down collective bargaining practices; and more recently when a first voluntary agreement on telework was concluded. This agreement represents for the European employers, as for the trade unions, a radical change in terms of affirming their autonomy in drawing up their work programme and in the way that negotiated solutions are implemented. This has also been a period of consolidation for UNICE as a body representing Europe's employers, while CEEP has embarked on new – territorial – forms of representation. As for UEAPME, a peripheral body in the early 1990 s, it has gradually asserted itself as a fully-fledged protagonist in the social dialogue...|$|R
