Remote sensing techniques provide promising possibilities to map land use/land cover classes since remotely sensed data covers a large area with periodic synoptic view. The Kingdom of <b>Saudia</b> <b>Arabia</b> contributed significantly to world date production. The Qassim region of central <b>Saudia</b> <b>Arabia</b> is considered as one of most famous producing area locally, regionally and internationally. In this study Enhanced thematic satellite scene of path 168 and row 43 acquired on 28. 08. 1999 was used. Unsupervised classification approach was used. Three major land use/land cover classes were determined viz hilly area (1232566. 06 ha), vegetated land (1663389. 88 ha) and sand dunes (470068. 08 ha). The vegetated land constitutes the first class, mainly the Wadis, and it is mainly devoted to dates production. Hilly unproductive areas constitute the second class. Finally, {{it is obvious that}} sand dunes cover {{a large proportion of the}} study area. It is worth to mention that sand dunes surround the vegetated land, which in turn will lead to the loss of some of the productive lands through sand encroachment. This fact necessitates the adoption of suitable management practices to retard and, if possible, to stop sand encroachment...|$|E

Until now, hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) and calixarene {{were the only two}} reported negative resists that could approach sub- 10 -nm half-pitch resolution for electron-beam lithography. Here, the authors report that 10 -nm half-pitch dense nanostructures can also be readily fabricated using the well known poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resist operating in negative tone, even at exposure energies as low as 2 keV. In addition to scanning electron microscopy metrology, transmission electron microscopy metrology was done to confirm the high-resolution capability of negative-tone PMMA. This process was compared to HSQ with salty development and showed similar ultimate resolution, so it could be used as an alternative for applications incompatible with HSQ.

Particularly, locally matching demand and generation {{in the form of}} microgrids is becoming a promising alternative to the central distribution paradigm. Infrastructure networks have long been a major focus of complex networks research with their spatial considerations. We present a systemic study of solar-powered microgrids in the urban context, obeying real hourly consumption patterns and spatial constraints of the city. We propose a microgrid model and study its citywide implementation, identifying the self-sufficiency and temporal properties of microgrids. Using a simple optimization scheme, we find microgrid configurations that result in increased resilience under cost constraints. We characterize load-related failures solving power flows in the networks, and we show the robustness behavior of urban microgrids with respect to optimization using percolation methods. Our findings hint at the existence of an optimal balance between cost and robustness in urban microgrids.

Methods: Questionnaire based study was conducted in family medicine training centers across the six cities representing all the regions of the Saudi Arabia.

Results: About 85 % of the residents believe that they should have a half day clinical attachment in family medicine training center every week throughout the whole program, 43 % claimed {{that they do not have}} enough time for case discussion with their supervisor. Forty percent residents were not closely supervised by full time trainer; 60 % believe that they were treated as service residents rather than trainees in family medicine. In addition, 64 % stated that their training centers do not carry video camera facilities for training purposes and 74 % believe that the community medicine course should be run by family medicine and community medicine trainers rather than community medicine alone. Furthermore, 50 % prefer intergrated course rather than block system and 59 % believe that the easily accessible facilities were available such as library, internet, audio-visual aids and 42 % thought that their centers were not supported by enough numbers of full time trainers.

RESULTS: The records showed that a total of 95 healthy children and 80 medically compromised children were treated during this period. The mean number of dental procedures (15. 6) for healthy child was significantly higher than the medically compromised child (14. 0). A significantly greater number of extractions were carried out in medically compromised children. The number of composite and stainless steel crown restorations and pulpal procedures was significantly greater in healthy children, while the number of amalgam restorations and sealants was significantly higher in medically compromised children.
