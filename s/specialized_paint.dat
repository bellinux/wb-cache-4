50|$|In 2011 {{it emerged}} that since early 2009 {{the office of}} Prime Minister Stephen Harper had {{repeatedly}} requested that the CC-150 configured for VIP use be repainted from the gun-metal military paint scheme it shared with the other CC-150s to a <b>specialized</b> <b>paint</b> scheme. The Department of National Defence, including Minister Peter MacKay, had resisted this request, noting that it was contrary to its multi-role nature and would compromise the aircraft's potential to safely transport personnel into a combat zone. The decision was ultimately made to repaint the craft during its next scheduled heavy maintenance.|$|E

5000|$|Production of Benjarong is {{a process}} known to only small {{communities}} of Thai artists which have passed down the knowledge from generation to generation. The artisan who makes Benjarong {{has to be very}} skillful and careful. The production process is needs a skilled labor. How the Benjarong is made and how the patterns are painted, are glamorous and all considered as the masterpieces. In the porcelain selection, only white porcelain (Bone China and Royal Porcelain) which had been fired at the proper temperature (1150-1280 degree Celsius) for many hours, are selected. White ware must not have any flaw. After we get all required white wares, cleaning is the next process. During this process, it is necessary to avoid oily surface from sweaty and dirty hand. In drawing process, we use hypodermic syringe or paint brush to draw line. The process begins with drawing the circular guide lines on the Thai porcelain on a turning wheel, which is manually controlled. While drawing on the design, the artist will keep the sample pattern in front of him so he can draw the pattern correctly. The initial pattern drawing is very crucial to how the design will turn out, so it will be done by the well-experienced artist (usually drawn by a master craftsman). This is the reason why the pattern is drawn in very fine lines on each Benjarong. In painting process, there are various colors of paint but basically we use five main colors (black, green, yellow, red and white). The <b>specialized</b> <b>paint</b> for Benjarong needs a skillful painter. The paint is made from mineral colors and must be well crushed and mixed with water in proper ratio. The crushing equipment is ceramic or equivalent material mortar. The paint should not be too thick or thin. If the paint is too thick, it will not be completely fired and the color will not be shown as expected. If the paint is too thin, the color will fade. Also, the paint must not overlap with any line of the other color. At the final stage of painting, the 18 karat gold might be added to the rims {{in order to make it}} look glamorous. The next step after painting is firing. Painted wares will be put in the kiln. The spaces between them are 0.5 - 1 cm unless you want the painted wares to touch each other and might get damaged to pattern that painted after firing. The temperature in the kiln is controlled between 800 to 1000◦C and takes about 10 hours firing time. The Benjarong must be put in the kiln five times. After finished firing, the Benjarong will be cooled down; then take it off from the kiln. Once the Benjarong has been fired, it can be seen as three dimensional bubble of paint on the surface, which is the reason why Benjarong is unique. At the end of production, there will a quality control. The slightest mistake in any process would ruin the design and fame of Benjarong. Any mistake is unacceptable. Benjarong supposed to be perfect in every respect. If the mistake is found, it will be sent back to the studio or might throw it away. In fact, this is very rare to happen because during each stage the artists take good care of each individual piece. (Blobiztar Company Limited) ...|$|E
40|$|The rotors {{of certain}} {{helicopters}} can spin at speeds {{as high as}} 500 revolutions per minute. As the blades slice through the air, they flex, moving into the wind and back out, experiencing pressure changes {{on the order of}} thousands of times a second and even higher. All of this makes acquiring a true understanding of rotorcraft aerodynamics a difficult task. A traditional means of acquiring aerodynamic data is to conduct wind tunnel tests using a vehicle model outfitted with pressure taps and other sensors. These sensors add significant costs to wind tunnel testing while only providing measurements at discrete locations on the model's surface. In addition, standard sensor solutions do not work for pulling data from a rotor in motion. "Typical static pressure instrumentation can't handle that," explains Neal Watkins, electronics engineer in Langley Research Center s Advanced Sensing and Optical Measurement Branch. "There are dynamic pressure taps, but your costs go up by a factor of five to ten if you use those. In addition, recovery of the pressure tap readings is accomplished through slip rings, which allow only a limited amount of sensors and can require significant maintenance throughout a typical rotor test. " One alternative to sensor-based wind tunnel testing is pressure sensitive paint (PSP). A coating of a <b>specialized</b> <b>paint</b> containing luminescent material is applied to the model. When exposed to an LED or laser light source, the material glows. The glowing material tends to be reactive to oxygen, explains Watkins, which causes the glow to diminish. The more oxygen that is present (or the more air present, since oxygen exists in a fixed proportion in air), the less the painted surface glows. Imaged with a camera, the areas experiencing greater air pressure show up darker than areas of less pressure. "The paint allows for a global pressure map as opposed to specific points," says Watkins. With PSP, each pixel recorded by the camera becomes an optical pressure tap. "Instead of having 100 or 200 pressure taps, you can have in theory several million, up to whatever the resolution of your camera is. " Watkins explains that typical wind tunnel testing requires two models: one with very little instrumentation, and a pressure model with a significant amount of sensors applied. "If you can make all of your measurements on one model with PSP, you've decreased your model costs by at least a factor of two and preferably your testing costs by about that much," he says. PSP technology has been around for almost 20 years, but a PSP solution for gathering instantaneous dynamic pressure data from surfaces moving at high speeds, such as rotor blades, was not available until a NASA partnership led to a game-changing innovation...|$|E
