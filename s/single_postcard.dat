50|$|Pedro {{involves}} the title character, a small anthropomorphic airplane from an airport near Santiago, Chile, engaging in {{his very first}} flight to pick up air mail from Mendoza, with disastrous results occurring when near Aconcagua, and again while chasing a vulture on the return journey. And to make matters worse, Pedro gets caught in a terrible storm! But, he makes {{it back to the}} airfield safe and sound with the mail, revealed to only be a <b>single</b> <b>postcard.</b> This segment was later released theatrically as an independent short, on May 13, 1955 by RKO Pictures.|$|E
5000|$|According to the magazine, the superrational {{thing was}} for each {{contestant}} to roll a simulated die {{with the number}} of sides equal to the number of expected responders (about 5% of the readership), and then send [...] "1" [...] if you roll [...] "1". If all contestants had followed this strategy, it is probable that the magazine would have received a <b>single</b> <b>postcard,</b> with a [...] "1", and would have had to pay a million dollars to the sender of that postcard. Reputedly the publisher and owners were very concerned about betting the company on a game.|$|E
5000|$|A similar game, {{referred}} to as a [...] "Luring Lottery", was actually played by the editors of Scientific American in the 1980s. To enter the contest once, readers had to send in a postcard with the number [...] "1" [...] written on it. They were also explicitly permitted to submit as many entries as they wished by sending in a <b>single</b> <b>postcard</b> bearing the number of entries they wished to submit. The prize was one million dollars divided {{by the total number of}} entries received, to be awarded to the submitter of a randomly chosen entry. Thus a reader who submitted a large number of entries increased his or her chances of winning but reduced the maximum possible value of the prize. It can be shown mathematically that one maximizes one's average winnings in this game by submitting a number of entries equal to the total number of entries of others. Of course, if others take this into account, then this strategy translates into a runaway reaction to unbounded number of entries being submitted.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1991 DMC {{released}} a 12" [...] vinyl <b>single</b> with the <b>Postcards</b> from the Edge Mix by Brothers in Rhythm.|$|R

5000|$|The {{next year}} P&T issued a simple, single postal {{card with a}} purple 10 Chhetrum {{imprinted}} stamp showing crossed dorjis or vajras. At {{the same time a}} reply post card pair was released as well with the same crossed dorjis imprinted stamps. This reply pair had the size and dimensions of two combined <b>single</b> <b>postcards.</b> Furthermore, that year a set of 10 postcards was released, each postcard showing on the front a drawing of a different dzong or lhakhang, each in a different, single color, drawn in a light, modern style. The set was stapled together with a single metal staple and an off-white paper cover on top with the words [...] "Dzong Series", [...] "10 Post Cards" [...] and [...] "His Majestyâ€™s Govt. of Bhutan" [...] printed on it in capital letters. These postcards are in principle an overprint on the single postal card, carrying the same imprint of a purple, crossed dorjis 10 Chhetrum stamp.|$|R
50|$|This <b>single</b> {{contains}} collector's <b>postcards</b> {{of classic}} Def Leppard album covers. It contains the On Through the Night, High 'n' Dry, Pyromania and Hysteria postcards, with band members {{comments on the}} back.|$|R

The band's second album, Rip It Up followed in November 1982. Their single [...] "Rip It Up", released in early 1983, reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and was noted {{as the first}} British hit single to feature a bass-line from the Roland TB-303 synthesizer. The song was their only Top 40 single.|$|R

[...] 'Seize The Night', the third <b>single</b> from <b>Postcards</b> From Ursa Minor, was included on NPR's Austin 100 list for the annual SXSW festival.|$|R
5000|$|The Glasgow School is a {{compilation}} album by the Scottish band Orange Juice, released in 2005. It contains the bands four <b>singles</b> for <b>Postcard</b> Records, {{the greater part}} of the 1992 compilation album Ostrich Churchyard (which contains early versions of tracks that later appeared on the 1982 album You Cant Hide Your Love Forever), an alternate version of [...] "Simply Thrilled Honey", and a cover of [...] "I Dont Care" [...] by the Ramones. This material was all recorded between 1978 and 1981, prior to the band signing with Polydor Records.|$|R

The 7-inch single was also {{available}} in a limited edition boxed packaging containing the <b>single</b> and three <b>postcards.</b> The 12-inch <b>single</b> and the boxed 7-inch single had the same picture on the front covers as the standard edition 7-inch single.|$|R
5000|$|Pencaitland is {{also the}} {{location}} of recording studio Castle Sound Studios, founded by producer Calum Malcolm in 1979 [...] and sited in a building which formerly housed Pencaitland Primary School until it moved to an area known as The Glebe in the 1970s. The band Orange Juice recorded their first two <b>singles</b> for the <b>Postcard</b> Records label at Castle Sound. Simple Minds, Runrig, REM, Martyn Bennett and The Blue Nile have also recorded there.|$|R
5000|$|In 1983 Aztec Camera {{released}} High Land, Hard Rain, {{their first}} album on Rough Trade Records; although, the album {{did not include}} the first two <b>Postcard</b> <b>singles.</b> The album's opening song [...] "Oblivious" [...] was a hit single and Aztec Camera were consequently recognised as one of the key acts on the Rough Trade label. On tracks such as [...] "Walk Out to Winter" [...] and [...] "Back on Board", Frame sang poetic lyrics about love, both lost and found, themes that he would revisit on subsequent Aztec Camera albums. The album also garnered attention for the band in the United States (US) and American magazine Creem published a review following its initial release that proclaimed: [...] ""The world ain't perfect. But High Land, Hard Rain comes close." ...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1960 s Peter Downsbrough (1940) {{has been an}} {{important}} figure in contemporary art, associated with major international art movements such as minimal art, conceptual art, and visual poetry. In his artistic work he explores various fields including sculpture, architecture, books, film, and photography. This book provides, for the first time, a profound insight into Downsbrough's diverse and complex use of photography within his artistic work over the last 40 years. A substantial essay by Alexander Streitberger discusses the artist's photographic work - which includes <b>single</b> prints, series, <b>postcards,</b> collages, and books - within its aesthetic and historical context. Streitberger relates Downsbrough's work to fundamental issues of photographic practice and discourse such as the photograph as document, the representation of urban space, space-time relations, collage as an aesthetic and political means of expression, the relationship between still and moving image, and the context of presentation. The rich image material - some of which has never been published before - is arranged by the artist himself {{in order to create a}} fertile exchange between the topics of the text and his own intervention. Concluding with an exclusive interview with the artist, this book offers a real dialogue between artistic practice and theoretical reflexion...|$|R
