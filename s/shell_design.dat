25|$|The {{first major}} update to its {{handheld}} line since 1989, Game Boy Advance features improved technical specifications {{similar to those}} of the SNES. The Game Boy Advance SP was the first revision to the GBA line and introduced screen lighting and a clam <b>shell</b> <b>design,</b> while later iteration, the Game Boy Micro, brought a smaller form factor.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of 1960, the factory {{employed}} forty-three workers, the Grantura Mk1 production was ending (with a total of 100 cars produced), and the Mk2 body <b>shell</b> <b>design</b> was nearly ready. TVR had distributors selling cars in the UK, including David Buxton Ltd. in Derby and Bill Last in Woodbridge, Suffolk. In January 1961, Keith Aitchison and Bryan Hopton (of the Aitchison-Hopton Lotus/TVR dealer in Chester) expressed interest in investing in TVR. During the summer, Bernard Williams attempted to cement their interest by offering a Climax-powered Grantura Mk2 to the two men for a drive to the Monza circuit in Italy. During the trip, {{a portion of the}} exhaust system fell off the car on two separate occasions, but the two men were nonetheless impressed with the car's performance.|$|E
500|$|Later in the year, Amtrak {{began an}} {{accelerated}} repair {{program on the}} unmodified cars, which had logged over [...] in revenue service, but very few cars were actually repaired. By the end of 1975, out-of-service rate was still 27.5%, and many trains ran with fewer cars than demand called for. In February 1976, Amtrak cut Metroliner service from 15 to 13 round trips {{because of the lack}} of serviceable cars. In August, Budd unveiled the SPV-2000, a Rail Diesel Car successor built with the Metroliner <b>shell</b> <b>design.</b> Although heavily marketed, the SPV-2000s were extremely unreliable and never achieved the widespread use of the Metroliners and Amfleets.|$|E

2500|$|Borealis I {{featured}} a major redesign from the tried-and-true cutout car. Instead {{of a flat}} shell with a [...] "bubble" [...] canopy, the team used an innovative [...] "manta" [...] <b>shell</b> <b>design,</b> where the windshield and canopy are integrated {{into the body of}} the car. Also, nearly all other systems were redesigned for higher performance.|$|E
2500|$|The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, the {{earliest}} surviving Islamic building, {{was completed in}} 691 by Umayyad caliph Abd Al-Malik. Its design {{was that of a}} ciborium, or reliquary, such as those common to Byzantine martyria and the major Christian churches of the city. The rotunda of the nearby Church of the Holy Sepulchre, in particular, has a similar design and almost the same dimensions. The dome, a double <b>shell</b> <b>design</b> made of wood, is 20.44 meters in diameter. The dome's bulbous shape [...] "probably dates from the eleventh century." [...] Several restorations since 1958 to address structural damage have resulted in the extensive replacement of tiles, mosaics, ceilings, and walls such that [...] "nearly everything that one sees in this marvelous building was put there {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century", but without significant change to its original form and structure. It is currently covered in gilded aluminum.|$|E
2500|$|The NFTA has a {{fleet of}} 27 (originally 29) rigid-bodied (non-articulated) LRVs for the Metro Rail system, {{numbered}} sequentially from 101-127. They were built by Tokyu Car Corporation of Japan in 1983. The cars' body <b>shell</b> <b>design</b> is notably {{similar to that of}} the earlier articulated US Standard Light Rail Vehicle, whose shells were also fabricated by Tokyu Car Corp. for Boeing Vertol. The cars have a maximum service speed of , but trains run at [...] in the above-ground section of the line. There are three sliding doors on each side of each LRV; these doors can be opened by passengers by push buttons on the outside wall of the train when trains are stopped at stations on the above-ground section of the line. However, in practice, train operators typically open all doors and extend all the retractable staircases at all above-stations. The NFTA acquired twelve PCC streetcars from the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority in 1990 for service on the never-built Tonawandas branch. They were later sold to the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|Some designs offer higher {{resistance}} to space debris. For example, the B330 provides ballistic protection superior to traditional aluminum <b>shell</b> <b>designs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The M360 105mm Cartridge was a {{chemical}} artillery <b>shell</b> <b>designed</b> {{for use by}} the U.S. Army. It carried approximately 1.6 pounds of GB.|$|R
50|$|Extended range shells are {{sometimes}} used. These special <b>shell</b> <b>designs</b> may be Rocket Assisted Projectiles (RAP) or base bleed to increase range. The first {{has a small}} rocket motor built into its base to provide additional thrust. The second has a pyrotechnic device in its base that bleeds gas to fill the partial vacuum created behind the shell and hence reduce base-drag. These <b>shell</b> <b>designs</b> usually have reduced HE filling to remain within the permitted weight for the projectile, and hence less lethality.|$|R

40|$|NASA {{sponsored}} composites {{research and}} development programs were set in place to develop the critical engineering technologies in large transport aircraft structures. This NASA-Boeing program focused on the critical issues of damage tolerance and pressure containment generic to the fuselage structure of large pressurized aircraft. Skin-stringer and honeycomb sandwich composite fuselage <b>shell</b> <b>designs</b> were evaluated to resolve these issues. Analyses were developed to model the structural response of the fuselage <b>shell</b> <b>designs,</b> and a development test program evaluated the selected design configurations to appropriate load conditions...|$|R

50|$|The NHL {{subsequently}} {{passed a}} rule that teams had to wear short pants and home and away socks from the 1983-84 season onwards.

50|$|Similar to {{incendiary}} shells were star <b>shells,</b> <b>designed</b> for illumination {{rather than}} arson. Sometimes called lightballs {{they were in}} use from the 17th Century onwards. The British adopted parachute lightballs in 1866 for 10, 8 and 5 inch calibres. The 10-inch wasn't officially declared obsolete until 1920.|$|R

5000|$|Scoop Proof {{describe}} a longer <b>shell</b> <b>design</b> on the pin half (plug or receptacle) of a connector. The longer shell allows the pin contacts—protruding {{from the face}} of the connector—to be recessed sufficiently so as not to be damaged if the mating shell is [...] "scooped" [...] into it during mating process. This prevents pins from being bent or contacts from being electrically shorted during mating.|$|E
50|$|Documentation {{published}} in 2010 disproved the decades long {{belief that the}} modified P5's new <b>shell</b> <b>design</b> came first and was then applied to the GG1, R1, and eventually the DD2.
