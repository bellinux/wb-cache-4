30|$|In this section, we have {{described}} the articulation between mobility, insurance, and remittances that form what we call sequential transnational social protection arrangements. Female MDWs who use these arrangements usually combine less privileged positions in racial and class terms. Their residence abroad and their family obligations in the homeland often add-up negatively and restrict their family’s and their own access to formal healthcare. This situation stimulates the use of remittances and community solidarity to access healthcare here and there. With <b>sequential</b> <b>arrangements,</b> it is primarily female {{members of the family}} who exchange items of equivalent value but at different points in time. As these families have restricted access to formal healthcare in sending and receiving societies, women have taken up the moral obligation to protect each other.

We hypothesized that variability can affect preferences by influencing the contiguity of food ingestion as young animals learn to forage. To test this hypothesis, we fed lambs two biochemically different foods, one with tannins (T— 55. 5 % beet pulp, 30 % grape pomace, 4. 5 % soybean meal, 10 % quebracho tannin; 2. 4 Mcal, 8 % CP) and one without tannins (NT— 35 % barley grain, 62 % alfalfa hay, 3 % soybean meal; 3. 0 Mcal, 15 % CP) in two temporal arrangements: (1) dissociated in two separate feeding bouts (Group 1; Delayed arrangement) or (2) associated in a sequence in the same feeding bout (Group 2; <b>Sequential</b> <b>arrangement).</b> We then determined if these different associations influenced choice of foods and foraging locations. In Trials 1 and 2, NT and T were both at location 1, whereas either NT or T, respectively, was at location 2. In Trials 3 and 4, the choices were similar, but the NT offered was reduced to half the average intake in Trials 1 and 2. Throughout the trials, both groups of lambs preferred NT to T and they spent more time at locations where NT was present.

30|$|Because {{of their}} privileged access to social {{protection}} in destination countries and their lower use of remittances to address relatives’ health {{needs in the}} homeland, we qualify the healthcare negotiations of this second group as sporadic transnational healthcare arrangements. With sporadic arrangements, equivalence is less precise and {{the sequence of events}} is less narrowly bounded. In this case, the more favorable class, ethnic and educational positions of female migrants support a different system of reciprocity with relatives in the homeland. This particular standpoint also helps them counter-balance the effects of their underprivileged position as migrant domestic workers in Europe. Sporadic arrangements articulate favorable access to mobility for migrants and non-migrant relatives, recourse to market-based health solutions in the homeland and a more limited use of remittances. Within these arrangements, female migrants continue to play a critical role as organizers of the family’s access to health but —because of their more favorable class status in the homeland— support of other family members in the homeland (including men) is also more frequent.

40|$|In recent years, {{evolutionary}} biology {{has been the}} focus of post-Darwinist theories superseding the mere notion of variation with a concept called evolutionary development. The theory of evolutionary development, commonly referred to as evo-devo, follows a series of observations on the nature of organic developments and natural morphologies. Its main contribution rests on an evolutionary model that considers the similarities of genetic material forming organisms and their differences in morphological development due to switching mechanisms between the assigned genes. As observed by the American biologist Sean Carroll, evolution follows regulatory sequences of selector genes that are similar and can be found across various species of insects, plants and animals. This observation represents a counter-proposal to the old-modern evolutionary theories that looked at processes of adaptation as a function of the emergence of new genes. Evo-devo, on the contrary, recognizes that morphological differences are triggered by recombinatory switches that re-arrange genes in manifold ways to produce numerous characteristics of adaptation. From a design point of view, evo-devo has tremendous implications because it suggests that generative design protocols may induce sets of similar operations, yet stimulate a wide range of morphologies according to their <b>sequential</b> <b>arrangements</b> and activities. These generative design strategies include, among others, computational methods such as structural shape annealing and object-oriented analysis and design.

40|$|There {{have been}} many {{attempts}} at defining the electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) without a universally accepted definition. This lack of consensus arises because the EEG expression of NCSE {{does not exist in}} isolation, but reflects status epilepticus under the variety of pathologic conditions that occur with age, cerebral development, encephalopathy, and epilepsy syndrome. Current NCSE definitions include "boundary conditions," in which electroencephalographic seizure activity occurs without apparent clinical seizures. Furthermore, what appears to one interpreter as status epilepticus, is not to another reader, reflecting the "art" of EEG interpretation. Seizures and epilepsy syndromes have undergone an evolution that has moved beyond a classification of focal or generalized conditions into a syndromic approach. It seems appropriate to make similar changes in the EEG analysis of the syndromes of NCSE. In effect, the literature on epilepsy classification has progressed to incorporate the different NCSE types with clinical descriptions, but the specific EEG evidence for these types is found largely in individual reports, and often by description only. NCSE classification of EEG patterns should derive from the aggregate of published EEG patterns in the respective clinical subtype, supported by an analysis of these EEG studies. The analysis that follows presents clinical descriptions and EEG patterns of NCSE in the neonatal period, infancy, childhood, adulthood, and late adulthood from a syndromic perspective based on age, encephalopathy, cerebral development, etiology, and syndrome. Proceeding from the proposed classification of status epilepticus syndromes in "Status epilepticus: its clinical features and treatment in children and adults" (published in 1994 by Cambridge University Press, New York), we have performed a systematic search for reports presenting EEG patterns of NCSE using the online medical search engine PubMed for 22 different search strategies. EEG patterns were reviewed by two board-certified epileptologists who reached consensus regarding presence of NCSE.

Spatial capture-recapture models provide an advantage over non-spatial models by explicitly accounting for heterogeneous detection probabilities among individuals that arise due to the spatial organization of individuals relative to sampling devices. We simulated black bear (Ursus americanus) populations and spatial capture-recapture data to evaluate the influence of trap configuration and trap spacing on estimates of population size and a spatial scale parameter, sigma, that relates to home range size. We varied detection probability and home range size, and considered three trap configurations common to large-mammal mark-recapture studies: regular spacing, clustered, and a temporal sequence of different cluster configurations (i. e., trap relocation). We explored trap spacing and number of traps per cluster by varying the number of traps.

50|$|Social monogamy in mammals {{is defined}} as a long term or <b>sequential</b> living <b>arrangement</b> between an adult male and an adult female (heterogeneous pair). It should not be {{confused}} with genetic monogamy, which refers to two individuals who only reproduce with one another. Social monogamy does not describe the sexual interactions or patterns of reproduction between monogamous pairs; rather it strictly refers to the patterns of their living conditions. This arrangement consists of, but is not limited to: sharing the same territory; obtaining food resources; and raising offspring together. A unique characteristic of monogamy is that unlike in polygamous species, parents share parenting tasks. Even though their tasks are shared, monogamy does not define the degree of paternal investment in the breeding of the young. Only ~3-5% of all mammalian species are socially monogamous, including some species that mate for life and ones that mate for an extended period of time. Lifelong monogamy is very rare; however, it is exemplified by species such as the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster). A vast majority of monogamous mammals practice sequential social monogamy where another male or female is accepted into a new partnership in the case of a partner’s death. In addition, there are some species that exhibit short-term monogamy which involves partnership termination while one's partner is still alive; however, it lasts for at least one breeding season. Monogamy usually does not occur in groups where there is a high abundance of females, but rather in ones where females occupy large ranges.|$|R

40|$|Downsizing is an {{established}} {{trend in the}} development of passenger car engines. However, the benefits of an improved fuel economy are often obtained {{at the expense of the}} engine’s dynamic response (owing to increasing demands on the boosting system) and, consequently, the vehicle driveability. The use of a continuously variable transmission in the supercharger driveline offers increased control flexibility over the air path, which could allow more suitable calibrations to be developed. This paper gives details of a co-simulation-based investigation into the trade-off between the steady-state part-load fuel efficiency and the resulting tip-in transient response for a highly boosted downsized gasoline engine. The engine was a 2. 0 l in-line four-cylinder unit, designed to replace a 5. 0 l, naturally aspirated V 8, equipped with a positive displacement supercharger in a <b>sequential</b> series <b>arrangement</b> with a fixed-geometry turbocharger with an external wastegate. The supercharger can be de-clutched and bypassed, and therefore three separate supercharger engagement regimes were investigated for part-load operation, defined as follows: with the supercharger disengaged and bypassed; with the supercharger engaged with a fixed drive ratio; with the supercharger engaged using a variable ratio (i. e. through a continuously variable transmission). For each of these supercharger engagement regimes, design-of-experiments and optimisation techniques were used to find the best settings for the key engine control parameters such as the intake and exhaust valve timings and the exhaust gas recirculation rate. Using these calibrations as a starting point, the transient performance was then assessed in fixed-speed tip-in simulations. The trade-off situation was found to be highly complex; identifying the best overall balance of the steady-state efficiency and the dynamic performance requires a subjective assessment. However, the continuously variable transmission does provide the best potential for dynamic response combined with a satisfactory fuel economy. It is suggested that the most suitable solution would be to have multiple user selectable calibrations, such as the ‘economy’ and ‘sport’ modes used on many modern vehicles...|$|R
