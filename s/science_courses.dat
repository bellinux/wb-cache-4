Additionally, the school offers six technology courses at GCSE (electronics, food technology, graphics, product design, resistant materials and textiles), as well as art and design, drama, music, PE, RE and child development GCSE qualifications.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to find out how the {{differences}} in entry qualifications of different groups of students were related to performance in a <b>science</b> <b>course</b> at Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE). The study was largely a qualitative case study of a cohort of students registered for the <b>science</b> <b>course</b> at the time the study was carried out. Data was gathered using interviews and documents. Data analysis involved interpreting emerging patterns between entry qualifications of students, experiences and performance in the <b>science</b> <b>course.</b> The reasons suggested for low performance in the <b>science</b> <b>course</b> investigated were that students who had registered for the course did not meet the entry qualifications of the course and this was an administrative issue, and that the lecturers were not able to teach students they considered unsuitable for the course, which was a pedagogy issue. There appears to be a relationship between entry qualifications and performance in examination in the <b>science</b> <b>course</b> investigated. There is urgent need to revise the curriculum materials so that the kind of student enrolled can cope with the demands of the <b>science</b> <b>course.</b> We recommend a different <b>science</b> <b>course</b> for students with different backgrounds without compromising the quality of the programme. The university must come up with a comprehensive orientation and mentoring for new appointments as well as a staff development programme to equip lecturers with knowledge and skills to teach students at risk of failure. Further research is recommended using a large population and sample size to find out the correlation between entry qualifications and performance in science...|$|R

Pierre Polinière and Jacques Rohault were among the first individuals to provide demonstrations of physical principles in the classroom. Experiments ranged from swinging a bucket of water at the end of a rope, demonstrating that centrifugal force would hold the water in the bucket, to more impressive experiments involving the use of an air-pump. One particularly dramatic air-pump demonstration involved placing an apple inside the glass receiver of the air-pump, and removing air until the resulting vacuum caused the apple to explode. Polinière’s demonstrations were so impressive that he was granted an invitation to present his course to Louis XV in 1722.|$|E
