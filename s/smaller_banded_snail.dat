40|$|The {{only known}} {{population}} of the Aldabra <b>banded</b> <b>snail</b> Rhachistia aldabrae declined through the late twentieth century, leading to its extinction in the late 1990 s. This occurred within a stable habitat and its extinction is attributable to decreasing rainfall on Aldabra atoll, associated with regional changes in rainfall patterns {{in the late twentieth}} and early twenty-first century. It is proposed that the extinction of this species {{is a direct result of}} decreasing rainfall leading to increased mortality of juvenile snails...|$|R

50|$|By the 1980s bands {{did not do}} {{a concert}} {{standstill}} portion of their show, but they still had to begin the show at the start line and end at the finish line. To encourage participation of <b>smaller</b> <b>bands</b> a new class structure was introduced in 1982. Bands {{were divided into two}} classes, based on band size and school enrollment, Large <b>Bands</b> and <b>Small</b> <b>Bands.</b> In 2007 a class for even <b>smaller</b> <b>bands</b> called Espirit de Corps was added. The class champions are determined in prelims with the top sixteen bands, regardless of class, moving on to finals. The Marching Eagles of Delta High School won the first <b>Small</b> <b>Bands</b> Championship. In 1989 the contest was moved to the opening day of the state fair. That year, under the direction of Doug Fletcher, the Marching Bears of Monroe Central High School became the first band competing as a <b>small</b> <b>band</b> to win the Indiana State Fair Band Day Championship, they repeated in 1990 and 1991and were runners up in 1992.|$|R

40|$|We report {{measurements}} of the quantum capacitance of individual semiconducting and <b>small</b> <b>band</b> gap single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). The observed quantum capacitance, 82 aF/μm for a semiconducting SWNT with chiral index (16, 8) and 10. 3 aF/μm for a <b>small</b> <b>band</b> gap SWNT upon Fermi level lying at the first subband are remarkably smaller than those originating from the density of states. We attribute the discrepancy to a strong electron correlation in SWNTs and derive the Luttinger parameter g of 0. 25 - 0. 3 for the (16, 8) SWNT and of 0. 32 for a <b>small</b> <b>band</b> gap SWNT. © 2009 American Institute of Physics. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
