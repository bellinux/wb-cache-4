25|$|According to Latter Day Saint doctrine, to {{exercise}} priesthood authority, a person must (1) be called by God, (2) be ordained or endowed with priesthood authority, and (3) receive the necessary priesthood keys, either through ordination {{to an office}} of the priesthood or through delegation or setting apart by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> hold the appropriate keys.|$|E
25|$|Most {{societies}} {{consider it}} a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not consent. This is called sexual assault, and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex (age of consent) are frequently the subject of debate, as is adolescent sexual behavior in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.|$|E
500|$|Journalist Jake Steelhammer {{believes}} the American urban myth of cow tipping {{originated in the}} 1970s.

Merv Bronte (Ray Romano) ruins his interview, and Dwight becomes incensed that the position might go to <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not take it seriously. He demands to be interviewed, and while Jim balks, after Dwight's persistent efforts to acquire an interview, Jo instructs Jim to grant him one, as she likes [...] "a little bit of crazy."

500|$|After facing {{some early}} {{struggle}} for film roles, Koechlin had four releases in 2011, garnering widespread recognition for her performances in them. The first was Bejoy Nambiar's Shaitan, a crime-thriller with an ensemble cast that included Koechlin, Rajeev Khandelwal, Gulshan Devaiya, Shiv Pandit, Neil Bhoopalam, and Kirti Kulhari. She {{played the role}} of a disturbed teenager and called it an [...] "exhausting" [...] experience, saying that she felt drained while trying to, [...] "get into a psyche of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> a lot of drugs and booze, has lost her mind a little bit and is very vulnerable". While the character was inconsistently described by film critics as [...] "a nightmare" [...] and [...] "engaging", Koechlin was unanimously praised for her performance, with Raja Sen calling her [...] "an increasingly striking actress". Upon release the film received positive reviews from critics, and Koechlin was nominated for the Best Actress Award at the Star Screen Awards.|$|E

500|$|After {{development}} was finished, the team reflected {{that the fundamental}} part of a Super Mario game {{was to make the}} player think about how [...] "fun" [...] it was to play the game itself, rather than simply finishing it. To accomplish this, Koizumi made sure that there were certain areas of the game which could be enjoyed by all types of people, including children. Shimizu added that Super Mario Galaxys ulterior motive was to have everybody [...] "gather around the TV", as he felt that a game starring Mario was not necessarily something which could be enjoyed by playing alone. The game was made to support six different save files – Shimizu liked the idea of one player looking at the progress of another player and seeing how they compared against their own. Iwata stated that when the first Super Mario game was released, there used to be [...] "many more" [...] people gathering around the television who would enjoy watching the gameplay experience. Iwata asserted that well-made video games were more enjoyable to spectate, and hoped that Super Mario Galaxys co-operative mode would tempt <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not usually play video games to join.|$|E
500|$|His lessened {{involvement}} with the plot compared to protagonists from preceding Final Fantasy titles was met with mixed reception. Destructoid editor Aaron Linde described him as [...] "arguably the most uninspiring character in the game". Play.tm editor Andrew Macarthy described Vaan as an [...] "undescribing figure". Eurogamer editor Rob Fahey stated that while [...] "players may initially be somewhat dismayed to find themselves largely following around the cheerful prettyboy Vaan", the game introduces new characters who [...] "fill out the cast superbly". PSX Extreme editor Cavin Smith commented that due to the game not focusing on just one character, Vaan [...] "spends the entire game as an observer of the events unfolding in front of him", adding {{that it is a}} [...] "far different take on the protagonist compared to Nomura's egocentric tendencies". PALGN editor Phil Larsen called him a [...] "rogue-ish bad boy with a heart of gold", adding that [...] "while this may seem clichéd at first, Vaan is always presented as extremely young and never tries to control every situation", citing Tidus as an example of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does.</b> Worthplaying editor Agustin described the set-up as being [...] "Dragon Quest-like", and that while he acts as a vehicle for players to view the plot through, he compared him to critically acclaimed characters Crono and Link from the Chrono Trigger and The Legend of Zelda series respectively.|$|E
500|$|Joy Kim of Manga Life also {{praised the}} art style saying the {{characters}} were distinctive. She criticized {{the relationship of}} the lead couple, Si-Joon Lee and Mu-Yeon Park, saying that Mu-Yeon should not be so sweet and protective of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not return her feelings. Kim praised the character Ji-Oh Yun as the most interesting character in the series and that his relationship with Mu-Hwa Park is interesting. Melinda Beasi of Manga Bookshelf reviewed the first volume and concluded that despite being [...] "somewhat muddled, the visual storytelling is not. The art is clean, lovely, and easy to follow, with a nicely restrained use of elaborate backgrounds and imaginative panel layouts. The character designs are pretty, distinct, and occasionally even creepy, as with Mu-Yeon's eternally smiling mask. The overall look is undeniably [...] "manhwa" [...] – a draw for some and a turn-off for others." [...] Erin Jones of Mania.com noted the distinct and typical romance story in the first volume, but found the first volume enjoyable and noted that the interactions of the [...] "Pig Girl" [...] are what will drive the series despite the volume ending without strong development of the characters. A review of volume two by Pop Culture Shock gave it a [...] "B+" [...] despite confusion caused by the plot and [...] "vagueness on the villain front, Pig Bride is still a very entertaining tale." ...|$|E

500|$|Evra {{returned}} to the team in November 2006 for the team's friendly match against Greece. He appeared as a half-time substitute for Abidal as France won the match 1–0. After going another year without representing France, Evra began appearing as a regular under Domenech in 2007. On 28 May 2008, he {{was included in the}} squad to participate in UEFA Euro 2008. He was initially placed onto the squad to serve as back-up to Abidal, however after failing to appear in the team's opening 0–0 draw with Romania, there were calls from the French media urging Domenech to insert Evra into the starting line-up at the behest of Abidal. Domenech relented and started Evra in the team's next match against the Netherlands, which ended in a 4–1 defeat. In the must-win final group stage match against Italy, Evra started his second consecutive match, but France lost 2–0 and were eliminated from the competition in the first round. Following the match, cameras witnessed Evra and teammates Patrick Vieira and Abidal getting into an altercation in the tunnel. Vieira later stated the video was shot after he got into an argument with a set of French supporters. A day after the team's elimination, Evra admitted his frustration to L'Équipe, stating, [...] "I am <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not like losing but I'm not going to make excuses. We had three games in this Euro, we have not won one. It's even hard to believe, to say it's over now." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lamer is a jargon or slang name {{originally}} {{applied in}} cracker and phreaker culture to <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not {{really understand what}} they were doing.

2500|$|Shanel Odum from Vibe {{called the}} track [...] "a graceful {{return to her}} melodic origins" [...] and praised Norwood's [...] "husky but hopeful, but still pain-infused" [...] vocal performance.

There's no showing off with vocal acrobatics or flashy production, just a premium on the melody and the mood." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the right}} to the {{communication}} of the truth is not unconditional in Catholic teaching. Everyone must conform his life to the Gospel precept of fraternal love. In concrete situations one should judge whether {{it is appropriate to}} reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. Charity and respect for the truth should dictate the response to every request for information or communication. The good and safety of others, respect for privacy, and the common good are sufficient reasons for being silent about what ought not be known or for making use of a discreet language. The duty to avoid scandal often commands strict discretion. No one is bound to reveal the truth to <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not have {{the right to}} know it. [...] The golden rule helps one discern, in concrete situations, whether it would be appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. The sacrament of confession is inviolable.|$|E
2500|$|The leap {{of faith}} is his {{conception}} of how an individual would believe in God or how a person would act in love. Faith is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to completely justify the kind of total commitment involved in true religious faith or romantic love. Faith involves making that commitment anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have faith {{is at the same}} time to have doubt. So, for example, for one to truly have faith in God, one would also have to doubt one's beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the faith would have no real substance. <b>Someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not realize that Christian doctrine is inherently doubtful and that there can be no objective certainty about its truth does not have faith but is merely credulous. For example, it takes no faith to believe that a pencil or a table exists, when one is looking at it and touching it. In the same way, to believe or have faith in God is to know that one has no perceptual or any other access to God, and yet still has faith in God. Kierkegaard writes, [...] "doubt is conquered by faith, just as it is faith which has brought doubt into the world".|$|E
