5|$|The SPC is {{the highest}} court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which {{controls}} the judiciary's budget and confirms the president's nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people's courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people's courts are the courts of first instance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military judges and assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has <b>supervisory</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the United States Department of State maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary, {{in part because the}} Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of Justice to the SPC in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary is also hampered by a shortage of lawyers and by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.|$|E

3000|$|Structure of {{the paper}} Section  2 {{presents}} the basic model of bank supervision in which a supervisor collects information on the solvency of a bank and, {{on the basis of}} this information, decides on its early liquidation. This setup may be interpreted as a model of decentralized supervision in which <b>supervisory</b> <b>responsibilities</b> are allocated to a local supervisor or a model of centralized supervision in which <b>supervisory</b> <b>responsibilities</b> are allocated to a central supervisor. Building on this setup, Sect.  3 presents the model of hierarchical supervision in which a central and a local supervisor jointly collect information and then the central supervisor decides on liquidation. Section  4 compares in terms of welfare three possible institutional arrangements: decentralized, hierarchical, and centralized supervision. Section  5 contains the extensions, and Sect.  6 the concluding remarks. The proofs of the analytical results are in the “Appendix”.|$|R

40|$|Free-riding {{has long}} been a {{contentious}} issue in Australian industrial relations. This article gauges the nature and location of free-riding in Australian workplaces, drawing on the 2004 Australian Worker Representation and Participation Survey. Of the 39. 2 percent of employees who could join a union in their workplace and who do not, 51. 7 percent may be characterized as deliberately free-riding. A similar proportion of employees may be described as 'passive beneficiaries', for whom the costs of membership are greater than the benefits, or for whom the net benefit is not perceived to be positive. Although free-riding is found to reduce as age and tenure increase, and to increase with higher income, <b>supervisory</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and full-time employment status, when free-riding is regressed against a range of personal and workplace characteristics only tenure and <b>supervisory</b> <b>responsibilities</b> retain significance. In general, instrumental motivations prevail over the ideological, personal, organizational and worker characteristics included in this analysis. The implications of these findings for union renewal in the current context are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how multinational corporations (MNCs) selectively assign <b>supervisory</b> <b>responsibilities</b> to units {{in countries with}} varying levels of institutional quality. Arbitraging across institutional contexts is an important function of MNCs, but it also creates coordination challenges. The choice of organization structure, such as the differential assignment of <b>supervisory</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> is an important tool for managing these coordination challenges. Using data on the business activities and supervision relationships within U. S. multinational manufacturers in 1996 - 2008, I find that frontline subsidiaries in countries with weaker institutions {{are more likely to}} be supervised by foreign rather than domestic supervisory units. Foreign supervision is even more likely when subsidiaries in weak-institution countries conduct activities that are more central to or interdependent with their parents’ global operations. These findings confirm that MNCs use differential supervision to enhance global coordination. The paper highlights one of the most unique features of MNCs: a multinational hierarchy that resides within firm’s boundary but across national borders. It also connects MNCs’ hierarchical structure with institutional imperfections that give rise to the emergence of the firm in the first place...|$|R

5000|$|Promotion {{to first}} {{lieutenant}} {{is governed by}} Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act of 1980. DOPMA guidelines suggest all [...] "fully qualified" [...] officers should be promoted to first lieutenant. A second lieutenant (grade O-1) is usually promoted to first lieutenant (grade O-2) after 18 months in the Army or 24 months in the Marine Corps and Air Force. The {{difference between the two}} ranks is slight, primarily being experienced and having higher pay. It is not uncommon to see officers moved to positions requiring more experience after promotion to first lieutenant. For example, in the Army and Marine Corps these positions can include leading a specialty platoon, or assignment as the executive officer for a company-sized unit (70-250 soldiers or marines). In the Air Force, a first lieutenant may be a flight commander or section's officer in charge with varied <b>supervisory</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> including supervision of as many as 100+ personnel, although in a flying unit, a first lieutenant is a rated officer (pilot, navigator, or air battle manager) who has just finished training for his career field and has few <b>supervisory</b> <b>responsibilities.</b>|$|R
