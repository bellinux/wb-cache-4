40|$|Machine {{perfusion}} of livers {{may provide}} a mechanism for extended preservation of marginal donor organs before transplantation, {{as well as a}} method for viability assessment. It has proved possible in a series of experimental porcine liver perfusions to maintain liver viability for up to 72 h. However, a reduction in bile production with associated histological evidence of cholestasis was seen after 10 h of perfusion, damaging the biliary canaliculi during the preservation period and leaving these organs in an unacceptable condition for transplantation. It was proposed that reduction in bile production {{was the result of a}} relentless depletion of available bile <b>salts,</b> <b>gut</b> recirculation not being possible and de-novo synthesis being unable to keep up with loss. This was proved by measuring porcine native bile acids within serial perfusate and bile samples using gas chromatography mass spectrophotometry. It was shown that all three native pig bile acids were decreased to 30 % of their original value by 20 h of unsupplemented perfusion. An infusion of taurocholate managed to maintain bile production at physiological levels throughout the 20 -h period (8 mL/h +/- 0. 75). It was successfully incorporated by the porcine livers into bile. We propose to use this circuit as a novel means of preserving donor livers for transplantation in which the organ is maintained at normal body temperature and perfused with blood. This will reduce ischaemia reperfusion injury and may enable prolonged preservation. The modification described ensures optimal bile production over the entire perfusion period, preventing inspissation and subsequent damage to the canaliculus...|$|R

40|$|Sodium {{appetite}} is {{an instinct}} that involves avid specific intention. It is elicited by sodium deficiency, stress-evoked adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and reproduction. Genome-wide microarrays in sodium-deficient mice or after ACTH infusion showed up-regulation of hypothalamic genes, including dopamine- and cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein 32 kDa (DARPP- 32), dopamine receptors- 1 and - 2, α- 2 C- adrenoceptor, and striatally enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP). Both DARPP- 32 and neural plasticity regulator activity-regulated cytoskeleton associated protein (ARC) were up-regulated in lateral hypothalamic orexinergic neurons by sodium deficiency. Administration of dopamine D 1 (SCH 23390) and D 2 receptor (raclopride) antagonists reduced gratification of sodium appetite triggered by sodium deficiency. SCH 23390 was specific, having {{no effect on}} osmotic-induced water drinking, whereas raclopride also reduced water intake. D 1 receptor KO mice had normal sodium appetite, indicating compensatory regulation. Appetite was insensitive to SCH 23390, confirming the absence of off-target effects. Bilateral microinjection of SCH 23390 (100 nM in 200 nL) into rats’ lateral hypothalamus greatly reduced sodium appetite. Gene set enrichment analysis in hypothalami of mice with sodium appetite showed significant enrichment of gene sets previously linked to addiction (opiates and cocaine). This finding of concerted gene regulation was attenuated on gratification with perplexingly rapid kinetics of only 10 min, anteceding significant absorption of <b>salt</b> from the <b>gut.</b> <b>Salt</b> appetite and hedonic liking of salt taste have evolved over > 100 million y (e. g., being present in Metatheria). Drugs causing pleasure and addiction are comparatively recent and likely reflect usurping of evolutionary ancient systems with high survival value by the gratification of contemporary hedonic indulgences. Our findings outline a molecular logic for instinctive behavior encoded by the brain with possible important translational–medical implications...|$|R
40|$|Get Up And Tie Your Fingers', {{originally}} {{written by}} Ann Coburn as {{a play for}} three actresses, is a fiction set against a real event, the Eyemouth Fishing Disaster of 1881. Women from fishing communities along {{the east coast of}} Scotland and England, the 'herring lassies' as they were known, would follow the herring fleets down the coast to meet the catch at each port of call. With knives at the ready, they <b>gutted,</b> <b>salted,</b> and barreled the 'silver darlings', the bountiful herring that were destined for markets across the world. Echoing the journey of the herring lassies, the production took the story of three such women - Jean, Janet, and young Molly - back to the communities from which they sprang and gave members of those communities the opportunity to create and participate in a piece of theatre alongside a professional production team...|$|R
5000|$|Daing, Tuyô, or Bilad (literally [...] "sun-dried" [...] or [...] "sun-baked") {{refers to}} dried {{fish from the}} Philippines. Fish {{prepared}} as daing are usually split open (though they may be left whole), <b>gutted,</b> <b>salted</b> liberally, and then sun and air-dried. There are also [...] "boneless" [...] variants which fillets the fish before the drying process. It was originally a preservation technique, as salt inhibits the growth of bacteria, allowing fish to be stored {{for long periods of}} time. A variant of daing known as labtingaw uses less salt and is dried for a much shorter period (only a few hours). The resulting daing is still slightly moist and meatier than the fully dried variant. Yet another variant of daing known as lamayo, does away with the drying process altogether. Instead, after the fish is cleaned, it is simply marinated in vinegar, garlic and other spices before frying.|$|R
40|$|The strong analgesic, {{anti-inflammatory}} {{effects of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are hampered by high occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects. Therapeutic actions of NSAIDs result from cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes inhibition with reduced synthesis of prostaglandins, major modulators of inflammation. Since prostaglandins also regulate key events in gut homeostasis -mucosal secretion, blood flow, epithelial regeneration - COX inhibition {{has been accepted}} {{as the reason for}} NSAID gastrointestinal toxicity. Several findings challenge this theory: first, intestinal damage by NSAIDs occurs also in COX- 1 knockout mice, demonstrating that topical (non-prostaglandin mediated) mechanisms are involved; second, no correlation is found in vivo between the extent of intestinal injury and the degree of inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; third, bile flow interruption in animal models completely prevents intestinal damage by parenterally administered NSAIDs. What is in bile that could play a role in NSAID toxicity? This timely review will critically discuss the role of bile <b>salts</b> in NSAID-dependent <b>gut</b> damag...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently, T {{cells were}} {{classified}} into two categories: intrathymic T cells (ITCs; thymus-derived T cells) and extrathymic T cells (ETCs). ETC, localized {{in the liver}} and intestinal intraepithelium (IE), play an im-portant immunologic role in the suppressed condition of T-cell develop-ment in the thymus. Given the fact that complications of surgery in patients with obstructive jaundice are often related to immunosuppression in the gut–liver circulation, we attempted to investigate {{the changes in the}} pro-portion of ETCs in mice with obstructive jaundice. Three mice models were prepared (n = 10 per group) : sham group with simple laparotomy; ligation group with common bile duct ligation; deoxycholic acid (DCA) group with an oral intake of DCA as a model of the presence of bile <b>salts</b> in the <b>gut</b> lumen. In each model, total mononuclear cells (MNCs), ITCs in the thy-mus, and ETCs in the liver and IE were counted using monoclonal antibod-ies in conjunction with a two-color immunofluorescence test by flow cytom-etry. In the ligation group the number of MNCs was reduced in the thymu...|$|R
40|$|Harvesting and {{processing}} of holothurians (sea cucumbers) in Fiji {{dates back to}} thousands of years. This study on harvesting {{and processing}} of holothurians was conducted in Fiji Islands. Data was collected through formal and informal interviews with fishers, marine product agents and through catch analysis by the fishers. The main targeted species in Fiji for harvest are Holothuria fuscogilva (White teatfish) and H. nobilis (Black teatfish). The rate at which harvesting sea cucumbers in Fiji is 5. 97 pieces per hour for individual collectors. From the interviews, {{it was determined that}} men were the major harvesters of sea cucumbers other than women and children. All accessible commercial sea cucumber species (18 species) were collected. Collection methods were by gleaning; free diving, scuba diving and the use of fishing gear such as “dri-bomb” to retrieve holothurians from the deep sea. Sea cucumbers were processed by salting and unsalting methods and involve first boiling, slitting and <b>gutting,</b> <b>salting</b> (agents only), second cook (agents only), smoke drying, third cook (agents only) and sun drying. This research raised issues of immediate awareness programs for fishers on proper harvesting, storage and better management of sea cucumbers in Fiji Islands...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Anguilla rostrata (American eel) are {{frequently}} captured in salt marshes, their role in salt marsh food webs {{and the influence of}} human impacts, such as tidal restrictions, on this role remains unclear. To better understand salt marsh trophic support of A. rostrata, eels were collected from tidally restricted and unrestricted salt marsh creeks within three New England estuaries. Gut contents were examined, and eel muscle tissue was analyzed for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values and entered into MixSir mixing models to understand if salt marsh food sources are important contributors to eel diet. Data suggest that eel prey rely heavily on salt marsh organic matter and eels utilize salt marsh secondary production as an energetic resource over time, and thus can be considered <b>salt</b> marsh residents. <b>Gut</b> contents indicate that A. rostrata function as top predators, feeding primarily on secondary consumers including other fish species, crustaceans, and polychaetes. Higher A. rostrata trophic position measured upstream of reference creeks suggests that severe tidal restrictions may result in altered food webs, {{but it is not clear}} how this impacts the overall fitness of A. rostrata populations in New England salt marshes.

40|$|Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive spore-forming {{pathogen}} and {{a leading}} cause of nosocomial diarrhea. C. difficile infections are transmitted when ingested spores germinate in the gastrointestinal tract and transform into vegetative cells. Germination begins when the germinant receptor CspC detects bile <b>salts</b> in the <b>gut.</b> CspC is a subtilisin-like serine pseudoprotease that activates the related CspB serine protease through an unknown mechanism. Activated CspB cleaves the pro-SleC zymogen, which allows the activated SleC cortex hydrolase to degrade the protective cortex layer. While these regulators are essential for C. difficile spores to outgrow and form toxin-secreting vegetative cells, the mechanisms controlling their function have only been partially characterized. In this study, we identify the lipoprotein GerS as a novel regulator of C. difficile spore germination using targeted mutagenesis. A gerS mutant has a severe germination defect and fails to degrade cortex even though it processes SleC at wildtype levels. Using complementation analyses, we demonstrate that GerS secretion, but not lipidation, is necessary for GerS to activate SleC. Importantly, loss of GerS attenuates the virulence of C. difficile in a hamster model of infection. Since GerS appears to be conserved exclusively in related Peptostreptococcaeace family members, our results contribute to a growing body of work indicating that C. difficile has evolved distinct mechanisms for controlling the exit from dormancy relative to B. subtilis and other spore-forming organisms...|$|R
