5|$|Elliott entered Ormond College, the Presbyterian hall of {{residence}} at the University of Melbourne in 1898 to study law. Between 1883 and 1896, law <b>students</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> required to first obtain a bachelor of arts degree before going on to study law. This had been changed, but Elliott, who was under no financial pressure to complete his degree quickly, elected to follow the old route and complete an arts degree first. He also represented Ormond College in football and athletics, and joined the University Officers' Training Corps. In March 1900, the Imperial authorities asked the Australian colonial governments to raise a force of 2,500 Imperial Bushmen for service in the South African War. Elliott decided to interrupt his studies to serve, {{and was one of}} 4,000 applicants for the 626 positions allotted to Victoria. He was accepted for the Victorian Imperial Bushmen, and trained at Langwarrin, Victoria, before embarking for South Africa on 1 May 1900.|$|E

The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a coalition of hard-line religious parties, claimed that between 400 and 1,000 <b>students</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed, along with women and children.

5|$|The University of Houston and the University of Texas {{played their}} first {{football}} game {{against one another}} in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge {{of taking care of}} ShastaI, the university's mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off. At the game, several Longhorn players saw what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent, suggesting the Cougars were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH <b>students</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time, but began using the bent-finger sign as a reminder that they would remember the taunts.|$|E

This design was inspired by a RAND paper in that year, which suggested a land invasion could be halted by destroying 20% of its vehicles with precision munitions. This would take several days with aircraft, but a surface ship with large numbers of land-attack missiles could achieve the same effect almost instantly.|$|E

25|$|After {{finishing}} {{high school}} in Bahrain in 1977, al-Khawaja traveled to the UK to continue his further education.

In the summer of 1980, after fellow <b>students</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> detained and interrogated under torture for their activities in London and his family’s house had been ransacked and searched, al-Khawaja, fearing detention if {{he went back to}} Bahrain, decided to remain abroad.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} force {{assimilation}} involved punishing children for speaking their own languages or practicing their own faiths, leading to allegations in the 20th century of cultural genocide and ethnocide. There was widespread {{physical and sexual}} abuse. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, {{and a lack of}} medical care led to high rates of tuberculosis, and death rates of up to 69%. Details of the mistreatment of <b>students</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> published numerous times throughout the 20th century, but following the closure of the schools in the 1960s, the work of indigenous activists and historians led to a change in the public perception of the residential school system, as well as official government apologies, and a (controversial) legal settlement.|$|E
