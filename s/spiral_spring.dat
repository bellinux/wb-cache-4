The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the axle box via a revolute joint and a <b>spiral</b> <b>spring.</b> Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E
25|$|In 1675, Huygens {{patented}} {{a pocket}} watch. The watches which {{were made in}} Paris from c. 1675 and following the Huygens plan are notable for lacking a fusee for equalizing the mainspring torque. The implication is that Huygens thought that his <b>spiral</b> <b>spring</b> would isochronise the balance, {{in the same way}} that he thought that the cycloidally shaped suspension curbs on his clocks would isochronise the pendulum.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{point of the}} design was {{that it did not}} use a traditional helical coiled recoil spring, but used a <b>spiral</b> <b>spring,</b> much like a large clock spring, in a semicircular housing {{just in front of the}} trigger. The operating rod had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force of the bolt assembly. At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the operating rod forward for the next round. As with a clock spring, the Lewis gun recoil spring had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. Unusual as it seems, the Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.|$|E
40|$|For a caged <b>spiral</b> power <b>spring,</b> its {{moment of}} inertia varies with the time in energy storage and {{is closely related to}} the states of spring strip. Due to {{continuous}} changing of the shape in energy storage, calculation of variable {{moment of inertia}} for <b>spiral</b> power <b>spring</b> is a highly challenging but important issue. A general analytical model and calculation method of variable moment of inertia for <b>spiral</b> power <b>spring</b> are proposed in this article. First, the contraction process of <b>spiral</b> power <b>spring</b> in energy storage is clearly revealed and analytical model of <b>spiral</b> power <b>spring</b> on the basis of contraction process is presented. In terms of the contraction characteristic, a general calculation method based on divisions of stage and state for variable moment of inertia is put forward. Finally, a <b>spiral</b> power <b>spring</b> is designed, and a prototype of the spring is developed. The proposed model and general calculation method are applied into the prototype to calculate its variable moment of inertia, and they are evaluated by a developed experimental scheme...|$|R

60|$|How {{much the}} making of species and genera is in order to general names; and how much general names are necessary, if not to the being, yet {{at least to the}} {{completing}} of a species, and making it pass for such, will appear, besides what has been said above concerning ice and water, in a very familiar example. A silent and a striking watch are but one species, to those who have but one name for them: but he that has the name WATCH for one, and CLOCK for the other, and distinct complex ideas to which those names belong, to HIM they are different species. It will be said perhaps, that the inward contrivance and constitution is different between these two, which the watchmaker has a clear idea of. And yet it is plain they are but one species to him, when he has but one name for them. For what is sufficient in the inward contrivance to make a new species? There are some watches that are made with four wheels, others with five; is this a specific difference to the workman? Some have strings and physics, and others none; some have the balance loose, and others regulated by a <b>spiral</b> <b>spring,</b> and others by hogs' bristles. Are any or all of these enough to make a specific difference to the workman, that knows each of these and several other different contrivances in the internal constitutions of watches? It is certain each of these hath a real difference from the rest; but whether it be an essential, a specific difference or no, relates only to the complex idea to which the name watch is given: as long as they all agree in the idea which that name stands for, and that name does not as a generical name comprehend different species under it, they are not essentially nor specifically different. But if any one will make minuter divisions, from differences that he knows in the internal frame of watches, and to such precise complex ideas give names that shall prevail; they will then be new species, to them who have those ideas with names to them, and can by those differences distinguish watches into these several sorts; and then WATCH will be a generical name. But yet they would be no distinct species to men ignorant of clock-work, and the inward contrivances of watches, who had no other idea but the outward shape and bulk, with the marking of the hours by the hand. For to them all those other names would be but synonymous terms for the same idea, and signify no more, nor no other thing but a watch. Just thus I think it is in natural things. Nobody will doubt that the wheels or springs (if I may so say) within, are different in a RATIONAL MAN and a CHANGELING; no more than that there is a difference in the frame between a DRILL and a CHANGELING. But whether one or both these differences be essential or specifical, is only to be known to us by their agreement or disagreement with the complex idea that the name man stands for: for by that alone can it be determined whether one, or both, or neither of those be a man.|$|E

25|$|Huygens {{developed}} a balance spring {{watch in the}} same period as, though independently of, Robert Hooke. Controversy over the priority persisted for centuries.
