50|$|Under {{the fixed}} {{exchange}} rate system, the central bank operates in the foreign exchange market to maintain a <b>specific</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> If there is pressure to depreciate the domestic currency's exchange rate because the supply of domestic currency exceeds its demand in foreign exchange markets, the local authority buys domestic currency with foreign currency to decrease the domestic currency's supply in the foreign exchange market. This keeps the domestic currency's exchange rate at its targeted level. If there is pressure to appreciate the domestic currency's exchange rate because the currency's demand exceeds its supply in the foreign exchange market, the local authority buys foreign currency with domestic currency to increase the domestic currency's supply in the foreign exchange market.

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used tool by which the central bank can affect the monetary base is by open market operations. This entails managing the quantity of money in circulation through the buying and selling of various financial instruments, such as treasury bills, company bonds, or foreign currencies, in exchange for money on deposit at the central bank. Those deposits are convertible to currency, so all of these purchases or sales result in more or less base currency entering or leaving market circulation. For example, if the central bank wishes to lower interest rates (executing expansionary monetary policy), it purchases government debt, thereby {{increasing the amount of}} cash in circulation or crediting banks' reserve accounts. Commercial banks then have more money to lend, so they reduce lending rates, making loans less expensive. Cheaper credit card interest rates boost consumer spending. Additionally, when business loans are more affordable, companies can expand to keep up with consumer demand. They ultimately hire more workers, whose incomes rise, which in its turn also increases the demand. This tool is usually enough to stimulate demand and drive economic growth to a healthy rate. Usually, the short-term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target. In other instances, monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a <b>specific</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold.

40|$|This {{collaborative}} project, {{which is}} participated by 8 SEACEN member banks, aimed to examine <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility {{faced by the}} member countries and to study {{its impact on the}} domestic economy with emphasis on adjustments of the corporate and financial sector. The project also investigated how the adjustments could contribute to the overall financial stability. The last decade was the end of explicit commitment to the fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime. Although, it is still debatable whether <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> should move or not, the lesson learnt from the 1997 Asian crisis was that a fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime ould have serious implications when the economy is not protected from severe <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements. The regime could undermine the resilience of the financial and corporate sector due to the commitment to stability of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> Nevertheless, in the decade since the crisis, SEACEN economies have adjusted to an environment of more volatile <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> The gradual decline in volatility could have contributed to economic performance and <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> adjusting to new levels. The managed float seems to be the main adopted regime and in some countries, the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> has almost returned to the pre-crisis level. The financial sector has increased capitalisation in response to the volatile <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> environment, boosting profitability and the capacity to absorb shocks including <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility. Financial stability has increased as a result of accumulated foreign reserves by the monetary authorites, helping to raise foreign investors' confidence in bringing back capital to the region and allowing the economy to leverage the international financial market. The corporate sector is always aware of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> risk and is investing in instruments that allow it to mitigate <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility. Financial derivatives are some of the instruments used widely. Empirical evidence reveals that <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility does not influence corporate value significantly, due perhaps to the successful risk mitigating strategies by the corporations and also partially because of more prudent <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy. This study used the industry <b>specific</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> for the analysis of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure and its impact on non-financial corporate sector in the participating SEACEN countries. The calculation of real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> indices for each industry using trade weights specifically for that industry is more useful for the analysis of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pressure on the real economy. The economy wide aggregate real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> {{would not be able to}} capture the pressure of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> when half of the economy is importing and the other half is exporting. With more precise data on trade of each industry, the real pressure generated through <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> change can be captured more accurately. From the empirical analysis of some industries, it is noted that industry <b>specific</b> real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> could be used for further analysis. On the whole, the conclusion reached is that corporate value is not affected by <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure and this is in line with the conclusion reached in other studies. The corporate sector adopts strategies which mitigate <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> risk. The strategies vary depending on the availability of instruments. Larger companies are utilising financial instruments such as forwards, swaps and netting off cash flows that match balance sheet exposures. Smaller companies, however, have to face risks if there is no option to hedge. The cost and access to hedge instruments is an issue of infrastructure which allow companies to leverage on them. Authorities' efforts to establish an efficient infrastructure was discussed in the case of Philippines. Similarly, the Indonesian non-deliverable forwards market is being developed. Finally, it was found that there have been few adjustments made in recent times to mitigate the volatility of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> The major adjustments were made mostly right after the crisis period and presently, markets have become increasingly efficient in dealing with the impact of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatilities. The most important contributions by the authorities are measures to ensure resilience of financial institutions, improvement of the efficiency of market, development of legal and technical framework for financial instruments that help both financial and corporate sectors to diversify risks and ensuring that <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy is prudent which would not lead to misalignments that create excessive <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure. ...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} research completed {{over the last}} decade has dramatically increased our understanding of exchange rate behavior. The major insight to come from this decade of research is that foreign exchange is a financial asset. In an asset pricing framework, current exchange rates reflect the expected values of future exogenous variables. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to survay the empirical evidence on exchange rate behavior, market efficiency and related topics. Section 2 presents a stylized history of exchange rate behavior during 1970 's. Alternative measures of volatility and transaction costs are reviewed. Tests of <b>specific</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> determination models are presented in Section 3. Empirical studies have been fairly successful in constructing models to explain cross-sectional exchange rate differences and to explain time series exchange rate developments over the medium-run and long-run. Following the asset market framework, recent studies have demonstrated that unanticipated exchange rate changes are significantly correlated with "news" concerning fundamental macroeconomic variables. Evidence on foreign exchange market efficiency is summurized in Section 4. Efficiency studies remain difficult to formulate (because of small samples and unobserved variables) and difficult to interpret (because of the joint hypothesis problem). Several recent studies claim that speculative profit opportunities are present, but it is unclear whether these are related to risk premiums or actual market inefficiencies. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to study the operation of exchange rate regimes {{in the context of}} possible regime switches. An intuitive survey of the regime switching literature is given in Chapter 1, and three independent essays are presented in Chapters 2, 3, and 4. Using the theory of regulated Brownian motion, Chapter 2 derives the nonlinear relationship between the nominal exchange rate and its fundamentals during the transition period from the current free-float to a specified target zone (TZ), triggered at an announced state-dependent switch. It is shown that the derived nonlinear relationship is in general different from the relationship corresponding to a return to a fixed exchange rate regime. This is due to a "reflecting effect", the mirror image of the well known "honeymoon effect" of a target zone. and a "bandwidth effect". Also derived is a locus of "benchmark cases" demarcating the factors that lead to an immediate appreciation or depreciation of the domestic currency at the announcement of the future TZ. The target zone model developed in Chapter 3 incorporates the possibility of a future change in the trend in the fundamentals of the exchange rate as policy reaction to specific events (e. g., impending speculative attacks and nominal anchor debates). The market has subjective expectations about this possible trend revision, which can affect the exchange rate level even if the change in trend is not implemented. These expectations are treated, first, as entirely exogenous and, second, as state-varying. In both cases various correlation patterns between the exchange rate and interest rate differentials are possible. This result is consistent with the observed behaviour of the exchange rate and interest rate differentials within the European Monetary System. Chapter 4 studies an announced (state-dependent) regime shift from a free-floating to a permanently fixed exchange rate regime and introduces specific welfare considerations. The welfare issues introduced here try to explain why a <b>specific</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> target level would be chosen instead of another one, if a return to a fixed exchange rate were on the public policy agenda and a given range for its pegged value had already been proposed. While this model does not provide a theory of choice between free-float and fixed rate regimes, it proposes a criterion to choose between fixed exchange rate regimes, taking into account the transition period from the free-float to the implementation of the fixed regime...|$|E

To date, however, {{the implications of the}} international economy for firms in the service sector are vastly understudied. This paper sets out to investigate this important, yet unexplored, issue. We analyze the effects of industry <b>specific</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements on the profitability, survival, sales and leverage of Canadian service sector firms. We use firm level data from 1986 to 1997 combined with service trade data from 1990 to 2005. Our empirical results show that real appreciations of the Canadian dollar reduce firm probability of survival, sales and profitability while depreciations have the opposite effect. Leverage decreases with appreciations and increases with depreciations. This paper is among the first in the literature that analyze the impact of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements on the behaviour of service firms. Overall, our findings suggest a significant <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> effect on service firms and the direction of which is similar to that for manufacturing firms...|$|R

Direct protection resulting from output and input subsidies and taxes was positive on average from 1966 to 1988, but total protection was negative when <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies are considered. Tobacco policies were quite volatile and resulted in increasing production in the 1970 s but decreasing production in the 1980 s. Overall, tobacco production was 4. 8 percent less {{than it would have}} been had there been no policy interventions. Several reasons are provided for the policies.

The relationship between income distribution and output is analysed in a short-run, two-country neo-Kaleckian model. The effects of devaluation and redistribution are discussed in detail. Trade and redistribution within one country interact and output increases or decreases with changes in either depending on the <b>specific</b> distributional and <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements. The Marshall-Lerner condition is shown to be equivalent to the assumption of expansionary evaluation. If devaluation increases output, national redistribution policy towards wage earners is also more likely to be expansionary...|$|R
