40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the design and}} fabrication of an experimental facility that was built to produce a turbulent plane wall jet. The target flow was two-dimensional with a uniform profile of the mean streamwise velocity and a low turbulence level at the slot exit. The design requirements for a flow conditioning apparatus that could produce this flow were determined. The apparatus was then designed and constructed, and measurements of the fluid flow were obtained using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The first series of measurements was along the slot width, the second series was along the slot centerline and the third was at 46 <b>slot</b> <b>heights</b> off the centerline. The Reynolds number, based on the <b>slot</b> <b>height</b> and jet exit velocity, of the wall jet varied from 7594 to 8121. Data for the streamwise and transverse components of velocity and the three associated Reynolds stress components were analyzed and {{used to determine the}} characteristics of the wall jet. This experimental facility was able to produce a profile of the mean streamwise velocity near the slot exit that was uniform over 71 % of the <b>slot</b> <b>height</b> with a streamwise turbulence that was equal to 1. 45 % of the mean velocity. This initial velocity was maintained to 6 <b>slot</b> <b>heights.</b> The fully developed region for the centerline and the off-centerline measurements was determined to extend from 50 to 100 <b>slot</b> <b>heights</b> and 40 to 100 <b>slot</b> <b>heights,</b> respectively. This was based on self-similarity of the mean streamwise velocity profiles when scaled using the maximum streamwise velocity and the jet half-width. The off-centerline Reynolds stress profiles achieved a greater degree of collapse than did the centerline profiles. The rate of spread of the wall jet along the centerline was 0. 080 in the self-similar region from 50 to 100 <b>slot</b> <b>heights,</b> and the off-centerline growth rate was 0. 077 in the self-similar region from 40 to 100 <b>slot</b> <b>heights.</b> The decay rate of the maximum streamwise velocity was - 0. 624 within the centerline self-similar region, and - 0. 562 within the off-centerline self-similar region. These results for the spread and decay of the wall jet compared well with recent similar studies. The two-dimensionality was initially assessed by measuring the mean streamwise velocity at 1 <b>slot</b> <b>height</b> along the entire slot width. The two-dimensionality of this wall jet was further analyzed by comparing the centerline and off-centerline profiles of the mean streamwise velocity at 2 / 3, 4, 50, 80, and 100 <b>slot</b> <b>heights,</b> and by comparing the growth rates and decay rates. Although this facility was able to produce a wall jet that was initially two-dimensional, the two-dimensionality was compromised downstream of the slot, most likely due to the presence of return flow and spanwise spreading. Without further measurements, it is not yet clear exactly how the lack of complete two-dimensionality affects the flow characteristics noted above...|$|R

Through {{the set up}} of a {{calculation}} model on film cooling in the primary zone of an annular combustor, a parametrical study was made {{on the relationship of}} film cooling effectiveness and wall temperature with configuration parameters such as cooling <b>slot</b> <b>height</b> and TBC thickness.

METHODS: Eight orthodontic brackets, two of <b>slot</b> <b>height</b> 0. 018 and six of <b>slot</b> <b>height</b> 0. 022, from different manufacturers, were measured and fixed to a vertical support. Twenty-four archwires of differing size, cross section and material were selected, measured and tested in each bracket of compatible slot width. Compression testing by Instron dynamometer and geometric calculations enabled us to determine the play angle of each bracket/archwire combination, and the angle at which a clinically efficacious force couple, sufficient for dental movement, is exerted. RESULTS: All bracket/archwire combinations considered were found to have play angles far above the ideal. This is ascribable to the slots being oversized with respect to the manufacturers' claims. Likewise, some archwires were found to be oversized, while others undersized. When the same archwire was tested with brackets from different manufacturers, the play and torque expression differed, despite the same nominal dimensions of the slots. When the same bracket was tested with the same size archwires, their construction material was found to influence the torque expression, due to the difference in elastic modulus, but not the wire/slot play.

40|$|The sound {{generated}} by a 2 -D, 20 % thick elliptical circulation control airfoil with single slot blowing is experimentally investigated in the University of Florida Aeroacoustic Flow Facility. Experiments are conducted {{at a variety of}} freestream and slot jet velocities for three different <b>slot</b> <b>heights</b> h. The airfoil’s lift characteristics compare favorably with data from a previous research study in a conventional closed-wall wind tunnel. A large aperture microphone array reveals low noise contamination in the UFAFF test section. Data from farfield microphones indicate both tonal and broadband noise sources. Vortex shedding from the rounded trailing edge occurs when jet momentum levels are insufficient to prevent flow separation. High frequency tonal noise is also identified due to vortex shedding, where fD/Ujet = 0. 21, from the D = 0. 28 mm thick slot lip. For large jet velocities, high frequency broadband slot jet noise is identified as the dominant noise source for fh/Ujet> 0. 1. Jet velocity amplitude and frequency non-dimensionalization collapse the high-frequency portion of the spectra reasonably well when freestream velocity is low or zero. For curvature and slot noise {{generated by}} the external boundary layer flow, local mean velocities at the trailing edge and above the slot are not more effective than freestream and jet velocities when non-dimensionalizing frequency.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{circulation}} control to deflect turbofan engine thrust beyond 90 deg. has been proven in full-scale static ground tests of the circulation-control-wing/upper-surface-blowing (CCW/USB) concept. This powered high-lift system employs a circular, blown trailing edge to replace the USB mechanical flaps to entrain engine-exhaust flow, and to obtain both a vertical-thrust component and an augmented circulation lift for short takeoff and landing (STOL) applications. Previous tests (Phase 1), done in 1982, of a basic configuration installed on the Quiet Short Haul Research Aircraft confirmed these CCW/USB systems capabilities. A second phase (Phase 2) of full-scale, static, thrust-deflection investigations has reconfirmed the ability to deflect engine thrust from 40 to 102 deg., depending on thrust level. Five new configurations were evaluated and performance improvements noted for those configurations with larger blown span, fences or favorable engine interactions, smaller <b>slot</b> <b>height,</b> and larger radii with less than 180 deg. of CCW surface arc. In general, a 90 deg. circular arc with a smaller <b>slot</b> <b>height</b> provided the best performance, demonstrating that adequate thrust turning can be produced by a trailing-edge shape which may have minimal cruise-performance penalty. Thrust deflections were achieved at considerably lower blowing momentum than was required for the baseline case of Phase 1. Improved performance and versatility were thus confirmed for the CCW/USB system applied to STOL aircraft, where the potential for developing a non-moving-parts pneumatic thrust deflector to rapidly vary horizontal force from thrust to drag, while maintaining constant vertical force, appears quite promising. The conversion from high-lift to lower-drag cruise mode by merely terminating the blowing provides an effective STOL aircraft system...|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional detached-eddy {{simulation}} (DES) {{study has}} been carried out to evaluate the cooling performance of a trailing-edge cutback turbine blade with various lip thickness to <b>slot</b> <b>height</b> ratios (t/H). By adopting the shear-stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model, the numerical investigations were performed at two successive steps: first, to validate simulation results from an existing cutback turbine blade model with staggered circular pin-fins arrays inside the cooling passage against experimental measurements and other available numerical predictions; second, to understand the effects of the lip thickness to the <b>slot</b> <b>height</b> ratio on the blade trailing-edge cooling performance. It was found from the model validations that at two moderate blowing ratios of 0. 5 and 1. 1, DES predicted film cooling effectiveness are in very good agreement with experimental data. Further comparisons of four various t/H ratios (t/H = 0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5) have revealed that the thermal mixing process between the ‘cold’ coolant gas and the ‘hot’ mainstream flow in the near wake region of the exit slot has been greatly intensified with the increase of the t/H ratio. As a result, it causes a rapid decay of the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness downstream of the blade trailing-edge. The observed vortex shedding and its characteristics in the near wake region are found {{to play an important role}} in determining the dynamic process of the ‘cold’ and the ‘warm’ airflow mixing, which in turn have significant influences on the prediction accuracy of the near-wall heat transfer performance. As the four t/H ratio increases from 0. 25 to 1. 5, DES predicts the decrease of main shedding frequencies as fs = 3. 69, 3. 2, 2. 21, and 1. 49 kHz, corresponding to Strouhal numbers St = 0. 15, 0. 20, 0. 23, and 0. 22, respectively. These results are in good agreement with available experimental measurements...|$|R
30|$|It {{should also}} be noted that the test {{performed}} is only a simplified representation of that which occurs in the oral cavity. Indeed, only single brackets were tested without any tipping information. This is obviously not the case in real-life orthodontics, in which a multibracket appliance, composed of 12 to 14 brackets, will deflect an archwire in a far more complex fashion. Indeed, second-order misalignment will have an influence on the torque expressed, by increasing the friction between the archwire and the bracket [25]. Furthermore, the experiment was not designed to take into account the phenomenon of bracket wear, which can increase the <b>slot</b> <b>height</b> by as much as 0.02 mm [26]. Nevertheless, our findings do provide food for thought as regards the real expression of information by pre-angled appliances.|$|R

Within the presented paper, the effectiveness of film cooling has been studied in a LOX/GH 2 subscale rocket combustion chamber. Aiming at {{high performance}} first stage applications, combustion chamber pressures have been varied up to 12 MPa. Using GH 2 with ambient temperatures for film cooling, typical influence parameters on film cooling effectiveness like film blowing rate, velocity ratio between film injection velocity and hot gas velocity, and film injection <b>slot</b> <b>height</b> have been investigated systematically at the European Research and Technology Test Facility P 8...|$|R
