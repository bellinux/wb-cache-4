Thus, St. Martin and the other islands are populated by a mixture of Amerindian, European, African, Indian and Asian peoples.|$|E
500|$|The 1846 {{hurricane}} {{resulted in}} a variety of both geological, geographical, and ecological alterations. In Key West, the local <b>salt</b> <b>pond</b> shifted from its original position, becoming a hindrance to local residents and requiring it to be filled up; eventually, the tourist district of Key West emerged over the former site of the <b>salt</b> <b>pond.</b> By December1846, Sand Key, which was inundated during the hurricane, resurfaced from the waters of the Atlantic. However, it was situated approximately [...] west of its location prior to the hurricane, and even months later, the lighthouse remained under [...] of seawater. Years afterward, greenery on the key was sparse, and little native vegetation existed. Signs of ecological damage remained even in the early 1880s, evidenced by the presence of rushes among the leaves of trees and bushes.|$|E

50|$|Anthropogenic {{threats to}} <b>salt</b> <b>ponds</b> include {{development}} and altered hydrology, pollution, erosion, and livestock and agricultural operations. <b>Salt</b> <b>ponds</b> may be filled, dredged, or removed for marinas, harbors, buildings, or other uses. Construction in upland areas also affects <b>salt</b> <b>ponds</b> by causing increased erosion and sedimentation. Pollution {{is also a}} major threat to <b>salt</b> <b>ponds.</b> These areas are frequent dumping sites for trash, wastewater, and solid waste. Livestock grazing can not only increase erosion through soil compaction and deforestation, but also introduces fertilizers. Agriculture can also introduce fertilizers and pesticides, causing algal blooms and reduced water quality. Anthropogenic activities, such as fossil fuel burning, can cause increased global temperatures and could lead to the drying of <b>salt</b> <b>ponds.</b> As many of the biological functions of <b>salt</b> <b>ponds</b> are unknown, {{it would be wise to}} mitigate potential human impact on these vulnerable ecosystems.|$|R

2500|$|The {{black-necked stilt}} {{is found in}} estuarine, lacustrine, <b>salt</b> <b>pond</b> and {{emergent}} wetland habitats; it is generally a lowland bird but in Central America has been found up to [...] ASL and commonly seen in llanos habitat in northern South America. It {{is also found in}} seasonally flooded wetlands. Use of salt evaporation ponds has increased significantly since 1960 in the USA, and they may now be the primary wintering habitat; these salt ponds are especially prevalent in southern San Francisco Bay. At the Salton Sea, the black-necked stilt is resident year-round.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these ecosystem services, <b>salt</b> <b>ponds</b> also produce a variety of useful products. Artemia, {{one of the primary}} food organisms for aquaculture systems, are cultured in <b>salt</b> <b>ponds.</b> Halophilic green algae can also be cultured in <b>salt</b> <b>ponds</b> to produce glycerol, dried protein that can be fed to livestock, and β-carotene used in dietary supplements. Spirulina is a salt-loving cyanobacterium with a protein content even higher than meat (60%), and it can be cultured in <b>salt</b> <b>ponds.</b> Other halophilic bacteria can be used to produce components used in highly technological processes. Photosynthetic pigment found in Halobacterium halobium is produced commercially and used for optical data processing, non-linear optics and as light sensors. Halophilic bacteria could also be used to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) which are biodegradable, water resistant thermoplastics.|$|R

2500|$|This stilt chooses mudflats, {{desiccated}} lacustrine verges, and levees for nest locations, {{as long as}} {{the soil}} is friable. Reproduction occurs from late April through August in North America, with peak activity in June, while tropical populations usually breed after the rainy season. The nests are typically sited within [...] of a feeding location, and the pairs defend an extensive perimeter around groups of nests, patrolling in cooperation with their neighbors. Spacing between nests is approximately , but sometimes nests are within [...] of each other and some nests in the rookery are as far as [...] from the nearest neighbor. The black-necked stilt is actually classified as semicolonial since the nests are rarely found alone and colonies usually number dozens, rarely hundreds of pairs. The nests are frequently established rather close to the water edge, so that their integrity is affected by rising water levels of ponds or tides. This is particularly a hazard in the case of managed salt ponds where water levels may be altered rapidly in the <b>salt</b> <b>pond</b> flooding process.|$|E
2500|$|The San Francisco Bay Trail, which {{passes in}} a loop around {{both sides of}} the Palo Alto Flood Basin is known as the Adobe Creek Loop Trail and is easily {{accessed}} from a parking lot at the northern terminus of San Antonio Road, just north of U.S. Highway 101. A scenic, easy walking or mountain biking trail, it also provides outstanding birdwatching and in winter is known for its flock of American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos). The Adobe Creek Loop Trail begins by heading north along the levee between Adobe Creek and the Charleston Slough out to the confluence of Adobe Creek and Matadero Creek. [...] As one heads north on the levee, Charleston Slough is on the right and Adobe Creek is on the left. The Charleston Slough is a rich salt marsh and littoral zone, providing feeding areas for a variety of shorebirds and other estuarine wildlife. At low tide Charleston Slough looks like a <b>salt</b> <b>pond,</b> like the Cargill salt ponds to the east of it, but it is open to tidal flow. Pumps and gates regulate the flow through the slough. Water from the slough gets pumped into Shoreline Lake, which then drains into Permanente Creek. The slough was named after George Charleston, who came from Scotland in 1852 and purchased [...] of marshland in this area. Charleston Road and Charleston Court also bear his name. Continuing north, the wide, curving Loop Trail eventually touches San Francisco Bay itself and curves to the west, crossing over the tidal gate of Mayfield Slough and enters the Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve. The sailing station boat launching dock is visible on the opposite shore of the channel {{at the mouth of the}} former Palo Alto Yacht Harbor. Baylands Nature Preserve surrounds what used to be the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor, now a silted-in mud flat and marsh which provides excellent birding. The Adobe Creek Loop Trail then heads back southwest with Matadero Creek on the left and Byxbee Park (former landfill) on the right, eventually connecting to the Bay Trail at East Bayshore Road. Heading east along East Bayshore Road, turn immediately left after crossing over Adobe Creek to return on the Bay Trail to the San Antonio Road parking lot.|$|E

40|$|In {{tropical}} coastal ecosystems mangrove {{forests are}} important as feeding, spawning, breeding and nursery grounds for many marine species. High human population pressure in coastal areas {{has led to}} the loss and deterioration of mangrove habitats. Solar salt production can affect these habitats along the East African coast. Littorinid snails live on mangrove trees, forming {{an important component of the}} mangrove ecosystem and have been used as bioindicators of environmental health and community stress. Littoraria subvittata is the most abundant littorinid species in mangroves along the East African coast. Partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene sequences of 298 individuals were used to assess the impact of mangrove deforestation at <b>salt</b> <b>ponds</b> on the genetic diversity and structuring of L. subvittata populations, as well as to infer the demographic history of the species. Nucleotide and haplotype diversities were found to be lower in samples from mangroves at <b>salt</b> <b>ponds</b> than in samples from natural mangroves. The mean nucleotide diversity was 0. 049 ± 0. 036 % and 0. 115 ± 0. 068 % in mangroves at <b>salt</b> <b>ponds</b> and natural mangroves, respectively. The mean haplotype diversity was 0. 23 ± 0. 14 and 0. 50 ± 0. 14 in mangroves at <b>salt</b> <b>ponds</b> and natural mangroves, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) detected a significant population structure (Ф st = 0. 049; P ct = 0. 022; P st = 0. 054, P st = − 0. 0026, P = 0. 64). Reduced effective population size was observed in most samples from mangrove sites at <b>salt</b> <b>ponds</b> compared with natural mangrove. The direction of migrants was mostly from <b>salt</b> <b>ponds</b> to natural mangroves. These results show that <b>salt</b> <b>ponds</b> have a negative impact on the genetic diversity of L. subvittata populations and modify the population's genetic structure...|$|R
