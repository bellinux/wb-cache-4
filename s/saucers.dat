5|$|Asteroids is an arcade space shooter {{released}} in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. and designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying <b>saucers.</b> The {{object of the}} game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and <b>saucers</b> while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1996, an {{enormous}} alien mothership, that has one fourth {{the mass of}} the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying gargantuan assault fortress <b>saucers,</b> each fifteen miles wide, that take positions over some of Earth's major cities and military bases. David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions that he determines is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. With the help of his former wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius, gain access to the Oval Office and warn President Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Thomas orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the <b>saucers</b> activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions. Thomas, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the capital is destroyed, along with other locations over which the <b>saucers</b> are positioned.|$|E
5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a rocket as {{it attempts to}} shoot a pair of flying <b>saucers</b> while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. Missiles are fired one at a time, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's rocket follows Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying <b>saucers</b> stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by turning their rocket.|$|E

5|$|On July 3, {{international}} leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces {{attack the}} <b>saucers</b> positioned above {{the ruins of}} the cities, but the <b>saucers</b> are protected by force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters, each with its own shield as well, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with the USMC squadron VMFA-314 based out of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to Area 51, where Thomas' group has landed. Through Secretary of Defense Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash.|$|E
5|$|A {{small ship}} travels to a {{rotating}} space station. Aboard the station, {{a group of}} starfish-like beings discuss how to warn humans of an impending disaster, deciding on contacting Japanese scientist Dr. Kumara. Meanwhile, flying <b>saucers</b> are spotted over the skies of Tokyo, baffling scientists. A journalist tries to get a statement from Dr. Kumara about the sightings, but Kumara replies {{that there is not}} enough evidence to formulate a hypothesis. At an observatory, Professor Isobe spots an object in his telescope apparently releasing smaller objects.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1981, Asteroids Deluxe is {{the first}} sequel to Asteroids. Dave Shepperd edited the code and made {{enhancements}} to the game without Logg's involvement. The onscreen objects were tinted blue, and hyperspace {{was replaced by a}} shield that depleted if used. The asteroids rotate, and the added killer satellite enemy breaks apart into three smaller ships when hit that home in on the player's position. The arcade machine's monitor displays vector graphics overlaying a holographic backdrop. The game is much harder than the original and does not allow <b>saucers</b> to be hunteda common strategy for Asteroids high scores.|$|E

5|$|There {{was some}} {{debate about the}} concept within the USAF, as many groups were {{attempting}} to gain funding for their own pet projects, like nuclear powered bombers. In {{a repeat of the}} earlier Toronto Star release, in 1955 an extensive article appeared in Look magazine that, among other claims, speculated that current UFO sightings were Soviet-built <b>saucers.</b> The article went on to describe such an aircraft with diagrams that were clearly influenced by the Avro design.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} his death, Parsons was well remembered among the Western esoteric community; his scientific recognition frequently {{amounted to a}} footnote. For instance, English Thelemite Kenneth Grant suggested that Parsons' Babalon Working marked {{the start of the}} appearance of flying <b>saucers</b> in the skies, leading to phenomena such as the Roswell UFO incident and Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting. Cameron postulated that the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident was a spiritual reaction to Parsons' death. In 1954 she portrayed Babalon in American Thelemite Kenneth Anger's short film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome, viewing this cinematic depiction of a Thelemic ritual as aiding the literal invocation of Babalon begun by Parsons' working, and later said that his Book of the AntiChrist prophecies were fulfilled through the manifestation of Babalon in her person.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Gems, who had {{previously}} written multiple unproduced screenplays for director Tim Burton, came up with his own idea for a Mars Attacks film in 1993. The writer pitched both concepts of Mars Attacks and Dinosaurs Attack! to Burton, who both decided that Dinosaurs Attack! would be too similar to Jurassic Park (1993). Burton, who was busy preparing Ed Wood (1994), believed that Mars Attacks! would be a perfect opportunity {{to pay homage to}} the films of Edward D. Wood, Jr., especially Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), and other 1950s science fiction B movies, such as Invaders from Mars (1953), It Came from Outer Space (1953), The War of the Worlds (1953), Target Earth (1954), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and Earth vs. the Flying <b>Saucers</b> (1956).|$|E

5|$|Over forty of {{the songs}} that Grossmith wrote or {{performed}} in his one-man shows have been recorded by baritone Leon Berger (a British Gilbert & Sullivan singer and Grossmith scholar), accompanied by Selwyn Tillett (G scholar) on two CDs: A Society Clown: The Songs of George Grossmith and The Grossmith Legacy. The latter also contains the recorded voice of Grossmith's son, George Grossmith Jr. Both are on the Divine Art Label. No recordings of Grossmith's voice are known to exist, although wax cylinder recording technology was available during his lifetime. Cups and <b>Saucers</b> was recorded by Retrospect Opera in 2016, together with F. C. Burnand and Edward Solomon's Pickwick.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying <b>Saucers</b> and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet {{on a collision course with}} the Earth.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and <b>saucers</b> lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E
50|$|This new <b>saucer</b> section {{has been}} {{designed}} to be able to land on a planetary body and lift off from the surface, overcoming a reluctance by captains to carry out a <b>saucer</b> sep. The stardrive section of the Enterprise-D is attached to this new <b>saucer,</b> which is then taken out for field testing. During the course of the mission, the <b>saucer</b> section is hijacked by Maquis operatives (one of whom is among Nechayev's test crew), who intend to re-dock it with the stardrive section and take it over, and Picard finds himself having to prevent the <b>saucer</b> and the technology contained within from falling into Maquis hands.|$|R
50|$|While recovering, a {{small crowd}} gathers around her. A {{policeman}} shows up, the crowd increases in size, and an FBI agent arrives. The girl sits up and says that the <b>saucer</b> spoke to her. The FBI man orders her to shut up and takes both the girl and the now-inanimate <b>saucer</b> into custody. The authorities obtain no information from the <b>saucer</b> or from the girl. They interrogate her about everything but especially about what the <b>saucer</b> had said to her. She refuses to answer, as the <b>saucer</b> was talking only to her, and thinks that it's nobody else's business. Finally, after many months in custody, including jail, she is released.|$|R
25|$|Another {{effect of}} the flying <b>saucer</b> type of UFO {{sightings}} has been Earth-made flying <b>saucer</b> craft in space fiction, for example the United Planets Cruiser C57D in Forbidden Planet (1956), the Jupiter 2 in Lost in Space, and the <b>saucer</b> section of the USS Enterprise in Star Trek, and many others.|$|R
5|$|Computer Space is a space combat arcade game {{developed}} in 1971 {{as one of}} the last games created in the early history of video games. Created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in partnership as Syzygy Engineering, it was the first arcade video game as well as the first commercially available video game. Computer Space is a derivative of the 1962 computer game Spacewar!, possibly the first video game to spread to multiple computer installations. It features a rocket, controlled by the player, engaged in a missile battle with a pair of flying <b>saucers</b> set against a background starfield. The goal is to score more hits than the enemy spaceships within a set time period, which awards a free round of gameplay. The game is enclosed in a custom fiberglass cabinet in one of four colors, which Bushnell designed himself to be futuristic.|$|E
5|$|His first {{television}} appearance {{was in a}} debate {{about the existence of}} flying <b>saucers</b> following a spate of reported sightings in the 1950s; Moore argued against Lord Dowding and other UFO proponents. He was invited to present a live astronomy programme and said the greatest difficulty was finding an appropriate theme tune; the opening of Jean Sibelius's Pelléas et Mélisande was chosen and used throughout the programme's existence. The programme was originally named Star Map before The Sky at Night was chosen in the Radio Times. On 24 April 1957, at 10:30 pm, Moore presented the first episode about the Comet Arend–Roland. The programme was pitched to casual viewers up to professional astronomers, in a format which remained consistent from its inception. Moore presented every monthly episode except for one in July 2004 when he suffered a near-fatal bout of food poisoning caused by eating a contaminated goose egg and was replaced for that episode by Chris Lintott. Moore appears in the Guinness World Records book as the world's longest-serving TV presenter having presented the programme since 1957. From 2004 to 2012, the programme was broadcast from Moore's home, when arthritis prevented him from travelling to the studios. Over the years he received many lucrative offers to take his programme onto other networks, but rejected them because he held a 'gentlemen's agreement' with the BBC.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, David {{demonstrates}} {{that the key to}} defeating the aliens lies in deactivating their force fields, and devises a way to do so by uploading a computer virus into the mothership. He proposes using the refurbished alien fighter to implement the plan, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The two are able to upload the virus and deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership. With military pilots in short supply, Thomas enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on Area 51. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighters are able to inflict damage, but their supply of missiles is quickly exhausted. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but his attempt of firing it jams, leaving him no choice but to sacrifice his own life. He flies his plane kamikaze-style into the directed-energy weapon port, which results in an explosion that destroys the saucer. Human resistance forces around the world successfully destroy the other <b>saucers</b> using this vulnerability. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They and military officers nearby accompany Thomas and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership burn up, resembling a fireworks display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|The gendarmes build {{a replica}} <b>saucer</b> to bait out the aliens {{and place it}} in the field where they had seen the <b>saucer</b> before. When the actual aliens arrive to {{investigate}} the second <b>saucer,</b> they disguise themselves as the gendarmes. The actual gendarmes then ambush them and spray them with water using packs on their back. Despite being sprayed with water, the aliens use their laser vision do destroy the gendarmes' water packs. The gendarmes briefly engage the aliens in hand-to-hand combat before the aliens seemingly retreat into their <b>saucer</b> and fly away. The next day, the gendarmes are being saluted as heroes at a parade, when they suddenly start making metallic noises and collapse. It is revealed that these are actually the alien gendarmes. Moments later, the flying <b>saucer</b> comes out of nowhere and flies over the crowd, being piloted by the real gendarmes who accidentally boarded the real <b>saucer.</b> The <b>saucer</b> runs out of power and falls into the ocean. The gendarmes get out, and are hailed as heroes by Saint-Tropez.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was self-sufficiency with {{only a small percentage}} of production being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support a wide variety of food establishments that catered to various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell ready-made hot food, an early form of fast food, or offer cooking services while the customers supplied some or all of the ingredients. Travellers, such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the more affluent, there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, <b>saucers,</b> waferers, etc. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden of throwing a major banquet.|$|E

25|$|Donald Keyhoe later began {{investigating}} flying <b>saucers</b> for True Magazine. Keyhoe {{was one of}} {{the first}} significant conspiracy theorists, asserting eventually that the <b>saucers</b> were from outer space and were on some sort of scouting mission. Keyhoe claimed to derive his theory from his contacts in Air Force and Navy intelligence. Project Sign, based at Air Technical Intelligence Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and its successors Project Grudge and Project Blue Book were officially assigned to investigate the flying <b>saucers.</b> Edward Ruppelt's book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, reports that many people within these research groups did in fact support the hypothesis that the flying <b>saucers</b> were from outer space.|$|E

50|$|The <b>saucer</b> {{had begun}} {{to be built in}} 1994 and became a local tourist attraction, with a $1 entry fee. The center {{was the subject of a}} 2001 segment in The Daily Show, in which Stephen Colbert {{presented}} a caricatured tour of the attraction. In 2003 Pendarvis added a smaller <b>saucer,</b> about 20 feet in width, to the top of the original structure and began living in the <b>saucer</b> during the summers when the <b>saucer</b> is cooler than his nearby mobile home. The admission price had risen to $20 by 2005.|$|R
