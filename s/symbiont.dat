5|$|The makeup for the Trill host {{featured}} a separate nose and forehead pieces, as the {{intention was to}} retain the general look of a human. Air bladders were placed inside a fake abdomen to create the shot in which the <b>symbiont</b> appeared to move under the host's skin. A second fake abdomen was created for the surgery scene in which the <b>symbiont</b> is moved into Riker, which worked by having a crew member lie under the surgery table, pulling the <b>symbiont</b> into the opening using a concealed string. The design of the <b>symbiont</b> {{was based on a}} caterpillar with an octopus for a head, which {{featured a}} further air bladder in order to give the appearance that it was pulsating and painted in fluorescent paint to glow when a black light was shone on it during that scene.|$|E

5|$|The {{shape and}} {{appearance}} of each coral colony depends {{not only on}} the species, but also on its location, depth, the amount of water movement and other factors. Many shallow-water corals contain <b>symbiont</b> unicellular organisms known as zooxanthellae within their tissues. These give their colour to the coral which thus may vary in hue depending on what species of <b>symbiont</b> it contains. Stony corals are closely related to sea anemones, and like them are armed with stinging cells known as cnidocytes. Corals reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most species release gametes into the sea where fertilisation takes place, and the planula larvae drift as part of the plankton, but a few species brood their eggs. Asexual reproduction is mostly by fragmentation, when part of a colony becomes detached and reattaches elsewhere.|$|E

30|$|Results of the {{meta-analysis}} also {{imply that}} diatom <b>symbionts</b> appear more resilient than dinoflagellate <b>symbionts</b> under ocean warming (Fig. 8 b). A meta-analysis for OA scenarios {{also suggests that}} hyaline taxa with diatom <b>symbionts</b> appear more resilient than porcelaneous taxa with dinoflagellate <b>symbionts</b> (Doo et al. 2014). These contrasting differences in host growth and photosymbiont health between two foraminiferal taxa with different algal <b>symbionts</b> will likely result in the dominance of hyaline foraminifera over porcelaneous foraminifera in symbiont-bearing reef foraminiferal communities in the future, {{as well as the}} geographical expansion of the former taxa to higher latitudes (Weinmann et al. 2013). The resilience of diatom <b>symbionts</b> over dinoflagellate <b>symbionts</b> under ocean warming may also partially explain the dominance of large benthic foraminifera during the warm period of the Cenozoic. During the Paleogene, hyaline rotaliid taxa such as Nummulites dominated and diversified in tropical to subtropical carbonate environments (Hallock 2000). Based on the fact that their modern descendants host diatom <b>symbionts,</b> these extinct hyaline taxa possibly harbor diatom <b>symbionts</b> (Lee 1998). Thus, a warm, high CO 2 world in the geological past was likely favored by hyaline taxa with diatom <b>symbionts</b> but not by porcelaneous taxa with dinoflagellate <b>symbionts,</b> as suggested by Hallock (2000) and Fujita et al. (2011).|$|R
40|$|Almost all lumbricid {{earthworms}} (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae) harbor species-specific Verminephrobacter (Betaproteobacteria) <b>symbionts</b> {{in their}} nephridia (excretory organs). The {{function of the}} symbiosis, and whether the <b>symbionts</b> have a beneficial effect on their earthworm host, is unknown; however, the <b>symbionts</b> have been hypothesized to enhance nitrogen retention in earthworms. The effect of Verminephrobacter on the life history traits of the earthworm Aporrectodea tuberculata (Eisen) was investigated by comparing the growth, development, and fecundity of worms with and without <b>symbionts</b> given high (cow dung) - and low (straw) -nutrient diets. There were no differences in worm growth {{or the number of}} cocoons produced by symbiotic and aposymbiotic worms. Worms with Verminephrobacter <b>symbionts</b> reached sexual maturity earlier and had higher cocoon hatching success than worms cured of their <b>symbionts</b> when grown on the low-nutrient diet. Thus, Verminephrobacter nephridial <b>symbionts</b> do have a beneficial effect on their earthworm host. Cocoons with and without <b>symbionts</b> did not significantly differ in total organic carbon, total nitrogen, or total hydrolyzable amino acid content, which strongly questions the hypothesized role of the <b>symbionts</b> in nitrogen recycling for the host...|$|R

5|$|Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) notifies Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) that a {{group of}} Trill {{scientists}} will be arriving soon at Deep Space Nine to perform experiments related to wormhole physics. The Trill are a species formed of both a humanoid host and a <b>symbiont,</b> which are implanted into them. The symbionts live far longer than the hosts, and are moved into a new host when the old one dies. Jadzia is the eighth host of the Dax <b>symbiont.</b> Sisko tells Dax that the head scientist is Lenara Kahn (Susanna Thompson), and offers to grant Dax a leave of absence while the Trill scientists are aboard, but she turns it down. Upon Dax and Kahn's first meeting, Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) notices that they are very familiar with each other; Dax tells her that Kahn used to be her wife. Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) later informs Kira about the non-association rules that Trill follow regarding the family and friends of former hosts, and says that hosts of the Dax and Kahn symbionts have previously been married to each other.|$|E

40|$|Marine {{biofouling}} {{has been}} regarded as a serious problem in the marine environment. The application of TBT and other heavy metal-based antifoulants has created another environmental problem. The present study explored the possible role of baterial <b>symbionts</b> of seagrasses Thalassia hemprichii, and Enhalus acoroides, which were successfully screened for antifouling activity against marine biofilm-forming bacteria isolated from the surrounding colonies of seagrasses. Bacterial <b>symbionts</b> were isolated and tested against biofilm-forming bacteria resulted in 4 bacterial <b>symbionts</b> capable of inhibiting the growth biofilm-forming isolates. Molecular identification based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the active bacterial <b>symbionts</b> belonged {{to the members of}} the genera Bacillus and Virgibacillus.

5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the <b>symbiont</b> zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E

Following the procedure, Ezri — now known as Ezri Dax — spent time at the Symbiosis Institute on Trill to learn to adapt to her new state.

5|$|Historically, Sarcosphaera coronaria {{has been}} {{assumed to be}} saprobic, {{acquiring}} nutrients from breaking down decaying organic matter. The fungus, however, is only found with trees known to form mycorrhiza, and it is often locally abundant where it occurs, year after year in the same location, indicative of a mycorrhizal lifestyle. The results of a 2006 study of Pezizalean fungi further suggest that the species is an ectomycorrhizal <b>symbiont,</b> and more generally, that the Pezizales include more ectomycorrhizal fungi than previously thought.|$|E
40|$|Increasing the acidity {{of ocean}} waters will {{directly}} threaten calcifying marine organisms such as reef-building scleractinian corals, and {{the myriad of}} species that rely on corals for protection and sustenance. Ocean pH has already decreased by around 0. 1 pH units {{since the beginning of}} the industrial revolution, and is expected to decrease by another 0. 2 – 0. 4 pH units by 2100. This study mimicked the pre-industrial, present, and near-future levels of p CO 2 using a precise control system (± 5 % p CO 2), to assess the impact of ocean acidification on the calcification of recently-settled primary polyps of Acropora digitifera, both with and without <b>symbionts,</b> and adult fragments with <b>symbionts.</b> The increase in p CO 2 of 100 μatm between the pre-industrial period and the present had more effect on the calcification rate of adult A. digitifera than the anticipated future increases of several hundreds of micro-atmospheres of p CO 2. The primary polyps with <b>symbionts</b> showed higher calcification rates than primary polyps without <b>symbionts,</b> suggesting that (i) primary polyps housing <b>symbionts</b> are more tolerant to near-future ocean acidification than organisms without <b>symbionts,</b> and (ii) corals acquiring <b>symbionts</b> from the environment (i. e. broadcasting species) will be more vulnerable to ocean acidification than corals that maternally acquire <b>symbionts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background Non-essential facultative endosymbionts {{can provide}} their hosts with {{protection}} from parasites, pathogens, and predators. For example, two facultative bacterial <b>symbionts</b> of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), Serratia symbiotica and Hamiltonella defensa, protect their hosts from parasitism by {{two species of}} parasitoid wasp. Previous studies have not explored whether facultative <b>symbionts</b> also play a defensive role against predation in this system. We tested whether feeding on aphids harboring different facultative <b>symbionts</b> affected the fitness of an aphid predator, the lady beetle Hippodamia convergens. Results While these aphid faculative <b>symbionts</b> did not deter lady beetle feeding, they did decrease survival of lady beetle larvae. Lady beetle larvae fed a diet of aphids with facultative <b>symbionts</b> had significantly reduced survival from egg hatching to pupation and therefore had reduced survival to adult emergence. Additionally, lady beetle adults fed aphids with facultative <b>symbionts</b> were significantly heavier than those fed facultative symbiont-free aphids, though development time was not significantly different. Conclusions Aphids reproduce clonally and are often found in large groups. Thus, aphid <b>symbionts,</b> by reducing the fitness of the aphid predator H. convergens, may indirectly defend their hosts’ clonal descendants against predation. These findings highlight the often far-reaching effects that <b>symbionts</b> can have in ecological systems...|$|R
40|$|A complex phylogenomic {{analysis}} of Enterobacteriaceae (50 taxa, 69 genes) {{was conducted to}} investigate origins of obligate intracellular <b>symbionts</b> within this symbiont-rich group of bacteria. Resulting topologies confirmed at least four independent origins of endosymbiosis within the Enterobacteriaceae and suggest origins of <b>symbionts</b> from phenotypically various bacterial ancestors including gut and pathogenic bacteria or facultative <b>symbionts...</b>|$|R
5|$|Other fauna, such as hydrozoa, bryozoa {{and brittle}} stars, often dwell among the {{branches}} of gorgonian and coral colonies. The pygmy seahorse not only makes certain species of gorgonians its home, but closely resembles its host and is thus well camouflaged. Some organisms have an obligate relationship with their host species. The mollusc Simnialena marferula is only found on the sea whip Leptogorgia virgulata, is coloured like it and has sequestered its defensive chemicals, and the nudibranch Tritonia wellsi is another obligate <b>symbiont,</b> its feathery gills resembling the tentacles of the polyps.|$|E
5|$|Three Amylostereum {{species are}} {{symbionts}} of wood wasps in the genera Sirex, Urocerus, and Xoanon, which infest conifers. The female wood wasps deposit their eggs together with fungal spores and mucus in trees, and the fungus is eaten by the wasp's larva as food. The fungus propagates vegetatively through {{the formation of}} asexual spores in newly emerged females that are stored in special structures adapted for the transport of symbiotic fungi. The A.areolatum–Sirex woodwasp (S.noctilio) <b>symbiont</b> complex has been studied extensively because of its potential to cause substantial economic losses in the forestry industry, particularly in non-native regions.|$|E
5|$|Compatibility {{tests as}} well as {{molecular}} analysis indicated that A.areolatum separated very early from other Amylostereum fungi. The other three species separated later {{from each other and}} are thus partially compatible to each other. A.ferreum and A.laevigatum produced in 59% of all cases a common mycelium, A.ferreum and A.chailletii only in 44%. There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A.laevigatum and A.ferreum. This is remarkable, as these fungi originated from Mycetangae (storing organs of Platypodinae) of a North American wood wasp, while A.laevigatum has never been seen as <b>symbiont</b> of wood wasps, neither in North American nor in Europe. The fungus possibly represents a separated species or a subtaxon of A.laevigatum. As A.areolatum and A.chailletii mainly reproduce asexually through the symbiosis of wood wasps, the genetic variability within these species is relatively low.|$|E
50|$|These plants harness {{an array}} of fungal <b>symbionts</b> across several families, often simultaneously. Analysis of these plants have {{identified}} Inocybe species as exclusive <b>symbionts</b> for 75% of the plants in habitat, {{as well as others}} (Hebeloma, Xerocomus, Lactarius and Thelephora). The plants also host ascomycete endophytes, which appear to assist the plant in parasitizing some of the plant's basidiomycete <b>symbionts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Symbiosis {{relationships}} can be obligate, {{meaning that}} {{one or both of}} the <b>symbionts</b> entirely depend on each other for survival. For example, in lichens, which consist of fungal and photosynthetic <b>symbionts,</b> the fungal partners cannot live on their own. The algal or cyanobacterial <b>symbionts</b> in lichens, such as Trentepohlia, can generally live independently, and their symbiosis is, therefore, facultative (optional).|$|R
40|$|Vertically {{transmitted}} bacterial <b>symbionts</b> {{are common}} in arthropods. However, estimates of their incidence and diversity are based on studies that test for a single bacterial genus and often only include small samples of each host species. Focussing on ladybird beetles, we collected large samples from 21 species and tested them for four different bacterial <b>symbionts.</b> Over half the species were infected, and there were often multiple <b>symbionts</b> in the same population. In most cases, more females than males were infected, suggesting that the <b>symbionts</b> may be sex ratio distorters. Many of these infections would have been missed in previous studies as they only infect {{a small proportion of}} the population. Furthermore, 11 out of the 17 <b>symbionts</b> discovered by us were either in the genus Rickettsia or Spiroplasma, which are rarely sampled. Our results suggest that the true incidence and diversity of bacterial <b>symbionts</b> in insects may be far greater than previously thought...|$|R
5|$|In 2009, {{an unknown}} species of Boletopsis was {{discovered}} in the Orongorongo valley near Wellington, New Zealand. In 2010, the fungus was found again {{in the same place}} and also discovered on the South Island. Morphological comparisons and molecular analysis of other species of the genus suggested that the fungus could not be attributed to any known representative of the genus, and so it was described by mycologists Jerry A. Cooper and Patrick Leonard as a new species. The species description of Boletopsis nothofagi appeared in the journal MycoKeys in 2012. The two authors chose the epithet nothofagi based on the characteristic of the fungus as mycorrhizal <b>symbiont</b> of Nothofagus fusca. Swollen hyphae and smooth spores show that B.nothofagi {{is a member of the}} subgenus Boletopsis in the genus Boletopsis.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow (Salix). Precise favoured species are unclear; {{at least one of}} the tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia) or the dark-leaved willow (S.myrsinifolia) is a possible <b>symbiont,</b> while other trees that the species has been found near include the bay willow (S.pentandra), the grey willow (S.cinnerea), the grey alder (Alnus incana) and species of birch (Betula). I.saliceticola is found most typically in moist thickets or woodland close to shores, but recordings have also been made in other moist habitats. Mushrooms are encountered on the ground, growing from detritus or amongst moss, such as the heart-leaved spear-moss (Calliergon cordifolium), the spiky-bog moss (Sphagnum squarrosum) and species of Mnium. They are typically near plants such as the tufted loosestrife (Lysimachia thyrsiflora), the creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens), the common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palustre), the purple marshlocks (Comarum palustre) and the purple small-reed (Calamagrostis canescens), and share the habitat with other Inocybe, including I.acuta and I.laceravar.helobia.|$|E
5|$|Mutualism is {{well known}} in a few beetles, such as the ambrosia beetle, which {{partners}} with fungi to digest the wood of dead trees. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal <b>symbiont.</b> The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery, so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. The beetles cannot eat the wood due to toxins, and uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome the defenses of its host tree in order to provide nutrition for their larvae. Chemically mediated by a bacterially produced polyunsaturated peroxide, this mutualistic relationship between the beetle and the fungus is coevolved.|$|E
40|$|The marine bivalve Lucinoma aequizonata has {{intracellular}} chemoautotrophic <b>symbionts</b> {{residing in}} the gill tissue.

40|$|Insect hosts derive {{benefits}} from their obligate <b>symbionts,</b> including nutrient supplementation {{and the ability}} to colonize otherwise inhospitable niches.

Even small increases in average temperature, comparable to those occurring under current conditions of climate change, can kill <b>symbionts</b> and, with them, their hosts. In some cases, limitations imposed by obligate <b>symbionts</b> may help to counter the spread of invasive pests, but they also contribute to contractions in populations and geographic ranges of invertebrate species...|$|R
40|$|Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), and Siphoninus phillyreae (Haliday) are {{whitefly}} {{species that}} harm agricultural crops {{in many regions}} of the world. These insects live in close association with bacterial <b>symbionts</b> that affect host fitness and adaptation to the environment. In the current study, we surveyed the infection of whitefly populations in Southeast Europe by various bacterial <b>symbionts</b> and performed phylogenetic analyses on the different <b>symbionts</b> detected. Arsenophonus and Hamiltonella were the most prevalent <b>symbionts</b> in all three whitefly species. Rickettsia was found to infect mainly B. tabaci, while Wolbachia mainly infected both B. tabaci and S. phillyreae. Furthermore, Cardinium was rarely found in the investigated whitefly populations, while Fritschea was never found {{in any of the}} whitefly species tested. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a diversity of several <b>symbionts</b> (e. g., Hamiltonella, Arsenophonus, Rickettsia), which appeared in several clades. Reproductively isolated B. tabaci and T. vaporariorum shared the same (or highly similar) Hamiltonella and Arsenophonus, while these <b>symbionts</b> were distinctive in S. phillyreae. Interestingly, Arsenophonus from S. phillyreae did not cluster with any of the reported sequences, which could indicate the presence of Arsenophonus, not previously associated with whiteflies. In this study, <b>symbionts</b> (Wolbachia, Rickettsia, and Cardinium) known to infect a wide range of insects each clustered in the same clades independently of the whitefly species. These results indicate horizontal transmission of bacterial <b>symbionts</b> between reproductively isolated whitefly species, a mechanism that can establish new infections that did not previously exist in whiteflies...|$|R
5|$|Mushrooms {{are mostly}} found during hot spells {{in summer and}} autumn, growing in {{mycorrhizal}} association with various broad-leaved trees and sclerophyllous shrubs, especially oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus), chestnut (Castanea), strawberry trees (Arbutus), treeheath (Erica), and rockrose (Cistus), showing a preference for acid soils. Roadsides and parks are common habitats. The cork oak in particular is an important <b>symbiont,</b> {{and the distribution of}} B.aereus (along with B.mamorensis) aligns with the tree across Europe and North Africa. The ectomycorrhizae that B.aereus forms with sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and downy oak (Quercus pubescens) have been described in detail. They are characterized by a lack of hyphal clamps, a plectenchymatous mantle (made of parallel-orientated hyphae with little branching or overlap), and rhizomorphs with differentiated hyphae. A 2007 field study on four species of boletes revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies appear to be more complex than previously thought.|$|E

40|$|Gutless oligochaetes {{are small}} marine worms {{that live in}} obligate {{associations}} with bacterial endosymbionts. While <b>symbionts</b> from several host species belonging to the genus Olavius have been described, little is known of the <b>symbionts</b> from the host genus Inanidrilus. In this study, the diversity of bacterial endosymbionts in Inanidrilus leukodermatus from Bermuda and Inanidrilus makropetalos from the Bahamas was investigated using comparative sequence analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene and fluorescence in situ hybridization. As in all other gutless oligochaetes examined to date, I. leukodermatus and I. makropetalos harbor large, oval bacteria identified as Gamma 1 <b>symbionts.</b> The presence of genes coding for ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase form I (cbbL) and adenosine 5 ′-phosphosulfate reductase (aprA) supports earlier studies indicating that these <b>symbionts</b> are chemoautotrophic sulfur oxidizers. Alphaproteobacteria, previously identified only in the gutless oligochaete Olavius loisae from the southwest Pacific Ocean, coexist with the Gamma 1 <b>symbionts</b> in both I. leukodermatus and I. makropetalos, with the former harboring four and the latter two alphaproteobacterial phylotypes. The presence of these <b>symbionts</b> in hosts from such geographically distant oceans as the Atlantic and Pacific suggests that symbioses with alphaproteobacterial <b>symbionts</b> may be widespread in gutless oligochaetes.
