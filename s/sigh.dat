5|$|Bonaparte's {{position}} as First Consul was {{strengthened by the}} successful outcome of the battle and the preceding campaign. After this victory, Napoleon could breathe a <b>sigh</b> of relief. The generals who had been hostile to him could see that his luck had not abandoned him. Thus, he had surpassed Schérer, Joubert, Championnet, and even Moreau, none {{of whom had been}} able to inflict a decisive blow on the Coalition. Moreau's victory at Hohenlinden, which was the one that in reality had {{put an end to the}} war, was minimised by Bonaparte who, from then on, would pose as a saviour of the fatherland, and even of the Republic. He rejected offers from Louis XVIII, who had considered the Consulate to be a mere transition towards the restoration of the king. Thanks to the victory at Marengo, Napoleon could finally set about reforming France according to his own vision.|$|E
5|$|Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward {{arrive at}} a gas station and from reading a {{newspaper}} article, discover SpongeBob's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City. But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him, SpongeBob cannot remember who they are. Squidward hi-jinks SpongeBob's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob still does not recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor. Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again, Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob's head, which causes his memory to come back. Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs apologize to SpongeBob for selfishly running him out of Bikini Bottom and are happy to have him back. But even so, SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City. He changes his mind after a breaking news report comes on, saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens, and a thug threatens to do something to SpongeBob if he ever comes back. SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again, much to his friends' delight. With a <b>sigh</b> of happiness, SpongeBob says that it looks like he will be back in Bikini Bottom. Upon hearing this, Squidward takes out his brain and drops it in a trash can.|$|E

25|$|For a {{short while}} a late career {{commercial}} breakthrough seemed likely. Rumor and <b>Sigh</b> {{was nominated for a}} Grammy and sold well. However, a shake-up at Capitol saw Hale Milgrim (Thompson's champion and fan within the boardroom) replaced by Garry Gersh. Thus, Thompson's next album Mirror Blue was held back for almost a year before being released, and the momentum that could have capitalized on the critical success and popularity enjoyed by Rumor and <b>Sigh</b> never followed.|$|E

25|$|After {{the release}} of That Obscure Object of Desire, Buñuel retired from filmmaking. In 1982, he wrote (along with Carrière) his autobiography, Mon Dernier Soupir (My Last <b>Sigh),</b> which {{provides}} an account of his life, friends, and family {{as well as a}} representation of his eccentric personality. In it, he recounts dreams, encounters with many well-known writers, actors, and artists such as Pablo Picasso and Charlie Chaplin as well as antics, like dressing up as a nun and walking around town.|$|E
25|$|The ephemeral {{qualities of}} operatic success are once more {{exemplified}} by the case of Emilie Ambre. In {{the early days of}} the Mapleson regime she made something of a sensation in New York, particularly as Aida, a role to which her very dark complexion was well suited. Now she is dead. Not long ago her effects were auctioned off at the Hotel Drouot. The whole civilized world heard the news, but there was scarcely a <b>sigh</b> from the public, for the singer had been absolutely forgotten.|$|E

25|$|Like other storks, {{they are}} very silent except at nest where they make bill-clattering sounds. The sounds {{produced}} are of a low-pitch and resonant and ends with a short <b>sigh.</b> Juveniles fledged from the nests can occasionally call using a mildly-warbling, high-pitched series of whistles, usually accompanied with open, quivering wings. These calls and behaviour are directed at adult birds and are a display to solicit food, particularly in drought years when younger birds are apparently unable to find food on their own easily.|$|E
25|$|In Saturday morning's free {{practice}} session Andrea Montermini, who had replaced Ratzenberger in the Simtek, {{had a huge}} crash exiting the high-speed final corner. In light of recent events, the paddock breathed a <b>sigh</b> of relief {{when it was announced}} Montermini had escaped with only a broken ankle and chipped heel. Schumacher took pole ahead of Hill, Häkkinen, Lehto, Barrichello and Alesi. As Simtek and Sauber both fielded only 1 car for the race, both Pacific cars were able to qualify for the race by default as they did in Monaco.|$|E
25|$|Tytla {{was one of}} {{the first}} animators {{assigned}} to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Fred Moore and Tytla were responsible for much of the design of the film and the definition of the personalities of the seven dwarfs. One of Tytla's famous scenes from the film (as described by John Canemaker) is where woman-hating Grumpy is kissed by Snow White. As he brusquely walks away, an internal warmth generated by the kiss gradually slows him, bringing a soft smile and <b>sigh</b> to his lips, revealing his true feelings of love. Grumpy's inner feelings are portrayed solely through pantomimein his telling facial expressions, his body language, and the timing of his reactions.|$|E
