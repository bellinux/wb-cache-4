5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and <b>squeeze</b> <b>in</b> extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to expand the}} memory and instruction set for Block II, but to retain the Block I's restrictive three-bit op. code and 12-bit address had interesting design consequences. Various tricks were employed to <b>squeeze</b> <b>in</b> additional instructions, such as having special memory addresses which, when referenced, would implement a certain function. For instance, an INDEX to address 25 triggered the RESUME instruction to return from an interrupt. Likewise, INDEX 17 performed an INHINT instruction (inhibit interrupts), while INDEX 16 reenabled them (RELINT). Other instructions were implemented by preceding them with a special version of TC called EXTEND. The address spaces were extended by employing the Bank (fixed) and Ebank (erasable) registers, so the only memory of either type that could be addressed {{at any given time}} was the current bank, plus the small amount of fixed-fixed memory and the erasable memory. In addition, the bank register could address a maximum of 32 kilowords, so an Sbank (super-bank) register was required to access the last 4 kilowords. All across-bank subroutine calls had to be initiated from fixed-fixed memory through special functions to restore the original bank during the return: essentially a system of far pointers.|$|E
25|$|An {{official}} list {{began to develop}} with Greco-Roman astronomer Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria (c. 100 – c. 170), whose list of 48 constellations was accepted as standard in Europe for 1,800 years. As constellations {{were considered to be}} composed only of the stars that constituted the figure, it was always possible to use any leftover stars to create and <b>squeeze</b> <b>in</b> a new grouping among the established constellations. Furthermore, exploration by Europeans {{to other parts of the}} globe exposed them to stars unknown to ancient Mediterraneans. Two astronomers particularly known for expanding on Ptolemy's catalog were Johann Bayer (1572–1625) and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1713–1762). Bayer listed a dozen figures that had been suggested since Ptolemy's day; Lacaille created new groups, mostly for the area near the South Celestial Pole. Many of their proposed constellations have been accepted, with the rest remaining as asterisms. In 1930, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) divided the sky into 88 official constellations surrounding recognized asterisms, with precise geometric boundaries that encompass all of the stars within them. Any grouping – whether it has an area of the sky identified by it or not – is an asterism.|$|E

25|$|At the Santa Fe campus, {{there is}} a program {{offering}} a Master of Arts in Eastern Classics (M.A.E.C.). This program is three semesters long and {{is designed to be}} completed in one 12-month period. The impetus for the program came with the recognition that the undergraduate program simply could not do justice to the Great Books of the three main Asian traditions (India, China and Japan) by trying to <b>squeeze</b> <b>in</b> a few works among so many European masterworks. The EC program therefore provides a full set of readings in the philosophical, religious and literary traditions of the three cultures listed above. Thus, students learn Chinese culture by reading not only Confucius, Laozi and Zhuangzi, but also Mencius, Xun Zi, Han Feizi, and Mozi, as well as historical narratives by Sima Qian and the Zuo Zhuan, the later movement of Neo-Confucianism and Zhu Xi, narrative works such as Journey to the West or the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the great Chinese poets, Li Bai, Wang Wei and Du Fu. This list represents only one-third of the required corpus, which also covers the major teachings and branches of Hinduism and the development of Theravada, Mahayana and Zen Buddhism, as well as such literary masterpieces as the Mahabharata, Shakuntala, The Tale of Genji, The Narrow Road to the Deep North and others. Students also take a language, either Sanskrit or Classical Chinese.|$|E

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate a}} scheme to enhance relative number squeezing and spin <b>squeezing</b> <b>in</b> a two- component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) by utilizing the inherent mean-field dynamics of the condensate. Due to the asymmetry in the scattering lengths, the two components exhibit large density oscillations where they spatially separate and recombine. The effective nonlinearity responsible for the squeezing is increased by up to 3 orders of magnitude when the two components spatially separate. We perform a multimode simulation of the system using the truncated Wigner method and show that this method {{can be used to}} create significant <b>squeezing</b> <b>in</b> systems where the effective nonlinearity would ordinarily be too small to produce any significant <b>squeezing</b> <b>in</b> sensible time frames, and we show that strong spatial dynamics resulting from large particle numbers aren’t necessarily detrimental to generating squeezing.

Landing at Boston, he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and his American publisher, James Thomas Fields. In early December, the readings began. [...] He performed 76 readings, netting £19,000, from December 1867 to April 1868.

2500|$|After a short {{assignment}} aboard USRC Thetis undergoing repairs at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Bertholf {{was again}} assigned to Bear in May, 1899, {{but this time}} as the executive officer. During this assignment, the crew of Bear delivered more reindeer to Alaska from Russia, enforced Federal law, rescued stranded destitute gold miners from starvation, rescued whalers from a shipwreck and investigated two murders; the Revenue Cutter Service being the only law enforcement in Alaska at the time. During this time Bertholf took the examination for First Lieutenant and was promoted in June 1900. [...] In January 1901, he was attached to the Department of Interior and sent to Russia to acquire more reindeer that were of hardier stock, for shipment to Alaska, for the relief of the Inuit.
