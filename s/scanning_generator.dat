30|$|Scanning microscopes {{are unique}} in that they allow for the {{recording}} of multiple signal types, often concurrently, {{all of which are}} spatially resolved. For the study of material science, some of the most powerful families of instruments used are the aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). Each of these valuable research tools is capable of yielding several imaging and spectroscopic signals, often in parallel, at atomic resolution. To retrieve these spatially resolved signals, a scanned probe of either electrons or a physical tip is used, in contrast with the parallel illumination in conventional transmission electron (TEM) or optical microscopy. However, in each case, this serial acquisition comes with a penalty, as typical acquisition times can be up to tens of seconds long depending on the image dimensions and scanning speed. At these acquisition times, the operator has to worry about correcting not only image offsets from stage/sample drift [1 – 6] (for example from thermal expansion) but also low-frequency distortions that can perturb the image locally [7 – 9]. Still, further problems can arise from incorrect instrument <b>scan</b> <b>generator</b> calibration [10]. These offsets and distortions then require correction by so-called rigid and non-rigid registrations.|$|R

As a result the scanning system for the sup 8 sup 4 Kr sup 1 sup 5 sup + ion beam extracted from the cyclotron IC- 100 has been chosen and worked up. It consists of two deflecting yokes creating horizontal and vertical magnetic fields. The yokes are supplied by generators of saw-tooth current having the definitely fixed frequencies. When both generators work synchronously the centre of mass of the ion beam 'draws' a pattern on the target. The dimensions of the pattern cells {{are determined by the}} ratio of these frequencies. The correlation between the generator frequencies when heterogeneity of the particle density distribution does not exceed the required value of +- 5 % is obtained. It has been shown that for the moving target the chosen scanning scheme allows one to obtain its uniform density distribution. For the slow target velocities (20 - 50 cm/s) this scheme also allows one to compensate the collapse in the particle density distribution on the target when the protective beam interruption occurs on time up to 0. 3 s.

Others and we previously applied large scale EM to human skin pancreatic islets, tissue culture and whole zebrafish larvae(1 - 7). Here we describe a universally applicable method for tissue-scale scanning EM for unbiased detection of sub-cellular and molecular features.

Our method is based on standardized EM sample preparation protocols: Fixation with glutaraldehyde and osmium, followed by epoxy-resin embedding, ultrathin sectioning and mounting of ultrathin-sections on one-hole grids, followed by post staining with uranyl and lead. Large-scale 2 D EM mosaic images are acquired using a scanning EM connected to an external large area <b>scan</b> <b>generator</b> using <b>scanning</b> transmission EM (STEM). Large scale EM images are typically similar to 5 - 50 G pixels in size, and best viewed using zoomable HTML files, which can be opened in any web browser, similar to online geographical HTML maps.

We visualize within a single dataset tissue, cellular and subcellular changes which can be quantified in various cell types including neurons and microglia, the brain's macrophages. In addition, nanotomy facilitates the correlation of EM with light microscopy (CLEM) (8) on the same tissue, as large surface areas previously imaged using fluorescent microscopy, can subsequently be subjected to large area EM, resulting in the nano-anatomy (nanotomy) of tissues.

50|$|The {{contrast}} seeker is {{a simple}} device that can be implemented using very basic analog electronics. It first uses some form of automatic gain control to adjust the image brightness until it contains some areas with high-contrast spots. This produces a bias voltage signal to represent the background brightness level, making brighter objects stand out. Any rapid change in contrast along a given scan line causes the voltage from the camera to suddenly change. If the change is greater than a selected threshold, it triggers a second circuit that sends {{the output of the}} <b>scanning</b> time base <b>generator</b> into capacitors. Thus the capacitors store a voltage value representing the Y and X locations of any high contrast spot within the image.|$|R

5000|$|The FPS-16 system {{originally}} {{planned for the}} Project Mercury tracking network did not have adequate displays and controls for reliably acquiring the spacecraft in the acquisition time available. Consequently, a contract was negotiated with a manufacturer to provide the instrumentation radar acquisition (IRACQ)RAnge Acquisition modifications. For the near earth spacecraft involved a major limitation of the FPS-16 was its mechanical range gear box, a wonderful piece of engineering. However, for a target at a range typically, say, [...] at acquisition of signal AOS, the radar was tracking second time around, that is, the pulse received in this interpulse period was that due to the previously transmitted pulse, {{and it would be}} indicating a range of [...] As the range closed the return pulse became {{closer and closer to the}} time at which the next transmitter pulse should occur. If they were allowed to coincide, remembering that the transmit-receive switch disconnected the receive (Rx) and connected the transmit (Tx) to the antenna at that instant, track would be lost. So, IRACQ provided an electronic ranging system, the function of which was to provide the necessary gating pulses to the Az and El receiver channels so that the system would maintain angle track. The system utilized a voltage controlled crystal oscillator VCXO as the clock generator for the range counters. An early/late gate system derived an error voltage which either increased a closing target or decreased an opening target the clock frequency, thus causing the gates to be generated so as to track the target. It also, when the target reached an indicated range of less than 16000 yd, took over the generation of transmitter trigger pulses and delayed these by 16000 yd, thus enabling the received pulses to pass through the Big Bang, as it was called, of normally timed Tx pulses. The radar operator, would, while IRACQ maintained angle track be slewing the range system from minimum range to maximum so as to regain track of the target at its true range of <500 nmi (900 km). As the target passed through point of closest approach (PCA) and increased in range the process was repeated at maximum range indication. The most difficult passes were those in which the orbit was such that the target came to PCA at a range of, say 470 nmi. That pass required the radar operator to work very hard as the radar closed, and then opened in range through the Big Bang in short order. The IRACQ Console contained a C-scope associated with which was a small joy stick which gave C-scope operator control of the antenna angle servo systems so that he could adjust the pointing angle to acquire the signal. IRACQ included a <b>scan</b> <b>generator</b> which drove the antenna in one of several pre-determined search patterns around the nominal pointing position, it being desirable that IRACQ acquire the target as early as possible. An essential feature of this modification is that it allows examination of all incoming video signals and allows establishment of angle-only track. Once the spacecraft has been acquired, in angle range. Other features of the IRACQ system included additional angle scan modes and radar phasing controls to permit multiple radar interrogation of the spacecraft beacon. The addition of a beacon local oscillator wave meter permitted the determination of spacecraft-transmitter frequency drift.|$|R

40|$|Local Alfven wave (LAW) {{resonances}} are excited in tokamak plasmas by an externally driven electro-magnetic field, with the frequency below the ion cyclotron frequency, where using of the Alfven waves is assumed. Recently, wave driven density fluctuations at the LAW resonance m=+/- 1, N=+/- 2 with few kW power deposition and 4 MHz frequency were detected in TCABR (Bt = 1. 1 T, q 0 = 1. 1, n 0 = 1. 4 - 2. 0 10 ^{ 19 }/ m^ 3) using a fixed frequency (32. 4 GHz) O-mode reflectometer. Here, {{we show that}} combination of small power deposition in LAW resonances, swept by plasma density variation or <b>scanned</b> with <b>generator</b> frequencies, in combination with detection of the density fluctuations in the LAW resonances by reflectometry can serve as diagnostic tool for identification of the effective ion mass number Aef and q-profile in tokamaks. The idea {{is based on the}} simultaneous detection of the position of m=+/- 1 local AW resonances, which are excited by M/N=+/- 1 /+/- 2 antenna modes, and m= 0 generated by poloidal mode coupling effect in tokamaks. According to LAW dispersion, the m= 0 resonance depends only on the effective ion mass number and does not depend on the q-profile. Then, using these data we can define q-value at the position of m=+/- 1 L AW resonances. Using TAE coils with even toroidal modes (N= 2, 4, [...] ) and AW generator in the frequency band 0. 6 - 1 MHz, an application of this method to Joint European Torus (Bt= 2. 3 T, q 0 = 1 - 1. 3, n 0 = 5 - 7 10 ^ 19 /m^ 3) is demonstrated.

The Solid Modeling Program (SMP) is an interactive program {{that is used to}} model complex solid object through the composition of primitive geomeentities.

The ADAGE 3000 Programmable Display Generator (PDG) is a color, raster <b>scan,</b> programmable display <b>generator</b> with a 32 -bit bit-slice, bipolar microprocessor (BPS).

40|$|The use of lasers for {{generating}} and detecting ultrasound {{is becoming more}} established in NDT. However, there is still scope in developing the techniques to fully realise the benefits of non-contact measurements for different applications. One particular application is the detection of surface defects in metals; for example, rolling contact fatigue in rails, and surface cracking on billets. For these applications scanning techniques can prove beneficial. We present measurements and models based on a system using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser to generate surface ultrasonic waves and an IOS two-wave mixer interferometer to detect the surface displacement on the sample, to investigate the interaction of Rayleigh or Lamb waves with surface defects. Changes in the transmission of surface waves {{in the vicinity of}} surface defects can be used for depth characterisation. This can then be combined with other techniques, such as signal enhancement, in order to pinpoint the defect position. This is observed for Rayleigh waves when either the <b>generator</b> (<b>scanning</b> laser source, SLS, technique) or detector is close to a defect. For a scanned detector measurement, enhancement is observed due to constructive interference of the incident and reflected Rayleigh waves with the mode converted surface skimming longitudinal wave. For SLS, the mode-converted wave is attenuated before reaching the detector, but the change in generation conditions when the laser is over the defect also lead to an enhancement. In measurements of plate samples we observe similar enhancement effects whereby higher order modes are generated when the laser is above a defect. The defect geometry significantly affects the enhancement observed when scanning the detection laser, such that a shallow angled crack will give an enhancement of over 10 times the incident signal amplitude, whereas the angle dependence of the SLS technique is relatively small. We discuss the reasons for this extra enhancement, and the implications for scanning laser techniques used for detecting and characterising surface cracking...|$|R
