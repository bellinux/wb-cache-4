5|$|The Aegean prehistorians felt <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> {{about their}} {{calculations}} that they rejected early radiocarbon dates in the 1970s for LMI/LCI Thera, as radiocarbon suggested a date about {{a century earlier}} than the traditional dates.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, called the Armée d'Angleterre (Army of England) around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England, and was <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> of success that he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate the conquest of the English. Although they never invaded, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale.|$|E
5|$|In January 1957, Diefenbaker {{took his}} place as Leader of the Official Opposition. In February, St. Laurent {{informed}} him that Parliament would be dissolved in April for an election on June 10. The Liberals submitted a budget in March; Diefenbaker attacked it for overly high taxes, failure to assist pensioners, {{and a lack of}} aid for the poorer provinces. Parliament was dissolved on April 12. St. Laurent was <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> of victory that he did not even bother to make recommendations to the Governor General to fill the 16 vacancies in the Senate.|$|E

6000|$|The stranger's manner was <b>so</b> doggedly <b>confident</b> that Mrs. Wade {{sank back}} tremblingly in her chair. The man put his slouch hat on his knee, twirled it round once or twice, {{and then said}} with the same {{stubborn}} deliberation:-- ...|$|R
50|$|Even {{though the}} Hessians {{had been on}} {{heightened}} alert {{for the past two}} weeks, they believed Honeyman’s story and <b>so</b> felt <b>confident</b> enough to relax security on December 26. In the meantime, Honeyman made his way to New Brunswick, New Jersey.|$|R
5|$|The {{first series}} of Hi-5 {{was sold to}} New Zealand and Singapore. In 2000, there were {{expression}} of interests from Britain, Canada, Germany, Israel and South Africa. The TV series had a successful premiere in the UK in early 2003. Initially, Harris expected that the series would become formatted into international versions, however she was <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> with the original cast that the Australian series was sold overseas instead. On pay-TV in Australia, Hi-5 premiered on Nick Jr. in 2003. The programme debuted in the US {{for the first time}} in 2014, with episodes featuring the original cast premiering on KCET.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only because he was <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{stated that}} {{the energy of the}} group was fast-paced, replicating the style of a music video, which {{children}} seem to enjoy. The educational theories incorporated were disguised with music and entertainment, with the band's work being designed to have multiple layers and cater {{for a wide range of}} ages in the audience, while being primarily aimed at those aged 2–8. Harris explained that Hi-5 was primarily a television series, but the music itself had the ability to stand alone. She expected that the series would initially become formatted into international versions, however was <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> with the original cast that the Australian series was sold overseas instead.|$|E
5000|$|Elle also compares it {{to other}} works, [...] "while evocative of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and Picnic at Hanging Rock, Kohler's writing is <b>so</b> {{smoothly}} <b>confident</b> and erotic that she has produced a tale resonant with a chilling power all its own." ...|$|R
50|$|Standard {{methods are}} {{designed}} and used widely to maximize {{precision and accuracy}} for all toxicity tests. Values derived from toxicity tests such as the MATC are reported to regulatory organizations like the US EPA and Environment Canada <b>so</b> more <b>confident</b> regulations can be designed.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Day {{returned}} to moulding Sabrina to meet his requirements for the ideal woman, choosing what she would wear, and pushing his ideas of frugality upon her. Sabrina took on all the ideas willingly and Day believed he had finally created a woman who would meet all his requirements. He was <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> that he talked openly of marrying Sabrina, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends {{let her know that}} he hoped to marry her. Sabrina confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that he had hoped to marry her since the day he met her.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1796 French and allied forces had been almost {{completely}} driven from the Indian Ocean, most of the colonies of the French-allied Batavian Republic falling to British invasions during 1795. The only significant French presence was on Île de France {{and a few other}} nearby islands, from which a squadron of two frigates periodically operated against British trade. The British were <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> of supremacy that they had split their forces, with a large squadron based at Simon's Town in the Cape Colony of Southern Africa under Sir George Keith Elphinstone and a smaller dispersed force operating under Peter Rainier in the Dutch East Indies, based at the captured port of Malacca. The important trading ports of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay were largely undefended, as were the valuable trade routes which supported them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said. He {{looked down}} at her and met her look. It {{disturbed}} her. She did not know him. He was a foreigner, they {{had nothing to do with}} each other. Yet his look disturbed her to knowledge of him. He was <b>so</b> strangely <b>confident</b> and direct.|$|R
5000|$|The critics praised Booth's performance. [...] "Everyone {{has long}} since lost his heart to Miss Booth," [...] wrote Brooks Atkinson in the New York Times. Walter Kerr praised her [...] "ease and self-assurance". [...] "She is <b>so</b> radiantly <b>confident</b> that the marquee outside glows {{brighter}} for having her in the neighborhood." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>So</b> supremely <b>confident</b> is Rasalom of his {{eventual}} {{victory that}} he spares Glaeken for an especially gruesome fate and {{allows him to}} pursue his desperate plan to save the Earth so that Glaeken's ultimate failure will become both Rasalom's greatest victory as well as Glaeken's - and humankind's - most tragic final defeat.|$|R
5|$|In spring 829, Michael II sent a new fleet to Sicily under Theodotus, who {{was well}} acquainted with the island, having already served as its strategos in the past. After landing, Theodotus marched his army to Enna, where the Arabs were {{continuing}} the siege. He was defeated in the subsequent battle, but {{was able to find}} refuge in the fortress with most of his men. The Muslims now became <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> of victory that they struck their first coins on the island, in the name of Ziyadat Allah and Muhammad ibn Abu'l-Jawari, who however died a short while after and was replaced by Zubayr ibn Gawth. Shortly after that, Theodotus managed to reverse the situation: he led a sally that routed a Muslim raiding party and then defeated the main Muslim army on the next day, killing 1,000 men and pursuing the rest up to the Muslims' fortified encampment, which he placed under siege. The Muslims tried to break out in a night sortie, but Theodotus was expecting such a move and routed them in an ambush.|$|E
5|$|Selke {{retired in}} 1964 and was succeeded by Sam Pollock. Often named the best general manager in NHL history, Pollock led the Canadiens to nine Stanley Cup championships in his 14 {{years at the}} helm of the team. One of his key tactics was trading aging stars to {{expansion}} teams for draft picks, which led to the team drafting future Hall of Famers Guy Lafleur, Larry Robinson and Ken Dryden. The Canadiens won consecutive titles in 1965 and 1966, and entered the 1967 Stanley Cup Final against Toronto as a heavy favourite. The City of Montreal was <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> in the Canadiens that they had already built a space for the Stanley Cup on the Expo 67 site, but the Canadiens fell to the Maple Leafs, in the last NHL finals of the Original Six era.|$|E
25|$|The Air Corps brass were <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> {{in the new}} {{technology}} that they allowed the XC-35 {{to be used as}} an executive transport for Louis Johnson, the assistant secretary of war and future Secretary of Defense.|$|E
50|$|Douglas led {{the left}} wing, while John Dunbar, Earl of Moray led the right. Hotspur's men, having ridden up from Newcastle, were tired and disorganized {{as they made}} their way onto the field. Hotspur was <b>so</b> overly <b>confident</b> that he {{attacked}} the Scots while the rest of his force was still marching up through Otterburn.|$|R

60|$|He seated {{himself again}} to his cigarettes. Though {{he had said}} it, he {{scarcely}} believed Charleroi would entertain company that night. For {{the first time in}} history the invitation of a Charles had been ignored. So simple in courtesy and honour was Grandemont, and, perhaps, <b>so</b> serenely <b>confident</b> in the prestige of his name, that the most likely reasons for the vacant board did not occur to him.|$|R
25|$|Hitchen {{regarded}} {{these matters}} so commonplace, <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> was he of his inviolability {{in the sense}} of having official immunity, that he began to boast of controlling dozens of thieves. At the beginning of September, the Court of Aldermen was presented an array of complaints from different layers of society, notably, all of whom were victims of pickpockets.|$|E
25|$|After the {{war began}} in 1914, the United States proclaimed a policy of {{neutrality}} despite president Woodrow Wilson's antipathies against Germany. Early in the war, the United States started to favor the British and their allies. President Wilson aimed to broker a peace and sent his top aide, Colonel House, on repeated missions to the two sides, but each remained <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> of victory that they ignored peace proposals.|$|E
25|$|After {{a stellar}} amateur career, Camacho began a quick rise through the {{professional}} rankings, {{first in the}} featherweight {{and then in the}} junior-lightweight division. He was <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> that he claimed he could beat world featherweight champions Salvador Sánchez and Eusebio Pedroza. However, Sánchez died while Camacho was still coming up in the ranks. In the junior-lightweight division, he defeated the top contenders Irleis Cubanito Perez, Melvin Paul, John Montes, and Refugio Rojas.|$|E

25|$|On November 30, 2012, it was {{revealed}} that shortly before the election, internal polling done by the Romney campaign had shown Romney ahead in Colorado and New Hampshire, tied in Iowa, and within a few points of Obama in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Ohio. In addition, the Romney campaign had assumed that they would win Florida and Virginia. The polls had made Romney and his campaign team <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> of their victory that Romney did not write a concession speech until Obama's victory was announced.|$|E
25|$|The Confederates did not press {{an attack}} after Col. John A. Washington, of Lee's staff, was killed during a {{reconnaissance}} of the Union right. Reynolds was <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> {{in the face}} of such timidity that he dispatched two of his own regiments from Elk Water up the mountain road to relieve the supposedly besieged fortress garrison, but the arriving Union reinforcements were unnecessary. Lee called off the attack and, after maneuvering in the vicinity, withdrew to Valley Mountain on September 17. Reynolds, meanwhile, planned an offensive against the Confederate forces stationed at the Greenbrier River.|$|E
25|$|Council Bluffs {{had several}} advantages: It was well {{north of the}} much of the Civil War {{fighting}} taking place in Missouri; it was the shortest route to South Pass in the Rockies in Wyoming; and it would follow a fertile river that would encourage settlement. Durant had hired Lincoln in 1857 {{when he was an}} attorney to represent him in a business matter about a bridge over the Missouri. Now Lincoln was responsible for choosing the eastern terminus, and he relied on Durant's counsel. Durant advocated for Omaha, and he was <b>so</b> <b>confident</b> of the choice that he began buying up land in Nebraska.|$|E
