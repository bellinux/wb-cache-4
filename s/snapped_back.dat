500|$|Alongside {{a series}} of unpopular films, {{problems}} arose from Hepburn's attitude. She had a difficult relationship with the press, with whom she could be rude and provocative. When asked {{if she had any}} children, she <b>snapped</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "Yes I have five: two white and three colored." [...] She would not give interviews and denied requests for autographs, which earned her the nickname [...] "Katharine of Arrogance". The public was also baffled by her boyish behavior and fashion choices, and she became a largely unpopular figure. Hepburn sensed that she needed to leave Hollywood, so she returned east to star in a theatrical adaptation of Jane Eyre. It had a successful tour, but, uncertain about the script and unwilling to risk failure after the disaster of The Lake, Hepburn decided against taking the show to Broadway. Towards the end of 1936, Hepburn vied for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind. Producer David O. Selznick refused to offer her the part because he felt she had no sex appeal. He reportedly told Hepburn, [...] "I can't see Rhett Butler chasing you for twelve years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an episode}} {{broadcast}} March 28, 1948, Benny borrowed neighbor Ronald Colman's Oscar, and was returning {{home when he}} was accosted by a mugger (voiced by comedian Eddie Marr). After asking for a match to light a cigarette, the mugger demands, [...] "Don't make a move, this is a stickup. Now, come on. Your money or your life." [...] Benny paused, and the studio audience—knowing his skinflint character—laughed. The robber then repeated his demand: [...] "Look, bud! I said your money or your life!" [...] Benny <b>snapped</b> <b>back,</b> without a break, [...] "I'm thinking it over!" [...] This time, the audience laughed louder and longer than they had during the pause.|$|E

60|$|When {{there was}} only a faint gleam of water sliding by below, he rose stiffly to his feet, and Lewson {{stretched}} out a hand for the rifle that lay among the stones. There was a sharp click as he jerked the lever, and then he laughed, a little jarring laugh, as the magazine <b>snapped</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
60|$|At last {{he became}} aware of the mighty surging of a number of his antagonists back and forth upon the great chain that held him, and {{presently}} came the same sound that he had heard at a little distance from him a short time before he had been attacked--his chain had parted and the broken end <b>snapped</b> <b>back</b> against the stone wall.|$|E

6000|$|It was pitiful. [...] "Lost fiddlesticks!" [...] I <b>snapped</b> <b>back</b> at him, with bared teeth. [...] "I wouldn't--I've never harmed a fly. Who, I {{should like}} to know, came to my help when...?" [...] But I choked down the words. Silence fell between us. The idiot clock chimed five. He turned his face away to conceal the aversion that had {{suddenly}} overwhelmed him at sight of me.|$|E
60|$|The old gun-man {{started as}} if he had seen ghosts. His hands grew clawlike as he reached for the guns. He threw open the cylinders, spilled out the shells, <b>snapped</b> <b>back</b> the cylinders. Then he went through motions too swift for Shefford to follow. But Shefford heard the hammers falling so swiftly they blended their clicks almost in one sound. Lassiter reloaded the guns with a speed {{comparable}} with the other actions. A remarkable transformation had come over him. He did not seem the same man. The mild eyes had changed; the long, shadowy, sloping lines were tense cords; and there was a cold, ashy shade on his face.|$|E
6000|$|He reluctantly went on, regretting {{every step}} {{that took him}} from her. But {{as he reached the}} next corner his {{shoulders}} <b>snapped</b> <b>back</b> into defiant straightness, he thrust his hands into the side pockets of his top-coat, and strode away, feeling that he had shaken off a burden of [...] "niceness." [...] He had, willy-nilly, recovered his freedom. He could go anywhere, now; mingle with any sort of people; be common and comfortable. He didn't have to take dancing lessons or fear the results of losing his job, or of being robbed of his interests in the Touricar. He glanced interestedly at a pretty girl; recklessly went into a cigar-store and bought a fifteen-cent cigar. He was free again.|$|E

6000|$|The hand moved very {{cautiously}} as it {{went down}} his side, within reach of Unk Wunk's one swift weapon. There were thousands of the spines, rough as a saw's edge, crossing each other in every direction, yet with every point outward. Unk Wunk was irritated, probably, {{because he could not}} have the salt he wanted. As the hand came within range, his tail <b>snapped</b> <b>back</b> like lightning. I was watching for the blow, but was not half quick enough. At the rustling snap, like the voice of a steel trap, I jerked my hand away. Two of his tail spines came with it; and a dozen more were in my coat sleeve. I jumped away as he turned, and so escaped the quick double swing of his tail at my legs. Then he rolled into a chestnut bur again, and proclaimed mockingly at every point: [...] "Touch me if you dare!" ...|$|E
60|$|This was no deer {{which they}} were chasing, however, but rather a grim old Transvaal wolf, with his teeth {{flashing}} ever over his shoulder. The sight of those distant white-tilted wagons fired the blood of every mounted infantryman, and sent the Oxfords, the Buffs, the West Ridings, and the Gloucesters racing along the river bank in the glorious virile air of an African morning. But there were kopjes ahead, sown with fierce Dopper Boers, and those tempting wagons were only to be reached over their bodies. The broad plain across which the English were hurrying was suddenly swept with a storm of bullets. The long infantry line extended yet further and lapped round the flank of the Boer position, and once more the terrible duet of the Mauser and the Lee-Metford was sung while the 81st field battery hurried up in time to add its deep roar to their higher chorus. With fine judgment Cronje {{held on to the}} last moment of safety, and then with a swift movement to the rear seized a further line two miles off, and again <b>snapped</b> <b>back</b> at his eager pursuers. All day the grim and weary rearguard stalled off the fiery advance of the infantry, and at nightfall the wagons were still untaken. The pursuing force {{to the north of the}} river was, it must be remembered, numerically inferior to the pursued, so that in simply retarding the advance of the enemy and in giving other British troops time to come up, Knox's brigade was doing splendid work. Had Cronje been well advised or well informed, he would have left his guns and wagons in the hope that by a swift dash over the Modder he might still bring his army away in safety. He seems to have underrated both the British numbers and the British activity.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{something}} whimsical in the quick beat of her eyelids {{and in the}} subtle quiver of her lips. “And behold! the same notion had occurred to Azzolati. Imagine that for this tête-à-tête dinner the creature had got himself up as if for a reception at court. He displayed a brochette {{of all sorts of}} decorations on the lapel of his frac and had a broad ribbon of some order across his shirt front. An orange ribbon. Bavarian, I should say. Great Roman Catholic, Azzolati. It was always his ambition to be the banker of all the Bourbons in the world. The last remnants of his hair were dyed jet black and the ends of his moustache were like knitting needles. He was disposed to be as soft as wax in my hands. Unfortunately I had had some irritating interviews during the day. I was keeping down sudden impulses to smash a glass, throw a plate on the floor, do something violent to relieve my feelings. His submissive attitude made me still more nervous. He was ready to do anything in the world for me providing that I would promise him that he would never find my door shut against him as long as he lived. You understand the impudence of it, don’t you? And his tone was positively abject, too. I <b>snapped</b> <b>back</b> at him that I had no door, that I was a nomad. He bowed ironically till his nose nearly touched his plate but begged me to remember that to his personal knowledge I had four houses of my own about the world. And you know this made me feel a homeless outcast more than ever—like a little dog lost in the street—not knowing where to go. I was ready to cry and there the creature sat in front of me with an imbecile smile as much as to say ‘here is a poser for you. [...] .’ I gnashed my teeth at him. Quietly, you know [...] . I suppose you two think that I am stupid.” ...|$|E

50|$|Elastic fibers (or yellow fibers) are {{bundles of}} {{proteins}} (elastin) found in extracellular matrix of connective tissue and produced by fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in arteries.
