40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that {{the extent to which a}} person maintains attention to pleasant versus unpleasant aspects of a given stimulus has an effect on the self-reported affective state. This assumption was empirically tested in two experiments. In Study 1, participants received the instruction either to focus on a positive emotion-eliciting event (winning a tournament chess game) or to focus their attention on an affectively neutral distraction task (describing drawings). Study 2 used negative performance feedback in a cognitive task to induce unpleasant affect and included three experimental groups (waiting condition, continuing with the same cognitive task, distraction by a different cognitive task). Results converged to show that distracting attention away from the emotion-eliciting event leads to a shorter duration of the emotional experience. These findings <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention-focus</b> hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|We propose {{two models}} {{of how a}} subject 2 Ì† 019 s growing {{experience}} in a medium affects presence: The Spin model (based on Spinoza) which predicts that subjects begin as present and then learn to become non-present; and the SoD model (based on Coleridge) which predicts that subjects expend effort to suspend their disbelief during presence. In a longitudinal study, 47 subjects (divided randomly into an attention-focussing and attention-neutral group) {{were exposed to the}} same VE over three days, and measured with the ITC-SOPI after the first and final exposures, and then again after a 72 hour delay. The data show the attention-neutral subjects experienced a slight increase in spatial presence, while <b>the</b> <b>attention-focussed</b> subjects showed no change over time. After <b>the</b> delay, <b>the</b> <b>attention-focussing</b> group experiences an increase in spatial presence and the attention-neutral group remains unchanged. We argue that this is, within the limits of the study, evidence for the Spin model. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and measurement implications of the models and results...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} <b>support</b> to <b>the</b> characteristics of participatory and anticipatory stages in secondary school pupils' abstraction of mathematical conceptions. We carried out clinical task-based interviews with 71 secondary-school pupils to obtain {{evidence of the}} different constructed mathematical conceptions (Participatory Stage) {{and how they were}} used (Anticipatory Stage). We distinguish two moments in the Participatory Stage based on the coordination of information from particular cases by activity-effect reflection which, in some cases, lead to a change of focus enabling secondary-school pupils to achieve a reorganization of their knowledge. We argue that (a) the capacity of perceiving regularities in sets of particular cases is a characteristic of activity-effect reflection in the abstraction of mathematical conceptions in secondary school, and (b) the coordination of information by pupils provides opportunities for changing <b>the</b> <b>attention-focus</b> from <b>the</b> particular results to the structure of properties...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} a visual search task, in which observers {{responded to the}} high-acuityaspect of a pop-out target (shape of an odd-colored diamond or vernier offset of an odd spatial-frequency patch). Repetition of the attention-driving feature (color or spatial frequency) in this task primes the pop-out; repetition of the high-acuity aspect (shape, vernier offset) does not. Priming of pop-out {{is due to a}} decaying memory trace of <b>the</b> <b>attention-focusing</b> feature laid down with each trial. The trace ex-erts a diminishing effect over the following five to eight trials (- 30 sec), and its influence over this time is cumulative. Observers cannot willfully overcome the priming, which suggests that it is pas-sive and autonomous. Both target facilitation and distractor inhibition are evident; the former has a greater effect. The phenomenon shows complete binocular transfer. In a typical visual search experiment, the observer's task is to detect the presence of the odd target within a field of distractors. Two well-known effects have been observed. Serial search is the term attributed to the find-ing that an increasing number ofdistractors increases the time necessary to find the target, yielding positive slop...|$|R
40|$|While {{people with}} Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show clear {{impairments}} in normal day-to-day behavior, they simultaneously outperform their Typically Developing (TD) counterparts on many perceptual tasks. This relative superiority in tasks requiring {{the processing of}} separate features rather than the overall configuration has inspired two competing theoretical frameworks: the Weak Central Coherence hypothesis (WCC) and the Enhanced Perceptional Functioning (EPF) theory. While WCC theory explains these results {{by the absence of}} a normal bias towards the global structure in a visual display in people with ASD, EPF theory insists that generally increased attention for local elements in a scene is the cause. Although both theoretical frameworks have been investigated for years, evidence for either line of theory remains mixed and ambiguously interpretable. To address this problem, we argue that the existing evidence on perceptual processing in ASD should be integrated within a unified theoretical framework, the Reverse Hierarchy Theory (RHT). Within this theory, both neurocognitive theories can be regarded as cases of hierarchy perturbations in the visual cortex. More precisely, people with ASD show a less efficient (slower) early-stage and pre-attentive global processing of visual information (in accordance with WCC) and a later-stage advantage in <b>the</b> <b>attention-focused</b> processing of local scene (or object) elements (in accordance with EPF). The empirical foundation of this alternative framework will be discussed on the basis of four recent studies from our own lab on ultra-rapid categorization, change blindness, complex visual search (chase detection) and spatial frequency priming. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|While most Typically Developing (TD) {{participants}} have a coarse-to-fine processing style, people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) {{seem to be}} less globally and more locally biased when processing visual information. The stimulus-specific spatial frequency content might be directly relevant to determine this temporal hierarchy of visual information processing in people with and without ASD. In this study, we implemented a semantic priming task in which (in) congruent coarse and/or fine spatial information preceded target categorization. In the first experiment, we presented nonsocial images of real-life scenes either as an unfiltered picture or solely defined by Low or High Spatial Frequency (LSF or HSF, resp.) information. In a second experiment, we also used hybrid images, consisting of overlaid LSF and HSF information from these scenes. Such images were used because they contain multiplex spatial frequency scale information (e. g., coarse (LSF) and fine (HSF) information from two different scenes) and therefore allow the investigation of scale-dependent recognition. Interestingly, our results indicated that adolescents with ASD, compared to TD adolescents, made more categorization errors and needed more time to process the prime stimuli. Simultaneously however, they also showed (1) an age-dependent improvement in categorization performance, and (2) a larger priming effect when fine spatial frequency prime information was presented longer. This pattern of results indicates a later-stage advantage in <b>the</b> <b>attention-focused</b> processing of detailed spatial information in ASD. We argue that this does not contradict a less efficient early-stage and pre-attentive global processing stage in people with ASD. status: publishe...|$|R

In this PhD project, we evaluated previous research findings on coarse (global) and fine (local) visual processing in ASD and tested the critical ideas of the main neurocognitive theories (WCC and EPF) in innovative ways. We used a diverse set of time-dependent experimental paradigms to explore possible differences in high-level visual perception between adolescents and adults with and without ASD (12 - 25 years of age). More precisely, behavioral testing focused on specific combinations of five experimental topics of interest: (1) the use of more ecologically valid visual displays, (2) the role of attentional processes in perception, (3) the defining stimulus characteristics for coarse and fine visual processing, (4) the influence of socially relevant stimuli, and (5) the influence of implicit social inferences based on the perception of dynamic visual displays. We believe that, by linking current neurocognitive models with state-of-the-art research on the processing sequence of coarse and fine information in TD participants, RHT provides an important addition to our current understanding of visual processing in ASD. Future research should continue to focus on systematically varying the time-course and content of stimulus presentation in behavioral paradigms and to link it with neuroimaging findings. As a result, we believe that the ASD-related literature will converge on a neurologically plausible and coherent theoretical framework for understanding the atypical visual perception in ASD. status: publishe...|$|R
