40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} functional and phenotypic changes in T cells after in vitro coincubation of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) and Leishmania donovani parasites at different parasite/peripheral blood mononuclear cell ratios. The phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -induced lymphoproliferative response was {{reduced by the}} coincubation, and at the maximal parasite/peripheral blood mononuclear cell ratio used (7. 5 : 1), the average response was less than 40 % of the response in the absence <b>of</b> <b>parasites.</b> The cause <b>of</b> the reduction in lymphoproliferation is not clear, but it requires live parasites. Interleukin- 1 production was unaffected, the levels of soluble interleukin- 2 receptor in supernatants were not changed by the coincubation, and the addition of exogenous interleukin- 2 failed to revert the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the <b>parasites.</b> In addition to the reduction in lymphocyte proliferation, phenotypic lymphocyte changes were observed. Cell surface expression of the CD 3 antigen, {{which is part of the}} CD 3 -T-cell receptor complex, was significantly reduced with increasing parasite/peripheral blood mononuclear cell ratios; the reduction was general in the sense that the parasites caused a shift in the fluorescent intensities of anti-CD 3 labeled cells toward lower values, without affecting the distribution pattern. In contrast, the parasites altered the CD 25 (interleukin- 2 receptor) expression on PHA-stimulated cells from a homogenous CD 25 -positive population to two populations, one small and without CD 25 expression and the other, larger population with only a slight reduction in size and CD 25 expression. In addition to the changes in expression of surface antigens, a general reduction in the size of PHA-stimulated lymphocytes after coincubation with the parasites was observed. The data presented thus suggest that the inhibition of the proliferative response to PHA by live L. donovani in vitro is associated with early processes in lymphocyte activation. Further studies on the inhibitory phenomena described may be of potential significance in the investigation of the suppressive mechanisms in human visceral leishmaniasis...|$|R

40|$|Previous in vivo {{studies have}} shown that delta 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the {{principal}} active ingredient in marijuana, can suppress both luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth hormone (GH) secretion after its injection into the third ventricle of conscious male rats. The present studies were designed to determine the mechanism <b>of</b> these <b>effects.</b> Various doses <b>of</b> THC were incubated with either stalk median eminence fragments (MEs) or mediobasal hypothalamic (MBH) fragments in vitro. Although THC (10 nM) did not alter basal release of LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) from MEs in vitro, it completely blocked the stimulatory action of dopamine or norepinephrine on LHRH release. The effective doses to block LHRH release were associated with a blockade of synthesis and release of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) from MBH in vitro. In contrast to the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> THC on LHRH release, somatostatin release from MEs was enhanced in a dose-related manner with a minimal effective dose of 1 nM. Since PGE 2 suppresses somatostatin release, this enhancement may also be related to the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> THC on PGE 2 synthesis and release. We speculate that these actions are mediated by the recently discovered THC receptors in the tissue. The results indicate that the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> THC on LH release is mediated by a blockade of LHRH release, whereas the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the compound on growth hormone release is mediated, at least in part, by a stimulation of somatostatin release...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> ethanol on {{cerebral}} y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptor and its related {{signal transduction}} systems were studied. [3 H]GABA binding to cerebral GABAB receptors in crude synaptic membranes from rat brain was unaffected by ethanol at concentrations up to 100 mM, although 100 mM ethanol suppressed {{not only the}} basal but also forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation in cerebral cortical membrane vesicles. The <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> baclofen and the stimulatory <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> forskolin on cAMP formation was also found to be unaltered by ethanol. Prctreatment of the membrane vesicles with islet-activating protein (IAP), which eliminates the function of G, protein by its ribosylation, had no <b>effect</b> on the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> ethanol on basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation. In contrast, pretreatment of membrane vesicles with 'low pH', which is known to suppress the function of G, protein, eliminated the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> ethanol on cAMP formation.

Amounts of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM in the supernate of pokeweed mitogen-stimulated cocultures of normal and immunodeficient mononuclear cells were measured by radioimmunoassays. Mononuclear cells from three of six patients inhibited Ig production of normal B cells (P < 0. 005). When purified patient and normal T cells were added to B cells in various autologous or allogeneic combinations, {{it was observed that}} immunodeficient T cells (AT) from four patients suppressed normal IgM synthesis. Allogeneic normal T cells did not provide help for B cells from these same immunodeficient patients. In two patients, autologous T cells were able to help autologous B-cell IgM synthesis in vitro. In five patients, AT cells inhibited normal B-cell IgG synthesis. Removal of T cells bearing Ia determinants or T cells with Fc-IgG receptors did not diminish the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> AT cells on normal B-cell Ig synthesis. Addition of indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, did not abrogate the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> immunodeficient mononuclear cells.

40|$|Friend leukemia virus {{suppresses}} the proliferative {{responses of}} normal thymus-dependent (T) and bursa equivalent-dependent (B) lymphocytes from spleen, thymus, lymph node, and bone marrow to mitogens. The <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> Friend virus complex (FV) requires fully infectious virions. Friend erythroleukemic cells, washed to removed extracellular virus, fail to suppress concanavalin A (Con-A) -induced mitogenesis of normal spleen cells. This indicates that FV does not mediate its immunosuppressive effect via transformed erythropoietic cells. The in vitro <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> FV on lymphocyte mitogenesis is under host genetic control. Spleen, bone marrow, and thymus cells from strains of mice susceptible to FV-induced leukemogenesis in vivo were quite {{susceptible to the}} <b>suppressive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> FV in vitro. On the other hand, similar cells from strains of mice such as C 57 BL/ 6 resistant to Friend erythroleukemia, were quite resistant to in virto immunosuppression by FV. Mitogenesis of splenic T cells from resistant B 6 mice, previously treated with 89 Sr, became susceptible to suppression by FV. This indicated that the in vitro resistance of lymphocytes to FV-induced suppression is not an intrinsic property of T cells, but is controlled by marrow-dependent (M) cells which are selectively eliminated by treatment with 89 Sr. M-cell function does not develop in mice less than 3 -wk old. The Con A response by thymus cells from 2 -wk-old B 6 mice was susceptible to suppression by FV, further supporting the concept that M cells may regulate the genetic resistance to FV...|$|R
40|$|The {{secretory}} leukocyte {{protease inhibitor}} (SLPI) {{is found in}} a variety of secreted fluids in mammals and is a known inhibitor of serine proteases. Wild-type (WT) SLPI has recently been shown to block nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation in rat lungs and to interfere with the ensuing inflammatory response and recruitment of neutrophils after an intrapulmonary deposition of IgG immune complexes. In this study, WT SLPI and SLPI mutants with various degrees of protease-inhibitory capacity (for trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase) were evaluated for their ability to suppress the lung-vascular leak, neutrophil accumulation, and NF-κB activation in the lung inflammatory model. The SLPI mutant with Gly 72 (replacing Leu 72) lost its ability to block in vivo activation of NF-κB, as well as its ability to suppress the lung vascular leak and neutrophil recruitment. The Phe 72 and Gly 20 mutants were as effective as the WT SLPI in suppressing NF-κB activation and neutrophil recruitment. The Lys 72 mutant had the most <b>suppressive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the lung vascular leak and for neutrophil recruitment into the lung. The in vivo <b>suppressive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> SLPI mutants on lung vascular permeability, neutrophil recruitment, and NF-κB activation appear to be most closely related to their trypsin-inhibiting activity.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that hypertonic stress (HS) can suppress chemoattractant-induced neutrophil responses via {{cyclic adenosine monophosphate}} and enhance these responses through p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. The underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we report that HS dose-dependently releases adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) from neutrophils and that extracellular ATP is rapidly converted to adenosine or activates p 38 MAPK and enhances N-formyl-methionyl-lencyl-phenylalanine-induced superoxide formation. In contrast, adenosine suppresses superoxide formation. Adenosine deaminase treatment abolished the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> HS, indicating that HS inhibits neutrophils through adenosine generation. Neutrophils express mRNA, encoding all known PI adenosine receptors (A 1, A 2 a, A 2 b, and A 3) and the nucleotide receptors P 2 Y 2, P 2 Y 4, P 2 Y 6, P 2 Y 11, and P 2 X 7. A 2 receptor agonists mimicked the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> HS; the A 2 receptor antagonists 8 -(p-sulfophenyl) theophylline, 3, 7 -dimethyl- 1 -(2 -propynyl) xanthine, 1, 3, 7 -trimethyl- 8 -(3 -chlorostyryl) xanthine, and 3 -propylxanthine, but not A 1 and A 3 receptor antagonists, decreased the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> HS, indicating that HS suppresses neutrophils via A 2 receptor activation. Antagonists of P 2 receptors counteracted the enhancing <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> ATP, suggesting that HS costimulates neutrophils by means of P 2 receptor activation.

40|$|Objective: The {{literature}} {{has shown that}} cognitive and emotional changes may occur after chronic treatment with glucocorticoids.

Paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake transporter, is a commonly used antidepressant for alleviation of {{signs and symptoms of}} clinical depression. It was discovered to promote hippocampal neurogenesis {{in the past few years}} and we wanted to investigate its interaction with glucocorticoid in this study. Methods: Adult rats were given vehicle, corticosterone, paroxetine, or both corticosterone and paroxetine for 14 d. Cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus was quantified using 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) immunohistochemistry. Results: The corticosterone treatment suppressed while paroxetine treatment increased hippocampal cell proliferation. More importantly, paroxetine treatment could reverse the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> corticosterone on hippocampal cell proliferation.

40|$|Hyperprolactinaemia is an {{important}} cause of infertility due to the suppression of gonadotrophin release. In seasonal breeders such as the sheep and horse, PRL displays a temporal pattern of secretion. Peak secretion of prolactin (PRL) coincides with the long days of summer in both species, yet whereas the sheep is infertile during the sununer, the horse is fertile. Moreover, in both species, PRL only suppresses the gonadotrophin response to GnRH when applied to pituitary cultures concomitantly with bromocriptine (Br), a dopamine (DA) agonist, during the summer.

These findings establish a key role for the Mnk/eIF 4 E pathway in the regulatory <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> IFNγ on normal hematopoiesis and identify Mnk kinases as important elements in the control of IFNγ-inducible ISG mRNA translation...|$|R
40|$|At {{least two}} {{different}} types of plaque-forming cells (PFC) participating in the immune response of mice to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) are identified. This is demonstrated by (a) two PFC-peaks appearing at different times in response to the same low dose of antigen; (b) the morphology of the PFC in each of the two peaks is different; (c) the PFC in each peak respond differently to the <b>suppressive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> anti-SRBC serum...|$|R
