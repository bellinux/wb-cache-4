To observe this phenomenon in a controlled environment, various basic experimental setups were assembled in a <b>semianechoic</b> <b>chamber,</b> consisting of a metal antenna, a table tennis ball, and a dielectric plane positioned on a ground plane. We provide a phenomenological discussion and present the obtained results.

40|$|Semianechoic {{chambers}} are {{the most}} widely used emplacements for Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Tests. Semianechoic chambers design is not an easy task, since they must behave like an ideal Open Area Test Site (OATS) within a quite narrow margin (± 4 dB) in a wide frequency span (from 30 to 1000 MHz). There are several possible configurations for a <b>Semianechoic</b> <b>Chamber,</b> based on different technological solutions (dielectric foam absorbers of different shapes, ferrite absorbing tiles or a combination of both elements are found in most of the actual chambers). In this work a new and efficient technique for the analysis of 2 -D simplified model of a chamber with arbitrary absorber is introduced and validated. Some advanced results are presented, and a 2 -D estimator for studying the overall behaviour of the chamber is proposed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{complete}} microwave system for bulk timber disinfestation is developed and tested. A commercial FEM simulator {{has been used}} to design the applicator, looking for structures providing uniform field distributions, which is a factor of capital relevance for a successful treatment. Special attention has also been given to the reduction of electromagnetic energy leakage. A dual polarized cylindrical applicator with a corrugated flange has been designed. The applicator has also been numerically tested emulating some real-life operating conditions. A prototype has been built using two low-cost magnetrons of 900 W and high power coaxial cables and it has been tested inside a shielded <b>semianechoic</b> <b>chamber.</b> The tests have been carried out in three stages: validation of the applicator design, determination of the lethal dosage {{as a function of the}} insect position and the maximum wood temperature allowed and statement of safe operation procedures...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{analysis}} of anechoic and <b>semianechoic</b> <b>chambers</b> in the low frequency range is presented in this work. The method is able to deal with different kind of absorbers (multilayer, pyramidal, hybrid) with their geometrical dimensions and shape stating the upper frequency limit of validity of the approach. The method combines homogenization with geometrical optics to account for multiple reflections in absorber lined chambers. Image theory is used to speed up the computation. Reflection coefficients are obtained using transmission line analogy for transverse field components. Both dielectric and magnetic lossy materials are considered. The method has been implemented in a software tool with a GUI and allows the user an easy introduction of geometrical data for both the screening and the absorbers...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of speech {{research}} it is agreed that more real data is required to improve the articulatory modelling of the vocal tract. Acoustic techniques {{may be used to}} acquire vocal tract data. The advance of digital signal processing has allowed the development of new experimental techniques that allow fast and efficient measurements. DSP based measurement systems were set up, and acoustic impedance and transfer function measurements were performed {{on a wide variety of}} subjects in DCU’s <b>semianechoic</b> <b>chamber.</b> The measurement systems are compact and reproducible. The variation of the wall vibration load was investigated in a wide range of human subjects. The investigation was prompted by the question: Is the wall vibration load important in the study and implementation of vocal tract and articulatory models? The results point to the possible need in acoustic to articulatory inversion, of adapting the reference model to specific subjects by separately estimating the wall impedance load...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate microphone array techniques based condition monitoring (CM). In this paper, a cost effective microphone array configured with 4 -sensors and data acquisition systems is investigated theoretically and experimentally to evaluate its performance in characterising sound sources in different acoustic environments. Time delay estimation (TDE) is used as a basic tool for calculating the time delay of the sound source arrived at each of the 4 -sensors and hence the localization parameters of the sound source such as azimuth, elevation and distance can be calculated from the TDE information. Results are presented for experimental studies both in a <b>semianechoic</b> <b>chamber,</b> an outdoor environment and an enclosure. Comparing the results obtained under different conditions, it has confirmed that the microphone array system can catch the location of the main sound source and also has ability to track and give the azimuthal trajectory of a moving target with high degree of accuracy...|$|E

IEEE 802.11 g standard wireless networks, that do not support QoS in according with IEEE 802.11 e standard, are, in particular, accounted for and Bluetooth signals, additive white Gaussian noise, and competitive data traffic are considered as sources of interference. The goal is twofold: from one side, experimentally assessing and correlating the values that some performance metrics assume at the same time at different layers of an IEEE 802.11 g WLAN delivering video streaming {{in the presence of}} in-channel interference; from the other side, deducing helpful and practical hints for designers and technicians, in order to efficiently assess and enhance the {{performance of}} an IEEE 802.11 g WLAN supporting video streaming in some suitable setup conditions and in the presence of interference. To this purpose, an experimental analysis is planned following a cross-layer measurement approach, and a proper testbed within a <b>semianechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> is used.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a methodology for the off-line reproduction of random pressure fields with given spatial correlation characteristics. The simulation method is first presented, {{together with an}} outline of the signal processing techniques required. The design of an experimental setup is then detailed in relation {{with the nature of}} the simulated pressure fields. Of particular interest is the laboratory synthesis of three different types of partially correlated random excitations: an acoustic diffuse field, a grazing incident plane wave, and a turbulent boundary layer. The corresponding excitations are generated in a <b>semianechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> over a test panel using a near-field array of 16 loudspeakers driven by a set of optimal signals. The loudspeakers are positioned at a suitable distance above a sufficiently dense grid of microphones close to the simulation surface. The mutually correlated drive signals are determined from both the target correlation properties and the acoustic transfer functions measured between the loudspeakers and the microphones. This approach could provide a cost-effective method of reducing the variation of low frequency sound transmission measurements as well as simulating the propeller-induced noise and the boundary layer noise transmitted through aircraft fuselage structures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Throughout the {{performance}} of a RF immunity test according IEC 61000 - 4 - 3 there are several factors that should be taken into account to ensure the quality and to estimate the uncertainty associated to the results. One phenomenon that should be considered to calculate uncertainty is the disturbing effect produced by the EUT over the electric field generated within the calibrated uniform field area; nevertheless the mentioned effect is not easily quantifiable because the measuring process using additional antennas or field probes inside the <b>semianechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> could also alter the electric field distribution. An experimental method for quantifying the mentioned uncertainty contribution is presented. The method is based upon the fact that antenna-EUT coupling and reflection effects could be measured through changes in the input impedance of the field generation antenna. A validation procedure for the proposed method is also described. Hence, a relationship between the reflection coefficient at the antenna input port and the electric field strength is derived. The uncertainty contribution is calculated through the maximum relative change in the E-field intensity magnitude for the frequency range of 80 – 1000 MHz, considering the worst case for several EUT positions. 1...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{setup for}} complex mono-static {{radar cross section}} (RCS) measurements in the 1 – 10 -GHzfrequency band, employing a suitably modified <b>semianechoic</b> <b>chamber,</b> is presented and characterized. The foreseen application is the measurement of the complex RCS {{of the human body}} during respiratory activity, to ease the design and optimization of ultrawideband (UWB) radar systems for breath-activity monitoring. The proposed RCS test range is calibrated by means of a readily available aluminum flat panel and its performance is tested against canonical targets, evaluating uncertainty in magnitude, and phase measurements. The setup is then employed to carry out investigations on the complex RCS of a volunteer focusing on its changes resulting from breath activity. Applying the measured RCS patterns to a specifically developed model, the feasibility of the UWB radar approach for achieving a continuous contact-less monitoring of breath activity in a subject at rest is clearly demonstrated. Finally, experimental tests of the application of the proposed radar technique to real-world scenarios are shown, and the safety of RCS measurements and UWB radar monitoring, with reference to exposure of the monitored subject to the radiated electromagnetic fields, is evaluated...|$|E
40|$|In the {{internal}} combustion engine noise source separation process, the combustion noise and the piston slap noise are found to be seriously aliased in time-frequency domain. It is difficult to accurately separate them. Therefore, the noise source separation method which is based on Gammatone filter bank and robust independent component analysis (RobustICA) is proposed. The 6 -cylinder {{internal combustion engine}} vibration and noise test are carried out in a <b>semianechoic</b> <b>chamber.</b> The lead covering method is adopted to isolate the interference noise from numbers 1 to 5 cylinder parts, with only the number 6 cylinder parts left bare. Firstly, many mode components of the measured near-field radiated noise signals are extracted through the designed Gammatone filter bank. Then, the RobustICA algorithm is utilised to extract the independent components. Finally, the spectrum analysis, the continuous wavelet time-frequency analysis, the correlation function method, and the drag test are employed to further identify the separation results. The research results show that the frequency of the combustion noise and the piston slap noise are, respectively, concentrated at 4025 [*]Hz and 1725 [*]Hz. Compared with the EWT-RobustICA method, the separation results obtained by the Gammatone-RobustICA method have very fewer interference components...|$|E

40|$|This {{integrated}} numerical {{and experimental}} study intends {{to enhance the}} performance of an in-line fan with the implement of the guiding vane and the tail body.

Next, the guiding vane is constructed based on the calculated flow characteristics, and attached in the downstream of rotor to smoothen the flow pattern. An appropriate guiding vane with high-performance and low-noise features can be achieved after several design iterations. In addition, the tail body connected to the motor is introduced for further enhancing the fan performance by reducing the sizes of wake and reversed flow behind the hub.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the validity of laboratory soundscape reproduction and the robustness of soundscape dimensional analysis. The soundscapes in four urban locations in Manchester (UK) were recorded with a soundfield microphone. The soundscapes were reproduced through an ambisonic 3 D loudspeaker system in a <b>semianechoic</b> <b>chamber.</b> Fifteen listeners rated the reproduced soundscapes on nineteen elevenpoint semantic differential scales. Factor analysis revealed that four dimensions explained 65 % {{of the variance in the}} judgements. The dimensions were: relaxation/calmness (41 %), dynamics/vibrancy (10 %), communication (7 %) and spatiality (7 %). This experiment can be compared with that of Kang (2007), who used very similar rating scales on outdoor soundwalks in two locations in Sheffield (UK). Kang found dimensions of relaxation (26 %), communication (12 %), spatiality (8 %) and dynamics (7 %). The dimensions from the two experiments load onto the semantic scales in a similar way. These results indicate that ambisonic reproduction of soundscapes gives similar results to field experiments, though with more variance explained. They also show that dimensional analysis of soundscape response is robust enough to produce similar results for different locations in different cities. It is suggested that the dimensions that result from this kind of experiment depend somewhat on the rating scales and questions used. Nevertheless, soundscapes and their perceptual dimensions both seem to be reproducible to a meaningful extent. ...|$|E
