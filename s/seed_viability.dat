5|$|B.cuneata is {{very unusual}} in {{apparently}} suffering no seed loss due to granivory. In nearly all other species, burrowing insect larvae eat {{a large proportion}} of seeds, and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat. The seed-eating insects are mostly species-specific, and it appears that no insect species has adapted to B.cuneata. Possible reasons for this are the very low seed counts, and the rarity of the species, both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species. There is also no evidence of granivores feeding on seed after it has fallen. As a result, this species has the highest rate of <b>seed</b> <b>viability</b> recorded for a Banksia species: in one study, 74% of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable. This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old, about 90% of which is viable. After the ninth year, viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and senescence sets in. Seed production itself starts very slowly. On average, plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy. Storage increases exponentially, however, and 25-year-old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds. Seed production probably never plateaus. In fact, by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches more often than not. As plants age, branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death, and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years.|$|E
25|$|Three {{fundamental}} conditions {{must exist}} before germination can occur. (1) The embryo must be alive, called <b>seed</b> <b>viability.</b> (2) Any dormancy requirements that prevent germination must be overcome. (3) The proper environmental conditions must exist for germination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>viability</b> is {{the ability}} of the embryo to {{germinate}} and is affected by a number of different conditions. Some plants do not produce seeds that have functional complete embryos, or the seed may have no embryo at all, often called empty seeds. Predators and pathogens can damage or kill the seed while it is still in the fruit or after it is dispersed. Environmental conditions like flooding or heat can kill the seed before or during germination. The age of the seed affects its health and germination ability: since the seed has a living embryo, over time cells die and cannot be replaced. Some seeds can live {{for a long time before}} germination, while others can only survive for a short period after dispersal before they die.|$|E

25|$|The {{germination}} percentage {{is simply the}} proportion of seeds that germinate from all seeds subject to the right conditions for growth. The germination rate is {{the length of time}} it takes for the seeds to germinate. Germination percentages and rates are affected by <b>seed</b> <b>viability,</b> dormancy and environmental effects that impact on the seed and seedling. In agriculture and horticulture quality seeds have high viability, measured by {{germination percentage}} plus the rate of germination. This is given as a percent of germination over a certain amount of time, 90% germination in 20 days, for example. 'Dormancy' is covered above; many plants produce seeds with varying degrees of dormancy, and different seeds from the same fruit can have different degrees of dormancy. It's possible to have seeds with no dormancy if they are dispersed right away and do not dry (if the seeds dry they go into physiological dormancy). There is great variation amongst plants and a dormant seed is still a viable seed even though the germination rate might be very low.|$|E
2500|$|During seed dormancy, often {{associated}} with unpredictable and stressful environments, DNA damages accumulate as the seeds age. [...] In rye seeds, the reduction of DNA integrity due to damage is associated with loss of <b>seed</b> <b>viability</b> during storage. [...] Upon germination, seeds of Vicia faba undergo DNA repair. [...] A plant DNA ligase that is involved in repair of single- and double-strand breaks during seed germination is an important determinant of seed longevity. [...] Also, in Arabidopsis seeds, {{the activities of the}} DNA repair enzymes Poly ADP ribose polymerases (PARP) are likely needed for successful germination. [...] Thus DNA damages that accumulate during dormancy appear to be a problem for seed survival, and the enzymatic repair of DNA damages during germination appears to be important for <b>seed</b> <b>viability.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{seeds of}} Capsicum plants are {{dispersed}} predominantly by birds: in birds, the TRPV1 channel {{does not respond}} to capsaicin or related chemicals (avian vs. mammalian TRPV1 show functional diversity and selective sensitivity). [...] This is advantageous to the plant, as chili pepper seeds consumed by birds pass through the digestive tract and can germinate later, whereas mammals have molar teeth which destroy such seeds and prevent them from germinating. [...] Thus, natural selection {{may have led to}} increasing capsaicin production because it makes the plant less likely to be eaten by animals that do not help it disperse. There is also evidence that capsaicin may have evolved as an anti-fungal agent: the fungal pathogen Fusarium, which is known to infect wild chilies and thereby reduce <b>seed</b> <b>viability,</b> is deterred by capsaicin, which thus limits this form of predispersal seed mortality.|$|E
