5|$|On 2 September 2005, Fowler {{released}} {{a book called}} Fowler: My Autobiography, about his time as a footballer and the issues <b>surrounding</b> <b>him.</b> Since his transfer to Liverpool he has updated it and included a section about his return to Anfield. Excerpts published in newspapers included criticism of the England management.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the off-the-field issues, Tennessee underwent a pair of coaching changes {{in the weeks before}} the Chick-fil-A Bowl. Wide receivers coach Frank Wilson and running backs coach Eddie Gran each decided in the first days of December to leave Tennessee for other SEC teams. In interviews, Kiffin said the coaching changes and stories <b>surrounding</b> <b>him</b> were not a distraction from his team's bowl preparation.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster House, an opulent government-owned period {{house in}} London, was rented (at £20,000 per day) for {{interior}} scenes of Buckingham Palace. The 1936 Accession Council at St. James's Palace, where George VI swore an oath, was filmed in the Livery Hall of Drapers' Hall. The room, ornate and vast, met the occasion: the daunting {{nature of the}} new King's responsibilities was shown by <b>surrounding</b> <b>him</b> with rich detail, flags and royal portraiture.|$|E

5|$|In December 1928 Crowley met the Nicaraguan Maria Teresa Sanchez. Crowley was {{deported}} from France by the authorities, who disliked {{his reputation}} and feared {{that he was}} a German agent. So that she could join him in Britain, Crowley married Sanchez in August 1929. Now based in London, Mandrake Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six-volume set, also publishing his novel Moonchild and book of short stories The Stratagem. Mandrake went into liquidation in November 1930, before the entirety of Crowley's Confessions could be published. Mandrake's owner P.R. Stephenson meanwhile wrote The Legend of Aleister Crowley, an analysis of the media coverage <b>surrounding</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Murrell's fame greatly {{increased}} {{after his death}} when he was made the subject, albeit in a highly fictionalised form, of a 1900 novel by Arthur Morrison. Morrison also produced a more objective study of the cunning man, published in The Strand magazine. During the 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple conducted further research on Murrell, finding much local folklore still <b>surrounding</b> <b>him</b> in the Hadleigh area, including the allegation {{that he had the}} ability to fly and to instantaneously transport himself vast distances. Murrell has continued {{to attract the attention of}} historians and folklorists studying English folk magic, and is referenced in works by scholars like Ronald Hutton, Owen Davies, and Ralph Merrifield.|$|E
5|$|On September 3, 2009, The Washington Post {{called on}} Rangel to resign his {{chairmanship}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, given the ethical issues that had surfaced. Another Republican resolution was put forth to force {{him out of his}} chairmanship. However, Rangel stayed in place and mostly maintained his role in House leadership and policy discussions, including the Obama health care reform plan (opposition to which, he suggested, was partly due to racial prejudice against President Obama). Nevertheless, his influence was diminished by the questions <b>surrounding</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

5|$|One of Yaponchik's victims is {{identified}} as a restorer of Russian icons. Her home is searched, and {{it is found that}} she had uncovered Yaponchik's identity and attempted to appease him by sending him several icons. Black feels Yaponchik is killing in order to perpetuate the legends <b>surrounding</b> <b>him</b> by instilling fear in those who believe them. Watts and Black visit the Russian Embassy to find the man the icons were being mailed to—Sergei Stepanovich, identifiable as Yaponchik. Stepanovich is protected by diplomatic immunity; however, it becomes clear that Surova, Medikov and an Orthodox priest who aided the investigation have all been stalking Stepanovich, who they believe to be the Antichrist.|$|E
5|$|The legend <b>surrounding</b> <b>him</b> {{was that}} he was killed while {{attempting}} a rescue; however, this is untrue. Barry retired to Bern, Switzerland and after his death his body was passed into the care of the Natural History Museum of Bern. His skin has been preserved through taxidermy although his skull was modified in 1923 to match the Saint Bernard of that time period. His story and name have been used in literary works, and a monument to him stands in the Cimetière des Chiens near Paris. At the hospice one dog has always been named Barry in his honor and since 2004 the Foundation Barry du Grand Saint Bernard has been set up to take over the responsibility for breeding dogs from the hospice.|$|E
5|$|As {{the title}} suggests, {{one of the}} major themes of the film {{involves}} the temptations Father John faces to sin and stray from his priestly calling. This is perhaps most strongly manifested in his apparent ambivalence regarding the vow of celibacy required of Catholic priests. As Father John goes deeper into the red-light district and the seedier aspects of Minneapolis, he appears to face temptations from the prostitution and overt sexuality <b>surrounding</b> <b>him.</b> Additionally, it can be interpreted that his interest in Linda is one of physical attraction, as well as a desire to help her. This is further manifested through the sudden reappearance of his former girlfriend, for whom Father John admits to still harboring romantic feelings. The priest demonstrates conflicting emotions when it comes to maintaining his priestly vows and his relationship with Nadine.|$|E

5|$|Coplas, {{songs and}} plays have been {{adapted from the}} oral tradition, and formal studies of the {{historical}} Cofresí and the legends <b>surrounding</b> <b>him</b> have appeared in book form. Historians Cardona Bonet, Acosta, Salvador Brau, Ramon Ibern Fleytas, Antonio S. Pedreira, Bienvenido Camacho, Isabel Cuchí Coll, Fernando Géigel Sabat, Ramírez Brau and Cayetano Coll y Toste have published {{the results of their}} research. Others inspired by the pirate include poets Cesáreo Rosa Nieves and the brothers Luis and Gustavo Palés Matos. Educators Juan Bernardo Huyke and Robert Fernández Valledor have also published on Cofresí. In mainstream media Cofresí has recently been discussed in the newspapers El Mundo, El Imparcial, El Nuevo Día, Primera Hora, El Periódico de Catalunya, Die Tageszeitung, Tribuna do Norte and The New York Times, and the magazines Puerto Rico Ilustrado, Fiat Lux and Proceedings have published articles on the pirate.|$|E
5|$|D'Oliveira {{was aware}} of the {{political}} discussions <b>surrounding</b> <b>him</b> during 1968, and the pressure on him was intensified by the scrutiny of his supporters and opponents in England and South Africa. Conscious of his failure in the West Indies, he made a concerted effort to improve his batting. He scored runs consistently and was chosen for England's first Test of 1968, against Australia in early June. He was very successful, scoring 87 not out and taking two wickets. After England lost, however, D'Oliveira was blamed in some sections of the press. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he failed as a bowler, and his innings was difficult to evaluate as England had effectively lost the match by that stage. Even so, most observers expected him to retain his place, including the watching South Africans.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Ludwig {{venture into}} the {{volcanic}} caves to find Trepkos. When they find Firewalker, Trepkos shoots Ludwig {{in the back with}} a flare gun, killing him. He then burns Ludwig's body, as he was infected with the spore as well. Trepkos tells Mulder that after Firewalker returned from its first descent, Erickson pulverized a rock in one of its samples, resulting in his death and the infection of all the scientists immediately <b>surrounding</b> <b>him.</b> Trepkos says that the spore is parasitic in nature, making its hosts pass itself on to others. Meanwhile, in the lab, an infected O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully to expose her to the spore, forcing Scully to use a hammer to split the chains but to no avail, so she instead protects herself by throwing O'Neil into a sealed chamber and closing the door. A protrusion then bursts out of O'Neil's throat, killing her without spreading the spore to Scully.|$|E

5|$|Part I {{opens in}} 1972 Amsterdam. The narrator finds an old vellum-bound {{book with a}} woodcut of a dragon in the center {{associated}} with Dracula. When she asks her father Paul about it, he tells her how he found the handmade book in his study carrel {{when he was a}} graduate student in the 1950s. Paul took the book to his mentor, Professor Bartholomew Rossi, and was shocked to find that Rossi had found a similar handmade book when he was a graduate student in the 1930s. As a result, Rossi researched Țepeș, the Dracula myth <b>surrounding</b> <b>him,</b> and the mysterious book. Rossi traveled as far as Istanbul; however, the appearance of curious characters and unexplained events caused him to drop his investigation and return to his graduate work. Rossi gives Paul his research notes and informs him that he believes Dracula is still alive.|$|E
5|$|When Tipu's embassy {{visited the}} court of the French King Louis XVI in 1788, Pope Clement XIV's {{representative}} conveyed the appeal to the embassy. In the Third Anglo-Mysore War (1789–92), the British and their allies defeated Tipu. Desperate to break the alliance of powers <b>surrounding</b> <b>him</b> on all sides, Tipu sought {{to make peace with}} Portugal, the Marathas, and other powers. According to Severine Silva, he consequently gave up the persecution of Christians, opened negotiations with the Portuguese Government and with the Archbishop of Goa, with a promise that he would stop molesting the Christians, further asserting that he would rebuild all destroyed churches at his own cost. The Christians found their supervision relaxed and Tipu became more conciliatory in his attitude. The Christians now escaped from the camps of Seringapatam and gradually began to enter the neighbouring kingdoms of Coorg and Malabar.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the bare}} facts of his life, {{little is known}} about Deusdedit. Deusdedit's {{successor}} as Archbishop of Canterbury, Wighard, had been one of his clergy. Deusdedit was regarded as a saint after his death, with a feast day of 14July, although the Bosworth Psalter, a late 10th or early 11th-century psalter produced at , gives a date of 15 July. His feast day is designated as a major feast day, and is included along with those of a number of other early Canterbury archbishops in the Bosworth Psalter. Deusdedit was buried in the church of St Augustine's in Canterbury, but was translated to the new abbey church in 1091. A hagiography, or saint's biography, on Deusdedit was written by Goscelin after the translation of his relics, but the work was based mainly on Bede's account; the manuscript of the De Sancto Deusdedit Archiepiscopo survives as part of British Library manuscript (ms) Cotton Vespasian B.xx. Because of the late date of the Sancto, Bede's Historia is the main source for what {{little is known about}} Deusdedit. Other than the hagiography, there is scant evidence of a cult <b>surrounding</b> <b>him.</b> His shrine survived until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s.|$|E

5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people <b>surrounding</b> <b>him</b> had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E
