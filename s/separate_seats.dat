25|$|The {{attitude}} of rail employees towards an industry-wide union began to {{shift in the}} 1890s {{with the onset of}} the Depression and its effects upon their wages and security of work. In 1903, Premier William Irvine’s government sought to stifle the electoral threat of rail workers’ anger at pay cuts through the passing of the Separate Representation Act. The Act – which barred railways employees from voting in their own seats and instead allotted two <b>separate</b> <b>seats</b> in State Parliament’s lower house for their votes – and the ensuing campaign to repeal it galvanised rail workers’ commitment to unionism and bolstered the ASRE’s ranks. In July 1911, after balloting their members on the question of an industry-wide union and returning a strongly affirmative opinion, the ASRE and all other craft unions in the railways {{with the exception of the}} locomotive association combined to form the Victorian Railways Union. This later became the Victorian branch of the Australian Railways Union when railways unions from each state and territory unified nationally in 1921.|$|E

50|$|Men {{and women}} are {{generally}} not separated in most Conservative synagogues, although it is a permissible option within Conservative Judaism and some Conservative synagogues, particularly in Canada, have one or have <b>separate</b> <b>seating</b> {{for men and women}} without a physical partition. Conservative Judaism takes the position that the Mechitza referred to in Talmud Tractate Sukkah applied only to the festival of Sukkah in the Temple and that its use to separate men and women for synagogue worship and other occasions represents a custom rather than a requirement of core Jewish law, and is subject to contemporary Rabbinic re-examination. Some Conservative synagogues (e.g. in Europe and Israel) also have a meḥitza or <b>separate</b> <b>seating</b> sections for men and women without a physical partition. At one point the synagogue in the Jewish Theological Seminary did so.|$|R
