25|$|Like velcro, {{carbohydrate}} ligands on the circulating leukocytes bind to <b>selectin</b> molecules on {{the inner}} wall of the vessel, with marginal affinity. This causes the leukocytes {{to slow down and}} begin rolling along the inner surface of the vessel wall. During this rolling motion, transitory bonds are formed and broken between selectins and their ligands.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide also {{acts as an}} L-selectin and P-selectin ligand, but it {{does not}} act as an E- <b>selectin</b> ligand. Selectins are {{adhesion}} molecules that facilitate the capture of circulating leukocytes. Sulfatide is also expressed on the surface of many types of cancer cells and tissues. Accordingly, sulfatide may function as a ligand for P-selectin, which facilitates cancer metastasis. Additionally, when L-selectin and sulfatide bind, upregulation of the chemokine co-receptor’s (CXCR4) expression is observed, specifically on the surfaced of leukocytes.|$|E
500|$|To {{reach the}} site of infection, phagocytes leave the {{bloodstream}} and enter the affected tissues. Signals from the infection cause the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels to make a protein called <b>selectin,</b> which neutrophils stick to on passing by. Other signals called vasodilators loosen the junctions connecting endothelial cells, allowing the phagocytes {{to pass through the}} wall. Chemotaxis is the process by which phagocytes follow the cytokine [...] "scent" [...] to the infected spot. Neutrophils travel across epithelial cell-lined organs to sites of infection, and although this is an important component of fighting infection, the migration itself can result in disease-like symptoms. During an infection, millions of neutrophils are recruited from the blood, but they die after a few days.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>selectins</b> (cluster of {{differentiation}} 62 or CD62) are {{a family}} of cell adhesion molecules (or CAMs). All <b>selectins</b> are single-chain transmembrane glycoproteins that share similar properties to C-type lectins due to a related amino terminus and calcium-dependent binding. [...] <b>Selectins</b> bind to sugar moieties and so {{are considered to be}} a type of lectin, cell adhesion proteins that bind sugar polymers.|$|R
40|$|The normal PrPC (cellular prion protein) {{contains}} sLeX [sialyl-LeX (Lewis X) ] and LeX. sLeX is a ligand of <b>selectins.</b> To {{examine whether}} PrPC is a ligand of <b>selectins,</b> we generated three human PrPC–Ig fusion proteins: one with LeX, one with sLeX, {{and the other}} with neither LeX nor sLeX. Only LeX-PrPC–Ig binds E-, L- and P-selectins. Binding is Ca 2 +-dependent and occurs with nanomolar affinity. Removal of sialic acid on sLeX-PrPC–Ig enables the fusion protein to bind all <b>selectins.</b> These findings were confirmed with brain-derived PrPC. The <b>selectins</b> precipitated PrPC in human brain in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner. Treatment of brain homogenates with neuraminidase increased the amounts of PrPC precipitated. Therefore the presence of sialic acid prevents the binding of PrPC in human brain to <b>selectins.</b> Hence, human brain PrPC interacts with <b>selectins</b> {{in a manner that is}} distinct from interactions in peripheral tissues. Alternations in these interactions may have pathological consequences...|$|R
40|$|On human endothelial {{cells from}} {{umbilical}} cord (HUVEC) are present, {{in addition to}} E- and P-selectins, their cognate ligands. Differently from <b>selectins,</b> the ligand expression is constitutive and not modulated by interleukin- 1 beta. Such ligands appear {{to be different from}} the ones present in promyelocytic cells in order to promote cell adhesion to immobilized <b>selectins.</b> The expression of selectin-ligands on HUVEC cells suggest that <b>selectins</b> can participate in endothelial signalling besides their role as adhesion molecules for circulating blood cells. However, despite their role in chemotaxis, <b>selectins</b> do not contribute to HUVEC tube formation in Matrigel...|$|R
5000|$|Similar to <b>selectin</b> binding, FimH binding {{also have}} a {{threshold}} where it only starts binding to the host cells above this threshold. This shear stress threshold is about 1 dynes per squared centimeter, slightly larger than that of <b>selectin</b> binding. Above this threshold, FimH also alternate between binding, pause and unbinding with the mannose residues. However, different from <b>selectin</b> binding, FimH binding to mannose-BSA can either have a very long or very short pauses. This cause FimH binding to exhibit a [...] "stick-and-roll" [...] adhesion, not rolling adhesion {{in the case of}} <b>selectin</b> binding. And unlike <b>selectin</b> binding which requires integrin to help with firm adhesion, FimH binding can become stationary, and this process is reversible. All of this is mediated by shear stress level: at shear stress higher than 20 dynes per squared centimeter, FimH binding is stationary. At shear stress higher than 100 dynes per squared centimeter, slow rolling is observed.|$|E
50|$|Experimental {{research}} has targeted adhesion molecules known as selectins on epithelial cells. These molecules initiate the early capturing and margination of leukocytes from circulation. <b>Selectin</b> antagonists {{have been examined}} in preclinical studies, including cutaneous inflammation, allergy and ischemia-reperfusion injury. There are four classes of <b>selectin</b> blocking agents: (i) carbohydrate based inhibitors targeting all P-, E-, and L-selectins, (ii) antihuman <b>selectin</b> antibodies, (iii) a recombinant truncated form of PSGL-1 immunoglobulin fusion protein, and (iv) small-molecule inhibitors of selectins. Most <b>selectin</b> blockers have failed phase II/III clinical trials, or the studies were ceased due to their unfavorable pharmacokinetics or prohibitive cost. Sphingolipids, present in yeast like Saccharomyces cerevisiae and plants, have also shown mitigative effects in animal models of gene knockout mice.|$|E
5000|$|In blood vessel, at {{very low}} shear stress of ~.3 dynes per squared centimeter, leukocytes do not adhere to the blood vessel endothelial cells. Cells move along the blood vessel at a rate {{proportional}} to the blood flow rate. Once the shear stress pass that shear threshold value, leukocytes start to accumulate via <b>selectin</b> binding. At low shear stress above the threshold of about [...]3 to 5 dynes per squared centimeter, leukocytes alternate between binding and non-binding. Because one leukocyte has many selectins around the surface, these <b>selectin</b> binding/ unbinding cause a rolling motion on the blood vessel. As the shear stress continue to increase, the <b>selectin</b> bonds becomes stronger, causing the rolling velocity to be slower. This reduction in leukocytes rolling velocity allow cells to stop and perform firm binding via integrin binding. <b>Selectin</b> binding do not exhibit [...] "true" [...] catch bond property. Experiments show that at very high shear stress (passing a second threshold), the <b>selectin</b> binding transit between a catch bond to a slip bond binding, in which the rolling velocity increases as the shear force increases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selectins</b> are {{expressed}} shortly after cytokine activation of endothelial cells by tissue macrophages. Activated endothelial cells initially express P-selectin molecules, but {{within two hours}} after activation E-selectin expression is favoured. Endothelial <b>selectins</b> bind carbohydrates on leukocyte transmembrane glycoproteins, including sialyl-LewisX.|$|R
40|$|Borrelia burgdorferi-induced {{arthritis}} in mice {{is characterized}} by tendonitis, synovitis, and inflammatory-cell infiltrate, predominantly of neutrophils. Because genetic deficiency in E and P <b>selectins</b> results in delayed recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation, mice with this deficiency were tested for their response to infection with B. burgdorferi. E and P <b>selectins</b> were not required for the control of B. burgdorferi numbers, nor did deficiency in E and P <b>selectins</b> result in alteration of arthritis severity...|$|R
40|$|During {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} {{inflammatory}} response, leukocytes marginate and roll along the endothelial surface, a process mediated largely by the <b>selectins</b> and their ligands. Mice with mutations in individual <b>selectins</b> show no spontaneous disease and have mild or negligible deficiencies of inflammatory responses. In contrast, we find that mice with null mutations in both endothelial <b>selectins</b> (P and E) develop a phenotype of leukocyte adhesion deficiency characterized by mucocutaneous infections, plasma cell proliferation, hypergammaglobulinemia, severe deficiencies of leukocyte rolling in cremaster venules with or without addition of TNF-alpha, and an absence of neutrophil emigration at 4 h in response to intraperitoneal Streptococcus pneumoniae peritonitis. These mice provide strong evidence for the functional importance of <b>selectins</b> in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Expression of αvβ 3 - or αvβ 5 -integrins and <b>selectins</b> is {{widespread}} on blood cells and endothelial cells. Here {{we report that}} human tumor cells injected s. c. into mice lacking β 3 - or β 3 /β 5 -integrins or various <b>selectins</b> show enhanced tumor growth compared with growth in control mice. There was increased angiogenesis in mice lacking β 3 -integrins, but no difference in structure of the vessels was observed by histology or by staining for NG 2 and smooth muscle actin in pericytes. Bone marrow transplants suggest {{that the absence of}} β 3 -integrins on bone marrow-derived host cells contributes to the enhanced tumor growth in β 3 -null mice, although few, if any, bone marrow-derived endothelial cells were found in the tumor vasculature. Tumor growth also was affected by bone marrow-derived cells in mice lacking any one or all three <b>selectins,</b> implicating both leukocyte and endothelial <b>selectins</b> in tumor suppression. Reduced infiltration of macrophages was observed in tumors grown in mice lacking either β 3 -integrins or <b>selectins.</b> These results implicate cells of the innate immune system, macrophages or perhaps natural killer cells, in each case dependent on integrins and <b>selectins,</b> in tumor suppression...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend our}} {{previous}} analyses of mice deficient in <b>selectins</b> by describing the generation and comparative phenotype of mice lacking one, two, or three <b>selectins</b> after sequential ablation of the murine genes encoding P-, E-, and L-selectins. All mice deficient in <b>selectins</b> are viable and fertile as homozygotes. However, mice missing both P- and E-selectins (PE−/−), and mice missing all three <b>selectins</b> (ELP−/−) develop mucocutaneous infections that {{eventually lead to}} death. Mice deficient in multiple <b>selectins</b> display varying degrees of leukocytosis, resulting in part from alterations in leukocyte rolling and recruitment. PE−/− mice, ELP−/− mice, and mice missing both P- and L-selectins (PL−/−) show drastic reductions in leukocyte rolling and in extravasation of neutrophils in thioglycollate-induced peritonitis. In a separate inflammatory model (ragweed-induced peritoneal eosinophilia), we demonstrate P-selectin to be both necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of eosinophils. The phenotype of mice missing both E- and L-selectins (EL−/−) is less severe than those seen in the other double knockouts. Comparisons among the double knockouts suggest that P-selectin normally cooperates with both E- and L-selectins. Our results indicate a preeminent role for P-selectin in regulating leukocyte behavior in mice. Data from the ELP−/− mice indicate, however, that all three <b>selectins</b> are important to leukocyte homeostasis and efficient neutrophil recruitment...|$|R
50|$|The <b>selectins</b> are {{a family}} of heterophilic CAMs that bind {{fucosylated}} carbohydrates, e.g., mucins. The three family members are E-selectin (endothelial), L-selectin (leukocyte), and P-selectin (platelet).

50|$|In {{leukocyte}} rolling, the ‘open’ conformation of the <b>selectin</b> {{allows it}} to bind to inward sialyl Lewis molecules farther up along the PSGL-1 chain, increasing overall binding affinity—if the selectin-sialyl Lewis bond breaks, it can slide and form new bonds with the other sialyl Lewis molecules down the chain.

40|$|Objective. The two endothelial <b>selectins,</b> P- and E-selectin, are {{critically}} important for adhesion and homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) into the bone marrow.

50|$|<b>Selectins</b> are {{involved}} in projects to treat osteoporosis, a disease that occurs when bone-creating cells called osteoblasts become too scarce. Osteoblasts develop from stem cells, and scientists hope to eventually be able to treat osteoporosis by adding stem cells to a patient’s bone marrow. Researchers have developed {{a way to use}} <b>selectins</b> to direct stem cells introduced into the vascular system to the bone marrow. E-selectins are constitutively expressed in the bone marrow, and researchers have shown that tagging stem cells with a certain glycoprotein causes these cells to migrate to the bone marrow. Thus, <b>selectins</b> may someday be essential to a regenerative therapy for osteoporosis.|$|R
5000|$|Firstly, at {{the site}} of {{infection}} histamine release causes vasodilation of the capillaries near the injured area which slows down the blood flow in the region and encourages leukocytes, such as neutrophils, to come closer to the endothelium, and away from the centre of the lumen where the rate of blood flow is highest. Once this occurs weak interactions are made between the <b>selectins</b> expressed on the neutrophil and endothelial cells (expression of which is also increased through the action of CXCL8 and other cytokines). On the neutrophil these are: L <b>selectins,</b> and on the endothelial cell: P and E <b>selectins.</b> This causes the [...] "rolling" [...] phase of chemotaxis.|$|R

50|$|P-selectin {{is found}} in endothelial cells and {{platelets}} where it is stored in Weibel-Palade bodies and α-granules, respectively. In response to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13, P-selectin is translocated to the plasma membrane in endothelial cells. The extracellular region of P-selectin is composed of three different domains like other <b>selectin</b> types; a C-type lectin-like domain in the N-terminus, an EGF-like domain and a complement-binding protein-like domains (same as complement regulatory proteins: CRP) having short consensus repeats (~60 amino acids). The number of CRP repeats is the major feature differentiating the type of <b>selectin</b> in extracellular region. In human, P-selectin has nine repeats while E-selectin contains six and L-selectin has only two.
