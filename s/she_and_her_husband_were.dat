5|$|Having {{performed}} in parlor theatricals as a child, from 1916 Simonovich-Efimova began staging puppet shows for fellow artists. The plays were so well received that <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> invited {{to create a}} children's puppet theater by the Russian authorities in 1918, becoming two of the first professional puppeteers in Russia. She created innovative designs to make her manikins lifelike, promoting her work by publishing books and teaching puppetry theory and design. She {{and her husband are}} known as the first couple of Russian puppetry, though she was the one determined to elevate the craft. They performed over 1,500 shows throughout Russia between 1920 and 1940, moving from place to place with their traveling puppet theater.|$|E
5|$|Serb forces {{singled out}} a number of {{prominent}} individuals. Among them was Dr. Vesna Bosanac, the director of the town's hospital, who was regarded as a heroine in Croatia but demonised by the Serbian media. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> taken to Sremska Mitrovica prison, where she was locked up in a single room with 66 other women for several weeks. Her husband was subjected to repeated beatings. After appeals from the International Committee of the Red Cross, the couple were eventually released in a prisoner exchange. Croatian Radio journalist Siniša Glavašević, whose broadcasts had become iconic in Croatia, was taken to Ovčara, severely beaten and shot along with the other victims of the massacre.|$|E
5|$|The farm {{became a}} center for the Russian monarchist {{community}} in Denmark and many Russian emigrants visited. Olga maintained {{a high level of}} correspondence with the Russian émigré community and former members of the imperial army.

In the 1930s, the family took annual holidays at Sofiero Castle, Sweden, with Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden and his wife, Louise. Olga began to sell her own paintings, of Russian and Danish scenes, with exhibition auctions in Copenhagen, London, Paris, and Berlin.

5|$|Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; {{this caused}} her {{popularity}} in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government {{took an interest in}} her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.|$|E

25|$|In July 1936, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> {{visited by}} the Gestapo, who {{threatened}} her with arrest and deportation to a Nazi concentration camp; they resolved {{to commit suicide}} if such a prospect became inevitable.

25|$|Gainsborough {{had painted}} (probably in London) Frances's parents in his Mr and Mrs Carter of Bullingdon House, Bulmer, Essex in about 1747–1748 (now Tate Britain). This {{painting}} makes an interesting comparison {{with that of}} the Andrews in many respects. Frances Jamineau, who became Mrs Carter, was of French parentage, and whether <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> really as disproportionate in size as Gainsborough paints them is unknown.|$|E

25|$|Sometime in the 1560s, her {{relationship}} with her former guardian may have cooled when Giulia insisted that she be treated as an equal to Cosimo I's mistress, who was regarded with general disdain at court. Other sources indicate that <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> still in good standing with the court when they moved to Naples in 1567. There they battled successfully to win the title and lands to the principality of Ottaiano, which their descendants hold today.|$|E

25|$|The {{annulment}} from Ruskin barred {{her from}} events at which Queen Victoria was present. Both <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> considerably bothered, {{as she had}} been socially very active, although many in society were still prepared to receive her and to press her case sympathetically. Eventually, when Millais was dying, the Queen relented through the intervention of her daughter Princess Louise, allowing Gray to attend an official function. Sixteen months after Millais' death, Effie died at Bowerswell on 23 December 1897 and was buried in Kinnoull churchyard, Perth, which is depicted in Millais's painting The Vale of Rest.|$|E

As the wife of Sir William Kingston, Constable of the Tower of London, she was in {{attendance}} on Anne Boleyn during the Queen's brief imprisonment in the Tower in May 1536, and both <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> among those who walked with the Queen to the scaffold. By her first husband, Edward Jerningham, she was the mother of Sir Henry Jerningham, whose support helped to place Queen Mary I on the throne of England in 1553, and who became one of Queen Mary's most favoured courtiers.|$|E

She doubted her abilities, but [...] "it was Butter that first encouraged me to let loose and just sing the blues [...] {{not to worry about}} singing pretty or hitting all the right notes... He loosened all the levels of self-consciousness and doubt out of me... And he'll forever live in my heart for that and for respecting me as a fellow musician." ...|$|E
