50|$|The {{braking system}} was also typical; the front brakes were disc brakes, using a solid iron disc and a single-piston sliding caliper. The rears were drum brakes (a {{technological}} backwards step from the 124, which used discs all round), utilising leading and trailing shoe design {{operated by a}} dual piston fixed slave cylinder. They were operated hydraulically, with a tandem master cylinder assisted by a vacuum servo using two separate circuits. A rear-mounted load <b>sensing</b> <b>valve</b> varied the bias of effort applied to the rear brakes, dependent on the load being carried (and also the pitch dynamics caused by braking effort and road levels). A centrally located floor mounted handbrake operated on the rear axle using bowden cables.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{increase}} in power brought by the new engine, the rest of the driveline was upgraded to be able to withstand the extra torque. The gearbox and differential were replaced by a version of those fitted to the TR and 2000 series cars, albeit with a close ratio gearset in the gearbox. The brakes were upgraded with new pad materials at the front, and the fitment of larger drums and a load <b>sensing</b> <b>valve</b> at the rear. Other changes over the standard Dolomite included the option of a limited slip differential. The optional overdrive and automatic transmission from the 1850 model were also offered as options on the Sprint. Initial models were only offered in [...] "Mimosa Yellow", although further colours were available from 1974 on.|$|E
50|$|The 2WD models {{feature the}} new Electronic Braking Force Distribution (EBD) system that uses {{electronic}} control to optimally distribute braking {{force to the}} front and rear wheels according to changes in the payload (number of passengers) being carried. This system works in tandem with the Braking Assist system (a brake booster with a two-stage mechanical assist mechanism plus ABS) to achieve synergies between effective utilization of front and rear braking force (EBD) and reduced pedal pressure (Braking Assist). As a result, more powerful braking performance is obtained with less pedal pressure in emergency braking situations even when carrying a large payload. The 4WD models also provide the nearly same high level of braking performance by adopting a load <b>sensing</b> <b>valve</b> (LSV) as a mechanical braking force distribution system in a set with the Braking Assist system.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{heavier duty}} drum brake systems {{compensate}} for load when determining wheel cylinder pressure; a feature rare when discs are employed (Hydropneumatic suspension systems as employed on Citroën vehicles adjust brake pressure depending on load regardless of if drum or discs are used).

This situation can be called extra-curial punishment given the 'extra-judicial' nature of the sanction. Studies in this area are sorely needed because of the continuing complexity and ambiguity surrounding both the definitional parameters of extra-curial punishment, and the way courts have applied these rules in a flexible, and sometimes improvised, fashion. It is this fluidity that has been criticised as being the cause for the lack of certainty and precision in the relevant law.

5000|$|There {{were two}} {{different}} types of high performance brake systems on offer for the C4 S4. [...] All S4s' initially had 310 mm diameter by 25 mm thick, radially ventilated disc brakes up front, each with an ATE single-piston sliding caliper inside a 'UFO' styled bell-shaped disc. With the introduction of the V8 engine, a new front brake setup became standard; again the discs used radial ventilation, but these front discs were now sized at 314 mm by 30 mm - with a conventionally mounted Lucas-Girling caliper in an external position over the disc. US models had smaller 276 mm discs. The rear brakes, 269 mm by 20 mm and also radially ventilated - remained the same throughout C4 production; they used a Lucas-Girling single-piston sliding caliper with an integrated cable-actuated handbrake mechanism. A Bosch three-channel operation (four-channel sensing) Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with a mechanical load <b>sensing</b> <b>valve</b> for the rear brakes was standard throughout production.|$|E
40|$|A {{variable}} displacement axial piston pump with Pressure compensator and Load Sensing control is coupled to a diesel engine. The pump {{is in an}} open circuit topology for load control in a typical excavator, skid-steer or front loader circuit. The active torque generated by the engine is subject to overloads, due to uncontrolled priority and sum of torque requests from hydrostatic transmission, implements and upper-structure control. In order to avoid engine overload a third 2 ways proportional valve {{is added to the}} control circuit. The valve controls the delivery pressure on the load <b>sensing</b> <b>valve</b> port, and the pressure is managed by an electronic system. This circuit architecture allow the designer to use the valve as a variable load sensing system, modifying the load sensing differential pressure depending on working conditions. The control must be in real time and a feed forward control based on the valve characteristic map is useful and helpful but a feedback control is needed to correct the steady state error; a PID and a Sliding mode are superimposed, in order to react to high dynamic transient. The controls runs properly on the bench and the advantages are: more engine efficiency and continuously working capacity, adapting load sensing pressure a more efficient use of power is possible...|$|E

5000|$|As the {{pneumatic}} operation of valves, compared to motorised operation, has cost and reliability advantages, pneumatic actuation {{is still an}} industry standard. To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4-20 mA is generated by the controller, but {{enables the use of}} pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (I to P) converters are available from manufacturers. These are usually located locally to the control valve and convert 4-20 mA to 3-15 psi (or (0.2 - 1.0 bar).This signal is then fed to the valve actuator or more commonly, a pneumatic positioner. This is a dedicated controller with a pneumatic nozzle and flapper arrangement and a mechanical linkage to <b>sense</b> the <b>valve</b> actuator movement. This ensures that problems of friction are overcome and the valve control element moves to the desired position, by comparing the actual valve regulating element position against the desired value; hence the name [...] "positioner". As a mechanical linkage is used for this, the positioner has to be mounted on the valve body. A positioner also allows the use of higher air pressures for valve actuation, which is particularly useful with cylinder type valve actuators.|$|R

40|$|Every {{sub-component}} of {{a diesel}} injector must perform optimally to ensure maximum fuel economy and minimum particulate and carbon-dioxide emissions. Continually developing emissions standards will drive manufacturers to guarantee fuel system performance {{for a significant}} period of the unit lifetime. Key to implementing such systems will be the ability to compensate for unit changes in use. This thesis investigates possibilities for developing existing unit and sub-component characterization techniques to enable robust performance over an extended duration. An overview of existing injector characterization techniques is given, along with possibilities for enhancement of the existing {{state of the art}} through development of measurement systems widely used within the industry. Particular attention is paid to developing methods to allow testing of injectors and sub-components under representative conditions, where system pressures of 3000 bar are commonplace. Consideration is given to the benefits of moving from existing methods, based on steady-state testing, towards dynamic transfer function testing, and methods reliant on real-time sub-system feedback, to enable better characterization of the unit in use. Key to the development of enhanced characterization will be feedback from the electrohydraulic valves operating inside the injector. These valves are critical to current heavyduty injector designs. To enable full understanding of the unit’s operation, the thesis develops mathematical representations of such component’s functionality. Software models of these systems are offered, and various model simulations discussed. Possibilities for refining these are also provided. Within this thesis the available mechanisms for taking valve position feedback measurements capable of detecting valve lifts of < 30 μm with suitable resolution and accuracy are discussed. The results of experiments with various sensing devices are then presented. Subsequently, novel methods for taking measurements using the unit stator as a sensing element are developed, described in terms of mathematical models, and tested in software simulations. <b>Sensing</b> experiments using <b>valve</b> hardware are then described.

40|$|Precise {{control of}} fluid flow becomes {{increasingly}} challenging as systems and instruments are scaled down. Smaller dimensions allow smaller flow ranges, but also leave smaller margins for error in performance. Reliable and effective fabrication and assembly procedures are therefore a primary requirement for any microfluidic system, {{if it is}} to be successful in real-world applications. This thesis describes the achievements made in ongoing efforts to create miniaturized, proportional control valves for minute gas flows. In this research we focus on MEMS-based fabrication processes, as they allow high precision manufacturing of miniature devices with high paralellism. This enables higher fabrication yields, improved reliability and increased integration. We present four valve designs that can be divided into two main categories, being either based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology or based on surface channel technology (SCT). The first group focuses on obtaining a proportional flow controller using simple, straight-forward fabrication processes with a small number of process steps, for use in an ambulant blood pressure waveform (BPW) measurement system. Two single-wafer valve designs are presented, both offering built-in capacitive <b>sensing</b> of the <b>valve</b> displacement which can be used to correct for actuator hysteresis and improve control precision. Nitrogen gas flows up to 13 g h− 1 at a pressure of 500 mbar are demonstrated in good agreement with analytical and numerical models, with leakage below 0. 1 mgh− 1 at 1 bar. Maximum throughput is estimated at 25 g h− 1 at 1 bar. A fully functional control valve assembly is demonstrated with integration of a miniaturized piezoelectric bimorph actuator. Time-dynamic characterization demonstrates that the control valve is suitable for high-speed flow control, with a mechanical bandwidth of 8 kHz and a frequency-independent response up to 3 kHz. The second group demonstrates two proportional control valve designs in an already existing (SCT) fabrication process, to allow integration with existing components such as flow sensors. The first valve design allows flow control from a chip inlet or outlet to a fluidic channel embedded in the silicon surface, with a flow range of > 1250 mgh- 1 at 600 mbar and a leak flow below 0. 05 mgh- 1 at 1 bar. The second valve design supports smaller flows (> 70 mgh- 1 at 200 mbar), but allows fully on-chip flow control between any two surface channels. A good fit is obtained between the measured flow profiles and analytical flow models of both valves. The valve designs aimed at the BPW monitoring system are shown to be very well suited for the aimed application, although a smaller bimorph piezo may be required to meet the demanded physical dimensions. The combination of capacitive displacement sensing with bimorph piezoelectric actuation allows for high-speed, high-precision flow control with low power usage. The SCTbased microvalves demonstrate proportional, on-chip flow control, suitable for integration with existing flow sensors. Their designs are tailored to match an existing high-resolution mass flow sensor which has a limited flow range, but the designs of both the valves and the sensor can be scaled up to increase the range...|$|R
40|$|Driven by {{miniaturization}} and {{the continuing}} increase in clock speed and data transfer, power dissipation in many electronic components has exceeded the limits of conventional cooling methodologies, such as fan-blown air cooling. Given the expected increase in power density, microprocessor designers have identified cooling {{as one of the}} major challenges for the next decade. Similar needs arise from the further development of other electronic devices such as Light Emitting Diodes (LED), where future generations of high light-output multichip LED modules are being developed for general and automotive illumination applications as well as for power electronics. Hence, there is a tremendous need for innovative cooling technologies. One of the most important factors in reducing the lifetime of micro-electronic components is the high operation temperature and thermal cycling. Liquid cooling has been identified {{as one of the most}} promising solutions in reducing the operation temperature of high power electronics. Liquid cooling is often not optimized, leading to excess of cooling and large temperature variations over the IC. If the coolant is allowed to boil in the cooling channels, the heat transfer coefficient is increased with one order of magnitude. The problem of phase transition regime is the boiling instability. A solution of these problems is addressed by implementation of valves in the cooling system. For single-phase systems they have the role of maintaining a more uniform temperature over the IC and to reduce the pumping power. For two-phase systems the valve purpose is to maintain the most optimum boiling conditions. A comparative study of different actuation principles was performed to identify the best actuation technology applied for chip cooling valves which meet the cooling requirements targeted in this PhD project. This classifies the valve size between the micro and macro-scale, a field which has been mainly overlooked by prior research and potentially promising applications have not been yet explored. It is for the first time that valves are especially designed for chip cooling applications. The principal requirements for the mechanical valves are the following: no leakage to the environment, low power consumption, continuous and proportional flow control, low cost, fast response time, small size and high reliability. The most promising actuation technology found for single-phase flow is thermopneumatic actuation. Based on this principle, a valve has been designed manufactured and tested on a cooling system. The valve actuation is performed by the thermal expansion of a liquid (actuation fluid) which, at the same time, actuates the valve and provides feed-back <b>sensing.</b> The thermopneumatic <b>valve</b> shows a novel actuation principle that combines the advantages of zero power consumption, small size compared with the high flow rate, and low manufacturing costs. This valve has the major advantage that it can be used together with any heat sink used for microelectronic cooling. Its small size and its independence from external energy make it suited for portable devices. No electrical connection, no wires and no electronic control are needed, increasing its simplicity and reliability. A maximum flow rate of 38 kg/h passes through the valve for a heat load up to 133 W. The valve is able to reduce the pumping power by up to 60 % and has the capability to reduce the temperature variation over the IC with up to 24 %. The most suitable actuation principle found for two-phase cooling is electro- magnetic actuation for large bandwidth, large forces, relatively high strokes and low manufacturing cost. The electromagnetic valve uses the reluctance actuation principle. It makes use of a pilot valve to reduce the size and the required actuation force. The emphasis is placed on a compact planar design to fit in planar devices. A pressure balance design allows operation at high system pressures. Because the pressure balance is used to drive the valve, an analytical and numerical model has been developed to predict the pressure distribution over the valve. The pilot valve has also been modelled as well and linearised using the results obtained from the model. The results of the model have been successfully validated by measurements. The valve is capable to control a flow rate up to 15 kg/h. This flow rate is sufficient to remove a heat input of 133 W equivalent with a heat flux of 500 W/cm 2 at a temperature difference of 20 deg. C. Its equilibrated design allows a pressure drop control of up to 100 kPa at maximum system pressures of 600 kPa. Compared with the latest research published in literature and the latest developments in industry, this electromagnetic valve classifies on top of the list when it comes to the following combined properties in a single package: high speed proportional control, compact dimensions, high flow rates at low pressure drop, high reliability and low manufacturing cost. This research demonstrates the need for valves and the benefits of using valves in high performance cooling systems.
