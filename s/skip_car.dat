40|$|Wear is {{becoming}} increasingly important in industrial applications,in particular due to its environmental impact through {{the reduction of the}} service life of machinery. Extremely heavy wear takes place in construction and mining,where large amounts of rocks and soil are processed. The <b>skip</b> <b>car</b> in blast furnace of RSP is used to transfer and charge raw materials such as coke,iron ore,sinter and additives like limes stone dolomites into the furnace. This <b>Skip</b> <b>Car</b> has to withstand heavy wear caused by loading and unloading of those raw materials onto the Car body,which subjects it to impact-abrasion wear caused by impacts and scratching by the minerals. Wear-resistant steels are often used as a material for this kind of machinery since it has better durability than mild steels and thus provides longer service life. At present mild steel is used as <b>skip</b> <b>car</b> liner plates in BF stock house of RSP. Its service life is found to be around 2 months. Under such circumstances a selection of high wear resistance steel is essential for better wear resistant and higher life for the <b>skip</b> <b>car.</b> Wear-resistant steels are often used as a material for this kind of machinery since it has better durability than mild steels and thus provides longer service life. Literature reveals that there are further developments in improving the wear properties of steel by using carbide coatings on base metals. Because of its immense popularity and versatility for severe abrasion applications,carbide coated products are being used in industries. Keeping this in view,the objective of this work is to investigate the performance of chromium carbide Overlay Plate to improve the service life of <b>skip</b> <b>car.</b> Experiments have been carried out(Solid particle erosion test,three body abrasion) on the developed coatings in the laboratory conditions to assess the suitability of the material for actual operations in the steel plant. Plant trials have been carried out and the results achieved are discussed in the thesis...|$|E

40|$|SPA] El tema central de la Tesis ha versado sobre el diseño y evaluación de aplicaciones para la reducción de la probabilidad de colisión en carretera mediante el uso de conectividad inalámbrica entre vehículos, particularmente en un escenario específico del tráfico rodado: presencia de un obstáculo en la dirección de tránsito que bloquea el paso. Dos enfoques han sido tomados en consideración: utilización de mecanismos de anticipación cooperativa vehículo a vehículo para evadir colisiones mediante frenada, y empleo de esquemas de maniobras de evasión cooperativa en circunstancias donde existe suficiente espacio en la carretera para reorientar las trayectorias y evitar el choque. Se ha hecho uso de herramientas de simulación de redes y dinámica vehicular, y de la teoría matemática de la optimización y de los procesos estocásticos para modelar estos escenarios. Los resultados demuestran que el uso de comunicaciones, junto con sistemas avanzados de inteligencia {{artificial}} permitirá en un futuro garantizar cotas de seguridad en carretera nunca antes vistas, incluso en situaciones de riesgo extremo que podrían ser detectadas por uno o más vehículos con tiempos muy cortos de reacción. [ENG] New emerging {{technologies in}} vehicular traffic are aimed primarily at improving safety and driving comfort for passengers, by paying {{special attention to}} the gradual evermore automation of all aspects of the driving task. In this regard, a promising research perspective considered by the Academia and the Industry is to use communications to build a complex interoperable vehicular network that would serve as a means to provide autonomous robotic-guided vehicles with additional status information that might not be collected from sensors on board. With properly configured processing schemes, this additional stream of information can be used to help vehicles anticipate and react conveniently to potentially risky situations that might cause an accident if not previously considered. Particularly, in this Thesis we use these premises to propose and evaluate collision avoidance policies under two specific fashions: i) Design and evaluation of a Cooperative chain Collision Avoidance (CcCA) 1 strategy to reduce the impact of multiple rear-end collisions in a platoon of vehicles when evasive maneuvering is not possible, and ii) Analysis and optimization of different strategies for Cooperative Collision Avoidance (CCA) by evasive maneuvering. The CcCA application allows us to study how communication protocols, both by one-hop transmissions as well as by relaying (multi-hop) schemes, can help reduce the number of accidents, or at least minimize their impact, in cases where vehicles cannot execute sudden maneuvers to <b>skip</b> <b>cars</b> ahead, but only brake. Simulations are validated by using an advanced stochastic model which rigorously describes the behavior of vehicles in this type of situations. Among other aspects, results show that real implementations of CcCA must take into account with special relevance those vehicles that might be humanly driven, and guarantee that during the transition stage (until a complete penetration of the technology is achieved) safety is preserved enough. Regarding CCA for evasive maneuvering, we provide an exhaustive optimization analysis for the calculation of optimum trajectories in cases where vehicles at high speeds are at risk of colliding with one or more obstacles appearing ahead. By reorienting trajectories through the lateral free spaces that might exist between the obstacles and the crash barriers (if the specific scenario allows it), vehicles can avoid crashing and simultaneously improve driving comfort even under such unpredictable circumstances. On the whole, despite much further effort is still required on these matters, results in this Work show that communications can help autonomous vehicles to make decisions in a cooperative fashion that will not only assist individuals to follow the best riding strategy, but also the traffic system as a whole to evolve according to the best possible behavior in terms of safety and comfort.

6000|$|... though I'd {{no thought}} of giving out: oh, bless you, no! When the engine screeched [...] "Here we are," [...] I {{clutched}} my escort in a fervent embrace, and <b>skipped</b> into the <b>car</b> with as blithe a farewell as if {{going on a}} bridal tour--though I believe brides don't usually wear cavernous black bonnets and fuzzy brown coats, with a hair-brush, a pair of rubbers, two books, {{and a bag of}} ginger-bread distorting the pockets of the same. If I thought that any one would believe it, I'd boldly state that I slept from C. to B., which would simplify matters immensely; but as I know they wouldn't, I'll confess that the head under the funereal coal-hod fermented with all manner of high thoughts and heroic purposes [...] "to do or die,"--perhaps both; and the heart under the fuzzy brown coat felt very tender with the memory of the dear old lady, probably sobbing over her army socks and the loss of her topsy-turvy Trib. At this juncture I took the veil, and what I did behind it is nobody's business; but I maintain that the soldier who cries when his mother says [...] "Good bye," [...] is the boy to fight best, and die bravest, when the time comes, or go back to her better than he went.|$|R
6000|$|I {{belong in}} Cleveland, Ohio. One winter's night, two years ago, I reached home just after dark, in a driving snow-storm, {{and the first}} thing I heard when I entered the house was that my dearest boyhood friend and schoolmate, John B. Hackett, had died the day before, and that his last {{utterance}} had been a desire that I would take his remains home to his poor old father and mother in Wisconsin. I was greatly shocked and grieved, but {{there was no time to}} waste in emotions; I must start at once. I took the card, marked [...] "Deacon Levi Hackett, Bethlehem, Wisconsin," [...] and hurried off through the whistling storm to the railway station. Arrived there I found the long white-pine box which had been described to me; I fastened the card to it with some tacks, saw it put safely aboard the express car, and then ran into the eating-room to provide myself with a sandwich and some cigars. When I returned, presently, there was my coffin-box back again, apparently, and a young fellow examining around it, with a card in his hands, and some tacks and a hammer! I was astonished and puzzled. He began to nail on his card, and I rushed out to the express car, in a good deal of a state of mind, to ask for an explanation. But no--there was my box, all right, in the express car; it hadn't been disturbed. [The fact is that without my suspecting it a prodigious mistake had been made. I was carrying off a box of guns which that young fellow had come to the station to ship to a rifle company in Peoria, Illinois, and he had got my corpse!] Just then the conductor sung out [...] "All aboard," [...] and I jumped into the express car and got a comfortable seat on a bale of buckets. The expressman was there, hard at work,--a plain man of fifty, with a simple, honest, good-natured face, and a breezy, practical heartiness in his general style. As the train moved off a stranger <b>skipped</b> into the <b>car</b> and set a package of peculiarly mature and capable Limburger cheese on one end of my coffin-box--I mean my box of guns. That is to say, I know now that it was Limburger cheese, but at that time I never had heard of the article in my life, and of course was wholly ignorant of its character. Well, we sped through the wild night, the bitter storm raged on, a cheerless misery stole over me, my heart went down, down, down! The old expressman made a brisk remark or two about the tempest and the arctic weather, slammed his sliding doors to, and bolted them, closed his window down tight, and then went bustling around, here and there and yonder, setting things to rights, and all the time contentedly humming [...] "Sweet By and By," [...] in a low tone, and flatting a good deal. Presently I began to detect a most evil and searching odor stealing about on the frozen air. This depressed my spirits still more, because of course I attributed it to my poor departed friend. There was something infinitely saddening about his calling himself to my remembrance in this dumb pathetic way, so it was hard to keep the tears back. Moreover, it distressed me on account of the old expressman, who, I was afraid, might notice it. However, he went humming tranquilly on, and gave no sign; and for this I was grateful. Grateful, yes, but still uneasy; and soon I began to feel more and more uneasy every minute, for every minute that went by that odor thickened up the more, and got to be more and more gamey and hard to stand. Presently, having got things arranged to his satisfaction, the expressman got some wood and made up a tremendous fire in his stove.|$|R
