40|$|About {{half the}} land in NSW (some 40 million hectares) is Crown (Government or Public) land. Within these lands, there are large areas {{suitable}} {{for the construction of}} alternative and sustainable “green ” electricity generating projects. Currently these lands are either set aside for public purposes or privately occupied under a lease or licence tenure, many of which are Perpetual Leasehold providing exclusive possession of the land during the currency of the lease.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of dental microwear {{is commonly used}} by paleontologists and anthropologists to clarify the diets of extinct species, including herbivorous and carnivorous mammals. Currently, there are numerous methods employed to quantify dental microwear, varying {{in the types of}} microscopes used, magnifications, and the characterization of wear in both two dimensions and three dimensions. Results from dental microwear studies utilizing different methods are not directly comparable and human quantification of wear features (e. g., pits and scratches) introduces interobserver error, with higher error being produced by less experienced individuals. Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA), which analyzes microwear features in three dimensions, alleviates some of the problems surrounding two-dimensional microwear methods by reducing observer bias. Here, we assess the accuracy and comparability within and between 2 D and 3 D dental microwear analyses in herbivorous and carnivorous mammals at the same magnification. Specifically, we compare observer-generated 2 D microwear data from photosimulations of the identical scanned areas of DMTA in extant African bovids and carnivorans using a scanning white light confocal microscope at 100 x magnification. Using this magnification, dental microwear features quantified in 2 D were able to <b>separate</b> <b>grazing</b> and frugivorous bovids using scratch frequency; however, DMTA variables were better able to discriminate between disparate dietary niches in both carnivorous and herbivorous mammals.

Experimental plots were prepared with clover : grass ratios of 40 : 60 (Low), 60 : 40 (Medium) and 80 : 20 (High). Two <b>separate</b> <b>grazing</b> trials were then conducted with these plots at two different sward heights, 20 cm (Tall) and 10 cm (Short). Sward composition and herbage biomass were determined for each plot using quadrat cuts, and the sward surface of each plot was characterised using a vertical point quadrat. Diet samples were collected using five animals of each species fistulated at the oesophagus. The sheep diet contained significantly more clover than the guanaco diet when the animals grazed the Medium plot of the Tall trial (31 % versus 10 %, P < 0. 05) and the Low plot of the Short trial (56 % versus 25 %, P < 0. 05).

Two hypotheses were tested in this experiment that ewes bred for worm resistance would have lower faecal worm egg counts than unselected control ewes, during late pregnancy and lactation, under similar but <b>separate</b> <b>grazing</b> areas; and also that numbers of infective nematode larvae would be lower on pastures grazed by resistant ewes than pastures grazed by unselected control ewes. Faecal samples were collected from resistant and unselected ewes in late pregnancy and early lactation, during the winter rainfall season, and analysed for numbers of Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Teladorsagia circumcincta. Pasture samples were taken 1 week before and 7 weeks after lambing started and analysed for infective larvae. In all sheep, worm egg counts rose 2 weeks prior to lambing and continued into lactation. Worm egg counts were significantly lower in the resistant ewes from 1 week before lambing to 2 weeks after lambing. There were no differences in egg counts between single- and twin-bearing ewes in the resistant line. However, twin-bearing control ewes had significantly higher egg counts than single-bearing control ewes. Following lactation, plots grazed by resistant ewes had substantially less contamination with T. colubriformis larvae, but there were no differences in numbers of T. circumcincta larvae. Our results demonstrate that sheep bred for worm resistance has lower worm burdens during the peri-parturient phase and that lambs born to resistant ewes face a lower larval challenge during their introduction to grazing. In our environment, selection for low worm egg counts has produced sheep highly resistant to T. colubriformis, but has had less impact on resistance towards T. circumcincta...|$|E

40|$|A dynamic reference-cover {{method and}} remotely-sensed ground cover {{were used to}} {{determine}} the change in the state of ~ 640 000 km(2) of rangelands in Queensland at a sub-bioregional scale between 1988 and 2005. The method is based on persistence of ground cover in years of lower rainfall and objectively <b>separates</b> <b>grazing</b> effects on ground cover from those due to inter-annual variation in rainfall. The method is applied only to areas where trees and shrubs were not cleared. An indicator of rangeland state was derived, at Landsat-TM pixel resolution, by subtracting automatically-calculated reference ground cover from actual ground cover and then spatially averaging these deviations across the area of each sub-bioregion. Landscape heterogeneity may affect reference cover but, because it is stable over time, change in mean cover deficit between sequences of dry years reliably indicates change due to grazing. All 34 sub-regions analysed had similar or increased levels of seasonally-adjusted ground cover {{at the end of the}} analysis period, which was either 2003 or 2005. Allowing for possible landscape heterogeneity effects on assessed condition, the Einasleigh Uplands bioregion was comparatively in a better state and those analysed parts of the Mulga Lands bioregion in poorer state at the first assessment in 1988. Most sub-regions of the Cape York Peninsula, Brigalow Belt North, Desert Uplands, Gulf Plains and Mitchell Grass Downs bioregions lay between these two end-states. Simulated levels of pasture utilisation based on modelled pasture growth and statistically-based grazing pressure supported the results of this regional assessment of land condition. The dynamic reference-cover method will allow the Queensland Government to monitor future grazing effects on rangeland ground cover between sequences of drier years - quantitatively and efficiently across the entire state. The method can potentially be adapted to other rangeland jurisdictions where a suitable multi-temporal database of remotely sensed ground cover exists. The results from further analyses of remotely sensed ground cover will be reported through the Australian Collaborative Rangelands Information System...|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal (GI) {{parasite}} {{infections are}} of major concern for productivity {{and health of}} first-season grazing (FSG) cattle in Sweden. Both GI nematodes and the coccidium Eimeria alabamensis overwinter on the pasture, which has major epidemiological implications. Clinical infections are seen as diarrhoea, anorexia and weight loss, while sub-clinical infections induce weight gain penalties that are easily overlooked. This thesis is based on grazing experiments {{that focus on the}} control of pasture-borne GI parasites in FSG cattle in Sweden, and the consequences of various levels of infection during their second grazing season (SSG cattle). For 3 consecutive years, FSG cattle were allocated to 4 groups with 10 animals in each, and subjected to either 1) rotational grazing with a 2 -paddock system, 2) nutritional supplementation in early season, 3) no treatment (minimum parasite control) and 4) regular treatment with anthelmintics (maximum parasite control). During the first grazing season, animal performance and parasitology were recorded, and pasture infectivity was investigated through tracer animals and pasture larval counts. The same 40 animals were monitored on communal pasturelands during their second grazing season. In addition, the effects of artificial single or concurrent infections with E. alabamensis and GI nematodes were assessed in a <b>separate</b> <b>grazing</b> experiment. Rotational grazing for FSG cattle was successful, and the same aftermath paddock proved parasitologically safe by mid-July for consecutive years. In contrast, severe diarrhoea and weight loss were seen in supplementary-fed and untreated FSG cattle, which may be explained by significant numbers of overwintered GI nematode larvae and E. alabamensis oocysts in the paddocks at spring turn-out. In the study with SSG on communal pasturelands, the weight gain penalties induced in the first grazing season largely remained {{at the end of the}} second grazing season in 2 out of 3 years. In addition, the importance of lungworm infections was demonstrated in previously unexposed SSG cattle.

40|$|Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) have a {{significant}} role in regulating the ecosystem services they provide on rangelands. Colonization of dung piles by dung beetles can help facilitate the decomposition of dung, control dung-breeding pests, and cycle important nutrients into the soil to improve pasture quality. Cattle are grazed on pastures at various stocking densities {{depending on the type of}} grazing practice. The influence of grazing practices on dung beetle communities and services remains largely unknown. Our first study investigated dung beetle activity across different cattle grazing practices to determine how grazing might influence dung beetle abundance and diversity. Dung beetle populations were monitored throughout the grazing season on pastures that were grazed under various practices: non-grazed/hay, continuous grazing, low-stocking rotational grazing, and high-stocking (mob) rotational grazing. Results from this study showed significantly higher dung beetle diversity on pastures exposed to rotational grazing practices compared to continuous grazing or no grazing. In some cases, dung beetle abundance and species richness were significantly greater on pastures that were grazed through high-stocking rotational grazing compared to low-stocking rotational or continuous grazing treatments. Based on these data, rotational cattle grazing may favor the colonization of dung beetles on rangeland, regardless of stocking density. Our second study investigated whether dung beetles exhibit preferences for dung from cattle exposed to different grazing practices. Dung from cattle in three <b>separate</b> <b>grazing</b> practices were used to test dung beetle preference: continuous grazing, low-stocking rotational grazing, and high-stocking rotational grazing. Dung beetle abundance was measured as well as the nutrient and physical properties of each dung type. Results of the study revealed no significant differences in dung beetle abundance between dung collected from each grazing practice. Nutritional content, pH, moisture, and dry matter levels also were not significantly different. However, the results indicated varying dung beetle species composition on dung from the continuous versus rotational grazing practices. Overall, cattle grazing practices may not affect dung composition or its influence on dung beetle preferences. Advisors: Jeffrey Bradshaw and Thomas Weisslin...|$|E

The heifers grazed for an average of 81 days (70 to 93) and steers for an average of 86 days (75 to 99) from April to July. Stocking rate was one animal per 2 acres. The cattle were sorted by starting weight into groups as follows: below 399 lb, 400 to 499 lb, 500 to 599 lb, 600 to 699 lb, and above 700 lb. In three other trials, 613 yearling heifers were sorted by starting weight, as shown above, and assigned a body condition score from 1 (thinnest to 5 (fattest). A <b>separate</b> <b>grazing</b> trial was conducted in which 158 yearling steers were compared to 103 steer calves. The yearlings were spring born and wintered on wheat pasture; the calves were fall born. Lightweight heifers had the greatest daily gain. Heifers between 400 and 499 lb gained considerably more (P<. 08) than heifers that weighed more than 600 lb. The steers with starting weights between 400 to 499 lb and 500 to 599 lb gained substantially more (P<. 01) than other weight groups. Steers gained faster than heifers (2. 29 lb vs 1. 90 lb/day, P<. 01). As heifers became fleshier, gain declined in all weight groups. Fall-born steer calves (444 lb) gained slower (2. 45 vs 2. 68 lb per day, P<. 01) than spring-born yearling steers (587 lb). Based on these data, the optimum starting weight for stocker cattle is between 400 and 499 lb for heifers and between 400 and 599 lb for steers. Yearling steers gained better than calves. In conclusion, sex, age, and starting weight of cattle affect their gains while grazing burned, native grass pastures. The optimum weight for best pasture gain may vary by forage type and quality, but clearly there is an ideal weight range for stocker cattle used for grazing...|$|E

There was a significant fence × year interaction for grass cover in the Allium type (but not the Achnatherum type), due to greater cover of grasses inside the fence only when rainfall was sufficient during the growing season. The effect of grazing exclusion on perennial forb cover was confounded by a significant fence × year interaction in both types. In 2007, perennial forbs were found outside the fence, but had almost disappeared inside the fence, resulting in this interaction. Annual forbs only had much greater cover values inside the fence than outside in 2006, also resulting in a significant fence × year interaction in both community types.

Two range sites were studied: Site 1, a light soil type, was dominated by annual grasses, legumes and forbs, whereas perennial grasses (mainly Chloris acieularis and Chloris truncata) dominated the heavy soils of Site 2. Although designed to determine carrying capacity of these sites grazed at 2. 5, 3. 7 and 4. 9 sheep per hectare, botanical data (plant cover by species, and density, diameter and basal area of Chlorisgrasses) collected during a seven year (1967 to 1974) grazing trial provided botanical inputs for Experiment 1 which was designed to: (1) determine range condition in 1967 and 1974 using two methods (Quantitative Climax Method - Method 1, and Christie 2 ̆ 7 s Method - Method 2); (2) determine if range condition and sheep production are positively correlated; (3) distinguish the roles of grazing and climate in community change; and (4) determine the value of demographic parameters in defining processes of community change. For Objective 1, the efficacy of Method 1 was hindered by inadequate reference areas, climate-induced variability in plant cover, and uncertainty in classifying perennial grasses as 2 ̆ 2 increasers 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 invaders 2 ̆ 2. Method 2 was superior because slower response of basal cover to weather enabled it to detect grazing-induced changes. Rated by Method 2, grazing treatments improved condition over the seven years, although moderate grazing was most successful, and Site 2 was in better range condition than Site 1. Contrary to the expected pattern for Objective 2, 2 ̆ 2 poor 2 ̆ 2 condition Site 1 produced more wool and higher sheep liveweight than Site 2. This occurred because invading annuals are more palatable, nutritious and productive than native perennial grasses. For Objective 3, simple climatic models showed that quantity and composition of pastures on both sites are determined first by timing and effectiveness of autumn rainfall, and subsequently modified by grazing intensity and plant competition. Two important demographic results were observed for Objective 4. First, population size of important Chloris grasses was regulated by density-dependent mechanisms when average density exceeded 10 plants per meter square for Chloris aciaularis (the dominant grass) and 1. 6 for Chloris truncata, a weak perennial. Spatial distribution explains the differential between species. Second, constant death risk in cohorts and long life-span produce mixed-age Chloris acicularis populations which are stable to changing climate and grazing. For Chloris truncata, short life-span and exponential death risk in cohorts renders it unstable to climate and grazing. The management implications of these results are discussed. Community stability was examined further in Experiment 2 by observing regeneration of perennial grasses on both sites at the three stocking rates following five months of grazing at 25 sheep per hectare. The results confirmed Experiment 1 : on neither site did Chloris aciaularis density decline significantly under abusive grazing. The reasons for the tenacity of the species are discussed in terms of physiological adaptations. In contrast, Chloris truncata populations. were decimated by abusive grazing, but produced enormous cohorts in the post-perturbation period suggesting that the species exercises a r-strategy for survival. It is concluded that while plant cover and basal area describe functional stability of vegetation to grazing and climate, they cannot detect structural changes in communities. Using plant size, age and density, demography can fulfill this function. Suggested applications of demography to practical situations are given and the implications discussed...|$|E

N. 1990 : Measurement of faecal output by sheep grazing at pasture using intraruminal chromium controlled release capsules. Proceedings of the Fifth AAAP Conference (Taipei). 3 : 92. Experimental evidence obtained since 1950 suggests that New Zealand sheep farm production and financial returns could be increased by adopting <b>separate</b> <b>grazing</b> management for ewes of different pregnancy and rearing status from 6 weeks before lambing until weaning. Progress in developing management systems for the differential allocation of pasture, favourable lambing paddocks and labour during this period has been restricted {{by the absence of}} equipment for diagnosing ewe pregnancy status and a lack of data relating pasture conditions to feed intake and ewe and lamb productivity. Accurate pregnancy diagnosis by realtime ultrasound scanning has been available to farmers since 1985, but research into ewe grazing management continues to be hampered by the absence of techniques for measuring feed intake. This thesis addressed the latter issue, first by validating controlled release capsule (CRC) technology for measuring feed intake and second by examining feed intakes of ewes differing in pregnancy and rearing status and relating intakes to productivity. A series of 11 experiments were conducted with sheep CRC to validate this technology for measurement of intake and to develop appropriate systems for using the technology in experimental situations. These studies examined: the linearity and period of Cr 2 O 3 release; the effect of presence of capsules in the rumen on voluntary feed intake; the effect of feed type and feeding level on Cr 2 O 3 release rate; and the accuracy of faecal Cr 2 O 3 concentration in predicting faecal output of sheep dosed with CRC when alternative sampling regimens were applied. These experiments, conducted under both indoor feeding and outdoor grazing conditions, established that CRC released Cr 2 O 3 into the rumen in a uniform manner once initiation of matrix extrusion had been completed 2 to 3 days after capsule insertion. The subsequent period of linear release (25 to 100 days) was found to be primarily dependent upon characteristics of the capsules controlled at manufacture (i. e. orifice diameter, matrix composition and length of pressed tablet matrix core). In comparison, environmental factors, both within and outside the sheep, had relatively small effects on the rate or linearity of Cr 2 O 3 release. Release rate decreased by c. 4 % if daily feed intake was at 0. 7 maintenance compared to an ad libitum level, increased by c. 2 % if hay rather than fresh pasture was consumed and decreased by 10 to 13 % if capsules were placed in rumen-fistulated sheep rather than in intact animals. Adoption of feeding level below 0. 6 maintenance for 4 to 7 days reduced Cr 2 O 3 release rate and could cause capsule failure. Between-capsule variation in release rate from CRC recovered from the rumen by slaughter was low (coefficient of variation 2. 0 to 6. 5 %). Variation between capsules within sheep was usually lower still. Voluntary herbage intake was significantly reduced if sheep were dosed with prototype CRC with inflexible wing designs. Under indoor conditions, correlations of 0. 90 to 0. 99 between daily faecal output derived by Cr 2 O 3 dilution and actual faecal output for individual sheep were obtained. The correlation between estimates of mean 3 -day faecal output of sheep at pasture predicted from the Cr 2 O 3 concentration in morning and evening grab samples and from total collections was 0. 87. Prediction of individual animal intakes (indoors) appeared less accurate (r = 0. 74) because of variation in capsule release rate and in the animal's own ability to select and digest its diet. Group mean estimates, which are appropriate for practical grazing conditions, were usually within ± 10 % of the actual value. Low diurnal variation in faecal Cr 2 O 3 concentration (non-significant) allowed flexible faecal sampling regimens to be applied. In summary CRC were demonstrated to be superior to existing feed intake measurement techniques and to be well suited to the estimation of mean intakes of sheep, provided that suitable faecal sampling regimens were applied. A pilot study investigating the feed intakes and productivity of ewes of different pregnancy and rearing status indicated that intakes of twin-bearing ewes were reduced in comparison to those of single-bearing ewes during late pregnancy, when the two groups were grazed together under "commercial" farming conditions. During lactation, intakes exhibited a curvilinear relationship with time and were generally higher (by up to 32 %) in twin-rearing ewes than in single-rearing ewes. This pattern of feed intake was less clear in a subsequent nine-week lactation study. In that trial, experimental groups comprising equal numbers of ewes rearing single or twin lambs were continuously grazed on five different pastures maintained at fixed sward surface heights (2. 5, 4. 0, 6. 0, 7. 0 and 9. 0 cm). Herbage intakes by both single- and twin-rearing ewes were maximised at a sward surface height of approximately 5. 0 cm (1000 to 1100 kg dry matter/ha). Lamb growth rates were not affected by sward height during the first six weeks of lactation because the ewes mobilised body reserves to maintain milk production. All ewes lost liveweight during the first 6 weeks of lactation but only the ewes on the 2. 5 cm sward failed to regain lost liveweight from weeks 6 to 9 of lactation. Wool production, strength and colour were not affected by sward conditions in either the ewes or lambs over the lactation period. These results suggest that New Zealand farmers would gain little benefit from differential management of ewes post-lambing where a minimum grazing height of 5. 0 cm could be maintained provided that ewes were in good condition (i. e minimum condition score 3. 0) at lambing...|$|E

As a result, these streams often have depauperate in-stream wood loads, and therefore decreased habitat complexity and lower levels of in-stream biodiversity. The introduction of wood was investigated as a possible rehabilitation technique for agricultural streams. Wood was re-introduced to eight streams in two <b>separate</b> high-rainfall, intensively <b>grazed</b> regions of Victoria, Australia and the effect on aquatic macroinvertebrate communities was measured. The addition of wood increased overall family richness and the richness of most functional feeding groups occupying edge and benthic habitats within the stream. Wood addition led to less overlap between benthic and edge macroinvertebrate communities, suggesting increased habitat heterogeneity within the stream ecosystem. Of all sampled habitats, wood supported the greatest density of families and was colonised by all functional feeding groups. Wood habitats also had the highest overall richness and supported the most taxa that were sensitive to disturbance.

Cell number-based factors ranged from 1. 1 × 1018 to 38 × 1018 cells mol of total thymidine incorporation− 1 and varied with treatment up to 10 -fold for the same initial bacterial assemblage. In contrast, cell biovolume-based conversion factors were similar for two treatment groups across a 16 -fold range of [3 H]thymidine incorporation rates: 5. 54 × 1017 μm 3 mol of total thymidine incorporation− 1 and 15. 2 × 1017 μm 3 mol of nucleic acid incorporation− 1. Much {{of the variation in}} cell number-based conversion factors was related to changes in apparent mean cell volume of produced bacteria.

Each of the 4 resulting groups <b>grazed</b> <b>separate,</b> contaminated pastures (mainly Haemonchus, Ostertagia and Cooperia) until winter housing on Oct 31, 1983.

One such breed is the Dorper sheep, which {{was used in this}} study to investigate the relationship between worm egg count and production attributes. Gastrointestinal worm burden was measured by worm egg counts (WECs) and production attributes that were examined included liveweight, body condition score (BCS), c-site fat depth and eye muscle depth. Two flocks of Dorper lambs (two-hundred and eighty nine Dorper ewe lambs, and two-hundred and thirty four entire Dorper ram lambs), were weaned onto two <b>separate</b> paddocks for <b>grazing</b> and natural worm challenge on a Kojonup property. At post weaning (approximately 10 months of age), each flock had their production attributes measured, along with individual WECs.

The measured flock WEC frequency distribution reinforced the concept that high flock WECs are influenced by {{a small percentage of the}} sheep within the flock and that Dorper sheep are similar to other breeds with respect to parasite population dynamics. The relationships found between WEC and production attributes of both liveweight and eye muscle depth were positive, contradicting the hypothesis of that a negative relationship exists between WEC and production in the Dorper.

The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of restricting pasture access time on dry matter intake (DMI), grazing behaviour and milk production. Fifty-two (20 primiparous and 32 pluriparous) Holstein-Friesian spring calving dairy cows (mean calving date 31 January) were balanced for lactation number (2. 4; s. d. 1. 43), milk yield (24. 5 (s. d. 4. 53) kg), body-weight (509, (s. d. 69. 5) kg) and body condition score (3. 31, s. d. 0. 331) in a randomised block design with 4 treatments.

In sheep, several {{studies have shown that}} the consumption of tannin-rich legume forages was associated with positive effects on host resilience and resistance to parasite infection. In goats, studies on such interactions between tanniferous plants and nematode infections remain few. The objectives of the current study were to examine under natural conditions the effects of consumption of sainfoin hay by goats on the parasite populations and on host resilience. Eighteen adult cull goats naturally infected with Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus colubriformis were used in the study. At the start of the assay, the goats were allocated into two groups, balanced according to weight and the levels of egg excretion. The two groups <b>grazed</b> <b>separate</b> pastures for 3 months with similar stocking rates. Goats from group S received each month indoors, for 7 days, sainfoin hay and control goats (group C) received hay of ryegrass.

Individual parasitological and pathophysiological measurements were performed fortnightly in order to compare host resistance and resilience. At the end of the study, five goats per group were necropsied.

Two flocks of 30 rams (resistant R and susceptible S) <b>grazed</b> <b>separate</b> pastures and 8 rams were slaughtered {{in the middle and}} at the end of each grazing season. Five groups of tracer lambs were added each year to estimate the pasture infectivity and were killed for worm counts. The availability of animals with differing resistance statuses (rams and tracer lambs) and differing levels of infection made it possible to investigate the number, size and fecundity of worms of these two species. The inflammatory response was measured in the rams by counting the globule leukocytes, mast cells and eosinophils in the fundic, pyloric and intestinal mucosa. In the tracer lambs, the daily egg production by the female worms of both species was negatively correlated with the worm burden. Worm length accounted for 60 and 70 % of the variation in the number of eggs in utero for T. circumcincta and T. colubriformis respectively. Worm length was closely associated with the resistance status of the host; there were greater differences between lambs, and S and R rams for T. colubriformis. T.  circumcincta worm lengths were not affected by the worm number. Globule leukocyte counts were related to the worm burdens, and mast cell counts to worm length in the R and S rams. The number, size and fecundity of the worms may well be regulated by similar mechanisms in both species, but T. colubriformis seemed to be more intensively regulated than T.  circumcincta.

Two lamb flocks (L and S) <b>grazed</b> <b>separate</b> paddocks with different natural larvae challenges (one low [Paddock L] and one high [Paddock S] challenge) on a commercial farm in Western Australia. Pasture samples were collected and analysed for larvae on 9 separate occasions from each paddock. Pregnant Merino ewes were sampled on 3 separate occasions (2 pre-partum and 1 post-partum). Following lambing, 203 female crossbred lambs were identified, from which faecal samples were collected across five separate samplings. Lamb production and faecal attributes were recorded. Genomic DNA was extracted directly from lamb faeces, {{in addition to the}} genomic DNA extracts from strongylid larval species recovered from pastures. Faecal worm egg counts (FWECs) were undertaken. Species-specific qPCRs and conventional PCRs (ITS- 2 nuclear ribosomal DNA) were used to screen samples for strongylid species (Teladorsagia circumcincta, Trichostrongylus spp., Haemonchus contortus, Chabertia ovina and Oesophagostomum venulosum). Negative correlations (r 2 > 0. 91) were found between qPCR C q values and log-transformed pasture larval counts for Trichostrongylus spp. and T. circumcincta. Moderate levels of agreement between pasture larval counts and qPCR results were observed (67 %). A clear difference in pasture larval challenge levels was observed between the two flocks using both qPCR and conventional pasture larval counts. It is difficult to draw conclusions on the production performances of lambs from the two experimental flocks, as no further replicates were able to be conducted following this experiment. Flock L had higher dressing percentages than Flock S (P= 0. 038), along with significantly higher faecal consistency and breech fleece faecal soiling scores at successive samplings.

Journal of Agricultural Science, 136, 221 - 230. The effectiveness of alternative fertilizer strategies to control nitrate leaching was investigated in a field experiment at IGER, Aberystwyth using simulated pastures to represent swards grazed by dairy cattle between May and October 1997, following an initial silage cut. Cut-plots with and without applications of artificial urine were used to represent the <b>separate</b> components of <b>grazed</b> pastures managed with the following nitrogen (N) fertilizer strategies: standard (fertilizer applied uniformly to {{all areas of the}} sward at a total rate of 180 kg N/ha between May and October), tactical (fertilizer rates adjusted to match the average soil mineral-N content of the pasture to that of ungrazed reference plots receiving the standard rate) and patch-avoidance (fertilizer applied at the standard rate but withheld from areas that had received urine). Calculated stocking rates derived from herbage yields indicated that 12 % of the pasture would have been affected by urine up to the end of ?grazing? in October. The presence of urine patches increased the nitrate-N content of the 0 ? 90 cm soil profile in October from 61 kg N/ha for ungrazed pasture to 104 kg/ha for ?grazed? pasture receiving the standard fertilizer rate. Although the patch-avoidance strategy was more effective than the tactical in reducing the accumulation of nitrate in soil under urine patches, they were both of limited effectiveness in reducing the content over the pasture as a whole. Profile contents in October for the simulated pastures managed with the tactical and patch-avoidance strategies were equivalent to 99 and 97 kg nitrate-N/ha, respectively. The tactical strategy achieved a 26 % saving in overall fertilizer use. Under the conditions of the experiment this did not significantly reduce herbage yields.

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{variation}} in demographic rates can have profound effects for population persistence, especially for dispersal-limited species living in fragmented landscapes. Long-term studies of plants in such habitats help with understanding {{the impacts of}} fragmentation on population persistence but such studies are rare. In this work we reanalyzed demographic data from seven years of the short-lived cactus Opuntia macrorhiza var. macrorhiza at five plots in Boulder, Colorado. Previous work combining data from all years and all plots predicted a stable population (deterministic log λ ≈ 0). This approach assumed that all five plots {{were part of a}} single population. Since the plots were located in a suburban/agricultural interface <b>separated</b> by highways, <b>grazing</b> lands and other barriers, and O. macrorhiza is likely dispersal-limited we analyzed the dynamics of each plot separately using stochastic matrix models assuming each plot represented a separate population. We found that the stochastic population growth rate log λS varied widely between populations (log λS = 0. 1497, 0. 0774, – 0. 0230, – 0. 2576, – 0. 4989). The three populations with the highest growth rates were located close together in space, while the two most isolated populations had the lowest growth rates suggesting that dispersal between populations is critical for the population viability of O. macrorhiza. With one exception, both our prospective (stochastic elasticity) and retrospective (stochastic life table response experiments) analysis suggested that means of stasis and growth, especially of smaller plants, were most important for population growth rate. This is surprising because recruitment is typically the most important vital rate in a short lived species such as O. macrorhiza. We found that elasticity to the variance was mostly negligible, suggesting O. macrorhiza populations are buffered against large temporal variation. Finally, single-year elasticities to means of transitions to the smallest stage (mostly due to reproduction) and growth differed considerably from their long-term elasticities. It is important to be aware of this difference when using models to predict the effect of manipulating plant vital rates within the time frame of typical plant demographic studies...|$|R

It is a former white-owned farm {{taken over by the}} South African Development Trust in the 1960 's. When the Trust took over: the land it was planned according to 'betterment' principles. This meant that the former tenants were relocated into a central village, and <b>separate</b> arable and <b>grazing</b> lands were demarcated by officials. Today poverty and powerlessness dominate the life of the inhabitants who depend on the export of. labour, migrant remittances and subsistence agriculture. This situation {{is directly related to the}} history of capitalist and state penetration in the Lowveld. Since the 1860 's the population of the Lowveld were systematically dispossessed by the State. Their incorporation into the capitalist economy followed the process of dispossession and proletarianization. In the 1890 's drought, rinderpest and the Anglo-Boer War completed the process of incorporation as the Lowveld population were increasingly forced to join the migrant labour force. From the early 1930 's when ownership of Lowveld farms changed from mining companies to individuals, labour tenancy replaced rent paying squatting as the dominant form of residence of the black population in the Lowveld. Labour tenancy on farms in the Bushbuckridge area provided the Lowveld population with opportunities for accumulation. Cattle numbers increased and small surpluses were produced. Tenants on Seville whose owners only used Seville for hunting in winter, enjoyed considerable freedom, and migrant labour became a matter of choice and not of necessity. But the recovery did not last long. State penetration to bring about racial separation transformed Busbuckridge farms into reserves, and as ethnic nationalism developed and became the dominant framework for intervention, reserve areas in the Lowveld were apportioned into ethnic homelands. Seville changed from a white-owned farm to a ward in the Mnisi Tribal Authority Area in Mhala, and the former tenants became citizens. of Gazankulu. These developments accelerated the process of rural decline and stagnation, leading to ever increasing poverty and powerlessness. Faced with these insecurities economic diversification and social mechanisms are major strategies to overcome poverty and survive. Though migrant labour is the material base of. life in this rural village, it cannot sustain social reproduction on its own. Neither can rural production. Families and households are forced to diversify economic activities and to find, according to their particular circumstances, a balance between migrant labour, local employment, rural production and informal economic activities. The demands of production and reproduction in the context of poverty and powerlessness also require the diversification of social relations to maximize the possibilities the social environment as a resource provides. And to maintain a community life and live as individuals in Seville, a balance between relations that unite and the relations that divide the community is necessary. Social diversification and the balance of relations that unite and divide are manifest in residential and domestic relations, and in cooperation and conflict...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in the magnitude of anthelmintic resistance towards commercial chemical anthelmintics, calls for alternative methods to complement treatment or replace anthelmintics. During {{the last two decades}} more and more calls have been made for a holistic management solution. Recent studies on breeding for resistant animals and bioactive forages highlight the potential of these to contribute towards parasite control. For this study, gastrointestinal infection in a merino flock was investigated by means of faecal egg counts (FEC). The level of parasite infection in weaned merino lambs in their first summer could be linked to weather conditions. Anthelmintic resistance in the flock was quantified and compared to the resistance level some years earlier. Within the flock, 18 % of the ewes appeared to be resistant with consistently (P< 0. 05) lower FEC {{than the rest of the}} flock. Lespedeza cuneata, a tannin-containing legume, is, according to scientific literature, one of the promising bioactive forages. Depending on the level of condensed tannin (CT), ruminant digestion can be complemented or compromised by the tannins. Small plot trials were conducted to establish production criteria for L. cuneata, currently lacking in South Africa. The grand mean dry mass (DM) yield for the first growing season, (characterized by above normal rainfall), was 8. 3 t ha- 1, compared to the 2. 56 t ha- 1 for the second growing season, (characterized by below normal rainfall). Highly significant differences (P< 0. 001) were measured between the yields produced under different cutting frequencies (6, 8 and 12 weeks) and cutting heights (5 cm and 15 cm). Except for crude protein levels, ADF (acid detergent fibre) and NDF (neutral detergent fibre) analysis of the complete plant indicated a less acceptable nutritional quality. Since sheep selected leaves during <b>grazing,</b> <b>separated</b> leaf samples were analysed. Chemical feed analyses of leaves were more favourable, compared to feed analysis of the whole plant. The condensed tannin (CT) content of leaves increased significantly (P< 0. 05) with increased moisture stress and varied between 24. 5 and 122 g kg- 1 DM over the growing seasons. Different dried herbage diets were offered to Merino ewes in a follow-up trial to evaluate the anthelmintic properties of the forage. The leaf portion of Lespedeza cuneata hay and Medicago sativa hay was offered ad libitum to confined sheep. Lespedeza cuneata is a tannin rich legume, while Medicago sativa, known for its very low tannin content, was used as control. FEC were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower in the Lespedeza group after 35 days. To determine the influence of condensed tannin (CT) level on the hatch efficacy of Haemonchus contortus eggs, acetone leaf extracts of L. cuneata plants with different condensed tannin contents (73. 5, 88, 102 and 122 g kg- 1 DM) were tested in an in vitro assay on H. contortus eggs. Concentrations of between 0. 63 and 20 mg ml- 1 were used in the assay. Concentrations higher than 10 mg ml- 1 led to complete inhibition of egg hatching with all the plant extracts regardless of CT content. A typical dose related response of the extracts of plants with very high tannin content was found, but not with plant extracts containing lower tannin concentrations. The results of the study indicate that L. cuneata can be incorporated in a fodder flow programme as an alternative or complementary strategy to other methods, to manage the detrimental effect of gastrointestinal parasites in sheep.

40|$|Gastrointestinal {{parasitism}} in grazing lambs adversely affects animal {{performance and}} welfare, causing significant production losses for the sheep industry. Control of gastrointestinal parasitism using chemotherapeutic treatment is under threat {{due to the}} emergence of anthelmintic resistance, thus stimulating research into alternative control strategies. Whilst investigating control strategies experimentally can be costly and time consuming, using a mathematical modelling approach can reduce such constraints. A previously developed model which describes the impact of host nutrition, genotype and gastrointestinal parasitism in a growing lamb, provided an appropriate starting point to explore control strategies and their impact on host-parasite interactions. Two contrasting mechanisms have previously been proposed to account for the occurrence of anorexia during parasitism. These were reductions in either intrinsic growth rate or relative food intake. Thus, the existing individual lamb model was modified to evaluate these mechanisms by exploring the relationship between anorexia and food composition (Chapter 2). For foods that did not constrain food intake, published data was found to be consistent with the predictions that arose from anorexia being modelled as a reduction in relative food intake. Reported genetic parameter estimates for resistance and performance traits appear to vary under differing production environments. In order to explore the impact of epidemiological effects and anthelmintic input on genetic parameter estimates the model was extended to simulate a population of lambs in a grazing scenario (Chapter 3). Whilst estimates of heritabilities and genetic correlations for drenched lambs remained constant, for lambs given no anthelmintic treatment, the heritability of empty body weight (EBW) reduced and the genetic correlation between faecal egg count (FEC) and EBW became increasingly negative with increasing exposure to infective larvae. Thus differences in anthelmintic input and pasture larval contamination (PC) may provide plausible causes for the variation in genetic parameter estimates previously reported. To investigate the interactions between host resistance and epidemiology (Chapter 4) a population of 10, 000 lambs were simulated and FEC predictions used to assign the 1, 000 lambs with the highest and lowest predicted FEC to ‘susceptible’ (S) and ‘resistant’ (R) groups, respectively. R and S groups were then simulated to <b>graze</b> <b>separate</b> pastures over 3 grazing seasons. The average FEC and PC predictions of these groups diverged during the first 2 grazing seasons and stabilised during the third, such that the difference in FEC predictions between R and S groups were double those predicted when grazed with the population. This was found to be consistent with experimental data. Further, anthelmintic treatment and grazing strategies were predicted to have no impact on the EBW of resistant lambs, suggesting that control strategies should be targeted towards susceptible animals. Targeted selective anthelmintic treatment (TST) has been proposed to reduce risks of anthelmintic resistance with minimal impacts on performance. To describe the short- and long-term impacts of TST and drenching frequency on sheep production and the emergence of anthelmintic resistance, the model was extended to include a description of anthelmintic resistance genotypes within the nematode population (Chapter 5). Reducing the proportion of treated animals was predicted to increase the duration of anthelmintic efficacy, whilst reducing the drenching frequency increased the long-term benefits of anthelmintic on sheep production. Various determinant criteria for use in TST regimes were compared (Chapter 5) including performance traits such as live weight and growth rate, and parasitological traits such as FEC. Using FEC as the TST criterion was predicted to allow the greatest {{reduction in the number of}} anthelmintic treatments administered whilst maintaining the highest average EBW, whilst live weight and growth rate were predicted to give little to no improvement in comparison to selecting animals at random for TST. Using estimated breeding values (EBVs) for FEC as the determinant criterion for TST regimes was compared to using measured FEC (Chapter 6). The EBV for true FEC across the entire growth period, akin to perfect genomic selection, was predicted to be a better criterion than measured time-specific FEC (including a sampling error) for a TST regime. EBVs calculated using measured time-specific FEC showed little benefit compared to measured FEC. The information gained from these simulation studies increases our understanding of control strategies and their impact on host-parasite interactions under various scenarios that may not have been possible using experimental methods. It is important to remember that the aim of alternative or complimentary control strategies is to maintain the sustainability of sheep production systems, and as such the production gain of any control strategy needs to be weighed against the financial, labour and time costs involved in implementation...|$|R

One third of the lambs grazed control perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) /white clover (Trifolium repens) pasture only, another third grazed pasture for 3 weeks followed by willow fodder blocks for 1 week (repeating the rotation; restricted access) and {{the last third of}} the lambs grazed on willow fodder blocks {{for the duration of the}} experiment (full access). All lambs were effectively treated with anthelmintics at the start of the experiment. Each group was divided into undrenched lambs and lambs regularly drenched every 4 weeks. Each of the six groups <b>grazed</b> <b>separate</b> areas at the same dry matter (DM) allowance, using {{rotational grazing}} with weekly breaks. Undrenched lambs would be trigger drenched if the faecal egg count (FEC) geometric mean of the group exceeded 1000 eggs/g wet faeces and/or liveweight gain (LWG) was reduced to zero and/or any one individual lamb exceeded 2500 eggs/g wet faeces, which never occurred. Rectal faecal samples for FEC, larval counts (LC) and visual dag formation (Dag Score; DS) were assessed initially and at two week intervals throughout the experiment. All lambs were slaughtered at the end of the experiment, fatness (GR) and carcass weight (CW) measurements were recorded and representative samples of the abomasum, small intestine and large intestine were collected in the three undrenched treatments to determine total worm burdens. Primary growth legume content in willow fodder blocks was similar to that of control pasture (20 %), but willow fodder blocks secondary growth legume content (30 %) was greater than in secondary growth control pasture (22 %). Primary growth pre-grazing herbage mass (approximately 4800 kg DM/ha) and post-grazing herbage mass (approximately 3400 kg DM/ha) in willow fodder blocks (full and restricted access) was higher than that of control pasture (4400 and 3000 kg DM/ha respectively). Secondary growth pre and post-grazing herbage mass was similar in willow fodder blocks and control pasture (4200 and 3000 kg DM/ha respectively). Secondary growth mass of fodder trees (775 kg DM/ha) in the willow fodder block full access treatment was higher than primary growth (562 kg DM/ha). Pre-grazing herbage dead matter content was consistently higher in secondary growth (20 - 40 %) than in primary growth (8 - 10 %), for both control pasture and fodder blocks. Condensed tannin concentration in willow fodder block herbage was 14. 5 g/kg DM compared to the CT levels (6. 2 g/kg DM) detected in control pasture diet selected. However, CT concentration in willow fodder block trees was particularly high (approximately 45. 5 g/kg DM). In vitro OMD, DOMD and ME concentrations were higher for selected tree browse in willow fodder blocks (0. 71; 0. 65 g/kg DM; 10. 6 MJ/kg DM respectively) when compared to herbage selected in either willow fodder blocks or control pasture (0. 65; 0. 60 g/kg DM; 9. 7 MJ/kg DM respectively). Regularly drenched lambs had significantly higher LWG and carcass weight gain (CWG) than undrenched lambs (p < 0, 05) in all three groups. Lambs in willow fodder block full access had the highest LWG in drenched as well as undrenched lambs of 182 g/day and 154 g/day respectively. Due to hot and dry summer conditions, growth rates of all treatments declined in the second half of the experiment as herbage nutritive value declined. Undrenched willow fodder block full access had the highest CWG amongst all undrenched treatments. Carcass weight gain reduction of undrenched lambs versus drenched lambs for the full access to willow fodder block group (12 g/day) was half of the reduction between control pasture groups (24 g/day). Dag score increased with time until Day 70 of the experiment, with no differences between the six treatment groups. From Day 70 until the end of the experiment, dag scores of lambs grazing willow fodder block full access were consistently lower than lambs grazing willow fodder block restricted access or control pasture and were lower for drenched than for undrenched lambs. Drenched groups maintained low FECs throughout the experiment, whereas FECs of undrenched groups progressively increased with time. Both DS and LWG were similar for drenched lambs grazing control pasture and undrenched lambs grazing willow fodder block full access. The parasites established in greatest numbers in undrenched lambs grazing control pasture were Teladorsagia trifurcata, Nematodirus spathiger, Trichostrongylus vitrinus, Trichostrongylus colubriformis followed by Trichostrongylus axei and Teladorsagia circumcincta. At slaughter, undrenched lambs grazing on willow fodder block full access had significantly lower Nematodirus spathiger, Trichostrongylus vitrinus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis worm burdens when compared to undrenched lambs grazing control pasture (p < 0. 05), but greater burdens of Haemonchus contortus (p = 0. 0299). Undrenched lambs grazing willow fodder block with restricted access had significantly lower Teladorsagia circumcincta, Teladorsagia trifurcata, Trichostrongylus vitrinus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis worm burdens than undrenched lambs grazing control pasture (p < 0. 05). It was concluded that parasitism restricted lamb growth in all three undrenchcd grazing systems, showing a progressive increase in FEC over time. However, the reduction in carcass weight gain was greatest for undrenched control lambs and least for undrenched lambs with full access to willow fodder blocks. Grazing undrenched lambs on restricted and full access willow fodder blocks showed lower burdens of some parasites at slaughter compared to undrenched lambs grazing control pasture, which could be due firstly to an increased CT present in both willow and in fodder block herbage and their possible effects in increasing protein absorption. Secondly, CT could have interrupted parasite life cycles and/or. thirdly, decreased L 3 larval consumption could have occurred due to taller plant morphology of the trees, hence reducing the reinfection rate. There seemed to be no direct effect on killing established parasites, as if that had happened, there should have been a decrease in FEC in the first half of the experiment, before any effects of reinfection took place. CT-containing forages could be used in conjunction with live weight gain monitoring and/or body condition score for the control of gastrointestinal nematodes, but it still needs further evaluation and a close collaboration of researchers and farmers...|$|R

In Experiment 1 (18 October 2000 to 21 January 2001) and Experiment 2 (3 October 2001 to 2 January 2002) both forages were fed ad libitum. Total condensed tannin (CT) concentration in the diet selected was 24 to 27 g CT/kg DM for L. corniculatus and 1. 4 to 1. 5 g CT/kg DM for pasture. The LW gain, weaning LW and wool production were consistently greater (P < 0. 001) for lambs grazing L. corniculatus, in either Experiment 1 (258 vs. 189 g/day; 36. 1 vs. 30. 1 kg; 1. 17 vs. 0. 98 kg) and in Experiment 2 (247 vs. 162 g/day; 31. 8 vs. 24. 1 kg; 1. 17 vs. 0. 81 kg), respectively. Ewe and lamb dag scores were strongly and positively correlated with dag weight (P < 0. 001) and generally increased with time in sheep grazing pasture, whilst grazing on L. corniculatus consistently reduced dag score. FEC in ewes grazing pasture showed a post-parturient rise (PPR) following lambing, whilst ewes grazing L. corniculatus had a reduced PPR in FEC. Up to day 70, FEC in lambs grazing L. corniculatus was lower than that for lambs grazing pasture, but between day 70 and the end of both experiments (approximately day 90), FEC in lambs grazing L. corniculatus increased to similar values as for pasture-fed lambs. FEC was not correlated with dag score or dag weight in ewes or lambs grazing pasture, but these indices were weakly and positively correlated in ewes and lambs grazing L. corniculatus, suggesting that lowering FEC on L. corniculatus also reduced dag formation. It was concluded that under dryland farming conditions, the use of L. corniculatus during the spring/early summer lactation period can increase lamb LW and wool production, whilst eliminating the need for pre-lambing anthelmintic drenching and probably reducing the amount of insecticide needed to control flystrike. These effects compared to pasture are probably due to higher digestibilty, higher ME concentration, higher voluntary feed intake (VFI), and to the effect of CT in reducing rumen protein degradability and controlling internal parasites in sheep grazing L. corniculatus. The absence of endophyte in L. corniculatus may have also have contributed to these effects. 2. During 2001 and 2002 (Chapter 3), grazing trials from February to November were conducted for 279 days (Experiments 1) and 285 days (Experiment 2), to compare the effects of grazing shorn mixed age Romney ewes in light condition on L. corniculatus versus pasture during the mating period (9 weeks, Experiment 1) and 11 weeks (Experiment 2). In Experiment 2, the length of time (days) that ewes need to graze L. corniculatus before mating to maximise reproductive performance was also investigated. Common objectives in both Experiments were to measure forage feeding effects on ewe wool production and LW of their lambs at weaning. In Experiment 1, groups of ewes (n = 100) were fed on either L. corniculatus or pasture at a herbage allowance of 1. 8 kg green DM/ewe/day for the first three weeks of feeding and increased to ad libitum (2. 3 kg green DM/ewe/day) during the mating period for two cycles. In Experiment 2, groups of 75 ewes grazed L. corniculatus for 42, 21, 10 and 0 days before a synchronised oestrus, with pasture being grazed for the balance of the 42 days. All L. corniculatus groups continued grazing L. corniculatus for a further 5 weeks. Feed allowance was initially 2. 0 kg green DM/ewe/day, increased to 2. 3 kg green DM/ewe/day during the mating period over the two cycles. At the end of L. corniculatus feeding in both experiments the groups were combined and grazed on pasture until weaning. Total CT concentration in the diet selected was 18 to 29 g CT/kg DM for L. corniculatus, with only trace amounts in pasture. In Experiment 1 mating ewes on L. corniculatus compared to pasture increased number of lambs born and lambs weaned per ewe lambing by 16 and 32 % units respectively (P < 0. 05), due to more multiple and less single births (P = 0. 06) and to reduced lamb mortality (P < 0. 05) between birth and weaning. In Experiment 2, increasing the numbers of days of grazing L. corniculatus before ovulation (0, 10, 21, 42 days) linearly increased ovulation rate (P < 0. 05), lambs born and lamb weaned by up to 16 % units, but had no effect upon lamb mortality. Mating ewes on L. corniculatus increased wool production (P < 0. 01) and fibre length (P < 0. 05) in Experiment 1 but not in Experiment 2. Grazing L. corniculatus had no effect on lamb birth weight and only small positive effects on weaning LW. It was concluded that, under commercial dryland farming conditions, the use of L. corniculatus during the mating season in late summer/autumn can be used to increase reproductive efficiency and wool production, with the largest responses in years with exceptionally dry autumn periods. These effects are probably due to the higher digestibility and ME concentration of L. corniculatus than pasture and to the CT in L. corniculatus reducing rumen protein degradability and leading to greater essential amino acid (EAA) absorption from the small intestine. Effects of forage CT upon the uterine microenvironment at the time of conception, implantation and early foetal growth, need to be investigated in future studies. It is also suggested that effects of mating on L. corniculatus upon lamb mortality between birth and weaning should be further investigated with ewe numbers/treatment increased from 100 to 350. 3. During the summer of 2002 / 2003, another grazing trial (Chapter 4 : 95 days) compared the effects of grazing L. corniculatus and pasture on LW and the dynamics of nematode parasite infection in Suffolk x Romney weaned lambs fed ad libitum. Half of the lambs (n = 30) grazing either L. corniculatus or pasture received oral anthelmintic at the start and at monthly intervals (regular-drenched groups), whilst the remaining 30 lambs in each treatment only received oral anthelmintic when mean faecal nematode egg counts (FECs) exceed 1, 000 eggs/g wet faeces (trigger-drenched groups), which occurred on day 58 only for both groups. Trigger and regular-drench lambs <b>grazed</b> <b>separate</b> areas. Total CT concentration in the diet selected was 40 to 31 g CT/kg DM for L. corniculatus, with only trace amounts in pasture. Regular-drenched lambs grazing L. corniculatus had significantly higher LW gain (298 g/day) and carcass weight gain (133 g/day) than all the other groups, whilst trigger-drenched lambs grazing L. corniculatus had significantly greater LW gain (228 g/day) and carcass gain (99 g/day) than regular-drenched (200; 66 g/day) and trigger-drenched (187; 63 g/day) lambs grazing pasture. Carcass fatness was significantly lower for trigger-drenched lambs than for regular-drenched lambs, when fed either L. corniculatus or pasture. Dag score was consistently lower for regular-drenched lambs grazing L. corniculatus than pasture; trigger-drenched lambs showed similar effects up to day 48, with no {{differences between the two groups}} thereafter. Regular anthelmintic treatment maintained FECs at low values, while parasitised lambs on L. corniculatus tended to have higher FECs than pasture-fed lambs. Relative to trigger-drenched lambs that grazed pasture, grazing trigger-drenched lambs on L. corniculatus had significantly reduced worm burdens of Haemochus contortus, Teladosargia spp., Nematodirus spp. and Cooperia spp. at slaughter, but greater burdens of Trichostrongylus spp., Chabertia ovina, Oesophagostonum spp. and Trichuris ovis were present in L. corniculatus-fed lambs. It was concluded that grazing L. corniculatus under dryland farming conditions compared to pasture can increase LW gain of weaned lambs, whilst reducing reliance on anthelmintic drenches to control parasites. These effects are probably due to increased protein supply from the action of CT enabling the lambs to have a higher LW gain when carrying a parasite burden, and to L. corniculatus better maintaining its high ME value under drought conditions. Using L. corniculatus to finish weaned lambs without anthelmintic drenches for a seven-week period is proposed. 4. A three-year study (Chapter 5; November 2000 to October 2003) was conducted to compare, under grazing conditions, seasonal and annual grazed net herbage accumulation rate and seasonal dynamics of undisturbed (i. e. non-grazed) net herbage accumulation rate of L. corniculatus relative to grass-dominant pasture. Prediction equations to estimate standing DM in L. corniculatus and pasture from the rising plate meter (RPM) and sward surface height were also generated. L. corniculatus and pasture growing in a moderate fertility and low-pH soil (pH 5. 35) accumulated similar total herbage masses (24. 3 vs. 24. 1 t DM/ha) over the 3 -year period, with the DM production being greater for L. corniculatus than for pasture during 2000 - 2001, producing more DM during summer/autumn drought conditions. The net herbage accumulation rate from undisturbed areas of L. corniculatus and pasture were similar in spring, summer and autumn. Seasonal variation in the calibration regressions fitted to estimate herbage mass of L. corniculatus non-destructively, suggested a combination of destructive and nondestructive methods are needed to assess herbage mass. It was concluded that L. corniculatus has the potential to increase the performance of a pasture-based sheep dryland farming system due to its ability to grow in acidic soils, its tolerance of drought conditions during summer/autumn and its seasonality of feed supply. 5. Three digestion experiments involving cryptorchid weaned lambs were conducted for 14 days over the spring, summer and autumn to determine changes in in vivo digestibility of DM, OM, digestible OM in the DM and ME concentration of L. corniculatus at different stages of maturity. In vivo digestibility samples were then used as standards to investigate if the enzymatic in vitro system of Roughan and Holland (1977) could predict OMD and DOMD of CT-containing L. corniculatus. Digestibility of L. corniculatus declined as it matured, but the rate of decline was much less than occurs for temperate grasses and for white clover. It was concluded that the in vitro enzymatic system of Roughan and Holland (1977) can be used to predict OMD and DOMD of L. corniculatus, provided a standard curve involving in vivo data generated with L. corniculatus is used. Using a standard curve with in vivo data from pasture led to bias which increased at lower OMD values. Reasons for the consistent differences between L. corniculatus and pasture standard curves are discussed, including possible effects of residual bound CT in lowering in vitro digestibility. From this series of experiments, this study is the first to report that relative to conventional perennial ryegrass/white clover, mating ewes on L. corniculatus under grazing conditions may reduce post-natal lamb mortality. It is also the first study to show that grazing sheep on L. corniculatus can maintain productivity during spring and summer with reduced dependence on anthelmintic drench input. It is concluded that whole farm modelling, mechanical harvesting and conservation strategies, selection of L. corniculatus germplasm for creeping-type plants more suited to grazing and the integration of new crops containing secondary compounds, such as chicory, should be considered to support major advances in sustainable dryland sheep farming systems...|$|R
