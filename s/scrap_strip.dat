50|$|Locomotive 101 {{remained}} in storage at Whitehead, Co. Antrim, ostenably {{as a source}} of spare parts for 102. Due to pressure for space {{as a result of the}} Whitehead site rebuild and the arrival of B(141) class locomotives B141 and B142 from Inchicore, attempts were made to seek a buyer for 101. This did not materialise, and it was decided to reluctantly <b>scrap</b> the partially <b>stripped</b> 101 and remove any useful parts for use on 102. The remains of the locomotive were cut up in January 2010.|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War in December 1941, the RAAF began classifying aircraft at SFTSs as Second Line (Reserve) elements in the defence of Australia. [...] No.70 (Reserve) Squadron was formed at No.6 SFTS, and was tasked with army cooperation, meteorological survey, and photo reconnaissance duties in the Adelaide vicinity. The RAAF rationalised its EATS facilities in March 1942, dividing the personnel and equipment of No.3 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, between No.6 SFTS and No.1 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria. The last course at No.6 SFTS concluded in September 1945, by which time 2,178 pilots had graduated. The school disbanded on 1January 1946, re-forming as Care and Maintenance Unit (CMU) Mallala. CMU Mallala was one of 40 such units across Australia responsible for the storage of surplus aircraft awaiting sale, <b>scrapping</b> or <b>stripping</b> for spare parts. From June 1947, the base facilities constructed for No.6 SFTS were occupied by RAAF units supporting the Long Range Weapons Project at Woomera Rocket Range.|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of dynamic recrystallization in the intermediate stands of the Finishing Mill of a Hot Strip Mill promotes substantial softening {{of the rolling}} stock, a situation that can cause operational problems and even <b>scrapping</b> of the <b>strip.</b> The aim of this work was to identify the specific process conditions {{that can lead to}} this situation, which was carried out through the application of a microstructural evolution model. It was verified, for the specific conditions of the Cubatão Works of Usiminas, that this problem generally occurs during the processing of thin hot coils, with a relatively low Nb content and under rolling temperatures slightly lower than the normal range...|$|R

40|$|When {{remelting}} aluminium scrap, metal losses due to dross {{generation is}} a common problem. Reduction of these losses will give substantial economic and environmental benefits. Dross is generated when aluminium metal oxidizes and films of oxide envelope molten metal. When a cold metal object is immersed in a melt, {{the heat of the}} melt around this is transferred so rapidly into the object that a shell of melt often solidifies {{to the surface of the}} object. When scrap with low bulk density is charged to a melt, solidification of melt on the cold scrap prevents melt from entering the cavities in the bulk of the scrap, and the bulk density remains low. Thus the scrap tends to float on the melt surface. Submersion of this scrap is important to avoid oxidation and subsequent dross generation. One solution to this is to roll <b>scrap</b> to a <b>strip</b> and feed it into the melt. This system has been examined by studying feeding of a continuous, thin aluminium plate into molten aluminium. Also, the effect of lacquer was considered, as well as feeding the plate into a launder with melt flowing along the surface of the plate. An analytical, one-dimensional, steady-state model has been developed to describe the melting and the melting mechanisms. It is based on a shell solidifying on the plate surface and a gap introducing a thermal resistance 1 /hg between the shell and the plate. The thermal resistance 1 /hl of the boundary layer of the melt is included. Depending on these resistances, the initial temperature of the plate and the melt temperature, a shell will form, and the plate will penetrate a distance P into the melt before it melts away. An experimental apparatus was designed and constructed to feed aluminium plate from a coil into a melt bath at a specified velocity. The plate could be withdrawn rapidly to “freeze” the situation like it was below the melt surface. The penetration depth P of the plate could be measured and shell formation observed. More than 200 experiments were performed, and by comparing the penetration depth at different feeding velocities and melt temperatures to model predictions, the two heat-transfer coefficients hl and hg could be determined by curve fitting. They agree reasonably well with values found in the literature and calculated from boundary-layer theory. In a few experiments, the plate feeding was recorded on video tape, and the cross section of some plates was studied in a microscope. Feeding of somewhat thicker plates was also tried. This gave valuable background information for comparing the experiments to the model. We believe that snap-off of the plate due to low mechanical strength around the melting temperature may affect the measurement of the penetration depth of the plate. Attempts were also made to measure the temperature in the plate by attaching thermocouples to its surface. The obtained temperature profiles in the plate were compared to the model predictions, but the method needs improvement. A criterion for formation of a shell is formulated and tested against experimental observations. Qualitative agreement is achieved. Even if there is no shell formation, it seems that there will be an air film with thermal resistance 1 /hg. This indicates that the melting rate will be independent of whether a shell is formed or not. Two additional models with only one heat-transfer coefficient are also developed in order to challenge the main model. From this analysis it is found that the use of two heat-transfer coefficients is necessary to describe the system. The model should be of direct interest when feeding rolled scrap into molten aluminium. Improvement of the model can be attained by reconsidering the assumptions made, but then numerical methods must undoubtedly be applied. These new models should include the snap-off mechanism. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
