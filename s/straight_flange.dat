40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} design a controlled sheet metal forming process to achieve a desired product shape without defects. An optimal blank holder force (BHF) profile is {{an efficient way to}} control the material flow during the forming process. The study in this paper tried to find an optimal BHF profile for an axisymmetric part using the finite element method. Up to now, the two main methods used vary the BHF as a function of time or space. Thus, time-variant and space-variant BHF profiles, which are imposed on the integrated and the divided blank holder respectively, were studied and compared in this paper. Two time-variant BHF patterns, such as linearly shaped and stepped ones, and various trends, such as ascending and descending, are discussed. The paper also examines six space-variant BHF patterns. Based on the numerical simulation results, the strain path in different areas under the various BHF schemes was analysed and compared. The results revealed that the ascending BHF type is the optimal pattern used to prevent wrinkling and optimize the strain distribution during the forming process as compared to the descending BHF type. In terms of energy opinion, it is found that the ascending BHF is {{the most effective way to}} prevent wrinkling and achieve a desired product shape. Taking another aspect, the preferable space-variant BHF pattern is the type where less force is imposed on the corner area than on the <b>straight</b> <b>flange</b> area. This is confirmed by a the comparison of strain paths under six space-variant BHF patterns. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Finite element {{simulations}} of hemming, a method {{used in the}} automotive industry to join two sheet metal panels by bending the flange of the outer panel over the inner one, are dealt with in this thesis. This method is used mainly for assembly of closures in automotive bodies (i. e. side doors, hoods, trunk lids and tailgates). Therefore, hemming {{is considered by many}} people to be a joining method. Nevertheless, as hemming also has many properties in common with sheet metal forming, some of the knowledge gained in research on sheet metal forming can also be applied to hemming and vice versa. There are some defects that can be associated with the hemming operation. The work presented in this thesis concentrates on predicting the reduction in size of the outer panel during the operation, known as roll-in. This reduction in size has to be compensated for, in the flange die for the outer panel, to obtain an assembled part with the correct dimensions. Today this compensation is based on practical knowledge from simple experiments and on experience gained from similar parts already in production. However, a large amount of both time and money could be saved if the roll-in could be predicted with high accuracy at an early stage of a project. The final goal is to simulate all of the hemming steps of production parts. To make three-dimensional {{simulations of}} hemming possible within reasonable simulation times, it is necessary to use shell elements. A problem in hemming simulations is that the radius of curvature of the outer part in the folded area is very small, normally of the same order of magnitude as the sheet thickness. This implies that the conditions for a shell theory to hold are far from being fulfilled. The first half of this thesis is therefore an investigation of the order of magnitude of the errors resulting from the use of shell elements in FE simulation of hemming. To estimate these errors, a two-dimensional FE model of a cross section of a flat part with a <b>straight</b> <b>flange</b> is investigated using both solid and shell elements. The results from these models are then compared {{with each other and with}} those from experiments conducted in this project. The solid element model in this study used a new implementation of the Barlat  91 material model. This implementation assumes plane strain conditions and planar anisotropy; it also uses an iterative, backward-Euler integration and is implemented in the FE code LS-DYNA. The second half of the thesis is devoted to three-dimensional simulations of the hemming of an automotive hood. Two versions of the explicit FE code LS-DYNA and five shell elements were used in these simulations. The influences on roll-in from adhesives, anisotropy, and uniform pre-straining were also studied. Results from a forming simulation were mapped to the flanging and hemming ones in order to study the influence from the stamping of the outer panel on the roll-in...|$|E

C. livida eggs are identified as being less than 1.35 mm in length, without pronounced flanges or longitudinal ridges, and with the arms of the <b>flanges</b> <b>straight</b> or slightly diverging.|$|R
5000|$|With both tram {{and train}} wheels, this happens {{naturally}} because the tires are cone shaped sloping surfaces: the inside diameter {{is a few}} millimeters larger than the outside. As the track starts to curve, the train tries to run <b>straight.</b> The wheel <b>flange</b> presses {{against the side of}} the curved rail so the [...] "contact point" [...] between rail and wheel moves a few millimeters outwards, making the effective diameter of the outer wheel temporarily larger, and equally opposite: the effective diameter of the inner wheel effectively becomes temporarily smaller. This technique works well on large-radius curves which are canted, but not as well on tight curves and railway switches (also known as [...] "points"). This is because the geometry or cant of the track is more difficult to optimize for every possible combination of vehicle and direction of travel.|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} program FLANGE was written to calculate {{not only the}} stresses due to moment loads on the flange ring but also stresses due to internal pressure; stresses due to a temperature difference between the hub and ring; and stresses due to the variations in bolt load that result from pressure, hub-ring temperature gradient, and/or bolt-ring temperature difference. The program FLANGE is applicable to tapered-hub, <b>straight,</b> and blind <b>flanges.</b> The analysis method {{is based on the}} differential equations for thin plates and shells. The stresses due to moment loading calculated by the two methods are essentially identical for identical boundary conditions. A description of the general model of flanges used in the theoretical development of the computer code is provided. The actual mathematical expressions for calculating stresses and displacements due to moment and pressure loads are derived. Example calculations, listings, and flowcharts of the program and its subroutines are included as appendices. (auth...|$|R
40|$|Arched roofs {{are built}} {{more and more}} with roller bent wide flange sections, serving as {{structural}} elements. Roller bent wide flange sections are manufactured from <b>straight</b> hot-rolled wide <b>flange</b> sections by a process called roller bending. The material is cold worked during forming, inducing a new distribution of mechanical properties across the section which is different compared to its original state. For the design of arches the use of original or nominal strength properties of the straight material neglects {{the influence of the}} roller bending process. This may lead to conservative or nonconservative designs. This paper presents the results of an extensive experimental investigation of the mechanical properties of roller bent wide flange sections. It comprises tensile tests and compression tests on coupons taken from roller bent sections and their straight counterparts. The results show that the roller bending process alters the mechanical properties of the material non-uniformly over the cross-section. In this paper the experimental results are presented. In a companion paper the experimental results are used to arrive at a set of equations that yields different stress–strain curves for specific zones across the roller bent steel section...|$|R
40|$|Rubber forming is {{a common}} process for the {{fabrication}} of flanged metallic parts in the aerospace industry. The process enables cheap tooling, which is important since the product series are limited. In the process a rigid and a soft tool are combined to form a metal blank into the required shape. Most components made in this way are “flanged parts”, i. e. parts with a rather flat web plate and curved flanges at {{the periphery of the}} web plate. For flanged parts the determination of spring back of the <b>flanges,</b> <b>straight</b> or curved, is important, since the forming dies compensated with the spring back, should result in accurate products. Like all metal forming processes elastic and plastic deformations are combined in the same process cycle. The elastic deformations result in spring back and residual stresses, the ratio between these two depends on the shape of the product and the distribution of the plastic and elastic deformations. In this research an aluminium alloy was used. The low Young’s modulus of this alloy results in rather high elastic responses upon deformation. Other aspects that have been evaluated are the effect of processing parameters like friction and distribution of strains. For stretch flanges the strain is distributed evenly along the flange, but not for shrink flanges, where buckling plays a role. Experimental research shows that the spring back of the flanges depend on a number of variables like the thickness, flange geometry, and material parameters. The spring back of a flange is also a mixture of different contributions: spring back due to the bending over the bend line, spring back due to the curvature of the flange, and spring back due to in-plane deformations. The research performed focused on the different components of the spring back and their interaction. Analysis of the data resulted in a new parameter by which a number of variables could be captured. This improves the understanding of the spring back phenomena and a generalization of the results...|$|R
