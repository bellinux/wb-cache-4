50|$|The State-Trait Anger Scale (STAS) {{includes}} 10 {{items and}} initially constructed with two subscales: state anger (S-Anger), {{defined as an}} emotional state or condition that consists of subjective feelings of tension, annoyance, irritation, fury and rage; trait anger (T-Anger) {{defined in terms of}} individual differences in the frequency that S-Anger was experienced over time. The scores on both <b>subscales</b> <b>were</b> found to be unrelated to each other. While responses to all items of the S-Anger scale were found to be equally related to this same scale (high internal consistency), this was not true for the T-Anger scale. The T-Anger scale was therefore divided in two subscales: Angry Temperament - which describes the disposition to express anger - and Angry Reaction, which describes anger responses.|$|E

40|$|The study {{describes}} {{the development and}} psychometric evaluation of a self-report questionnaire for use in both treatment-outcome research and process studies: the Agoraphobic self-statements Questionnaire (ASQ). The ASQ comprises two subscales: a positive self-statements subscale and a negative self-statements subscale. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that, {{with the exception of}} one item, the proposed bidimensional structure of the ASQ reappeared in a second agoraphobic patient Sample. Internal consistency of both <b>subscales</b> <b>was</b> satisfactory. Both <b>subscales</b> appeared to <b>be</b> sensitive to change in treatment and discriminated between agoraphobic patients and normal controls. Construct validity of the negative <b>subscale</b> <b>was</b> satisfactory, whilst additional validation of the positive <b>subscale</b> <b>is</b> required. Findings also revealed that positive thinking may serve as a coping device and that the occurrence of negative self-statements might be considered a sine qua non for the occurrence of positive self-statements. It is concluded that the ASQ can contribute to the understanding of cognitive processes during treatment of agoraphobia. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Background: Reliable {{and valid}} scale {{measures}} of barriers to condom use {{are not available}} for young black {{men who have sex}} with men (YBMSM). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Condom Barriers Scales for application with YBMSM. Methods: A clinic-based sample of 600 YBMSM completed a computer-assisted self-interview. The primary measure was a 14 -item abbreviated version of the Condom Barriers Scale. Reliability and criterion validity were assessed. Results: All 3 <b>subscales</b> <b>were</b> reliable: partner-related barriers (Cronbach [alpha]= 0. 73), sensation-related barriers ([alpha]= 0. 70), and motivation-related barriers ([alpha] = 0. 81). A complete absence of barriers was common: 47. 0 % (partner-related), 30. 7 % (sensation-related), and 46. 5 % (motivation-related). Dichotomized <b>subscales</b> <b>were</b> significantly associated with reporting any condomless insertive anal sex (all Ps < 0. 001) and any condomless receptive anal sex (all Ps < 0. 001). The <b>subscales</b> <b>were</b> significantly associated with these measures of condomless sex preserved at a continuous level (all Ps < 0. 001, except for sensation barriers associated with condomless receptive anal sex = 0. 03). Further, the <b>subscales</b> <b>were</b> significantly associated with reporting any condom use problems (all Ps < 0. 001) and a measure of condomless oral sex (all Ps < 0. 001, except for partner-related barriers= 0. 31). Finally, the sensation-related barriers subscale was significantly associated with testing positive for Chlamydia and/or gonorrhea (P= 0. 049). Conclusions: The 3 identified subscales yielded adequate reliability and strong evidence of validity, thereby suggesting the utility of these brief measures for use in observational and experimental research with YBMSM...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the psychometric properties of the items concerning sexual functioning of the Gynaecologic Leiden Questionnaire (LQ), which consists of items for post operative morbidity for women with cancer. METHODS: The total study sample consisted of 198 subjects: 66 patients treated for cervical cancer, 66 patients with sexual complaints and 66 subjects from the general population. RESULTS: By means of factor analysis three <b>subscales</b> <b>were</b> derived: Female Sexual Complaints, Female Sexual Function and Female Orgasm. The reliability of the subscales appeared to be satisfactory. The scores on the three subscales differentiated well between the patients treated for cervical cancer, patients with sexual complaints and the subjects from the general population.

Prevalence of SANS items and <b>subscales</b> <b>were</b> tabulated across all psychotic diagnoses, and logistic regression analysis determined which items and <b>subscales</b> <b>were</b> predictive of schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses. SANS items were most prevalent in schizophrenia spectrum conditions but frequently presented in other FEP diagnoses, particularly substance induced psychotic disorder and Major Depressive Disorder.

40|$|A {{reliable}} and valid questionnaire has been developed to measure the satisfaction of participants with service offered at mammography screening programmes. The questionnaire measures five specific aspects: convenience and accessibility, staffs' interpersonal skills, information transfer between staff and client, physical surroundings and perceived technical competence of staff. A general satisfaction dimension was also included. Systematic procedures were followed {{to ensure that the}} initial pool of items met the criteria for satisfactory content validity. These procedures included extensive literature review and interviews with participants and service providers. Discriminant validity was assessed by a modified Q-sort procedure, where eight expert judges sorted items into relevant dimensions. The sample for other validity and reliability testing consisted of 584 women who were participants at a breast X-ray programme in Melbourne, Australia. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by considering the correlation of the sum of the subscale scores for each respondent with their score on the general subscale (r = 0. 76; P < 0. 001). Multiple regression was used to provide further evidence for the discriminant validity of the proposed subscales and support for the multidimensional conceptualism of satisfaction. Scores on the general satisfaction <b>subscale</b> <b>were</b> used as an outcome variable and other <b>subscale</b> scores <b>were</b> predictor variables. All subscale scores significantly contributed to the prediction of satisfaction, over and above that of other subscales (R 2 = 0. 59). This indicates that these <b>subscales</b> <b>are</b> measuring distinct dimensions of satisfaction. Cronbach's alpha of each <b>subscale</b> <b>was</b> over 0. 50, indicating that the <b>subscales</b> <b>are</b> reliable.

40|$|Considerable research, {{ranging from}} survey to {{clinical}} to genetic, has utilized traditional measures of tobacco dependence, {{such as the}} Fagerström Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (4 th ed.) (DSM-IV) criteria, that focus on endpoint definitions of tobacco dependence such as heavy smoking, time to first cigarette in the morning, and smoking despite consequences. In an effort to better understand possible theories and mechanisms underlying tobacco dependence, {{which could be used}} to improve treatment and research, two multidimensional measures of tobacco dependence have been developed: the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS) and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM). This research used data from three randomized smoking cessation trials to examine the internal consistency and validity (convergent, concurrent and predictive) of these scales, relative to each other and the traditional measures. Results reveal that NDSS and WISDM <b>subscales</b> <b>are</b> related to important dependence criteria, but in a heterogeneous fashion. The data suggest that there are important underlying mechanisms or motives that are significantly related to different important outcomes, such as withdrawal and cessation. The FTND was most strongly related to abstinence at 1 week and 6 months post-quit, whereas the WISDM Tolerance <b>subscale</b> <b>was</b> most strongly related to abstinence at the end of treatment.
