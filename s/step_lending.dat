40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the role of}} the airway epithelial cell in mediating virus-induced inflammation, we infected primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells with human influenza type A/Port Chalmers/ 72 (H 3 N 2). After two days, the medium was collected for measurement of the chemstactic cytokine interleukin- 8 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The RNA was extracted from the cells for analysis of interleukin- 8 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Interleukin- 8 production was more than doubled by viral infection, while interleukin- 8 mRNA was increased four-folsd. Thus induction or interleukin- 8 gene expression in virus-infected airway epithelium may be an important early <b>step</b> <b>lending</b> to virus-induced airway inflammation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} output feedback {{stabilization of}} fully actuated rigid-body attitude dynamics {{in the presence}} of unknown point-wise time-delay in the input torque. Specifically, rate-gyros are unavailable here and only the attitude state represented by the unit quaternion is assumed to be measured. In the absence of time-delay, {{it is well known that}} linear asymptotically stabilizing control laws can be derived for this problem using the passivity properties of the system. The presence of unknown time-delay in the measured variables, however, imposes formidable technical challenges for the output-feedback attitude stabilization problem on hand. One of the central difficulties stems from the availability of only a weak Lyapunov-like function for the passivity based dynamic output feedback controller in the absence of delay. This obstacle is circumvented in this paper by a novel process of partially strictifying the underlying weak Lyapunov-like function. This <b>step</b> <b>lends</b> itself very nicely toward the subsequent definition of a Lyapunov-Krasovskii type functional when unknown time-delay is introduced within the feedback. The paper concludes with a closed-loop stability analysis that includes a rigorous characterization for the region of attraction as a function of the initial angular speed and the magnitude of the time-delay...|$|R
40|$|There is much {{common ground}} between {{the areas of}} coding theory and systems theory. Fitzpatrick has shown that a Göbner basis {{approach}} leads to efficient algorithms in the decoding of Reed-Solomon codes and in scalar interpolation and partial realization. This thesis simultaneously generalizes and simplifies that approach and presents applications to discrete-time modeling, multivariable interpolation and list decoding. Gröbner basis theory has come into its own {{in the context of}} software and algorithm development. By generalizing the concept of polynomial degree, term orders are provided for multivariable polynomial rings and free modules over polynomial rings. The orders are not, in general, unique and this adds, in no small way, to the power and flexibility of the technique. As well as being generating sets for ideals or modules, Gröbner bases always contain a element which is minimal with respect tot the corresponding term order. Central to this thesis is a general algorithm, valid for any term order, that produces a Gröbner basis for the solution module (or ideal) of elements satisfying a sequence of generalized congruences. These congruences, based on shifts and homomorphisms, are applicable {{to a wide variety of}} problems, including key equations and interpolations. At the core of the algorithm is an incremental step. Iterating this <b>step</b> <b>lends</b> a recursive/iterative character to the algorithm. As a consequence, not all of the input to the algorithm need be available from the start and different "paths" can be taken to reach the final solution.

40|$|Measuring {{variations}} in efficiency and its extension, eco-efficiency, during a restructuring period in different industries {{has always been}} a point of interest for regulators and policy makers. This paper assesses the impacts of restructuring of procurement in the Iranian power industry on the performance of power plants. We introduce a new slacks-based model for Malmquist-Luenberger (ML) Index measurement and apply it to the power plants to calculate the efficiency, eco-efficiency, and technological changes over the 8 -year period (2003 - 2010) of restructuring in the power industry. The results reveal that although the restructuring had different effects on the individual power plants, the overall growth in the eco-efficiency of the sector was mainly due to advances in pure technology. We also assess the correlation between efficiency and eco-efficiency of the power plants, which indicates a close relationship between these two <b>steps,</b> thus <b>lending</b> support to the incorporation of environmental factors in efficiency analysis...|$|R

40|$|Ciliates are {{a type of}} {{unicellular}} {{eukaryotic organism}} that has two types of nuclei within each cell; one is called the macronucleus (MAC) {{and the other is}} known as the micronucleus (MIC). During mating, ciliates exchange their MIC, destroy their own MAC, and create a new MAC from the genetic material of their new MIC. The process of developing a new MAC from the exchanged new MIC is known as gene assembly in ciliates, and it consists of a massive amount of DNA excision from the micronucleus, and the rearrangement {{of the rest of the}} DNA sequences. During the gene assembly process, the DNA segments that get eliminated are known as internal eliminated segments (IESs), and the remaining DNA segments that are rearranged in an order that is correct for creating proteins, are called macronuclear destined segments (MDSs). A topic of interest is to predict the correct order to descramble a gene or chromosomal segment. A prediction can be made based on the principle of parsimony, whereby the smallest sequence of operations is likely close to the actual number of operations that occurred. Interestingly, the order of MDSs in the newly assembled 22, 354 Oxytricha trifallax MIC chromosome fragments provides evidence that multiple parallel recombinations occur, where the structure of the chromosomes allows for interleaving between two sections of the developing macronuclear chromosome in a manner that can be captured with a common string operation called the shuffle operation (the shuffle operation on two strings results in a new string by weaving together the first two, while preserving the order within each string). Thus, we studied four similar systems involving applications of shuffle to see how the minimum number of operations needed to assemble differs between the types. Two algorithms for each of the first two systems have been implemented that are both shown to be optimal. And, for the third and fourth systems, four and two heuristic algorithms, respectively, have been implemented. The results from these algorithms revealed that, in most cases, the third system gives the minimum number of applications of shuffle to descramble, but whether the best implemented algorithm for the third system is optimal or not remains an open question. The best implemented algorithm for the third system showed that 96. 63 % of the scrambled micronuclear chromosome fragments of Oxytricha trifallax can be descrambled by only 1 or 2 applications of shuffle. This small number of <b>steps</b> <b>lends</b> theoretical evidence that some structural component is enforcing an alignment of segments in a shuffle-like fashion, and then parallel recombination is taking place to enable MDS rearrangement and IES elimination. Another problem of interest is to classify segments of the MIC into MDSs and IESs; this is the second topic of the thesis, and is a matter of determining the right "class label", i. e. MDS or IES, on each nucleotide. Thus, training data of labelled input sequences was used with hidden Markov models (HMMs), which is a well-known supervised machine learning classification algorithm. HMMs of first-, second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-order have been implemented. The accuracy of the classification was verified through 10 -fold cross validation. Results from this work show that an HMM is more likely to fail to accurately classify micronuclear chromosomes without having some additional knowledge...|$|R

Despite decades of pointillistic legal harmonization, cross border transactions within the Internal market of the European Union continue {{to take place in}} the shadow of divergent procedural and substantive law rules, differing legal cultures and significant linguistic diversities. Whilst national contract law systems function more or less efficiently internally, it is their partial non-compatibility with other Member States’ private laws that provokes isolated distortions on the market. As a consequence, the European Commission has presented its ‘Common Frame of Reference’ research strategy aimed at fostering common contract law principles, model rules and uniform legal terminology, which, it is believed, will better facilitate commercial actors.

The importance of the housing sector can be judged by the fact that we consider house as the best investment and want to invest our hard earned money or saving in a house. The need for Finance to purchase a house brought out specialized Housing Finance Institutions. The Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) as they are called today have <b>stepped</b> up their <b>lending</b> over the years contributing to the growth of the housing sector.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{research done}} {{to apply the}} Fractional Step Method to finite-element simulations of natural convective flows in pure liquids, permeable media, and in a directionally solidified metal alloy casting. The Fractional Step Method has been applied commonly to high Reynold's number flow simulations, but is less common for low Reynold's number flows, such as natural convection in liquids and in permeable media. The Fractional Step Method offers increased speed and reduced memory requirements by allowing non-coupled solution of the pressure and the velocity components. The Fractional Step Method has particular benefits for predicting flows in a directionally solidified alloy, since other methods presently employed are not very efficient. Previously, the most suitable method for predicting flows in a directionally solidified binary alloy was the penalty method. The penalty method requires direct matrix solvers, due to the penalty term. The Fractional Step Method allows iterative solution of the finite element stiffness matrices, thereby allowing more efficient solution of the matrices. The Fractional <b>Step</b> Method also <b>lends</b> itself to parallel processing, since the velocity component stiffness matrices can be built and solved independently of each other. The finite-element simulations of a directionally solidified casting are used to predict macrosegregation in directionally solidified castings. In particular, the finite-element simulations predict the existence of 'channels' within the processing mushy zone and subsequently 'freckles' within the fully processed solid, which are known to result from macrosegregation, or what {{is often referred to}} as thermo-solutal convection. These freckles cause material property non-uniformities in directionally solidified castings; therefore many of these castings are scrapped. The phenomenon of natural convection in an alloy under-going directional solidification, or thermo-solutal convection, will be explained. The development of the momentum and continuity equations for natural convection in a fluid, a permeable medium, and in a binary alloy undergoing directional solidification will be presented. Finally, results for natural convection in a pure liquid, natural convection in a medium with a constant permeability, and for directional solidification will be presented...|$|R

In such circumstances joint liability institutions, <b>step</b> in to <b>lend</b> to groups of people and where the entire group is considered responsible for default by any one member. In places where group lending has been practiced there have been mixed results with some enterprises growing and repaying their loans while others did not. This study therefore sought to analyze the effects of group liability on the performance of MSEs in Nairobi, Uhuru market. This is because the market is located in the largest and fast growing urban town, therefore providing an appropriate population for the study. The objectives of the study were to establish whether adverse selection and moral hazards affect performance of MSEs in Nairobi Uhuru market, to determine the effect of cost state verification on the performance of MSEs in Nairobi Uhuru Market and to explore the relationship between enforcement of laws on loans and performance of MSE‘s in Nairobi Uhuru Market. This study used both primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected using questionnaires which were administered using drop and pick later method while secondary data was obtained from MSEs strategic plans, newspapers, in-house journals, electronic journals and other internet sources. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and represented by measures of central tendency, that is mean and standard deviation. Descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation were used to measure effect of group liability lending on performance of MSEs. Inferential statistics such as the as spearman correlation coefficients and ANOVA were computed to explain and allow for drawing of conclusions.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study of the supply of financial services to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). A major objective of the study is to document the experiences of providers of financial services to SMEs worldwide, with particular emphasis on identifying innovative business models that can generate financial and social returns. The methodology employed follows the ‘value chain’ approach in that investment processes are analysed and factors facilitating or constraining the fluidity of the chain are identified. The underlying barriers to financing SMEs in Africa can be classified into four types related to: (1) risks involved; (2) institutional development; (3) policy and regulatory frameworks; and (4) skills and training needs. Particular difficulties’ in the fisheries sector include: Information Asymmetry i. e. promoters lack business acumen to fully articulate their ventures to funders; but financiers lack expertise in appraising fisheries projects. Establishing a venture fund is challenging and lengthy; as is accessing local capital. Limited incubation and lack of project preparation facilities that assist fisheries and aquaculture entrepreneurs to develop their ideas into bankable deals limit the pool from which investors can mine potential fisheries and aquaculture investments. Global financiers in SMEs are currently implementing innovative financial models for sustainable enterprises. One key characteristic of investment funds specialising in SMEs in Africa is that they combine investment funds with business development funds in order to ensure the economic growth of SMEs as well as the likelihood of prompt loan repayment. Innovative financial models for SMEs seek to fill the gap between traditional banking and grant-based donor finance. Hybrid business models that can leverage the best aspects of philanthropy and business can help build sustainable, scalable enterprises. The delivery of investment and business development for SMEs can be done directly or through intermediaries. Other forms of innovation include utilizing SME purchase agreements as collateral; specialised financial intermediaries and multilateral agencies acting as co-lenders and risk-sharing of loans to SMEs; and industry partners assisting to develop the economic growth of SMEs and ensuring market access. Lending institutions and investment funds by and large follow a process which can be likened to that of a value chain. The importance of identifying key <b>steps</b> in the <b>lending</b> or investment process and the associated facilitating or constraining factors becomes evident when dealing with SMEs particularly in Africa. Lending institutions, Credit Guarantee Schemes (CGSs) and Private Equity Funds (PEFs) follow pre-determined cycles. This is highlighted in the cases studies in the report. Numerous challenges in finance for SMEs exist. Bureaucracy, actual or perceived, and a lack of awareness about SMEs have been identified as serious barriers to the successful reaching of SMEs. Existing relations are crucial to the lending relationship between SMEs and local financial intermediaries, especially when new products are introduced or for speedy approvals. Appropriate monitoring and performance measurement metrics, which are important in a social business model such as a Fund for SMEs in the fisheries sector are lacking. Country-specific legal regulations are cumbersome for regional funds. In a rapidly changing environment, maintaining the alignment of stakeholders’ interests is critical. Business development support from a group of talented management professionals with knowledge of financial accountability, operations, and international/national markets in the fisheries sector – in order to serve as advisors and talent-enablers to SMEs is crucial. Financial returns and exact exit structure are rarely known or guaranteed. Key interventions to help increase financial access by companies in the sector include: (1) Exit strategies; (2) Incubation facilities; (3) Business Angels; (4) Funds of funds; and (5) Policy and regulatory reforms. The key intervention is to promote financial market growth in Africa to address exit strategy challenges such as small African capital exchanges, Restriction on Listing of Foreign Companies, Share Buyback Restriction and Inadequate Double Taxation Agreements. The business incubation sphere in Africa is very young and underdeveloped compared to other developing countries in the world. SMEs in Africa can also benefit from the formation of business angel networks in combination with the establishment of incubators and investment funds. Amendments to stringent policies that hinder access to key sources of local capital in Africa today are essential e. g. restrictions on illiquid investments by pension funds and insurance companies, which can serve as investment vehicles targeting SMEs...|$|R
