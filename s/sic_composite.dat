The metal-like conductance of ZrB2 allows for its conductivity to decrease with increasing temperature, preventing uncontrollable electrical discharge while maintaining high operational upper bounds for operation. It was also found that through incorporation of 40% ZrB2 flexural strength was reduced from 500 MPa and 359 MPa in SiC and ZrB2 single crystals to 212.96 MPa, with flexural strength highly correlated to the size of grains in the annealed ceramic material.
