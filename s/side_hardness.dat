40|$|The {{identification}} of traditionally underutilized species {{with the potential}} for development and increased marketing potential has been recognized as a source of potential innovation in the Northwestern Ontario forest sector. However, the industry requires improved knowledge of the physical and mechanical properties of these species and how this information can be applied to end use attributes in value added forest products. Black ash (Fraxinus nigra Marsh.) is abundant throughout the region, yet has been identified as an underutilized species with limited available literature on properties or potential variations. Nine mature black ash trees from the Thunder Bay Seed Zone were destructively sampled and wood properties in differing radial and longitudinal positions were measured and recorded. Longitudinal positions reflect 0, 25, 50 and 75 percent of total merchantable height. Radial positions reflect the juvenile wood core, transition zone and mature wood of each stem. Measured wood properties include MOE, MOR, compression parallel to the grain, Janka ball <b>side</b> <b>hardness,</b> relative density, ring width, latewood percentage and average ring density. Results indicate stable and predictable wood properties in the radial direction with only percentage of latewood varying significantly radially. Longitudinal position reflected increased variance with MOE, compression parallel to the grain, <b>side</b> <b>hardness</b> and ring width displaying significant results. The greatest level of variability was observed between sites in each of the selected properties. Results consistently displayed two subsets of sites; reflecting the second and third sites, or three distinct sites. Increased mechanical property values were identified in the upland and well-drained sites as compared to the lowland site. In the future, benefits exist for increased processing potential, as inherent properties are consistent throughout the tree including the desirable heartwood section. It was determined that site conditions {{play a significant role in}} the inherent wood properties and opportunities exist for forest managers to predict mechanical properties based on site characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Heat-treated wood is a {{credible}} alternative for {{certain kinds of}} tropical timber. It is also an alternative for certain polluting wood preservatives. This study aims to determine the changes in physico-mechanical properties and durability of wood that is subjected to heat treatment. For this, we studied five species (oak, ash, natural beech and a variant known as steamed beech, poplar, Douglas-fir). For each species, we had fifteen reference samples and fifteen corresponding treated samples. The results show {{a decrease in the}} hygroscopicity and an increase in dimensional stability of heat-treated wood in relation to the degradation of hemicelluloses. The mechanical properties are influence variously, because heat-treated wood is stiffer but also more brittle. The modulus of elasticity increases slightly after treatment. <b>Side</b> <b>hardness</b> and compressive fracture of heat-treated wood may increase up to 30 %. On the other hand, the modulus of rupture, the ability to slit and impact may decrease by 50 %, 60 % and 70 %. The durability of heat-treated wood against wood-destroying fungi increases. However, within each species, the durability increase varies greatly. Additional tests conducted to understand this variability, suggests that the heat distribution is not homogeneous within the processing unit. Moreover, our work suggests that durability is related to the fixed carbon content and that this path would be interesting to explore in the future...|$|E

30|$|Large-area {{polycrystalline}} diamond (PCD) coatings {{are important}} for fields such as thermal management, optical windows, tribological moving mechanical assemblies, harsh chemical environments, biological sensors, etc. Microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) is a standard technique to grow high-quality PCD films over large area due {{to the absence of}} contact between the reactive species and the filament or the chamber wall. However, the existence of temperature gradients during growth may compromise the desired uniformity of the final diamond coatings. In the present work, a thick PCD coating was deposited on a 100 -mm silicon substrate inside a 915 -MHz reactor; the temperature gradient resulted in a non-uniform diamond coating. An attempt was made to relate the local temperature variation during deposition and the different properties of the final coating. It was found that there was large instability inside the system, in terms of substrate temperature (as high as ΔT = 212 °C), that resulted in a large dispersion of the diamond coating’s final properties: residual stress (∼ 15.8 GPa to + 6.2 GPa), surface morphology (octahedral pyramids with (111) planes to cubo-octahedrals with (100) flat top surfaces), thickness (190 μm to 245 μm), columnar growth of diamond (with appearance of variety of nanostructures), nucleation <b>side</b> <b>hardness</b> (17 GPa to 48 GPa), quality (Raman peak FWHM varying from 5.1 cm− 1 to 12.4 cm− 1 with occasional splitting).

40|$|Creating quality {{tolerant}} hardwood stands through intensive silviculture and mapping {{their properties}} {{is considered a}} means for optimizing the value chain in Northeastern Ontario. A comprehensive literature review was conducted concerning the growth, morphology and factors influencing end merchantability of diffuse porous hardwoods, which commonly grow in Northeastern Canada and North America. It was seen {{that there was a}} gap in the literature concerning the effects varying degrees of density management have on the internal properties of the growing stock occurring on site. The literature did, however, provide a knowledge base from which to evolve. Based on the current gaps in the literature, mapping of the internal properties associated with density management of yellow birch was conducted from a research site 30 kilometers Northwest of Thessalon, Ontario in the Algoma Forest District. Density management associated with the specific research site reflect releasing trees to 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % of tree height at time of treatment, since the trees were on average 10 m high the treatments consist of releasing plus trees to one, two, three and four m, respectively. Destructive testing was performed on 15 yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton) trees from the thinning trial located in the Northern regions of the Great Lakes St Lawrence forest zone. The results showed that the thinning treatments applied had a significant effect on the internal wood properties of the yellow birch growing on site. The greatest variability was not between treatments but axially throughout the trees. Janka Ball <b>side</b> <b>hardness</b> values attained from the test specimens were on average 24 % higher than published values. Modulus of Elasticity (MOE) and Modulus of Rupture (MOR) values attained were 15 % and 15 % lower than the published values, respectively.

The values for the microscopic attributes (fibers and vessels) displayed no difference between treatments and followed published trends associated with morphological changes in the trees. It was observed that the properties do not follow any discernable pattern associated with the intensity of crop tree thinning intensity.

Microstructures, microhardness, and fractured surfaces were analyzed for three different rpms and mm·min− 1 with Ti- 6242 SG and Ti- 54 M {{kept on the}} advancing and retreating side, respectively. While constant traverse speed (varying rotation speed) has no significant effect on micrographic patterns in weld nugget, constant rotation speed (with increasing traverse speed) results in {{an increasing number of}} streaks with specified spacing (advances per revolution) (consisting of material migrating from retreating side) on the advancing <b>side.</b> Although, <b>hardness</b> variation within streaks (due to lower values of v ω; where v   and   ω are traverse and rotation speed) were challenging to evaluate, yet hardness maps imitated the micrographic morphology of the weld nugget.

Fractured surfaces revealed an appearance of a combination of transcrystalline and intercrystalline fracture for all the processing parameters.

Electromigration and thermomigration {{are considered to be}} major road blocks leading to realisation of nanoelectronics and SiC based high temperature power electronics. In this paper, damage mechanics of 95. 5 Sn 4 Ag 0. 5 Cu (SAC 405) lead-free solder joints under high temperature gradients have been studied. This paper presents observations on samples which were subjected to 1000 °C/cm thermal gradient for two hours, 286 hours, 712 hours and 1156 hours. It was observed that samples subjected to thermal gradient did not develop a Cu 3 Sn intermetallic compound (IMC) layer at the hot side due to Cu migration to the cold side thus causing insufficient Cu mass concentration to form Cu 3 Sn.

We are {{particularly interested in the}} well-known Random Serial Dictatorship mechanism. For dichotomous preferences, we first show that truthful, symmetric and optimal mechanisms exist if intractable mechanisms are allowed. We then provide a connection to online bipartite matching. Using this connection, it is possible to design truthful, symmetric and tractable mechanisms that extract 0. 69 of the maximum social welfare, which works under assumption that agents are not adversarial. Without this assumption, we show that Random Serial Dictatorship always returns an assignment in which the expected social welfare is at least a third of the maximum social welfare. For normalized von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences, we show that Random Serial Dictatorship always returns an assignment in which the expected social welfare is at least 1 /eν() ^ 2 /n, where ν() is the maximum social welfare and n is the number of both agents and items.

Recently, Feldman et al. gave an algorithm that achieves 0. 6702 competitive ratio, thus breaking through the 1 − 1 /e barrier. One of the questions left open in their work is to obtain a better competitive ratio by generalizing their two suggested matchings (TSM) algorithm to d-suggested matchings (d-SM). We show that the best competitive ratio that can be obtained with the static analysis used in the d-SM algorithm is upper bounded by 0. 76, even for the special case of d-regular graphs, thus suggesting that a dynamic analysis {{may be needed to}} improve the competitive ratio significantly. We make the first step in this direction by showing that the RANDOM algorithm, which assigns an impression to a randomly chosen eligible advertiser, achieves 1 − e −d d d /d! = 1 − O(1 / √ d) competitive ratio for d-regular graphs, which converges to 1 as d increases.

40|$|Recycling {{has proven}} {{not only to}} address today’s economical, {{environmental}} and social issues, but also to be imperative for the sustainability of human technology. The current thesis has investigated the feasibility of a new philosophy for Recycling (Alloying-Recycling) using steel 1020 and aluminum 6061 T 6. The {{study was limited to}} the metallurgical aspects only and has highlighted the potential of recycled alloys made of recycled aluminum and steel to exhibit substantially increased wear resistance and strength-to-weight ratio as compared to initial primary materials. Three alloy-mixtures are considered: TN 3 (5 wt% 1020 + 95 wt% 6061 T 6); TN 5 (0. 7 wt% 1020 + 99. 3 wt% 6061 T 6); and TN 4 (10 wt% 6061 T 6 + 90 wt% 1020). A Tucker induction power supply system (3 kW; 135 - 400 kHz) is used to melt the alloy mixtures for casting in graphite crucibles. Heat treatment of the cast samples is done using a radiation box furnace. Microscopy, Vickers hardness and pin-on-disc abrasive wear tests are performed. Casting destroyed the initial microstructures of the alloys leading to a hardness reduction in the as-cast and solution heat-treated aluminum rich samples to 60 Hv from 140 Hv. Ageing slightly increased the hardness of the cast samples and provided a wear resistance two times higher than that of the initial 6061 T 6 material. On the steel rich <b>side,</b> the <b>hardness</b> of the as-cast TN 4 was 480 Hv, which is more than twice as high as the initial hardness of steel 1020 of 202 Hv; this hints to strong internal and residual stress, probably martensite formation during fast cooling following casting. Solution heat treatment lowered the hardness to the original value of steel 1020, but provided about ten (10) times higher wear resistance; this suggests higher ductility and toughness of normalised TN 4 as compared to 1020. In addition, TN 4 exhibits about 25 % weight reduction as compared to 1020. The actual recycling process and the effect of non-metallic impurities shall be investigated in future works.

However, the literature contains very little guidance on which combinations of parameters can or cannot be exploited algorithmically. Our goal is to systematically investigate the possible parameterized algorithms that can exist for Subgraph Isomorphism.

Constant-factor approximation has been also known for submodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint (a factor of 0. 309 [33]) and for submodular maximization subject to a matroid base constraint, provided that the fractional base packing number ν is bounded away from 1 (a 1 / 4 -approximation assuming that ν ≥ 2 [33]). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for submodular maximization {{which is based on}} the idea of simulated annealing.

Even for the special case of cardinality constraint, we prove it is impossible to achieve a 0. 491 -approximation.

In this paper, we study a geometric version of this problem, called Gen-RBSC-lines, where the elements are points in the plane and sets are defined by lines. We study this problem for an array of parameters, namely, k_ℓ, k_r, r, b, and ℓ, and all possible combinations of them.

40|$|In this paper, we {{explicitly}} {{study the}} online vertex cover problem, {{which is a}} natural generalization of the well-studied ski-rental problem. In the online vertex cover problem, we are required to maintain a monotone vertex cover in a graph whose vertices arrive online. When a vertex arrives, all its incident edges to previously arrived vertices are revealed to the algorithm. For bipartite graphs with the left vertices offline (i. e. all of the left vertices arrive first before any right vertex), there are algorithms achieving the optimal competitive ratio of 1 / 1 - 1 /e≈ 1. 582. Our first result is a new optimal water-filling algorithm for this case. One major ingredient of our result is a new charging-based analysis, which can be generalized to attack the online fractional vertex cover problem in general graphs. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} a 1. 901 -competitive algorithm for this problem. When the underlying graph is bipartite, our fractional solution can be rounded to an integral solution. In other words, we can obtain a vertex cover with expected size at most 1. 901 of the optimal vertex cover in bipartite graphs. The next major result is a primal-dual analysis of our algorithm for the online fractional vertex cover problem in general graphs, which implies the dual result of a 0. 526 -competitive algorithm for online fractional matching in general graphs. Notice that both problems admit a well-known 2 -competitive greedy algorithm. Our result in this paper is the first successful attempt to beat the greedy algorithm for these two problems. On the <b>hardness</b> <b>side,</b> we show that no randomized online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than 1. 753 and 0. 625 for the online fractional vertex cover problem and the online fractional matching problem respectively, even for bipartite graphs.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a population of}} n agents which {{communicate with each other}} in a decentralized manner, through random pairwise interactions. One or more agents in the population may act as authoritative sources of information, and the objective of the remaining agents is to obtain information from or about these source agents. We study two basic tasks: broadcasting, in which the agents are to learn the bit-state of an authoritative source which is present in the population, and source detection, in which the agents are required to decide if at least one source agent is present in the population or not. We focus on designing protocols which meet two natural conditions: (1) universality, i. e., independence of population size, and (2) rapid convergence to a correct global state after a reconfiguration, such as a change in the state of a source agent. Our main positive result is to show that both of these constraints can be met. For both the broadcasting problem and the source detection problem, we obtain solutions with a convergence time of O(^ 2 n) rounds, w. h. p., from any starting configuration. The solution to broadcasting is exact, which means that all agents reach the state broadcast by the source, while the solution to source detection admits one-sided error on a ε-fraction of the population (which is unavoidable for this problem). Both protocols are easy to implement in practice and have a compact formulation. Our protocols exploit the properties of self-organizing oscillatory dynamics. On the <b>hardness</b> <b>side,</b> our main structural insight is to prove that any protocol which meets the constraints of universality and of rapid convergence after reconfiguration must display a form of non-stationary behavior (of which oscillatory dynamics are an example). We also observe that the periodicity of the oscillatory behavior of the protocol, when present, must necessarily depend on the number ^...|$|R
40|$|We study an {{algorithm}} for approximating {{the multivariate}} independence polynomial Z(z), with negative and complex arguments, {{an object that}} has strong connections to combinatorics and to statistical physics. In particular, the independence polynomial with negative arguments, Z(-p), determines the Shearer region, the maximal region of probabilities to which the Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL) can be extended (Shearer 1985). In statistical physics, complex zeros of the independence polynomial relate to existence of phase transitions. Our main result is a deterministic algorithm to compute approximately the independence polynomial in any root-free complex polydisc centered at the origin. Our algorithm {{is essentially the same}} as Weitz's algorithm for positive parameters up to the tree uniqueness threshold, and the core of our analysis is a novel multivariate form of the correlation decay technique, which can handle non-uniform complex parameters. In particular, in the univariate real setting our work implies that Weitz's algorithm works in an interval between two critical points (λ'_c(d), λ_c(d)), and outside of this interval an approximation of Z(z) is known to be NP-hard. As an application, we give a sub-exponential time algorithm for testing approximate membership in the Shearer region. We also give a new rounding based deterministic algorithm for Shearer's lemma (an extension of the LLL), which, however, runs in sub-exponential time. On the <b>hardness</b> <b>side,</b> we prove that evaluating Z(z) at an arbitrary point in Shearer's region, and testing membership in Shearer's region, are #P-hard problems. We also establish the best possible dependence of the exponent of the run time of Weitz's correlation decay technique in the negative regime on the distance to the boundary of the Shearer region.

40|$|The classic stable set problem asks to find {{a maximum}} {{cardinality}} set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices in an undirected graph G. This problem is NP-hard to approximate with factor n^{ 1 -epsilon} for any constant epsilon> 0 [Hastad/Acta Mathematica/ 1996; Zuckerman/STOC/ 2006], where n {{is the number of}} vertices, and therefore there is no hope for good approximations in the general case. We study the stable set problem when restricted to graphs with bounded odd cycle packing number ocp(G), possibly by a function of n. This is the largest number of vertex-disjoint odd cycles in G. Equivalently, it is the logarithm of the largest absolute value of a sub-determinant of the edge-node incidence matrix A_G of G. Hence, if A_G is totally unimodular, then ocp(G) = 0. Therefore, ocp(G) is a natural distance measure of A_G to the set of totally unimodular matrices on a scale from 1 to n/ 3. When ocp(G) = 0, the graph is bipartite and {{it is well known that}} stable set can be solved in polynomial time. Our results imply that the odd cycle packing number indeed strongly influences the approximability of stable set. More precisely, we obtain a polynomial-time approximation scheme for graphs with ocp(G) =o(n/log(n)), and an alpha-approximation algorithm for any graph where alpha smoothly increases from a constant to n as ocp(G) grows from O(n/log(n)) to n/ 3. On the <b>hardness</b> <b>side,</b> we show that, assuming the exponential-time hypothesis, stable set cannot be solved in polynomial time if ocp(G) =Omega(log^{ 1 +epsilon}(n)) for some epsilon> 0. Finally, we generalize a theorem by Györi et al. [Györi et al. /Discrete Mathematics/ 1997] and show that graphs without odd cycles of small weight can be made bipartite by removing a small number of vertices. This allows us to extend some of our above results to the weighted stable set problem...|$|R
40|$|Selling {{reserved}} instances (or virtual machines) is a {{basic service}} in cloud computing. In this paper, we consider a more flexible pricing model for instance reservation, in which a customer can propose the time length and number of resources of her request, while in today's industry, customers can only choose from several predefined reservation packages. Under this model, we design randomized mechanisms for customers coming online to optimize social welfare and providers' revenue. We first consider a simple case, where the requests from the customers do not vary too much {{in terms of both}} length and value density. We design a randomized mechanism that achieves a competitive ratio 1 / 42 for both social welfare and revenue, which is a improvement as there is usually no revenue guarantee in previous works such as azar 2015 ec,wang 2015 selling. This ratio can be improved up to 1 / 11 when we impose a realistic constraint on the maximum number of resources used by each request. On the <b>hardness</b> <b>side,</b> we show an upper bound 1 / 3 on competitive ratio for any randomized mechanism. We then extend our mechanism to the general case and achieve a competitive ratio 1 / 42 k T for both social welfare and revenue, where T is the ratio of the maximum request length to the minimum request length and k is the ratio of the maximum request value density to the minimum request value density. This result outperforms the previous upper bound 1 /CkT for deterministic mechanisms wang 2015 selling. We also prove an upper bound 2 / 8 kT for any randomized mechanism. All the mechanisms we provide are in a greedy style. They are truthful and easy to be integrated into practical cloud systems. Comment: Already accepted by AAAI' 1...|$|R
40|$|Given two graphs H and G, the Subgraph Isomorphism problem asks if H is {{isomorphic}} to a subgraph of G. While NP-hard in general, algorithms {{exist for}} various parameterized {{versions of the}} problem: for example, the problem can be solved (1) in time 2 ^O(|V(H) |) · n^O((H)) using the color-coding technique of Alon, Yuster, and Zwick; (2) in time f(|V(H) |,(G)) · n using Courcelle's Theorem; (3) in time f(|V(H) |,(G)) · n using a result on first-order model checking by Frick and Grohe; or (4) in time f((H)) · n^O((G)) for connected H using the algorithm of Matoušek and Thomas. Already this small sample of results shows that the way an algorithm can depend on the parameters is highly nontrivial and subtle. We develop a framework involving 10 relevant parameters for each of H and G (such as treewidth, pathwidth, genus, maximum degree, number of vertices, number of components, etc.), and ask if an algorithm with running time f_ 1 (p_ 1,p_ 2, [...] ., p_ℓ) · n^f_ 2 (p_ℓ+ 1, [...] ., p_k) exist, where each of p_ 1, [...] ., p_k {{is one of the}} 10 parameters depending only on H or G. We show that all the questions arising in this framework are answered by a set of 11 maximal positive results (algorithms) and a set of 17 maximal negative results (hardness proofs); some of these results already appear in the literature, while others are new in this paper. On the algorithmic side, our study reveals for example that an unexpected combination of bounded degree, genus, and feedback vertex set number of G gives rise to a highly nontrivial algorithm for Subgraph Isomorphism. On the <b>hardness</b> <b>side,</b> we present W[1]-hardness proofs under extremely restricted conditions, such as when H is a bounded-degree tree of constant pathwidth and G is a planar graph of bounded pathwidth.

40|$|Ni-based {{superalloy}} weld overlays {{are widely}} used in electricity generating plants to significantly reduce high temperature corrosion problems of ferritic steel components under service conditions. Welding a nickel alloy similar to IN 625 onto the outer bore of a 2. 25 Cr 1 Mo steel tube enhances its service life as a superheater tube in the highly corrosive environment of a Waste-to-Energy boiler. For the purposes of studying the effects of high temperature service on the microstructure of this laid tube with a weld overly, a series of thermal exposure tests at 650 ˚C was performed for different times from 1 day up to 128 days. The microstructural evolution was studied {{using a combination of}} analytical techniques along with changes in hardness profile across the interface. Changes in the microstructure were examined using OM, SEM, EPMA, EBSD and FIB-STEM. Hardness survey results indicate significant changes in the interfacial region during ageing. Formation of a soft zone ~ 300 μm wide and its subsequent re-hardening was observed in the steel <b>side</b> while the <b>hardness</b> of the bulk steel remained unchanged. Development of a hard band ~ 30 μm wide adjacent to the interface in the weld overlay region and hardening of the bulk overlay material occurs {{in the early stages of}} ageing and remained unchanged with ageing time. Thermodynamic calculations were performed using Thermo-Calc software and TCFE 6 and TTNI 7 databases to aid interpretation of experimental data. Microstructural evolution in the steel region is related to the carbide transformation process and carbon migration. In the bulk of the steel tube, the bimodal microstructure is stable and in the tempered martensite/bainite areas, the initial M 3 C transform to M 23 C 6 through a series of metastable carbides while in the ferrite grains, M 2 C carbide precipitates and transforms directly to the equilibrium carbide. The main process for supply of carbon atoms is transformation of carbides and the rates of transformation are related to the as-welded microstructure. On the steel side of interfacial region where bainite was formed after welding, the stability of metastable carbides is related to the carbon content. Long term ageing causes Mo replenishment in the coexisting ferrite and fine grains have formed in this region following long term ageing. Experimental observations confirmed that a network of alloyed M 23 C 6 carbide precipitates was formed at the interface in the steel side which are believed to interrupt the carbon migration across the interface. Moreover, there is a carbide precipitation region within ~ 100 μm from the interface in the weld overlay. Beyond this region intermetallic phases like Mo-rich μ and Nb-rich δ were formed in the interdendritic regions and along the grain boundaries. Hard band formation is related to precipitation of the σ phase. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
