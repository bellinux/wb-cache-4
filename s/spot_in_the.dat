5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rotation. The number three <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rotation {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E
