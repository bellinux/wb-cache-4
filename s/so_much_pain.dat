25|$|It is both biochemically and {{medically}} {{interesting how}} tarantula hawk venom works. How can an essentially non-toxic venom that causes <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>pain,</b> described as blinding, debilitating, and shockingly electric by Schmidt, subside in only three minutes in humans? Only the bullet ant is ranked {{higher than the}} tarantula hawk’s sting on Schmidt’s Sting Pain Index. How does it permanently paralyze a tarantula, yet keep it alive? It is also evolutionarily interesting and significant how such a toxin evolved. Selection pressure by potential vertebrate predators would have favored individuals with painful venom components, but not vertebrate-lethal components. At the same time, selection pressure against venom lethality towards prey and subsequent loss of prey to spoilage would be very strong. The tarantula hawk’s venom is a specific, evolutionarily tailored cocktail of compounds best suited to the wasps’ needs. Studying tarantula hawk venom may help us gain insight into treating human problems like chronic pain from injury or disease.|$|E

Elizabeth and her hosts {{are invited}} to Rosings Park, the {{imposing}} home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, patroness of Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy's extremely wealthy aunt. She expects Mr. Darcy to marry her daughter. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting at Rosings Park. Colonel Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr. Darcy managed to save a friend from a bad match by convincing the friend of the lady's indifference. Elizabeth realizes the story must refer to Jane and is horrified that Darcy has interfered and caused her sister <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>pain.</b> Mr. Darcy, meanwhile, has {{fallen in love with}} Elizabeth and proposes to her. She rejects him angrily, stating that she could not love a man who has caused her sister such unhappiness and further accuses him of treating Mr. Wickham unjustly. The latter accusation seems to anger Mr. Darcy, and he accuses her family of wanting propriety and suggests he has been kinder to Bingley than himself. They part, barely speaking.|$|E

Most of the sentiments are understated, and Burshtein avoided having any of the characters break down or openly become angry when pressured. Yaron described a scene between Yochay and Rivka as her favorite, saying, [...] "I think it's because there is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> there; it touches you the most when people feel something and try to hide it and you see it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the prior film, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed {{off-screen}} in the film. Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved {{the issue with}} the statement that [...] "it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or Devon’s unwillingness to come back." [...] Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. [...] "When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific," [...] Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear [...] " [...] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> in her life.

[...] The lyrics contain direct {{references}} to Christianity, with Fantasia singing: [...] "Thank you for never leaving me Lord Jesus!". She continues to express her gratitude with the lyrics: [...] "You're the only one that never left me when everyone else just didn't care, you're the only one that really loved me. I made it.

500|$|Rapace {{described}} Shaw, an archaeologist, as {{a believer}} in God with a very strong faith, and said that, [...] "In {{the middle of the}} movie, things happen and she changes into more of a warrior. And in the end, she's such a survivor." [...] To aid her method acting, she developed a complete backstory for Shaw, and worked with a dialect coach to achieve a British accent. She also asked her make-up artist to apply extra blood and sweat during filming to more accurately portray her character. Rapace said, [...] "I was out there filming for about six months and it was super-intense, my body was in <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> sometimes but it was absolutely amazing." [...] She dismissed comparisons to the Alien franchise's Ellen Ripley. Rapace came to director Ridley Scott's attention for her performance as Lisbeth Salander in the 2009 drama film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She met Scott in August 2010, and by January 2011 she had secured the role. Actresses Anne Hathaway, Natalie Portman, Gemma Arterton, Carey Mulligan, and Abbie Cornish were all considered for the role during development. Lucy Hutchinson, who was eight years old in 2012, portrays Shaw as a child.|$|E

500|$|Greenwalt {{discusses}} how Cordelia [...] "is sort {{of forced}} {{to become a}} deeper character" [...] when she starts to receive the visions of the suffering and helpless, [...] "She's sort of living with {{one foot in the}} world of 'I want to be an actress' and with another foot in the world of 'I want to save and help people, and I have a deeper purpose and mission.'" [...] Greenwalt felt that this development allowed Cordelia to develop from a [...] "vainglorious high schooler to someone who's almost like a superhero"; this also provided Carpenter with the opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress. From the tenth episode, [...] "Parting Gifts", Cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in the series while the introduction of Wesley also contributes some added comic relief to the series. It is from this episode Cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns the death of Doyle, whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him. The first-season finale saw Cordelia's visions inflict all the suffering of the human world upon her, and to effectively act this, Carpenter's acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation. The scene took over eight hours to film, and Carpenter was relieved when it was over. The experience saw Cordelia further resolve to help those in need, stating [...] "I saw the world and there's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>pain.</b> We have to help them." [...] Carpenter explains, [...] "Through the suffering of the world, and through her own experiences, she discovers what's important in life." ...|$|E

According to Manson, [...] "we were all in <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>pain,</b> but it {{meant so much to}} them that I could sing that song and so much to me that I was able to do something.

Lincoln was {{familiar}} with Emerson's work, having previously seen him lecture. [...] Emerson's misgivings about Lincoln began to soften after this meeting.

2500|$|The fast bowling of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller {{was seen}} off by England's opening {{partnership}} as Len Hutton (94) and Cyril Washbrook (65) made another century stand; 137 runs in 178 minutes.

Wally Hammond was in <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> from fibrositis that he took 12 aspirin before {{he went out to}} bat and was bowled by Ernie Toshack for 18 to leave England 202/4. Denis Compton (147) stroked his way to 147, adding 118 with Joe Hardstaff (67), 61 with Jack Ikin (21) and 74 with Norman Yardley (18 not out). It was his third first-class century in a row and [...] "It was amazing to see Compton occasionally run down the pitch, change his mind, and either play the ball like a baseball bunt, or scamper back to ground his bat in time to get {{the benefit of the doubt}} on a stumping appeal". Lindwall thought he should have been stumped before he reached his century, [...] "but I could well understand the umpire's explanation...that the glare of the sun suddenly became so intense that he was unable to see clearly the white line of the popping crease". In any case Lindwall quickly ended the innings with the new ball, he caught and bowled Compton to have England 455/7. In the next over he sent Alec Bedser's off-stump cart-wheeling back to the wicketkeeper, then bowled Godfrey Evans first ball, shaved Doug Wright's stumps before bowling him second ball - 3 wickets in 4 balls to end the innings for 460. This was the nearest that Lindwall ever got to a hat-trick.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second season}} of the TV show Arrow {{featured}} an episode titled [...] "Birds of Prey," [...] which centers around the characters Dinah Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy); the Canary, Sara Lance (Caity Lotz); and the Huntress, Helena Bertinelli (Jessica De Gouw). Despite the title, the episode does not feature the two masked women teaming up and the only said team up was between Laurel and her sister, Sara. The Canary and her vigilante crime-fighting partner the Arrow (Stephen Amell) attempt to bring the Huntress in after they help the police bring in Frank Bertinelli (Jeffrey Nordling), Helena's father who was in hiding from her since season one. Helena arrives at the courthouse to kill her father and after a firefight between her, her thugs, and SWAT, she takes hostages, including Laurel. She demands her father but the Canary intervenes to save her sister, but is thrown out a window by Helena. Due to the two meeting in season one, Laurel tries to reason with Helena and talks about her own experiences and how she's finally dealing, urging Helena to deal with hers. Helena takes Laurel and escapes with her after Oliver informs her that he will trade her for Frank. During the exchange, Frank apologizes for causing his daughter <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> and Arrow urges her not to kill him. A violent SWAT member shows up after following Laurel's cell phone signal and opens fire on the vigilantes due to his hate for them. After he is dealt with, Canary and Huntress fight once again, with Sara almost killing Helena before Laurel persuades her not to. Sara lets Helena go. Helena discovers her father dead and becomes remorseful, and later admits to Oliver while in custody that he was right and that killing her father didn't solve anything.
