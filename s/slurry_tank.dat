The analyzed wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was operated in activated sludge technology with hybrid activated sludge reactor where biomass is kept in settled and suspended form. Treatment system was completed with hydroponic lagoon. Hydroponic lagoon has been used as tertiary treatment, in which the self-cleaning processes with the participation of the plant has come to an additional reduction of nutrients. Analyzed three stage treatment plant is located in the municipality of Nowa Sól. Only domestic wastewater delivered by <b>slurry</b> <b>tanks</b> are treated there in amount of 60 m 3 /d. During the observation high average concentrations of total nitrogen (201. 0 mgN/dm 3) was observed and organic matter expressed by COD reaching 1341. 5 mgO 2 /dm 3 and BOD 5 on the level of 246. 3 mgO 2 /dm 3 were noted. A characteristic feature of an object designed for wastewater treatment delivered by <b>slurry</b> <b>tanks</b> is high irregularity of wastewater supply and high instantaneous loads of pollutants (the system does not provide expansion tank). The biggest inequality factor of the flow to the reactor was observed in December 2014 (N d = 3. 9). During the observations also occurred days with no inflow of sewage. The study shows the dynamics of changes in the amount of delivered domestic wastewater and sewage flowing out of treatment plant including inequality factor.

50|$|A slurry pit, {{also known}} as a farm slurry pit, <b>slurry</b> <b>tank,</b> slurry lagoon or slurry store, is a hole, dam, or {{circular}} concrete structure where farmers gather all their animal waste together with other unusable organic matter, such as hay and water run off from washing down dairies, stables, and barns, in order to convert it, over a lengthy period of time, into fertilizer that can eventually be reused on their lands to fertilize crops.

50|$|The most {{important}} operating parameters of disc filters are {{the height of}} the <b>slurry</b> <b>tank,</b> agitation and the intensity and rotation speed of the disc as these will determine the cake formation and drying times. It is important to continuously agitate the slurry in order to prevent sedimentation of the solids. Excessively high agitation intensity may affect cake formation or change the particle size distribution of the product. One of the most commonly used agitators for filtration using vacuum disc filters is an oscillating cradle-type agitator located {{in the bottom of the}} basin, which requires fairly high rotation speeds to form homogeneous slurry. For processing rapidly settling high concentration slurries, bottom-feed rotary disc filters are usually used.|$|E

50|$|A vacuum {{ceramic filter}} is {{designed}} to separate liquids from solids for dewatering purposes. The device consists of a rotator, <b>slurry</b> <b>tank,</b> ceramic filter plate, distributor, discharge scraper, cleaning device, frame, agitating device, pipe system, vacuum system, automatic acid dosing system, automatic lubricating system, valve and discharge chute.

The disc material is inert, has a long operational life and is resistant to almost all chemicals. Performance can be optimized by taking into account all those factors which affect the overall efficiency of the separation process. Some of the variables affecting the performance of a vacuum ceramic filter include the solid concentration, speed rotation of the disc, slurry level in the feed basin, temperature of the feed slurry, and the pressure during dewatering stages and filter cake formation.|$|E
50|$|Key to the {{production}} of chlorine is the operation of the brine saturation/treatment system. Maintaining a properly saturated solution with the correct purity is vital, especially for membrane cells. Many plants have a salt pile which is sprayed with recycled brine. Others have <b>slurry</b> <b>tanks</b> that are fed raw salt and recycled brine. The raw brine is treated with sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide to precipitate calcium and magnesium. The reactions are often carried out in a series of reactors before the treated brine is sent to a large clarifier where the calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide are settled out. A floculating agent may be added just prior to the clarifier to improve settling. The decanted brine is then mechanically filtered using sand filters or leaf filters before entering a series of ion exchangers to further remove impurities. At several points in this process the brine is tested for hardness and strength.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents an}} analysis of the mechanisms influencing mixing within double-shell <b>slurry</b> <b>tanks.</b> A research program to characterize mixing of <b>slurries</b> within <b>tanks</b> has been proposed. The research program presents a combined experimental and computational approach to produce correlations describing the <b>tank</b> <b>slurry</b> concentration profile (and therefore uniformity) as a function of mixer pump operating conditions. The TEMPEST computer code was used to simulate both a full-scale (prototype) and scaled (model) double-shell waste tank to predict flow patterns resulting from a stationary jet centered in the tank. The simulation results were used to evaluate flow patterns in the tank and to determine whether flow patterns are similar between the full-scale prototype and an existing 1 / 12 -scale model tank. The flow patterns were sufficiently similar to recommend conducting scoping experiments at 1 / 12 -scale. Also, TEMPEST modeled velocity profiles of the near-floor jet were compared to experimental measurements of the near-floor jet with good agreement. Reported values of physical properties of double-shell <b>tank</b> <b>slurries</b> were analyzed to evaluate the range of properties appropriate for conducting scaled experiments. One-twelfth scale scoping experiments are recommended to confirm the prioritization of the dimensionless groups (gravitational settling, Froude, and Reynolds numbers) that affect slurry suspension in the tank. Two of the proposed 1 / 12 -scale test conditions were modeled using the TEMPEST computer code to observe the anticipated flow fields. This information will be used to guide selection of sampling probe locations. Additional computer modeling is being conducted to model a particulate laden, rotating jet centered in the tank. The results of this modeling effort will be compared to the scaled experimental data to quantify the agreement between the code and the 1 / 12 -scale experiment. The scoping experiment results will guide selection of parameters to be varied in the follow-on experiments. Data from the follow-on experiments will be used to develop correlations to describe slurry concentration profile as a function of mixing pump operating conditions. This data will also be used to further evaluate the computer model applications. If the agreement between the experimental data and the code predictions is good, the computer code will be recommended for use to predict slurry uniformity in the tanks under various operating conditions. If the agreement between the code predictions and experimental results is not good, the experimental data correlations will be used to predict slurry uniformity in the tanks within the range of correlation applicability...|$|R

With pig slurry, EM addition at the beginning of slurry storage had no or negati-ve effects on the emissions of CH 4, NH 3, N 2 O, and greenhouse gases. The very low dry matter content of the pig slurry is very likely the reason for this phenomenon. EM addition to the pigs ` feed declined emis-sions during pig slurry storage...|$|R

Following {{the death}} of his father, he was taken into the {{guardianship}} of William Pugh of Caerhowel and in 1827 he was apprenticed to the Oswestry architect Thomas Penson. He never qualified as an architect. In 1857 Poundley published Poundley’s Cottage Architecture. Poundley had close connections with Naylor family who, in 1835, had acquired the Brynllywarch estates at Kerry from William Pugh, the son of his guardian. They were also to acquire other estates at Leighton and Nantcribba. Poundley was employed to undertake survey work of these acquisitions. These surveys are now bound in two handsome atlas volumes in the National Library of Wales. The Leighton Estate was purchased in 1847 and Poundley was employed on the construction of the monumental model farm from about 1849 to 1860. Apart from the farm itself, some of the more important structures are the Poultry House and the ‘cottage orneé’ Poultry Cottage, the Cable House of the Railway and the massive stone built <b>slurry</b> <b>tank,</b> for the effluent from the farm.|$|E

Accidental poisoning from gases produced in such tanks is a recognised hazard, and multiple fatalities have been reported. 1 2 The principal constituents are methane, ammonia, {{carbon dioxide and}} hydrogen sulphide. The most dangerous of these is hydrogen sulphide which acts {{in a similar manner}} to cyanide, with reversible inhibition of the respiratory enzyme cytochrome oxidase. Concentrations above 200 parts per million (ppm) produce direct irritant effects on exposed surfaces, and pulmonary oedema on prolonged inhalation. 3 Higher levels (above 500 ppm) depress the central nervous system, with paralysis of the respiratory centre, and almost instantaneous loss of consciousness. The familiar smell of 'rotten eggs ' is not a reliable warning sign as paralysis of the olfactory nerve makes the gas odourless at lethal levels.

40|$|The {{water quality}} of rivers {{in the eastern}} part of the Humber Basin, {{north-eastern}} England is described from a baseflow survey (11 – 13 August 2006) of a wide range of water quality determinants, and long-term nutrient records of the Environment Agency of England and Wales (EA). The baseflow survey shows that the rivers are oversaturated with respect to dissolved CO 2 and calcite. They are sodium, potassium, lithium, boron, chloride, sulphate and fluoride bearing from a combination of atmospheric, within-catchment, agricultural and sewage effluent sources. Nitrate concentrations are uniform for rivers draining permeable bedrock but decrease for clay drainage areas. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations are variable across the catchments reflecting the importance and variability of point sources and within-river processing. The EA data show annual oscillations for both NO 3 and SRP concentrations. Average NO 3 concentrations vary between 3. 3 and 18. 8 mgN/l and concentrations are low during the summer months. Average SRP concentrations vary between 23 and 1959 μg/l. Highest SRP concentrations generally occur when there is effluent input from sewage treatment works and agricultural point sources (e. g. overflow from <b>slurry</b> <b>tanks,</b> farmyard washings).

40|$|The Savannah River Site {{processes}} high-level {{radioactive waste}} through precipitation {{by the addition of}} sodium tetraphenylborate in a large (approximately 1. 3 million gallon) High Level Waste Tank. Radiolysis of water produces a significant amount of hydrogen gas in this slurry. During quiescent periods the tetraphenylborate slurry retains large amounts of hydrogen as dissolved gas and small bubbles. When mixing pumps start, large amounts of hydrogen release due to agitation of the slurry. Flammability concerns necessitate an understanding of the hydrogen retention mechanism in the slurry and a model of how the hydrogen releases from the slurry during pump operation. Hydrogen concentration data collected from the <b>slurry</b> <b>tank</b> confirmed this behavior in the full-scale system.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} is of global concern. Most antimicrobial use is in agriculture; manures and slurry are especially {{important because they}} contain a mix of bacteria, including potential pathogens, antimicrobial resistance genes and antimicrobials. In many countries, manures and slurry are stored, especially over winter, before spreading onto fields as organic fertilizer. Thus these are a potential location for gene exchange and selection for resistance. We develop and analyze a mathematical model to quantify the spread of antimicrobial resistance in stored agricultural waste. We use parameters from a <b>slurry</b> <b>tank</b> on a UK dairy farm as an exemplar. We show that the spread of resistance depends in a subtle way on the rates of gene transfer and antibiotic inflow. If the gene transfer rate is high, then its reduction controls resistance, while cutting antibiotic inflow has little impact. If the gene transfer rate is low, then reducing antibiotic inflow controls resistance. Reducing length of storage can also control spread of resistance. Bacterial growth rate, fitness costs of carrying antimicrobial resistance and proportion of resistant bacteria in animal faeces have little impact on spread of resistance. Therefore effective treatment strategies depend critically on knowledge of gene transfer rates...|$|E
