40|$|Fatty acid {{analysis}} was used to study the trophic ecology of 10 demersal fish species in the South Georgia region. Principal component analysis grouped the species into three general clusters, revealing resource partitioning between species. Two groups were characterised by large proportions of either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, separating species according to their predominant feeding habitat. The third group showed fatty acid signatures overlapping with either or both of the previous two groups, suggesting a more opportunistic feeding behaviour for these species. Intraspecific comparisons furthermore revealed dietary variability with size, year and geographical location in several <b>species.</b> <b>Mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> (Champsocephalus gunnari) in particular showed inter-annual differences in muscle lipid concentrations closely linked to prey availability with low lipid contents found in years of low krill (Euphausia superba) abundance. Despite the intraspecific differences the majority of species could be easily distinguished from each other, which indicates the utility of this method in the dietary analysis of higher predators. ...|$|E

The swept-area method was used in the depth range from 100 to 1 000 m with 207 random stratified stations. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains incomplete as four of the species (D. eleginoides, bigeye grenadier (Macrourus carinatus), Eaton's skate (Bathyraja eatonii) and Kerguelen sandpaper skate (B. irrasa)) extend deeper than 1 000 m, the limit of the POKER 2006 survey.

Data on the frequency and size structure of <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> in the diet of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella and gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua from 1991 to 2002 were used to examine trophic interactions involving this species and to evaluate the potential impact of predators on its population. <b>Mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> occurred in 10 to 20 % of scats from Antarctic fur seals and comprised 48 % of the diet by mass of gentoo penguins.

40|$|Target {{identification}} {{remains a}} challenge for acoustic surveys of marine fauna. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, are typically identified {{through a combination of}} expert scrutiny of echograms and analysis of differences in mean volume backscattering strengths (SV; dB re 1 m− 1) measured at two or more echosounder frequencies. For commonly used frequencies, however, the differences for krill are similar to those for many co-occurring fish species that do not possess swimbladders. At South Georgia, South Atlantic, one <b>species</b> in particular, <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish,</b> Champsocephalus gunnari, forms pelagic aggregations, which can be difficult to distinguish acoustically from large krill layers. <b>Mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> are currently surveyed using bottom-trawls, but the resultant estimates of abundance may be biased because of the species' semi-pelagic distribution. An acoustic estimate of the pelagic component of the population could indicate the magnitude of this bias, but first a reliable target identification method is required. To address this, random forests (RFs) were generated using acoustic and net sample data collected during surveys. The final RF classified as krill, icefish, and mixed aggregations of weak scattering fish species with an overall estimated accuracy of 95 %. Minimum SV, mean aggregation depth (m), mean distance from the seabed (m), and geographic positional data were most important to the accuracy of the RF. Time-of-day and the difference between SV at 120 kHz (SV 120) and that at 38 kHz (SV 38) were also important. The RF classification resulted in significantly higher estimates of backscatter apportioned to krill when compared with widely applied identification methods based on fixed and variable ranges of SV 120 –SV 38. These results suggest that krill density is underestimated when those SV-differencing methods are used for target identification. RFs are an objective means for target identification and could enhance the utility of incidentally collected acoustic data...|$|R
40|$|Exploitation of Southern Ocean marine {{resources}} began more than 200 {{years ago with}} the massive hunt for seals and whales. In the 1960 s/ 70 s, fisheries for finfish and krill entered Southern Ocean waters. Within a few years many fish populations were heavily overfished and dramatically depleted, and some of these stocks still did not recover. Today, fish stocks and fisheries activities are managed and monitored by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) which was established in 1982 to ensure sustainable exploitation and protection of the delicate marine ecosystem. Current target <b>species</b> include <b>Mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> (Champsocephalus gunnari), Patagonian as well as Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides and D. mawsoni) and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Most of these species are vulnerable to overfishing due to slow growth, late age at maturity, and rather low fecundity. This vulnerability might increase, as Southern Ocean living communities are currently also faced with alterations of their environment due to climate change, such as increasing water temperatures and decreasing sea ice. Species, including the ones targetted by fisheries, are well-adapted to their particular environmental conditions and are believed to be highly sensitive to changes because of their cold-adapted physiology, their life history traits, and their direct or indirect dependence on sea ice. The species will be exposed to several stressors at the same time, and fishing pressure, direct abiotic forcing and changes mediated via the food web might act synergistically and result in significant population declines. In particular the strongly sea ice-dependent Antarctic krill, a key species in the food web, might be adversely affected.

40|$|The <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> (Champsocephalus gunnari) is a {{prominent}} {{member of the}} coastal fish fauna of the Seasonal Pack-Ice Zone and the islands north of it.

C. gunnari has many characteristics typical of Antarctic fish species with respect to life history characteristics, such as egg size, fecundity and growth. These fall well within the range of other sympatric red-blooded notothenioids; eggs are large and yolky. Egg diameter, egg production per gram body weight and growth performance at South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands was comparable with similar-sized nototheniids and channichthyids. Stocks of C. gunnari have a number of biological characteristics in common, such as feeding mode and food, early life history and growth in the first years of life. However, stocks in sub-Antarctic waters differ in reproductive characteristics, such as length and age at first spawning, natural mortality and life expectancy from those on more southerly grounds. They may grow to more than 60 cm and may become 13 – 15 yrs old. However, in the vicinity of South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands, fish apparently do not exhaust this growth potential fully. Their ability to reproduce at an early age coupled with a comparatively high fecundity and growth performance may mean stocks of C. gunnari in sub-antarctic waters have far more resilience and a greater capacity to rebuild than species with the slower reproductive rates common in other notothenioids...|$|R

The mesoscale habitat use of these birds is increasingly being quantified by relating their movements to remotely sensed, near surface properties of the ocean. However, prey availability at the sea surface may also be determined by habitat characteristics not measurable from space. For instance, benthic-pelagic coupling, which occurs when seabed processes affect productivity in the epipelagic zone, can link benthic habitat type to availability of surface prey. We combined acoustically derived maps of the substrate of the South Georgia shelf with GPS tracking to quantify the sub-mesoscale habitat use of breeding black-browed albatrosses.

In the course of a number of collectioils from there by members of 'this Institute including the authors in 1960 - 61, it has been possible to obtain material of two distinct <b>species</b> of <b>mackerel,</b> sufficient io enable drawing up a detailed comparison...|$|R
5000|$|About 21 {{species in}} the family Scombridae are {{commonly}} called <b>mackerel.</b> The type <b>species</b> for the scombroid mackerel is the Atlantic mackerel, Scomber scombrus. Until recently, Atlantic chub mackerel and Indo-Pacific chub mackerel {{were thought to be}} subspecies of the same species. In 1999, Collette established, on molecular and morphological considerations, that these are separate <b>species.</b> <b>Mackerel</b> are smaller with shorter lifecycles than their close relatives, the tuna, which are also members of the same family.|$|R
40|$|Ontogenetic, inter-annual and {{regional}} variations in diet were investigated for <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish,</b> Champsocephalus gunnari, in three successive summer seasons around South Georgia. Stomach contents from 2239 C. gunnari (130 - 560 mm total length) were examined. A bootstrapping technique {{was used to}} calculate confidence intervals for an index of relative importance of prey categories (% IRIDC). Diet varied significantly between years and age classes {{but there was little}} regional difference in diet. In general, diet was dominated by krill, Euphausia superba and by the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii. Smaller (younger) fish tended to prey on a higher proportion of T. gaudichaudii and small euphausiids such as Thysanoessa sp. and took smaller quantities of E. superba. In a season of poor krill availability (summer of 2003 - 2004) the proportion of krill in the diet, stomach fullness and fish condition (indicated by length-weight relationships) were significantly lower than in the other summer seasons. A large reduction (> 80 %) in the estimated annual (2005) biomass of the C. gunnari stock directly followed the season of poor krill availability. This decline was largely because of mortality of 2 + and 3 + fish, which were more krill dependent than 1 + fish. Younger fish appear to have survived, leading to an increase in the estimated population biomass in 2006...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analysed}} {{the total}} length (LT) -frequency distribution of <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> Champsocephalus gunnari at South Georgia and Shag Rocks from nine bottom trawl surveys at South Georgia and eight at Shag Rocks between 1987 and 2002. The estimated mean LT of age-classes 1 +, 2 +, 3 + and 4 + years during January were, respectively, 14 · 7, 23 · 5, 29 · 8 and 35 · 1 [*]cm at South Georgia. Age-classes 1 +, 2 + and 3 + years were 18 · 3, 26 · 2 and 33 · 8 [*]cm at Shag Rocks. The derived Bertalanffy growth parameters for South Georgia were: L∞[*]=[*] 51 · 7 [*]cm, k[*]=[*] 0 · 27 and t 0 [*]=[*]− 0 · 26. The mean LT of each age-class of C. gunnari at Shag Rocks was significantly larger than at South Georgia, equivalent to c. 5 months growth, although the annual growth in LT was similar. This is {{further evidence that}} C. gunnari hatched earlier at Shag Rocks. At South Georgia, the mean LT of age-classes 1 + and 3 + years were correlated, and significantly decreased between 1987 and 2002, and were smaller following warmer summers. This decrease {{in the size of}} C. gunnari {{may be the result of}} reduced food availability linked to climate warming...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of egg and larvae of mackerel, horse mackerel, sardine, hake, megrim, blue whiting and anchovy along the European Atlantic waters (south Portugal to Scotland) during 1998 is described. Time of the year, sea surface temperature and bottom depth {{are used to}} define the spawning habitat of the different <b>species.</b> <b>Mackerel,</b> horse mackerel, and sardine eggs and larvae presented the widest distribution, whereas megrim and anchovy showed a limited distribution, restricted to the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay respectively. Correspondingly mackerel, horse mackerel and sardine showed the highest aggregation indices. Blue whiting larvae were found at the lowest temperatures, whereas anchovy eggs and larvae {{were found in the}} warmest waters. The analysis is a basis for evaluation of ongoing changes in the pelagic ecosystem of the north-east Atlantic...|$|R
