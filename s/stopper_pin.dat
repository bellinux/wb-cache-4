40|$|Abstract: The simple design concept {{approach}} {{and the simple}} technique of installation of external elbow hinge fixator are used {{for the treatment of}} proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contractures without open surgery. This device has never been tested on any patient yet since it was a new design. Application of elbow hinge fixator is easy and effective in reducing contractures of the PIP joint by soft tissue distraction. An external elbow hinge fixators can be applied as a neutralization device after open or pericutaneous reduction. It will act as an active reduction device using universal hinge mechanisms between fixation blocks. Beside that it will also act as an external scaffold which incorporates the placement of multi-axial fixing element with shanz pin to apply force through humeral. The concept of fixation rod and multiaxial placement of pins is introduced. External elbow hinged fixators are used to provide some combination of easy mobilization, and stability, as well as gradual rotating elbow motion. In open procedure situations, the external elbow hinged fixator maintains a concentric motion of the humeral articulation throughout a full range of active elbow motion. During the postoperative period a controlled gradual stretch is applied using the <b>stopper</b> <b>pin</b> on the device. The device is turned smoothly in 0 ยบ till 135 ยบ and can be stop at interval of every 15 ยบ. The direction is alternated and the patient usually rests in extension overnight. The <b>stopper</b> <b>pin</b> mechanism can be released for active mobilization of the elbow...|$|E
