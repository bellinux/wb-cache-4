Despite the increase of coal production from multiple-seam mining, available predictive methods are mostly unable to predict a reliable <b>subsidence</b> <b>profile</b> for multiple-seam extractions. In this paper, a case study of multiple-seam subsidence is modelled using physical modelling techniques. The subsidence mechanism as revealed in the physical model is explained and the differences between multiple and single-seam subsidence are highlighted. On the same case study, a commonly used influence function method (IFM) and Generalised Influence Function Method (GIFM) are utilised to predict the <b>subsidence</b> <b>profile.</b> The results are compared with predictions achieved by a newly developed predictive method based on the understanding of mechanism of the multiple-seam subsidence.

The object {{of this work}} is to examine hydrogeological techniques and problems which {{can be associated with}} longwall coal extraction. Current U.

An area of principal concern is the potential access of water via fracture networks associated with <b>subsidence</b> <b>profile</b> formation. The role of subsidence development with respect to different geological conditions is considered. Similarly, parameters which control the potential yield of an aquifer, as well as the techniques available for assessing them, are also discussed, with particular reference to Coal Measures strata.

The results of numerical modeling were calibrated by changing different elastic properties and parameters of rock within a reasonable range to match the predicted subsidence using the empirical models.

This was done by using a query function within the Phase 2 program. Through this query line, the profiles of stresses and strains at certain points in the model could be obtained. When a reasonable match between the numerical result and the empirical formulas was obtained, the finite element modeling could predict the state of stresses and strain within the rock {{that could be used for}} evaluation of wellbore stability.|$|R

Understanding the characteristics of multi-seam subsidence is the ﬁrst step in achieving reliable subsidence predictions. Characteristics of multi-seam subsidence are investigated by means of several sand-plaster physical models. Geological and site speciﬁc parameters are kept constant in all the models in order to compare the multi-seam subsidence parameters for diﬀerent mining conﬁgurations. Based on observations from the physical models, it is concluded that the panel conﬁgurations of the two seams have signiﬁcant impact on the multi-seam subsidence development.

40|$|Underground mining-induced {{subsidence}} {{is responsible}} for damages to built features, assets, surface and underground water resources, and other environmental features. The ability to predict and manage the effects of underground longwall coal mining on ground surface is deemed necessary for coal mining companies to seek approval from regulatory organisations. This ability is particularly important in cases where higher magnitudes of subsidence and extents of damage to ground surface are expected, such as multi-seam longwall mining-induced subsidence. By {{reducing the number of}} untouched coal resources, the number of multi-seam coal mines has increased to meet today&# 039;s energy requirement. This increase has brought new challenges to mine subsidence engineers as the observed subsidence above multi-seam coal mines indicate significantly different subsidence characteristics in comparison with that of single-seam mining. Multi-seam subsidence observations suggest that there is a different strata movement mechanism involved in the multi-seam mining, which is yet to be fully understood. In addition, the multi-seam mining-induced subsidence is a case dependent phenomenon and currently available subsidence predictive methodologies are unable to account for this case dependency of the multi-seam subsidence to achieve reliable subsidence predictions. The aim {{of this study is to}} first investigate strata movement mechanism and ground surface subsidence characteristics resulting from multi-seam longwall mining extractions and then, at the second stage, use the results of this investigation to characterise and develop a reliable multi-seam subsidence predictive methodology. For this purpose, several investigation methods are utilised, such as physical and numerical modelling techniques and factual subsidence observational data analysis. The key finding from these investigations was that multi-seam mining configuration, i. e. relative location of the longwall panels in the two mining seams and interburden thickness, is the most influential factor that alters the strata movement pattern and shape of the multi-seam subsidence. Extraction of lower longwall panel from under previously extracted longwall panels creates specific strata movement patterns and areas of fracture closure/opening above the previously extracted upper mining seam, depending on the multi-seam mining configuration. Closure of cracks and reduced bridging ability of the previously caved strata result in enhanced magnitude of subsidence above overlapping areas of longwall panels in the two mining seams. Existence of previously disturbed and caved areas also alters the strata movement pattern and subsidence characteristics above the edges of the lower panels. It was found that where edges of the longwall panels are vertically aligned in the two mining horizons a steep and concentrated <b>subsidence</b> <b>profile</b> forms above the edge of the lower panel. In contrast, where lower panel&# 039;s edge is located under the previously extracted upper panel a smooth and wide <b>subsidence</b> <b>profile</b> occurs. At the next stage, results from different investigation methods were used to characterise the multi-seam subsidence. For this purpose and to avoid generalisation of the multi-seam subsidence, it was suggested to divide the extracted lower panel into a number of segments with different segmental subsidence parameters in accordance with the relative location of the panels in the mining seams. By this method, multi-seam subsidence due to any mining configuration can be characterised. The proposed characterisation was then employed to modify a conventional subsidence prediction method, namely, Influence Function Method (IFM). The modified method is called Discrete Influence Function Method (Discrete-IFM). This method is based on superpositioning of subsidence influence from extracted discrete segments with different subsidence parameters, which together form the extracted longwall panel, to calculate the final multi-seam <b>subsidence</b> <b>profile.</b> The outstanding advantage of the Discrete-IFM in comparison with other conventional subsidence prediction methods is its ability to predict <b>subsidence</b> <b>profile</b> of any shape and magnitude for every multi-seam mining configuration. Finally, the ability of the Discrete-IFM to predict multi-seam subsidence profiles was demonstrated in a multi-seam mine case study. For this purpose, the Discrete-IFM was first calibrated by two control cases. The multi-seam subsidence in other locations was then predicted by means of the calibrated method. The prediction results by Discrete-IFM were also compared with selected commonly used prediction methods. This comparison results indicated improved ability of the Discrete-IFM to predict the multi-seam subsidence and its specific characteristics due to various multi-seam mining configurations. The findings presented in this study would enable mining engineers to determine the extent of the multi-seam subsidence. The proposed conceptualised characterisation of the subsidence can be used to reliably predict the multi-seam subsidence due to various mining configurations and evaluate the impact of multi-seam mining on the ground surface...|$|E
40|$|According to Litwiniszyn’s theory, {{subsidence}} over a yielding underground geo-structure {{is seen as}} a stochastic (Markov) process. This theory {{leads to}} a single, linear parabolic differential equation of diffusion–convection type (D–C equation) in the plane-field of displacements. If the boundary conditions for the governing D–C equation are prescribed along the shear bands, i. e. at ‘moving ’ boundaries—it has been observed from small-scale model experiments that the subsiding process is always confined between a set of inclined shear bands—then the resulting equation is nonlinear. The inverse problem for this nonlinear equation, i. e. the problem of determining the base displacement using the surface subsidence as ‘initial ’ condition, is ill-posed and estimation of the base displacement from a given surface <b>subsidence</b> <b>profile</b> is not possible. In the present paper the domain of integration of the governing D–C equation is fixed (and bounded) —the boundaries are not evolving. Hence, the governing equation remains linear parabolic.

40|$|Numerical {{methods have}} the {{potential}} to assist in prediction of subsidence, particularly in new mining environments such as multi-seam mining. However, numerical methods have often been criticised for the predictions of subsidence above single-seam longwalls not matching field measurements well. To achieve a realistic prediction, a sound understanding of the mechanical laws governing the deformation of the sub-surface strata is required. Within the framework of the finite element method (FEM), this study compares predicted <b>subsidence</b> <b>profiles,</b> as well as stress distributions in the sub-surface strata, for a selection of the different constitutive laws currently used by practising engineers to represent coal measure strata. Further, a strain-stiffening caved goaf material is introduced into the simulations to allow the vertical stresses along the longwall floor to return to the original overburden load. Both single seam and multi-seam longwall panels are considered. A key finding is that the best agreement between predictions and field observations of subsidence is when the coal measure strata are represented as an elastic material with closely spaced frictionless horizontal interfaces, representing bedding planes. With this model the vertical stress also re-turns to the overburden stress in the caved goaf material within the first seam, prior to extraction of the second seam. The results show that more sophisticated and numerically taxing constitutive laws do not necessarily lead to more accurate predictions of subsidence when compared to field measurements. The advantages and limitations of using each particular constitutive law considered in the study are presented. 1...|$|R
30|$|Underground {{extraction}} of coal mining {{could lead to}} serious environment problems because of surface movement and subsidence. The damage to environment could continue for a long time. A number of computational methods {{have been developed for}} simulating ground movement and deformation caused by underground mining (Braeuner 1973; Peng and Chyan 1981; Alejano et al. 1999; Zhao et al. 2004). The most widely used method is subsidence engineering handbook (SEH) for predicting subsidence based on the graphical solutions (Anon. 1975). The SEH method offers fast and easy calculations where empirical predictions are based on actual measured data. However, this method is only applicable for simple coal panel’s geometry and for solving two-dimensional (2 D) problem only. The profile functions method have been successfully applied to predict <b>subsidence</b> <b>profiles</b> induced by working in horizontal or moderately dipping coal seams (Torano et al. 2003), but this method cannot be accounted for coal seams with irregular panel. The complex cases can be modeled by analytical methods such as finite element analysis which offers some possibilities for subsidence prediction by Najjar and Zaman (1993), Yang et al. (1993), but these are invariably fraught with some difficulties. Moreover, influence functions method is considered as a powerful application for three-dimensional (3 D) subsidence prediction for all shapes of extraction panels (Sheorey et al. 2000). However, the use of influence functions is very time consuming and calibration is difficult. A sensitivity analysis method is proposed for the GIS-based mapping of the ground subsidence hazard near abandoned underground coal mines (Oh et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Earth's largest {{reactive}} carbon pool, marine sedimentary organic matter, {{becomes increasingly}} recalcitrant during burial, making it almost inaccessible {{as a substrate}} for microorganisms, and thereby limiting metabolic activity in the deep biosphere. Because elevated temperature acting over geological time leads to the massive thermal breakdown of the organic matter into volatiles, including petroleum, the question arises whether microorganisms can directly utilize these maturation products as a substrate. While migrated thermogenic fluids are known to sustain microbial consortia in shallow sediments, an in situ coupling of abiotic generation and microbial utilization has not been demonstrated.

The subsidence history of each section has been calculated using standard backstripping techniques. An inverse model, based on finite-duration lithospheric stretching, has then been used to calculate the distribution of strain rate as a function of time required to fit each <b>subsidence</b> <b>profile.</b> Results demonstrate an excellent fit between theory and observation. By combining our analysis with independent field-based and geophysical observations, we show that the Timan–Pechora basin underwent at least four phases of mild lithospheric stretching during the Phanerozoic (β < 1. 2). These phases occurred in Ordovician, Late Ordovician– Silurian, Middle–Late Devonian and Permian–Early Triassic times. Growth on normal faults, episodes of volcanic activity and regional considerations provide corroborative support for the existence of all four phases. Although less well constrained, subsidence data from the South Barents Sea basin are consistent with a similar Early–Middle Palaeozoic history. The main difference is that Permian–Early Triassic extension is substantially greater than that seen onshore. This similarity implies structura...|$|E
40|$|Coalbed methane (CBM) drew {{increasingly}} the attention as an unconventional source {{of natural gas}} during the last decades, globally and domestically. In {{spite of the fact}} that it is one of the main hazardous concerns in coal mining it is one of the most advantageous sources of natural gas especially due to its high purity of methane and quality. In conventional natural gas reservoirs the pressurized gas is stored in porous space or fracture space but in CBM natural gas molecules mainly is adsorbed to coal matrix. Therefore in contrast to conventional natural gas reservoirs, the gas production of CBM initiates after decreasing the reservoir pressure down to a threshold in order to initiation the desorption process. According to the presence of water in CBMs which creates a remarkable pressure due to hydrostatic head of water the above desorption threshold will be achieved after dewatering process. Dewatering process will lead in decreasing reservoir pressure in one hand which helps the gas desorption but will lead in increasing effective stress which is applied to rock solid skeleton on the other hand. Such an increase in effective stress accounts for rock structure deformation which has a high impact on surface subsidence due to shallow depth of coal seams. Presence of soft formations in dewatered horizon especially coal seams will increase effectively the deformation of the formations, which could potentially result in remarkable <b>subsidence</b> <b>profile.</b> Studying the depletion induced deformation due to CBM production is the main aim of this study.

40|$|Measured <b>subsidence</b> <b>profiles</b> above {{coal mining}} {{operations}} regularly show less than expected subsidence at creeks, river valleys and gorges. Horizontal measurements across such surface notches {{indicate that they}} reduce in width as mining occurs. The reduction in subsidence {{is referred to as}} ‘upsidence’ and the reduction in width is referred to as valley closure. The upsidence and closure movements tend to increase in amplitude as the size of the valley increases, and as the magnitude of subsidence increases. The movements are greatest when the insitu horizontal stresses are high and when the valleys are fully undermined. The upsidence is a combination of anticlinal valley bulging and buckling or shearing of the surface and near-surface strata. As Longwalls 8 and 10, at Tower Colliery, in the Southern Coalfield of New South Wales, were mined beneath the Cataract River Gorge, the incremental upsidence in the base of the gorge, due to mining each longwall, was approximately 360 mm, resulting in the base of the gorge being uplifted as much as 250 mm above its original level. At the same time, the width of the gorge was reduced by approximately 280 mm. Cracking and buckling of the strata, within the base of the gorge, resulted in a loss of water from some of the natural ponds in the bed of the river, with consequential criticism from local landholders and regulatory authorities. A comprehensive research study supported by an ACARP grant and assisted by CSIRO and The University of New South Wales has provided some additional insight into the valley bulging phenomenon.

40|$|In this paper, an {{idealized}} framework {{based on a}} cloud-topped mixed layer model is developed for investigating feedbacks between subtropical stratocumulus (Sc) and global warming. The two principal control parameters are Sc-region sea surface temperature (SST) and intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) SST (which controls the temperature and mean <b>subsidence</b> <b>profiles</b> above the Sc). The direct effect of CO 2 doubling (leaving all other parameters fixed) is tested and found to somewhat reduce liquid water path; discussion of this effect on the SST-change simulations is included. The presence of a cold boundary layer is found to significantly affect the temperature and subsidence rate just above cloud top by enhancing lower-tropospheric diabatic cooling in this region. A simple representation of this effect (easily generaliz-able to a more realistic boundary layer model) is developed. Steady-state solutions are analyzed {{as a function of}} local and ITCZ SST. Two climate change scenarios are considered. The first scenario is an equal increase of local and ITCZ SSTs. In this case, predicted boundary layer depth and cloud thickness increase. This is found in a simplified context to result from subsidence and entrainment decreases due to increased static stability in a warmer climate. In the second case, local SST change is diagnosed from a surface energy balance under the assumption that ocean heat transport remains unchanged. In this case, predicted boundary layer depth decreases. Cloud continues to thicken with rising ITCZ SST, but at a rate much reduced in comparison to the equal-warming scenario. This cloud shading feedback keeps SST in the Sc region nearly constant as the ITCZ SST increases. Model sensitivity to aerosol indirect effects is also considered by varying the assumed droplet concen-tration. The resulting change in liquid water path is small, suggesting a weaker dependence on second indirect effect than found in previous studies. 1...|$|R

While accurate global datasets of topography through geologic time are not currently available, pale- ogeographic reconstructions illustrate the evolution of topographically-dependent environments. This thesis examines regional-global paleogeographic responses to topographic trends driven by mantle ﬂow induced by sunken lithospheric slabs. Global paleogeographic maps are amalgamations of older, smaller regional-local studies and original data locations are not traceable. Here, we evaluate extracted Cretaceous and Cenozoic global paleoshorelines from two independent paleogeographic datasets. We ﬁnd high consistency with the fossil record {{on a global scale}} for both datasets. In continental interiors, we predict the drivers of major ﬂooding events around the world during the Cretaceous and Cenozoic by comparing trends of ﬂooding, modelled dynamic topography and eustatic sea level. We ﬁnd that eustasy and dynamic topography are often contemporaneous drivers of regional ﬂooding, with some exceptions (e. g. ﬂooding regression in mid-Cretaceous Australia corresponds to dynamic topography instead of eustasy). In Early-mid Cretaceous Australia, we compare ﬂooding patterns, backstripped well subsidence and modelled slab-driven dynamic topography trends from three diﬀerent model runs, which suggest that lower viscosity in the asthenosphere produces modelled dynamic topography trends that are more consistent with ﬂooding and backstripped subsidence trends for Cretaceous Australia. The northern extents of mid-Cretaceous ﬂooding regression in the Eromanga- Surat basins may need to be revised with respect to well <b>subsidence</b> <b>proﬁles</b> and marine fossil distributions.

40|$|The Spurgeon Coal Field, {{an area of}} nine square miles, {{is located}} in {{southern}} Pike and northern Warrick Counties, Indiana. In this region, overburden thickness increases above 120 feet (37 m), and strip mining based on current equipment and highwall procedures is uneconomical. Hence longwall mining, a procedure involving high-productivity and -safety aspects is under consideration. ^ For longwall mining to succeed, several specific geological and mining conditions must occur. An essentially uniform thickness plus continuity of the coal (Indiana Coal V) was determined through examination of drilling data and interpretation of cross sections, isopach maps and structural contour maps prepared. No coal discontinuities (channels, wash outs, faults) were indicated for the Spurgeon Field. Continuous and regular caving of the immediate roof after mining was also necessary for a successful longwall operation. Based on drill core strength, the caveability classification of the immediate roof qualified as 2 ̆ 2 fairly good/good, easy caving 2 ̆ 2. These findings were favorable for adopting the longwall method. ^ An aspect of concern is the shallow overburden (average 150 feet) (46 m) of the field as other longwall mines in the U. S. have overburdens in excess of 800 ft (244 m) and experience is based on these conditions. ^ The general proposed layout and design for longwall mining were evaluated. High horizontal stresses due to the shallow overburden were considered {{in the design of}} the chain pillars. Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s confining core approach for estimating the location of the peak stress and the tributary area concept of the maximum potential loading were combined to develop a procedure for determining dimensions of the chain pillar. The existence of high horizontal stresses allows for the reduction in size of the chain pillar in the hydrostatic stress state. ^ Owing to the similar geologic condition of the Illinois Basin and the coal fields of England, the SEH (Subsidence Engineering Handbook) approach was used to evaluate the maximum potential subsidence above the central region of the panel.

40|$|Ground {{subsidence}} due to mining {{has been}} the subject of intensive research for several decades, and it remains to be an important topic confronting the mining industry today. In the Southern Coalfield of New South Wales, Australia, there is particular concern about subsidence impacts on incised river valleys – valley closure, upsidence, and the resulting localised loss of surface water under low flow conditions. Most of the reported cases have occurred when the river valley is directly undermined. More importantly, there are a number of cases where closure and upsidence have been reported above unmined coal. These latter events are especially significant as they influence decisions regarding stand-off distances and hence mine layouts and reserve recovery. The deformation of a valley indicates the onset of locally compressive stress conditions concentrated at the base of the valley. Compressive conditions are anticipated when the surface deforms in a sagging mode, for example directly above the longwall extraction; but they are not expected when the surface deforms in a hogging mode at the edge of the extraction as that area is typically in tension. To date, explanations for valley closure under the hogging mode have considered undefined compressive stress redistributions in the horizontal plane, or lateral block movements and displacement along discontinuities generated in the sagging mode. This research is investigating the possibilities of the block movement model and its role in generating compressive stresses at the base of valleys, in the tensile portion of the <b>subsidence</b> <b>profile.</b> The numerical modelling in this research project has demonstrated that the block movement proposal is feasible provided that the curvatures developed are sufficient to allow lateral block movement. Valley closure and the onset of valley base yield are able to be quantified with the possibility of using analytical solutions. To achieve this, a methodology of subsidence prediction using the Distinct Element code UDEC has been developed as an alternative for subsidence modelling and prediction for isolated longwall panels. The numerical models have been validated by comparison with empirical results, observed caving behaviour and analytical solutions, all of which are in good agreement. The techniques developed in the subsidence prediction UDEC models have then been used to develop the conceptual block movement model. The outcomes of this research have vast implications. Firstly, it is shown that valley closure and upsidence is primarily a function of ground curvature. Since the magnitude of curvature is directly related to the magnitude of vertical subsidence there is an opportunity to consider changes in the mine layout as a strategy to reduce valley closure. Secondly, with further research there is the possibility that mining companies can assess potential damage to river valleys based on how close longwall panels approach the river valley in question. This has the added advantage of optimising the required stand off distances to river valley and increasing coal recovery...|$|E
40|$|SUPPLEMENT : RESTRICTED (not {{available}} on-line) Coal {{is being}} mined from seams which lie beneath urban {{areas around the}} City of Newcastle, New South Wales, under nearby Lake Macquarie and the Pacific Ocean. Subsidence {{occurs as a result}} of pillar extraction or longwall mining and homes and other structures or surface features can be affected. Detailed field surveys commenced in the late 19602 ̆ 7 s in the coalfields north and south of Sydney. This work was developed and extended by the author in order to provide the basic information which was used to develop a method of subsidence prediction. Because of the large quantity of results, several computer programmes were designed to handle the calculations, filing and data manipulation from the field booking sheets to the presentation of calculated results from the computer. Detailed analyses of the results of these surveys have enabled the relationship between the geometry of mine workings and the subsidence at the surface to be established for the particular geological environments. This research has shown that the massive and strong conglomerates of the Newcastle area {{have a significant effect on}} the value of the maximum subsidence. For the lower range of widths of extraction, the investigations showed that the nature of the caving of the roof strata over the mined seam influenced the magnitude of the surface subsidence. Subsidence in Newcastle was shown to be significantly less than what would be experienced in areas of mainly argillaceous strata such as in the United Kingdom because of their different caving properties and strata deformation characteristics. On the basis of a theoretical subsidence prediction method developed for the Newcastle area by the author using the survey, geological and mining information, panel and pillar mining layouts are now designed for maximum coal recovery consistent with small values of maximum subsidence. With the aid of these locally established guidelines, longwall extraction is now taking place beneath the Pacific Ocean, Lake Macquarie and areas of surface development along their shorelines. The research showed that, in the Newcastle District, subsidence develops in four stages as the ratio of the width of extraction w to the depth of cover h increases for panels of critical or supercritical length. Extraction layouts with subcritical w/h values up to 0. 55 result in a slight undulation of the surface and it is within this range that panel and pillar extraction layouts have been designed for protection of structures on the surface. Where the w/h ratio is greater than 0. 55 and less than 0. 65, a pronounced subcritical subsidence trough develops. For extraction layouts where the w/h ratio is greater than 0. 65 the maximum subsidence increases rapidly as the conglomerate within the strata fails to support itself over the increasingly wide panel. The subsidence reaches its maximum possible value at a critical w/h value of around 1. 3. In the supercritical range above 1. 3 the maximum subsidence is 0. 65 of the seam height mined. The research also revealed the factors which influenced the maximum subsidence such as the recovery of coal from the seam mined, the caving of the roof strata, whether other seams have been mined, the presence of significant faulting and the stability of pillars which remain between or adjacent to extracted panels. Other features of subsidence profiles in Newcastle studied in relation to the mine geometry were the shape of the <b>subsidence</b> <b>profile,</b> the various relationships between subsidence, slope change, curvature and strain, and the time-subsidence relationships. It was also discovered that the travelling slopes and strains above an advancing face are significantly less than the final static values over the end of the panel. Strain triangles were used to investigate the magnitudes and directions of the maximum and minimum principal strains. The principles developed as a result of the author 2 ̆ 7 s research work are unique to the Newcastle district north of Sydney where they are now used as a predictive tool in the control of mine subsidence...|$|E

The study aims at analysing {{the response of}} reinforced concrete framed buildings on discrete foundations in interaction with metro lines. It refers {{to the case of}} the twin tunnels of the Milan (Italy) metro line 5,recently built in coarse grained materials using EPB machines,for which subsidence measurements collected along ground and building sections during tunnelling were available. Settlements measured under freefield conditions are firstly back interpreted using Gaussian empirical predictions. Then,the in situ measurements’ analysis is extended to include the evolving response of a 9 storey reinforced concrete building while being undercrossed by the metro line. In the finite element study,the soil mechanical behaviour is described using an advanced constitutive model. This latter,when combined with a proper simulation of the excavation process, proves to realistically reproduce the <b>subsidence</b> <b>profiles</b> under free field conditions and to capture the interaction phenomena occurring between the twin tunnels during the excavation. Furthermore, when the numerical model is extended to include the building, schematised in a detailed manner, the results are in good agreement with the monitoring data for different stages of the twin tunnelling. Thus, they indirectly confirm the satisfactory performance of the adopted numerical approach which also allows a direct evaluation of the structural response as an outcome of the analysis. Further analyses are also carried out modelling the building with different levels of detail. The results highlight that, in this case, the simplified approach based on the equivalent plate schematisation is inadequate to capture the real tunnelling induced displacement field. The overall behaviour of the system proves to be mainly influenced by the buried portion of the building which plays an essential role in the interaction mechanism, due to its high stiffness...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 100 years, the Galveston Bay (GB) Estuary has {{experienced}} {{a wide range of}} anthropogenic activities. The bay?s watershed and shoreline contains one of the largest concentrations of petroleum and chemical industries in the world, with the greatest concentration within the lower San Jacinto River/Houston Ship Channel (SJR/HSC). Extensive groundwater has been withdrawn to support these industries, and an expanding population has resulted in elevated land subsidence, with the highest rates in the lower SJR/HSC (3 cm yr^- 1, > 3 m) decreasing seaward throughout the bay to 0. 6 cm yr^- 1 near Galveston Island. Due to the industrial, commercial, and residential importance of the GB watershed, understanding the sources of sediment, and the rates of accumulation is imperative in determining the concentration, inventory and fluxes of trace metals (e. g., Hg) in the environment. Moreover, these data may be used to minimize the impact on public health, and reconstruct the historical input for improving management strategies. To examine the anthropogenic alteration in the system, 22 sediment vibra-cores were collected throughout the bay and analyzed using ^ 210 Pb and ^ 137 Cs radioisotope geochronology, grain size, XRF, X-radiography, Hg concentration, lignin content and composition, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. Geochronology from these cores was used to determine sedimentation rates and correlated to Hg profiles to estimate input histories. The results show the highest sedimentation rates correspond to areas of highest Relative Sea Level Rise (RSLR), and are of the same order of magnitude.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In coal mining, {{the most}} {{favourable}} and most easily won coal reserves are depleted first, typically from {{within a single}} coal seam. A recent trend in Australia {{and elsewhere in the}} world is to attempt to recover coal from multiple seams within a single site, a practice known as multi-seam mining. With longwall mining becoming one of the safest and most economical means of underground extraction of coal in Australia, we are likely to see {{an increase in the number}} of multi-seam longwall mining operations. Evidence thus far has indicated that the geomechanics of multi-seam longwall mining differs from that of single-seam longwall mining, especially with respect to variations in mine stability and subsidence. The overarching aim of this Thesis is to critically compare predicted stresses and deformations for single-seam and multi-seam longwall mines based on commonly used constitutive laws and continuum-based modelling assumptions. The main approach used to predict stresses and deformations is the displacement finite element method. Finite element limit analyses of roof collapse are also considered. In all cases, twodimensional (plane strain) conditions were assumed, and focus is on relatively wide longwall panels at shallow depth, known as supercritical longwall panels. Key objectives are to predict stress redistributions in multi-seam longwall mines, roof collapse in underground openings, and <b>subsidence</b> <b>profiles</b> above single-seam and multi-seam longwall mines. The changes in the vertical and horizontal stress distribution due to the extraction of a series of parallel longwall panels were predicted using isotropic and anisotropic linear elastic constitutive laws to represent the coal measure strata. The key finding from the study of vertical stress redistribution is that the abutment angle, the overburden depth, the pillar width and the anisotropic behaviour most influence the change in the in situ vertical stress in the lower seam. The redistribution of horizontal stress originally transmitted through the overburden generates smaller changes to the in situ stresses in the rock strata below the first mined seam than is predicted for the vertical stress. Transversely isotropic material causes the vertical stresses imposed onto the chain pillars to be transferred deeper into the underlying strata. The implications of the findings are that the predicted rapid changes in vertical stress with horizontal distance in transverse isotropic strata behaviour are likely to be reflected in more sudden changes in rock mass response which pose a safety risk. The differences occurring in predictions of roof collapse in underground rectangular cavities using the Hoek-Brown and Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria were evaluated. The predicted shape of the failure surface is shown to be governed by the friction angle of the rock mass. The friction angle also governs the so-called critical width, which corresponds to the boundary between subcritical and supercritical failure of the overburden. The predictions of the critical width matches best field observations in the New South Wales coalfields when the linear Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is used with a friction angle of approximately 30 degrees. The prediction of the critical width when using the Hoek-Brown failure criterion overestimates the value observed in the field. This is because the Hoek-Brown failure criterion corresponds to effectively high friction angles in the range of tensile and very low confining stresses encountered in the strata above underground openings. Stability charts for rectangular cavities using the Hoek-Brown failure criterion and two forms of the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion are presented to enable designers of underground openings to predict rapidly the safe widths of underground cavities. Predictions of vertical <b>subsidence</b> <b>profiles</b> above single-seam and multi-seam longwall panels are compared using various constitutive laws to represent the coal measure strata and goaf. A key finding is that the best agreement between the numerical predictions and the field observations, for both the single-seam and multi-seam supercritical longwall cases, is when the coal measure strata is represented as an elastic material with closely spaced frictionless interfaces representing bedding planes. Representing the coal measure strata as a bedded material also allows for the vertical stresses to return to the level of the original overburden stress in the caved goaf material within the first seam, prior to extraction of the second seam. The results show that more sophisticated and numerically taxing constitutive laws do not necessarily lead to more accurate results when compared to field measurements. A case study based on a multi-seam mine in the Hunter Valley assists in validating the conclusions made in the comparative study. The findings presented in this Thesis will enable engineers to design economically viable multi-seam longwall mines, while still meeting legislative needs in terms of the environment and safety of personnel...|$|R

ERS and ENVISAT time series, covering approximately an 11 -year period (between 1999 and 2010), were produced showing mainly linear subsidence behaviour for almost the entire area under study, but increasing rates that reach up to 285 mm/yr.

Thus, a methodology for identification of probable fracturing zones based on discrimination and modelling of the non-linear (quadratic function) component is presented. This component was mapped and temporal <b>subsidence</b> evolution <b>profiles</b> were constructed across areas where notable acceleration (maximum of 8 mm/yr 2) or deceleration (maximum of − 9 mm/yr 2) is found.

The maximum, minimum, and mean subsidence rates are − 68.7, − 1.3, and − 33.7  mm/year, respectively. The subsidence rate map, the optical images, and our in situ investigations {{in the study area}} demonstrate that the subsidence pattern is highly related to land-use categories (i.e., industrial lands, residential lands, agricultural lands, commercial lands, etc.). The uneven subsidence in this area is attributed to aquifer compression caused by the unbalanced pumping of groundwater in different types of lands. Further inspections of the <b>subsidence</b> rate <b>profiles</b> of the transportation facilities and the land-use categories around them indicate that groundwater pumping has indeed affected the road network being studied.

This study aims at extending the knowledge of footing subsidence causing by ground water pumping by considering various well and load conditions.

40|$|Salts are mined {{for both}} storage and {{extraction}} purposes, either via dry or solution mining techniques. For operational, environmental and geological purposes, {{it is important}} to understand and predict the in situ behaviour of salt, in particular the creep and strength characteristics. A micro-mechanically based explanation and quantification of primary (strainhardening) creep in rocksalt have not yet been reported. Creep models for primary creep are still mainly based on curve fitting. At relatively low temperatures (0 - 200 °C), as encountered near all excavations, the primary creep phase is very important, certainly at laboratory time scales. Since understanding of the mechanism may be important in extrapolating relatively short term laboratory tests to long term creep in situ, an attempt is made in this thesis to explain (and simulate) both primary and secondary (steady state) creep via a micro-mechanical approach. Deformation in this model is governed by dislocation motion, which becomes increasingly hindered with strain by crystal lattice defects, resulting in strain hardening. The defects in turn are assumed to be dislocation dipoles (two mutually trapped dislocations of opposite sign). Recovery in this model is related to the thermally activated generation of vacancies and interstitials by the disintegration of dipoles consisting of very near dislocations. These vacancies and interstitials in turn precipitate on other (more rigid) dipoles, allowing them to annihilate by climb. This model describes the observed measurements very well, especially in describing transition zones after changing a strain rate. Unfortunately this model does not result in a simple constitutive equation, although possible in theory. Simpler, but for general practice usually sufficiently accurate, curve-fitting laws have been implemented in the DIANA Finite Element Code, now capable of simulating salt creep behaviour. Rocksalt at greater depth is usually impermeable, thus forming a good seal against fluid penetration. A combination of high deviatoric and low confining stresses leads to dilation and even failure during deformation. Tensile stresses can result in micro- or macro-fracturing of the salt. These mechanisms affect the sealing capacity of salt. Contrary to common opinion so far, it is shown here that fluid pressures (as present in, for instance, caverns or aquifers) do not increase the salt's bearing capacity. Hence, salt needs to be treated like a Terzaghi material, subtracting fluid pressures from the stress field when determining dilation or fracture criteria. The risk of fracturing or failure implies that care should be taken with cavern operations. In fluid storage caverns, fracturing can occur after a period of lowcavern pressures and subsequent filling and pressurising. The stress field around the cavern may be relaxed, whereby the salt stress no longer coincides with the initial stress situation. Fractures become possible, particularly if the cavern is. not embedded in a large salt mass but is close to a non-creeping overburden, taking stresses from the salt by arching eventually. Similarly, such a stress relaxation can lead to a fracture connecting an aquifer to a cavern or mine, flooding being the result. Another consequence of the relatively easy fracturing of salts is that large fluid volumes cannot be sealed permanently by plugging the cavern entrance (casing). Density differences between fluid and rocksalt will finally lead to an excess fluid pressure near the top (roof) of the cavern, resulting in permeation and fracturation of the cavern roof, resulting in cavern fluid leakage. Although occurring very slowly, the caverns will vanish in time, resulting in surface subsidence. Special attention has been paid to the Veendam solution mines, which have been mined in multicomponent salts (sodium, magnesium, potassium salts). These offer unique opportunities to observe creep and fracture related features over a short period of time (compared to caverns constructed in rocksalt only). Abandonment of solution-mined caverns containing magnesium salts should be preceded by squeeze, to minimise the cavern volume first. Squeeze-related subsidence is forced to appear within operational periods, when valuable magnesium brine can be produced. Drilling and development of new caverns can be postponed, saving on investments and operational costs. Finite element calculations have been performed to simulate a squeeze test of 150 000 m 3 in one of the caverns. Calculated cavern convergence over time and the associated surface subsidence coincided well with the test measurements. They indicate that squeeze can be performed safely. <b>Subsidence</b> <b>profiles</b> for longer periods of time (i. e. larger cavern volume reductions) have been created, serving as a base for studies on the consequences of subsidence.
