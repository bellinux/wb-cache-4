40|$|Here is {{just some}} {{of what we are}} given to {{understand}} John Chamberlain’s art as being like: car wrecks and dancers, artichokes and mummies and giant phalluses, drapery, a football player, ornaments for an immense Christmas tree and monstrous jungle-gyms, a <b>sucked</b> <b>egg,</b> and Titans beside themselves with rage. Next, a long list of the art-historical movements that his pieces have brought to mind: the baroque and rococo, neoclassicism, Cubism, Dada and Surrealism, both Abstract Expressionism and Pop, and also Minimalism and Process art. And, lastly, a very long list of the artists whose works Chamberlain’s are said to resemble in one way or another: Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Peter Paul Rubens, Auguste Rodin, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning, David Smith, Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, Mark di Suvero, and Donald Judd. Chamberlain himself has taken part in this frenzy as well. He mentioned in various instances how his objects are like jigsaw puzzles, like a girl he used to know in Philadelphia, like lasagna, and like sex. And why not? Certainly some will judge this breathtaking list of likenesses as ample proof of artistic achievement, a body of work so wide open that evidently this or that piece corresponds with about anything you could want it to. But one might also pause to marvel at the forced associations across fifty years of writing on Chamberlain’s art and wonder why we cannot get over {{trying to figure out what}} his creations remind us of, what they evoke, what they are similar to. We risk missing all that is new in the work when we cast about for likenesses to everything we already know...|$|E

Birds less than thee by far, like prophets, do Tell us, 'tis coming, though not by Cuckoo. Nor dost thou summer have away with thee, Though thou a yawling bawling Cuckoo be. When thou dost cease among us to appear, Then doth our harvest bravely crown our year. But thou hast fellows, some like thee can do Little but <b>suck</b> our <b>eggs,</b> and sing Cuckoo.

40|$|Randomly sampled oothecae of {{a natural}} {{population}} of Gratiana spadicea from the outskirts of Porto Alegre, RS, were dissected. The overlapping of the egg membranes makes possible to enumerate the eggs in a batch and therefore to relate mortality to position in the ootheca. The ootheca of this cassid provides a spatial refuge for some of its eggs. Successful eggs of G. spadicea amounted to less than one fifth of the total in each batch. Parasitoids and predators were responsible for a high mortality of eggs whatever {{the size of the}} ootheca. The main cause of mortality was the eulophid wasp Emersonella ooecia De Santis, 1983. A large proportion of <b>eggs</b> were <b>sucked</b> dry by the mirid Tupiocoris cincticornis (Stal, 1860). The <b>sucked</b> <b>eggs</b> could have contained either the embryo of G. spadicea or the parasitoid in the pre-emergence stages...|$|R
5000|$|Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to <b>Suck</b> <b>Eggs</b> (or {{as simply}} {{referred}} to as Psalm 69) is the common title for the fifth studio album by industrial metal band Ministry, released in 1992 on Sire Records. The actual title of the album is ΚΕΦΑΛΗΞΘ, which {{is made up of}} [...] (kephalē), a Greek word meaning [...] "head" [...] (and by extension [...] "heading" [...] or [...] "chapter"), and ΞΘ, the number 69 in Greek numerals. The title Psalm 69 is used for simplicity's sake. The album gave Ministry a more mainstream audience, with the track [...] "Jesus Built My Hotrod" [...] receiving major airplay on MTV and various other music stations. Psalm 69 also marked Ministry's first release with guitarist Mike Scaccia, who was recruited by band frontman and founder Al Jourgensen in 1989.|$|R
60|$|Now {{you must}} remember, {{whenever}} {{you have to}} do with him, that Analysis, like fire, is a very good servant, but a very bad master. For, having got his freedom only of late years or so, he is, like young men when they come suddenly to be their own masters, apt to be conceited, and to fancy that he knows everything, when really he knows nothing, and can never know anything, but only knows about things, which is a very different matter. Indeed, nowadays he pretends that he can teach his old grandmother, Madam How, not only how to <b>suck</b> <b>eggs,</b> but to make eggs into the bargain; while the good old lady just laughs at him kindly, and lets him run on, because she knows he will grow wiser in time, and learn humility by his mistakes and failures, as I hope you will from yours.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} poverty is {{particularly}} acute in India. With 14 {{percent of the}} world's population, we have the misfortune of having almost twice as large {{a share of the}} world's poor. Indeed, as I shall presently underline, the question of poverty and its amelioration has {{been at the center of}} our concerns from the beginning of our planning efforts almost four decades ago. Little therefore can be said on it that some distinguished Indian economist has not already said. In some ways, therefore, to talk on the design of public policy for poverty to an Indian audience is to carry coal to Newcastle or, as the old saying goes, to teach your grandmother how to <b>suck</b> <b>eggs.</b> Nonetheless, I hope to provide a fresh perspective by putting the problem into an explicit analytical framework that permits alternative policy designs to be sharply defined and contrasted. I also intend to draw on international experience to put our efforts and problems into both historical and comparative perspectives...|$|R
5000|$|The {{influence}} of Reznor's conflict {{with his former}} label, TVT, is evident in multiple aspects of the EP.

[...] These comments are likely directed towards TVT Records' Steve Gottlieb, who refused to let Reznor out of his contract, sparking legal battles between the two parties. The [...] "no thanks" [...] part may be a response to the liner notes of Ministry's Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to <b>Suck</b> <b>Eggs</b> album, which featured a cryptic [...] "no thanks, you know who you are."
