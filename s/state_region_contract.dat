40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{wine grape}} supply contracts {{used in the}} main grape growing regions of Australia. An empirical analysis provides insight into specific aspects of contract design and implementation. Statistical analyses of sample data reveal differences between <b>regions</b> in <b>contract</b> specifications. Lower quality grape growing regions place a greater reliance on grape quality assessment to determine bonus/penalty payments compared to higher quality <b>regions.</b> <b>Contracts</b> in higher quality regions place greater emphasis on explicit winery involvement and direction in vineyard management. Results indicate that longer duration contracts are more inclusive {{in terms of the}} number of clauses included. Evidence of risk shifting (i. e., winery to grower) for high quality grapes is reported, where the price received by growers is determined by the bottle price of the wine produced. ...|$|R

50|$|Stars {{form when}} clumps of {{hydrogen}} and other gases in an H II <b>region</b> <b>contract</b> {{under their own}} gravity. As the gas collapses, the central clump grows stronger and the gas heats to extreme temperatures by converting gravitational potential energy to thermal energy. If the temperature gets high enough, nuclear fusion will ignite and form a protostar. The protostar is 'born' when it begins to emit enough radiative energy to balance out its gravity and halt gravitational collapse.|$|R
