The response of central London authorities both pre- and post- September 11 th is used as the lens through which to view attempts to reduce the real and perceived threat of terrorist attack through the adoption of territorial approaches to security, both physical and technological, which are increasingly being utilized at ever-expanding spatial scales.

40|$|BGV-style {{homomorphic}} encryption schemes over polynomial rings, rely {{for their}} <b>security</b> on <b>rings</b> of very large dimension. This large dimension is needed {{because of the}} large modulus-to-noise ratio in the key-switching matrices that are used for the top few levels of the evaluated circuit. However, larger noise (and hence smaller modulus-to-noise ratio) is used in lower levels of the circuit, so from a security standpoint it is permissible to switch to lower-dimension rings, thus speeding up the homomorphic operations for the lower levels of the circuit. However, implementing such ring-switching is nontrivial, since these schemes rely on the ring algebraic structure for their homomorphic properties. A basic ring-switching operation was used by Brakerski, Gentry and Vaikuntanathan, over polynomial rings of the form Z[X]/(X 2 n + 1), in the context of bootstrapping. In this work we generalize and extend this technique to work over any cyclotomic ring and show how it can be used not only for bootstrapping but also during the computation itself (in conjunction with the “packed ciphertext ” techniques of Gentry, Halevi and Smart.)

The main fort built by the Reddy dynasty and refurbished by subsequent rulers, located at a height of nearly 320 m, was considered then as one of the strongest forts in the region. 21 structures have been identified within the fort. Its fortifications built with granite stones comprise huge ramparts, magazines, warehouses, granaries and wells. There are two entry gates into the forts, called the ‘Kolepalli Darwaza’ and the ‘Nadella Darwaza’. The entrance gate is three storied, massive and made of granite stone blocks. A building built with rock pillars and covered with rock slabs, has110 m long inscriptions. A defense bunker is also seen. The source of water supply to the inhabitants of the fort was from three sources namely, the Mutyalama Cheruvu, the Puttalamma Cheruvu and the Vedulla Cheruvu (‘Cheruvu’ in Telugu language means “pond”).

40|$|System {{security}} {{is a prerequisite for}} efficient day-to-day transactions. As a consequence, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are commonly used to provide an effective <b>security</b> <b>ring</b> to systems in a network. An IDS operates by inspecting packets flowing in the network for malicious content. To do so, an IDS like Snort[49] compares bytes in a packet with a database of prior reported attacks. This functionality can also be viewed as string matching of the packet bytes with the attack string database. Snort commonly uses the Aho-Corasick algorithm[2] to detect attacks in a packet. The Aho-Corasick algorithm works by first constructing a Finite State Machine (FSM) using the attack string database. Later the FSM is traversed with the packet bytes. The main advantage of this algorithm is that it provides a linear time search irrespective of the number of strings in the database. The issue however lies in devising a practical implementation. The FSM thus constructed gets very bloated in terms of the storage size, and so is area inefficient. This also affects its performance efficiency as the memory footprint also grows. Another issue is the limited scope for exploiting any parallelism due to the inherent sequential nature in a FSM traversal. This thesis explores hardware and software techniques to accelerate attack detection using the Aho-Corasick algorithm. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we investigate techniques to improve the area and performance efficiency of an IDS. Notable among our contributions, includes a pipelined architecture that accelerates accesses to the most frequently accessed node in the FSM. The second part of this thesis studies the resilience of an IDS to evasion attempts. In an evasion attempt an adversary saturates the performance of an IDS to disable it, and thereby gain access to the network. We explore an evasion attempt that significantly degrades the performance of the Aho-Corasick al- gorithm used in an IDS. As a counter measure, we propose a parallel architecture that improves the resilience of an IDS to an evasion attempt. The final part of this thesis explores techniques to exploit the network traffic characteristic. In our study, we observe significant redundancy in the payload bytes. So we propose a mechanism to leverage this redundancy in the FSM traversal of the Aho-Corasick algorithm. We have also implemented our proposed redundancy-aware FSM traversal in Snort.

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a virtual-machine monitor (VMM) security kernel for the VAX archi-tecture. The paper particularly focuses on how the system’s hardware, microcode, and software are aimed at meeting Al-level security requirements while maintaining the standard interfaces and applications of the VMS and ULTRIX- 32 operating systems. The VAX Security Kernel supports multiple concurrent virtual machines on a single VAX system, providing isolation and con-trolled sharing of sensitive data. Rigorous engineering standards were applied during development to comply with the assurance requirements for verification and configuration management. The VAX Security Kernel has been developed with a heavy emphasis on performance and system management tools. The kernel performs sufficiently well that much of its development was carried out in virtual machines running on the kernel itself, rather than in a conventional time-sharing system.

(IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 2017) {{designed}} a new computational fuzzy extractor and physical unclonable function (PUF) challenge-response protocol {{based on the}} Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem. The protocol requires no irreversible state updates on the PUFs for security, like burning irreversible fuses, and can correct for significant measurement noise when compared to PUFs using a conventional (information theoretical secure) fuzzy extractor. However, Herder et al. did not implement their protocol. In this paper, we give the first implementation of a challenge response protocol based on computational fuzzy extractors. Our main insight is that “confidence information” {{does not need to}} be kept private, if the noise vector is independent of the confidence information, e. g., the bits generated by ring oscillator pairs which are physically placed close to each other. This leads to a construction which is a simplified version of the design of Herder et al. (also building on a ring oscillator PUF).

40|$|Group {{signatures}} are {{a modern}} cryptographic primitive that allow {{a member of}} a specific group (e. g., “the White House staff ” or “employees of Corporation X that publish press releases”) to sign messages on behalf of the group as a whole; i. e., without revealing their individual identities and thus providing them with a certain degree of anonymity and privacy. They have quite a number of potential applications (and in fact have been incorporated into the latest version of the Trusted Platform Module, or TPM), and are still an active area of research. In this work, we explore group signatures and the many variations that have been considered since their original introduction in 1991 by Chaum and van Heyst. We furthermore discuss the basic primitives used to realize group signatures and their numerous definitions of security; we then outline a generic group signature construction (due to Bellare, Micciancio, and Warinschi) that achieves the strongest notion of security and give intuition for how it does this. As a complement to group signatures we also consider ring signatures, in which users can enjoy anonymity properties similar to those of group signatures but can form their groups in an adhoc manner; i. e., without any setup or consent required from the other members of these “ad-hoc groups, ” or rings. We again consider the different notions of <b>security</b> for <b>ring</b> signatures, as well as the different variations on the original concept introduced by Rivest, Shamir, and Tauman in 2001. We then outline a ring signature construction (due to Shacham and Waters) that achieves the strongest notion of security, and conclude with a discussion of open problems for both group and ring signatures. ...|$|R
