40|$|The {{environmental}} {{quality of soil}} polluted by mercury and lead in typical polymetallic deposit areas of western Hunan province and its natural and human causes were studied. It was found that western Hunan province is a high regional geochemical abnormal region on mercury and lead. The concentrations of mercury and lead <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> <b>in</b> mercury deposit areas were 1315 and 3. 1 times {{higher than that of}} the average background of <b>soils</b> <b>in</b> China respectively, while those <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> <b>in</b> lead-zinc deposit areas were 14. 8 and 16. 1 times higher. Using geoaccumulation index developed by Muller, it was found that either mercury deposit area or lead-zinc deposit area in western Hunan province is polluted by the two elements, the majority <b>soils</b> <b>in</b> mercury deposit areas are seriously polluted by mercury with middle polluted or light polluted by lead, while the majority <b>soils</b> <b>in</b> lead-zinc deposit areas are middle polluted or middle-heavily polluted by lead and middle-heavily polluted by mercury. The sources of metal pollutants <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> <b>in</b> the deposit areas are natural and human causal, the spatial distribution of mercury and lead are dominated by original geochemical situation but seriously affected by human mining activities...|$|R

5|$|A {{nutritional}} {{analysis of}} P.indusiatus (based on specimens collected from Nigeria) {{determined that the}} egg stage of the fungus contains (per 100g of fungus, dry weight) 33.6g of crude protein, 1.66g of fat, and 3.98g of carbohydrates. The egg stage was also measured to comprise 20.9g dietary fibre, and 88.76% moisture. The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of P.indusiatus is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including potassium, sodium, and iron, was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the mineral composition in the fungus is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in the <b>soil</b> <b>in</b> which they grow.|$|E
5|$|After {{signing the}} truce, Muhammad {{assembled}} an expedition against the Jewish oasis of Khaybar, {{known as the}} Battle of Khaybar. This was possibly due to housing the Banu Nadir who were inciting hostilities against Muhammad, or to regain prestige from what appeared as the inconclusive result of the truce of Hudaybiyya. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad also sent letters to many rulers, asking them to convert to Islam (the exact date is given variously in the sources). He sent messengers (with letters) to Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire (the eastern Roman Empire), Khosrau of Persia, the chief of Yemen and to some others.
