5000|$|The <b>subflow</b> system, used {{to gather}} {{multiple}} standard TCP connections (the paths from one host to another). Subflows are identified during the TCP three-way handshake. After the handshake, an application can add or remove some subflows (subtypes 0x3 and 0x4).|$|E
50|$|In {{standard}} TCP, {{the connection}} {{should be established}} between two IP addresses. Each TCP connection is identified by a four-tuple (source and destination addresses and ports). Given this restriction, an application can only create one TCP connection through a single link. Multipath TCP allows the connection to use several paths simultaneously. For this, Multipath TCP creates one TCP connection, called <b>subflow,</b> over each path {{that needs to be}} used.|$|E
3000|$|As {{discussed}} in Section 3.2, when we perform packing on the circular network by unwrapping it to a linear network, {{it is possible}} for a flow to be cut into two <b>subflows.</b> Each clockwise unidirectional packing contains at least one flow that does not generate <b>subflows</b> (a flow cannot have more than N hops). As a corollary, if the clockwise packing contains a flow that has been cut into two <b>subflows,</b> then the packing must contain at least two flows to start with. One of these <b>subflows</b> will be relegated to a future packing exercise. So, each clockwise packing reduces the number of remaining flows to be packed by at least one. For the matching counterclockwise packing, at most one flow will be cut into two <b>subflows.</b> Thus, the matching counterclockwise packing does not increase the number of remaining counter-clockwise flow. Recall from the discussion in Section 3.2 that for [...] "traffic balance" [...] successive dual packings will start with clockwise and counterclockwise packings in an alternate manner. Thus, successive dual packings will reduce the numbers of remaining clockwise and counterclockwise flows by at least one alternately.|$|R

This feature enables peer devices to continue data transfer with the open <b>subflow</b> after a new IP address is acquired for the same interface or from different interface. A handover for a smartphone can be from Wi-Fi to 3 G/ 4 G network after it is disconnected from the Wi-Fi network.

30|$|As {{soon as the}} MD is {{disconnected}} from the Wi-Fi network, the data transfer shifts to the backup <b>subflow</b> (B denotes the data transfer duration). The REMOVE_ADDR (step 8) option is sent through the 3 G/ 4 G <b>subflow</b> to inform the VM that the previous IP address is no longer available. At step 9, an ACK message is sent from the VM to the MD.|$|E
30|$|Although ADD_ADDR 22 advertises the {{existence}} of the additional IP address, no <b>subflow</b> can be started with the additional interface before the VM is migrated. Since the IP address assigned to the additional interface is from a different LAN after migration, the VM is unreachable through this interface. But the connection from the MD will keep trying to create a new <b>subflow</b> with the new IP address of the VM.|$|E

40|$|Multipath TCP (MPTCP) {{allows the}} {{concurrent}} use of mul-tiple paths between two end points, {{and as such}} holds great promise for improving application performance. However, in this paper, we report a newly discovered class of attacks on MPTCP that may jeopardize and hamper its wide-scale adoption. The attacks stem from the interdependence be-tween the multiple <b>subflows</b> in anMPTCP connection. MPTCP congestion control algorithms are designed to achieve re-source pooling and fairness with single-path TCP users at shared bottlenecks. Therefore, multiple MPTCP <b>subflows</b> are inherently coupled with each other, resulting in potential side-channels that can be exploited to infer cross-path prop-erties. In particular, an ISP monitoring one or more paths used by an MPTCP connection can infer sensitive and pro-prietary information (e. g., level of network congestion, end-to-end TCP throughput, packet loss, network delay) about its competitors. Since the side-channel information enabled by the coupling among the <b>subflows</b> in an MPTCP connection results directly from the design goals of MPTCP conges-tion control algorithms, it is not obvious how to circumvent this attack easily. We believe our findings provide insights {{that can be used}} to guide future security-related research on MPTCP and other similar multipath extensions...|$|R

Extending MPTCP to add more control information into the session becomes cumbersome as the TCP option space is limited to 40 bytes. This draft introduces a control stream that allows to send control information as part of the <b>subflow’s</b> payload. The control stream is mapped into a separate sequence number space and uses a TLV-format for maximum extensibility. It is left to future documents to specify how the TLV-format might be used to exchange control information. As the control stream is sent as part of the <b>subflow’s</b> payload, it is not subject to the 40 bytes limitation of the TCP option space...|$|R

The constraint belongs to the class of IEEE 802.11 protocol interference models and is hence simple to implement in a distributed way in ad hoc networks. In the ad hoc network context, we do not use clique-based interference models, e.g., [6], which may have significant computation overheads in ad hoc networks and have to reduce a clique capacity sufficient enough for feasible <b>subflow</b> schedules. Signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR)-based physical interference models [24] may be more accurately applied to multi-radio multi-channel networks, but the computational complexity of calculating SINR in the ad hoc environment may be significantly high.|$|E

For a countable group G, the Bernoulli flow 2 G consists of all functions from G to 2 together with the shift action of G given by (g ·α) (h) = α(g− 1 h). A G-subflow is a compact shift-invariant subset X ⊆ 2 G. Two subflows are isomorphic, X ∼ = Y, {{if there is a}} homeomorphism ϕ: X → Y which commutes with the shift, i. e., ϕ(g ·α) = g ·ϕ(α).

40|$|Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is an {{extension}} to TCP which aggregates multiple parallel connections over available network interfaces. MPTCP bases its scheduling decisions on the individual RTT values observed at the <b>subflows,</b> but does not attempt to perform any kind of joint optimization over the <b>subflows.</b> Using the MPTCP scheduler as an example, {{in this paper we}} demonstrate that exploiting cross-layer information and optimizing scheduling decisions jointly over the multiple flows, can lead to significant performance gains. While our results only represent a single data point, they illustrate the need to look at MPTCP from a more holistic point of view and not treat the connections separately, as is currently being done. We call for new approaches and research into how multiple parallel connections offered by MPTCP should be used in an efficient and fair manner...|$|R
40|$|Many {{computers}} and {{devices such as}} smart phones, laptops and tablet devices are now equipped with multiple network interfaces, enabling them to use multiple paths to access content over the network. If the resources could be used concurrently, end user experience can be greatly improved. The recent studies in MPTCP suggest that improved reliability, load balancing and mobility are feasible. The thesis presents a new multipath delay based algorithm, MPPERT (Multipath Probabilistic Early response TCP), which provides high throughput and efficient load balancing. In all-PERT environment, MPPERT suffers no packet loss and maintains much smaller queue sizes compared to existing MPTCP, making it suitable for real time data transfer. MP-PERT is suitable for incremental deployment in a heterogeneous environment. It also presents a parametrized approach to tune the amount of traffic shift off the congested path. Multipath approach is benefited from having multiple connections between end hosts. However, it is desired to keep the connection set minimal as increasing number of paths may not always provide {{significant increase in the}} performance. Moreover, higher number of paths unnecessarily increase computational requirement. Ideally, we should suppress paths with low throughputs and avoid paths with shared bottlenecks. In case of MPTCP, there is no efficient way to detect a common bottleneck between <b>subflows.</b> MPTCP applies a constraint of best single-path TCP throughput, to ensure fair share at a common bottleneck link. The best path throughput constraint along with traffic shift, from more congested to less congested paths, provide better opportunity for the competing flows to achieve higher throughput. However, the disadvantage is that even if there are no shared links, the same constraint would decrease the overall achievable throughput of a multipath flow. PERT, being a delay based TCP protocol, has continuous information {{about the state of the}} queue. This information is valuable in enabling MPPERT to detect <b>subflows</b> sharing a common bottleneck and obtain a smaller set of disjoint <b>subflows.</b> This information can even be used to switch from coupled (a set of <b>subflows</b> having interdependent increase/decrease of congestion windows) to uncoupled (independent increase/decrease of congestion windows) <b>subflows,</b> yielding higher throughput when best single-path TCP constraint is relaxed. The ns- 2 simulations support MPPERT as a highly competitive multipath approach, suitable for real time data transfer, which is capable of offering higher throughput and improved reliability...|$|R
