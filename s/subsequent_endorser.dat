Procedures. (a) General. Assistance checks prepared by the central disbursing office and issued by the Treasury Department will be cleared through the banks and the paid checks will be filed in the Department of the Auditor General. However, if the check is lost, forged, or the like, the procedures set forth in subsections (b) —(k) will be followed. (b) Lost checks. Lost checks will be handled as follows: (1) Loss or nonreceipt of check by recipient. If a recipient reports the non-receipt of an assistance check, loss of an unendorsed check, or destruction of a check either endorsed or unendorsed, the Treasury Department will conduct an investigation.

5000|$|In September 2012, the U.S. Copyright Office {{published}} a [...] "Notice of Inquiry" [...] regarding establishing an artist [...] "resale royalty right" [...] in the US. [...] The Notice {{was published in}} response to a request by Representative Jerrold Nadler and Senator Herb Kohl, who had introduced droit de suite legislation in 2011. [...] The Copyright Office's <b>subsequent</b> report <b>endorsed</b> [...] "congressional consideration of a resale royalty right, or droit de suite, which would give artists a percentage of the amount paid for a work each time it is resold by another party." [...] A follow-up bill was introduced in 2014, the American Royalties Too Act, and was vigorously opposed by auction houses. The bill died in committee.|$|R
25|$|In April 1991, Militant {{decided to}} support the setting up of Scottish Militant Labour, an {{independent}} organisation in Scotland. At the same time, it decided to support independent Broad Left candidates in Liverpool standing against the official Labour Party. All five Broad Left candidates won in the May 1991 local elections. Eric Heffer, MP for Liverpool Walton died in May 1991, and the Broad Left decided to stand Militant supporter Lesley Mahmood as the candidate of 'Real Labour' at the <b>subsequent</b> by-election.. Militant <b>endorsed</b> the decision, but on the Militant executive Ted Grant and Rob Sewell opposed. Mahmood came third, just saving her deposit. It was the group's first electoral step outside the Labour Party.|$|R
50|$|But {{dissatisfaction with}} the work of the {{commission}} was felt on all sides, especially with their interpretation of the rubrics. They had been hurried in their work, and had left too much latitude for local customs. The question was reopened and the Chapter of London (1250) asked the commission to reassemble at Metz and revise their work {{in the light of the}} criticisms that had been made; the result of this revision was approved at the Chapters of Metz (1251) and Bologna (1252) and its use made obligatory for the whole order. It was also ordained that one copy of the liturgical books should be placed at Paris and one at Bologna, from which the books for the other convents should be faithfully copied. However, it was recognized that these books were not entirely perfect, leaving room for further revision. Though this work was done under the direction of John the Teuton, the brunt of the revision fell to the lot of Humbert of Romains, then provincial of the Paris Province. Humbert was elected Master General of the Chapter of Buda (1254) and was asked to direct his attention to the question of the order's liturgical books. He subjected each of them to a most thorough revision, and after two years submitted his work to the Chapter of Paris (1256). This and several <b>subsequent</b> chapters <b>endorsed</b> the work, effected legislation guarding against corruption, constitutionally recognized the authorship of Humbert, and thus once and for all settled a common rite for the Order of Preachers throughout the world.|$|R
2500|$|Carlos Hugo and {{his aides}} {{embarked}} on activist policy, launching new initiatives and ensuring that the young prince gets increasingly recognized in national media. In terms of political content the group started to advance heterodox theories, focused on society as means and objective of politics.

As orthodox Traditionalists {{got more and more}} perturbed, they tried to alarm Don Javier about apparently dissident course of his son. However, Don Javier kept assuring them that he maintained full confidence in Carlos Hugo and that while the principles remained the same, new times required new practical concepts. He also kept <b>endorsing</b> <b>subsequent</b> waves of structural changes, which combined with personal decisions in the mid-1960s left the Comunión dominated by Carlos Hugo and his entourage.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the extent and}} nature of firm compensation strategies using employee compensation data from U. S. high-technology firms. I found that firm pay level strategies influenced the pay level for strategic employee groups (i. e., managers, R&D employees) {{to a greater extent}} than the pay level for other employee groups. My analyses also revealed that firms applied consistent pay level and pay mix strategies across different employee groups. “(Strategy is defined as) the determination of the basic long-term goals and objectives of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals ” (Chandler, 1962 : 13). As suggested by Chandler, resource allocation presents a key element of corporate strategy. Granted, the way firms manage employee compensation will form one important dimension of corporate strategy as it is directly associated with the allocation of compensation budget, which accounts for more than 50 percent of operating expenses in most firms (Milkovich & Newman, 2008). Reported relationships between compensation management and <b>subsequent</b> firm performance <b>endorse</b> the strategic nature o...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of double effect {{has a very}} long history and continues {{to play an important}} role in ethical and bioethical discussions. However, the principle has been subject of incessant debates in the last few decades and many ethicists and bioethicists have explicitly denied its validity and applicability to solving important moral dilemmas. Many authors endorsing consequentialism have claimed that the {{principle of}} double effect, based on an intention-sensitive ethics, is not valid as a moral principle. Their rejection of the validity of this principle follows a well- established ethical tradition according to which intentions have no role in the moral evaluation of human actions. This dissertation has three overall aims: i) It aims at showing, in the course of textual analysis and interpretation of Aquinas's œuvre complete, that Thomas Aquinas was indeed the first author who explicitly discusses actions with one good and one bad effect and can be therefore considered the founding father of all <b>subsequent</b> moral tradition <b>endorsing</b> the principle of double effect. ii) Secondly, it demonstrates that from a historical point of view it is inadequate to continue to talk about "the principle of double effect". In the moral tradition from 13 th century to present days more than one principle of double effect [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Over 7 million {{patients}} {{present to}} emergency departments (ED) in the United States every {{year with a}} principal complaint of chest pain. 1 Most of these patients will not be diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but the morbidity and legal consequences associated with a missed diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) are significant. 2 Consequently, for patients with possible ACS, serial negative cardiac biomarkers, and nondiagnostic ECGs, the guidelines recommend routine provocative testing or an assessment for anatomic coronary artery disease (CAD) before discharge for most patients and within 72 hours of discharge for low-risk patients. If the test reveals evidence of inducible ischemia, the guidelines <b>endorse</b> <b>subsequent</b> hospitalization. 3, 4 Clinical Perspective on p 919 Despite these recommendations, there is little data to sug-gest that inpatient admission and treatment after abnormal myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in a low-risk population improve outcomes. Furthermore, the benefit of an early revas-cularization strategy in low-risk ACS is uncertain. 5 The current clinical practice to admit patients from the ED with a positive stress test {{is based on the}} assumption that the presence of myo-cardial ischemia reclassifies patients from low risk to high risk for short-term adverse events, thus justifying early revascular-ization. This assumption is unproven and has been questioned. 6 Accordingly, we conducted this study to define further the yield of rest-stress single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) MPI to detect ischemia in patients referred from the ED after serial negative troponin T testing and nondiagnostic ECGs. In addition, we assessed short-term adverse events after MPI. Finally, we investigated whether patients with ischemia realize a survival benefit with early revascularization...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{early and}} late neuropathies {{resulting}} from direct and conductive electrical patterns of injury are disabling and extremely challenging to manage. We report a patient who suffered acute onset of right-hand weakness and decreased sensation following a radar equipment–related electrical injury. He received a carpal and Guyon tunnel release, regaining sensation and strength to his right hand by the first postoperative day. Radar-induced injuries are often associated with burns that involve excess irradiation of tissues with high-energy electromagnetic radiation. Electricity, induced from electromagnetic waves, can cause extensive damage to many tissue types, depending {{on the nature of}} the energy (high or low voltage, alternating current vs direct current) as well as the conductive nature of the tissue through which the electricity is flowing. In this article, we report on a patient who suffered an electrical burn following contact with a high-energy military radar antenna and discuss possible mechanisms of injury that might have occurred. CASE REPORT A 23 -year-old, previously healthy man, on active naval duty, came in close contact with a high-energy radar antenna transformer and received an electrical injury that left burn marks on his right hand and foot. The patient was working with his hands positioned at approximately 4 to 6 inches from the transformer and saw a blue arc of electricity going from the transformer to his right hand. He was instantaneously thrown back and <b>endorsed</b> <b>subsequent</b> pain in his right upper and lower extremities. The transformer had been carrying an electrical potential of 18, 000 V. Its operating frequency, deemed classified information, cannot be reported. However, typical frequencies of operation aboard naval sea craft on radar equipment range from 400 to 10, 000 MHz. 1 Later, a discharge burn was found on the transformer, which was evidence that an electrical discharge had indeed occurred between the patient and the transformer...|$|R
