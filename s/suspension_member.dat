50|$|In {{automotive}} suspensions, {{a suspension}} link, control link or link is a <b>suspension</b> <b>member,</b> that attaches at only two points. One point being the body or {{frame of the}} vehicle and the other point attaching to the knuckle, upright, axle or another link. The link pivots on either a bushing or a ball joint at each attachment point. A link differs from a control arm because it can only control one of the degrees of freedom by itself.|$|E

50|$|Wheel rate {{is usually}} {{equal to or}} {{considerably}} less than the spring rate. Commonly, springs are mounted on control arms, swing arms or some other pivoting <b>suspension</b> <b>member.</b> Consider the example above where the spring rate was calculated to be600 lbs/inch (87.5 N/mm), {{if you were to}} move the wheel 1 in (without moving the car), the spring more than likely compresses a smaller amount. Let's assume the spring moved 0.75 in, the lever arm ratio would be 0.75:1. The wheel rate is calculated by taking the square of the ratio (0.5625) times the spring rate, thus obtaining 281.25 lbs/inch (49.25 N/mm). Squaring the ratio is because the ratio has two effects on the wheel rate. The ratio applies to both the force and distance traveled.|$|E

This new structural system of pedestrian stress-ribbon bridges includes <b>suspension</b> <b>members</b> with bending stiffness and a pre-stressed tie. The article looks into the behaviour of such suspension bridge under symmetrical and asymmetrical loads; it also presents analytical expressions for displacements, thrust forces and bending moments of such stiff <b>suspension</b> <b>members.</b> Then the article explains {{the effect of the}} cable's bending stiffness and the tie's axial stiffness on the bridge's stresses as well as the effect of the tie's pre-stressing on horizontal and vertical displacements of the bridge structure. The article then proceeds to comparative analysis, which considers the new structure and a traditional pedestrian suspension bridge. Numerical experiment determines the accuracy of the new engineering method developed for the analysis of stress-ribbon bridges. The efficiency of steel stress-ribbon bridge displacement stabilization through the bending stiffness is being discussed...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Several {{standardized}} {{courses for}} Formula SAE (FSAE) testing are introduced and described with sufficient detail to be reproduced by any Formula SAE team. Basic analysis methods for the courses are given {{as well as}} explanations of how those analyses could be used. On-car data from the Global Formula Racing (GFR) SAE cars is used to verify the analysis methods, give estimates to unknown variables, and show {{the relevance of the}} standard testing courses. Using the courses and methods described in this paper should allow standardized comparison of FSAE car performance, as well as provide a method to verify simulations and evaluate changes in vehicle performance from tuning. Instrumentation of all <b>suspension</b> <b>member</b> forces with strain gauge load cells is shown to be an extremely powerful tool for measuring vehicle performance and quantifying vehicle dynamic characteristics. The design and implementation of strain gauge load cells is described in detail to provide a template for reproducing similar results in other vehicles. Data from the GFR 2011 FSAE car is used throughout the paper to: show the design process for making effective <b>suspension</b> <b>member</b> load cells, show the calibration processes necessary to ensure quality data is collected, illustrate the calculation of suspension corner forces, and show the effectiveness of measuring vehicle dynamic characteristics with this technique. Using the methods described in this paper should provide data that allows a more complete and thorough understanding of on-car vehicle dynamics. This data may be used to validate vehicle models...|$|E
40|$|This {{is a short}} film, which {{explores the}} ideas that {{underpin}} {{the design of the}} sculpture and the presentation of three maquettes for the general public of Corby to vote on. Large-scale stainless steel public artwork and seating designs for Corby Borough Council [URL] Many aspects of my output over the past twenty years have been influenced by the history and heritage of the site destined for my landmark sculptures. The culture of a community is vital to the realisation of Public Art, and this is one significant difference between what {{can be seen in the}} rarified environment of a gallery or museum, and a public space, which everyone uses on a daily basis. Many people still feel that a gallery or museum space is not for them, despite the efforts of curators and museum directors to break down these barriers to accessing culture. So the use of public space has become an important way of integrating culture into a community and at the same time reinforce the histories and ambitions of the populace. The working method of producing steel has been a significant influence on the development of all three concepts ideas shown here at the Cube. The fluidity and malleability of white hot metal has prompted the idea of flowing movement, as shown here in these three maquettes. Part of the artwork designs relate to the construction techniques used in the manufacture of the Great Jib, where wire ropes were used to take equal shares of holding a Jib in the air. This method was later surpassed by a rigid box section for the <b>suspension</b> <b>member</b> of the Great Jib, but the use of tensioning ropes in my sculptures relate to this procedure of industrial construction of heavy machinery. The use of tensioning wires also alludes to musical instruments and the prominence that music has played within the various communities of Corbyites. The eminence of music within the Corby community is varied and spans decades. It has been used to celebrate distinctiveness and has also written as a requiem to hopes dashed and once great industries brought to an abrupt halt, such as “Steeltown” by the band, Big County 1984, formed originally in Scotland. Corby also boasts a number of creative writers and in particular poets, who have used the heritage and culture of Corby as a cultural barometer for their poetry. The technical structure of poetry with iambic pentameters, assonance, timbre and rhythm, are also a significant influence on the formal language of all three sculptures. D. H. Lawrence describes the “boom of the tingling strings” as his mother played the piano, mimicking the volume and resonance of the sound (“boom”) as well as the fine, high-pitched vibration of the strings that produced it (“tingling strings”) and in the same way my sculptures explore the visual onomatopoeia of molten steel being captured in a cascading rhythm of abstract form. My intention is to fabricate the large-scale artwork in stainless steel in order to capture the modern environment to of the railway station, and to use polished surfaces to reflect the movement of passengers and visitors to the station. I also want the sculpture to be a celebration of Corby’s renewal over the many decades of rebuilding since the 1980 ’s, when its industry and identity were brought to an abrupt halt. The railway is an important location for the sculpture because of notions of connectivity, but also because Corby can now boast a cultural iconic gateway into the town that celebrates its present and future aspirations, with only a glance to its ironstone past that once made it a worldwide hub for steel production...|$|E

40|$|Side impact {{accidents}} {{against a}} tree or pole remain the most dangerous accident scenarios in rally cars. Statistical data shows that 52 % of the fatalities between 2004 and 2009 concern crashes against a rigid pole by the track sides, whilst among those more than 60 % were side impacts. Despite the present scientific efforts, rallying cars side impacts are still among the least understood primarily due to limited space between the occupant and door sill, evolving safety regulations and vehicle dynamics. In this study, finite element dynamic characteristics of the whole car were studied. The finite element model consisted of the whole car structure and 241 parts including the engines, tyres and the <b>suspension</b> <b>members</b> with 4 different element types and 7 material models. All structural parts were modelled as low-carbon steel with the piecewise- linear-plasticity material model (mat 24). The tyres were modelled with the Blatz-Ko rubber material (mat 07) whilst also rigid and other materials (mat 020, 01, 09, S 01 and S 02) were used to represent {{different parts of the}} model, as the <b>suspension</b> <b>members,</b> <b>suspension</b> links and the engine. A rollcage and two racing seats were modelled with four-node shell elements and the use of piecewise-linear-plasticity and composite-damage materials respectively.

50|$|The MacPherson strut is {{a common}} form of strut suspension. This {{was not the first}} attempt at strut suspension, but in MacPherson's {{original}} patent, the anti-roll bar forms an integral and essential part of the suspension, in addition to its usual function in controlling body roll. A strut suspension like MacPherson's requires a hinged lower member between the chassis and wheel hub to control the wheel position both inwards and outwards (controlling the track), and also forwards and backwards. This may be provided by a wishbone with a number of joints, or by using an additional radius rod. MacPherson's design replaced the wishbone with a simpler and cheaper track control arm, with a single inboard joint, to control the track. Forward and backward position was controlled through the anti-roll bar. Overall this required a simpler and cheaper set of <b>suspension</b> <b>members</b> than with wishbones, also allowing a reduction in unsprung weight.|$|R

50|$|Silver Cross is {{well known}} for the {{manufacture}} of traditional coach-built prams, characterised by a hard body, C-spring suspension, spoked wheels and folding hood. This method of pram building was pioneered by William Wilson, an engineer and inventor from Leeds, England. Wilson went on to establish Silver Cross in 1877, marketing this type of coach-built baby carriage, and registering numerous patents for perambulator design in order to protect his unique invention. Despite refinements in techniques and manufacturing processes, the method of pram building today remains very similar to early pram building, with body panels being pressed from aluminium, riveted together and then painted to a high gloss finish. The body is then hand upholstered with a pram bed, and also decorated with fine line detail (in kind with fine lines applied to the coachwork of horse-drawn carriages - hence the term coach-built pram). The fine lines are hand painted and require considerable skill to apply. The steel suspension of the pram is hand bent around a specially shaped form in order to create the C-shaped <b>suspension</b> <b>members,</b> which are then attached to the body using leather straps. It is the C-spring suspension and leather straps that create the unique coach-built pram 'bounce'. The spoked wheels (traditionally chromed) are then attached to the suspension to complete the rolling chassis. Traditional pram wheels are large in diameter to further enhance the smooth ride. A folding fabric hood, pushing handle and covering fabric apron are then attached to the pram to complete the build. Silver Cross also manufactures a collection of coach-built dolls prams, which are scaled-down replicas of the full size prams. The dolls prams are made {{in exactly the same way}} as the real prams with the same coachwork, spoked wheels and folding hood. Silver Cross currently manufactures two models of full-size coach-built pram in the UK, the Balmoral and the Kensington, as well as two models of dolls pram, the Oberon and the Chatsworth. Silver Cross is the only pram manufacturer still producing coach-built prams in the UK.|$|R
