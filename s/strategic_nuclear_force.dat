50|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the number of submarines required to support the United States' <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> the United States Navy conducted a number of studies. Those studies looked at the number of missiles required to be at sea and on station at any given time, the number of missiles each boat should be armed with, the likelihood that a boat will remain undiscovered by the enemy and be capable of launching its missiles, and how the maintenance schedule of each boat will impact that boat’s availability to be deployed on mission. A number of cost-reduction studies were also conducted that explored multiple design and construction possibilities. The cost-reduction studies explored the possibility of adding missile tubes to the design of the Virginia class of fast-attack submarine, the possibility of building Ohio-class replacement submarines using updated Ohio-class designs, as well as developing an entirely new Ohio replacement boat design.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs the United States enters {{the decade of}} the 1990 s, it is essential to review the guidance and policies for our force structures. At the focal point of discussion on future force structures for the United States is the strategic nuclear forces. The <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> structure for the United States has been predicated on the concept of a Triad, which consists of three legs, referred to as land-based, sea-based, and manned bombers. Each of the legs consists of separate components. Understanding the tradition of the United States strategic deterrent being predicated on the Triad concept, it is concluded that with the changing international environment and the declaratory statements for continuing to decrease the Defense Budget, a new and realistic review of the factors for determining a <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> should be researched. Therefore, the intention of this thesis is to review and analyze the five factors which may contribute to the formulation of a realistic policy for the 1990 s with regard to the United States strategic nuclear forces. The final results of the research have indicated sufficient evidence that a policy review of the strategic nuclear Triad should be conducted to meet the challenges and realities of the 1990 s and the 21 st Century.

40|$|This thesis {{centers on}} {{that aspect of}} superpower {{strategic}} nuclear systems that lies beyond pure deterrence. Much has been offered {{under the rubric of}} deterrence, but little analysis of compellence has been attempted. Considering the widespread criticisms of deterrence theory, this is surprising. A comprehensive look at nuclear strategy from the conceptual framework of compellence helps clarify the limits of deterrence and indicates that deterrence and compellence are increasingly interrelated. To demonstrate these assertions, this dissertation provides a quantitative and qualitative analysis of intercontinental nuclear systems. The thesis is that nuclear strategy in the United States and the Soviet Union from 1970 - 1986 may be described at least equally well by compellence rather than deterrence. By looking closely at technological capabilities, the real capability of these nuclear systems can be more accurately determined. This analysis includes an assessment of how these nuclear systems could interact in combat, based on a Soviet correlation of nuclear forces model. This {{is the first time in}} the West that this model has been used for this purpose. It provides a unique Soviet perspective on nuclear strategy. This dissertation begins with the theoretical basis of deterrence and compellence, and then establishes two models based on these two concepts which provide the conceptual framework for the dissertation. The second chap ter examines the theoretical basis for arms control based on each paradigm. The next two chapters address alternately the American and the Soviet nuclear strategies, attempting to draw out the deterrent and compellent aspects therein. The fifth chapter narrows the focus to the role of arms control in identifying actual nuclear strategy; to what extent are the superpowers attempting to achieve foreign policy objectives in SALT I, SALT II and START. The sixth chapter considers the NATO-Warsaw Pact relationship to determine to what extent the superpowers are using their respective alliance systems in their strategic interrelationship. The next three chapters analyze quantitatively and qualitatively the American and Soviet <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> structures to determine a correlation of forces trend and develop some predictions as to the viability of each force structure in supporting its respective strategy. The paradigmatic analysis of superpower nuclear strategy clearly portrays the limitations of deterrence as an explanation for international strategic behaviour. The compellent paradigm is shown as a reasonable alternative that in many ways better explains what has happened in superpower strategic relations from 1970 - 1986...|$|E
