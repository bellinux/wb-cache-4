40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of estimating the inertial properties of small-size aerial vehicles. The proposed procedure consists in first subjecting the vehicle to a pendular motion; next, time histories of attitude and angular velocity are obtained by using an inertial measurement unit attached to the vehicle; finally, estimates of the inertia tensor components are obtained by using maximum-likelihood constrained optimization in the time domain. The experimental equipment is extremely simple to realize and of low cost. An important highlight of the proposed approach is that the inertial properties of the vehicle are estimated using specific experimental observations which can be conducted in the labora-tory prior to performing flight testing. Hence, flight trials can focus of the sole estimation of the aerodynamic parameters, easing the problem and {{improving the quality of}} the estimates. The procedure is first tested in a simulated environment, by artificially creating virtual time histories so as to verify the observability of all parameters. Then, the procedure is validated by using an object of known inertial characteristics. Finally, the document is concluded with the application of the proposed methodology to a <b>small</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> vehicle. 1 C. L. Bottasso, D. Leonello, A. Maffezzoli and F. Riccard...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presents}} an environment awareness approach for a <b>small</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> unmanned aircraft (UA) which operates at low height using {{a single line}} laser scanner which enables a height estimation with a concurrent detection of ground fixed obstacles. The approach is suitable for small UA which {{are not able to}} carry complex and heavy 3 D laser scanner mountings having additional drives or mirrors. It works without using external reference systems like DGPS. The approach was especially developed for a mission of the “International Micro Air Vehicle Conference” outdoor contest, where it is the aim to fly through a 6 x 6 m artificial gate. The sensor data processing enables the height estimation above ground as well as the detection of obstacles {{in order to meet the}} mission’s goal. The height estimation enables a near-ground flight to prevent a collision with a top boundary of the gate, and a terrain following. The obstacle detection senses the pillars of the gate and finds a safe way through the narrow gate passage. The development and optimisation of the mounting and the sensor processing, as well as the validation, was realized under operational conditions with manual remote control (RC) helicopter flights and virtual flights at a simulation environment.

"Potential {{applications of}} <b>small</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) range from military missions to {{exploration of the}} planet Mars (Patrick C. O’Brien, 2003). Tasks such as exploration of unknown territories, formation flying, intelligence gathering etc, require UAV {{to be capable of}} flying very close to other flying or steady objects.

40|$|In this paper, a {{procedure}} for estimating the inertial properties of small size aerial vehicle is illustrated. It {{has been developed}} an identification algorithm that, starting from experimental data, estimates the parameters of physical model describing the pendular motion of a rigid body. The attitude time histories of a structure (“cage”), carrying the object whose inertial properties have to be evaluated, are the experimental data and they are obtained through a measurement unit attached to the cage itself. The cage, designed {{in order to facilitate}} the assembly issues, is put in pendular motion thanks to a pivot needle shaped, placed to the cage-top and leaning against a beam. Before proceeding to the identification of aerial vehicle inertial properties, the performance of the identification algorithm has been evaluated by performing several tests. A preliminary effectiveness of the algorithm has been tested via simulation environment, by artificially creating “virtual” time histories. Next, the algorithm has been validated experimentally by loading the cage with a proof mass of known inertial characteristics. In this case, the algorithm errors have been evaluated by comparing the obtained results with the inertial properties predicted by a 3 D CAD software where both the cage and the proof mass have been modeled. During these experimental tests, specific attention has been focused on the effect of the cage on the inertial properties estimate. In particular, it has been identified a range of initial attitudes that guarantee n opportune compromise between having cage wide oscillations, needed for a correct identification, and negligible aerodynamic effects that haven’t been considered in physical model. After this algorithm test phase, the developed methodology has been applied to a <b>small</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> vehicle in order to evaluate its inertial properties...|$|E
40|$|Saturns giant moon Titan {{has become}} one of the most {{fascinating}} bodies in the Solar System. Even though it is a billion miles from Earth, data from the Cassini mission reveals that Titan has a very diverse, Earth-like surface, with mountains, fluvial channels, lakes, evaporite basins, plains, dunes, and seas [Lopes 2010] (Figure 1). But unlike Earth, Titans surface likely is composed of organic chemistry products derived from complex atmospheric photochemistry [Lorenz 2008]. In addition, Titan has an active meteorological system with observed storms and precipitation-induced surface darkening suggesting a hydrocarbon cycle analogous to Earths water cycle [Turtle 2011]. Titan is the richest laboratory in the solar system for studying prebiotic chemistry, which makes studying its chemistry from the surface and in the atmosphere one of the most important objectives in planetary science [Decadal 2011]. The diversity of surface features on Titan related to organic solids and liquids makes long-range mobility with surface access important [Decadal 2011]. This has not been possible to date, because mission concepts have had either no mobility (landers), no surface access (balloons and airplanes), or low maturity, high risk, and/or high development costs for this environment (e,g. large, self-sufficient, long-duration helicopters). Enabling in situ mobility could revolutionize Titan exploration, similarly to the way rovers revolutionized Mars exploration. Recent progress on several fronts has suggested that small-scale rotorcraft deployed as daughtercraft from a lander or balloon mothercraft may be an effective, affordable approach to expanding Titan surface access. This includes rapid progress on autonomous navigation capabilities of such aircraft for terrestrial applications and on miniaturization, driven by the consumer mobile electronics market, of high performance of sensors, processors, and other avionics components needed for such aircraft. Chemical analysis, for example with a mass spectrometer, will be important to any Titan surface mission. Anticipating that it may be more practical to host chemical analysis instruments on a mothership than a daughtercraft, we defined system and mission concepts that deploy a <b>small</b> <b>rotorcraft,</b> termed a Titan Aerial Daughtercraft (TAD), from a lander or balloon to perform high-resolution imaging and mapping, potentially land to acquire microscopic images or other in situ measurements, and acquire samples to return to analytical instruments on the mothership. In principle, the ability to recharge batteries in TAD from a radioisotope or other long-lived power source on the mothership could enable multiple sorties. For a lander-based mission, a variety of landing sites is conceivable, including near lake margins, in dry lake beds, or in regions of plains, dunes, or putative cryovolanic or impact melt features. Such missions may require landing with greater precision than in previous missions (Huygens) and mission studies; this could also enhance the ability of TAD to reach interesting terrain from the landing site. Precision descent may also benefit balloon missions, with or without a daughtercraft, by increasing the probability that the balloon will drift over desired terrain early in its mission. Given these potential benefits, the overall concept studied here includes brief consideration of precision descent for landing or balloon deployment, followed by one or more sorties by a rotorcraft deployed from the mothership, with the ability to return to the mothership...|$|E

40|$|Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) {{describe}} a {{diverse range of}} aircraft that are operated without a human pilot on-board. Unmanned aircraft range from <b>small</b> <b>rotorcraft,</b> which can fit {{in the palm of}} your hand, through to fixed wing aircraft comparable in size to that of a commercial passenger jet. The absence of a pilot on-board allows these aircraft to be developed with unique performance capabilities facilitating a wide range of applications in surveillance, environmental management, agriculture, defence, and search and rescue. However, regulations relating to the safe design and operation of UAS first need to be developed before the many potential benefits from these applications can be realised. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a Risk Management Process (RMP) should support all civil aviation policy and rulemaking activities (ICAO 2009). The RMP is described in International standard, ISO 31000 : 2009 (ISO, 2009 a). This standard is intentionally generic and high-level, providing limited guidance on how it can be effectively applied to complex socio-technical decision problems such as the development of regulations for UAS. Through the application of principles and tools drawn from systems philosophy and systems engineering, this thesis explores how the RMP can be effectively applied to support the development of safety regulations for UAS. A sound systems-theoretic foundation for the RMP is presented in this thesis. Using the case-study scenario of a UAS operation over an inhabited area and through the novel application of principles drawn from general systems modelling philosophy, a consolidated framework of the definitions of the concepts of: safe, risk and hazard is made. The framework is novel in that it facilitates the representation of broader subjective factors in an assessment of the safety of a system; describes the issues associated with the specification of a system-boundary; makes explicit the hierarchical nature {{of the relationship between the}} concepts and the subsequent constraints that exist between them; and can be evaluated using a range of analytic or deliberative modelling techniques. Following the general sequence of the RMP, the thesis explores the issues associated with the quantified specification of safety criteria for UAS. A novel risk analysis tool is presented. In contrast to existing risk tools, the analysis tool presented in this thesis quantifiably characterises both the societal and individual risk of UAS operations as a function of the flight path of the aircraft. A novel structuring of the risk evaluation and risk treatment decision processes is then proposed. The structuring is achieved through the application of the Decision Support Problem Technique; a modelling approach that has been previously used to effectively model complex engineering design processes and to support decision-making in relation to airspace design. The final contribution made by this thesis is in the development of an airworthiness regulatory framework for civil UAS. A novel "airworthiness certification matrix" is proposed as a basis for the definition of UAS "Part 21 " regulations. The outcome airworthiness certification matrix provides a flexible, systematic and justifiable method for promulgating airworthiness regulations for UAS. In addition, an approach for deriving "Part 1309 " regulations for UAS is presented. In contrast to existing approaches, the approach presented in this thesis facilitates a traceable and objective tailoring of system-level reliability requirements across the diverse range of UAS operations. The significance of the research contained in this thesis is clearly demonstrated by its practical real world outcomes. Industry regulatory development groups and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority have endorsed the proposed airworthiness certification matrix. The risk models have also been used to support research undertaken by the Australian Department of Defence. Ultimately, it is hoped that the outcomes from this research will play a significant part in the shaping of regulations for civil UAS, here in Australia and around the world...|$|E
40|$|Proximity {{operations}} of small rotary wing air vehicles pose a unique challenge {{due to the}} downwash they generate.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{research shows}} a <b>small</b> unmanned <b>rotorcraft</b> system with onboard processing and a vision sensor can produce autonomous, collision-free flight in a restricted maneuverability environment with no a priori knowledge {{by using a}} gap-aiming behavior inspired by flying animals. Current approaches to autonomous flight with small unmanned aerial systems (SUAS) concentrate on detecting and explicitly avoiding obstacles. In contrast, biology indicates that birds, bats, and insects do the opposite; they react to open spaces, or gaps in the environment, with a gap_aiming behavior. Using flying animals as inspiration a behavior-based robotics approach is taken to implement and test their observed gap-aiming behavior in three dimensions. Because biological studies were unclear whether the flying animals were reacting to the largest gap perceived, the closest gap perceived, {{or all of the}} gaps three approaches for the perceptual schema were explored in simulation: detect_closest_gap, detect_largest_gap, and detect_all_gaps. The result of these simulations was used in a proof-of-concept implementation on a 3 DRobotics Solo quadrotor platform in an environment designed to represent the navigational diffi- culties found inside a restricted maneuverability environment. The motor schema is implemented with an artificial potential field to produce the action of aiming {{to the center of the}} gap. Through two sets of field trials totaling fifteen flights conducted with a small unmanned quadrotor, the gap-aiming behavior observed in flying animals is shown to produce repeatable autonomous, collision-free flight in a restricted maneuverability environment. Additionally, using the distance from the starting location to perceived gaps, the horizontal and vertical distance traveled, and the distance from the center of the gap during traversal the implementation of the gap selection approach performs as intended, the three-dimensional movement produced by the motor schema and the accuracy of the motor schema are shown, respectively. This gap-aiming behavior provides the robotics community with the first known implementation of autonomous, collision-free flight on a small unmanned quadrotor without explicit obstacle detection and avoidance as seen with current implementations. Additionally, the testing environment described by quantitative metrics provides a benchmark for autonomous SUAS flight testing in confined environments. Finally, the success of the autonomous collision-free flight implementation on a <b>small</b> unmanned <b>rotorcraft</b> and field tested in a restricted maneuverability environment could have important societal impact in both the public and private sectors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Successful {{operation}} of a miniature rotorcraft re-lies on capabilities including automated guidance, trajectory following, and teleoperation; all of which require accurate estimates of the vehicle’s body velocities and Euler angles. For larger rotorcraft that operate outdoors, the traditional approach is to combine a highly accurate IMU with GPS measurements. However, for <b>small</b> scale <b>rotorcraft</b> that op-erate indoors, lower quality MEMS IMUs are used because of limited payload. In indoor applications GPS is usually not available, and state estimates based on IMU measurements drift over time. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for state estimation that combines a dynamic flight model, IMU measurements, and 3 D velocity estimates computed from an onboard monocular camera using computer vision. Our work differs from existing approaches in that, rather than using a single vision algorithm to update the vehicle’s state, we capitalize on the strengths of multiple vision al-gorithms by integrating them into a meta-algorithm for 3 D motion estimation. Experiments are conducted on two real helicopter platforms in a laboratory environment for differ-ent motion types to demonstrate and evaluate the effective-ness of our approach...|$|R
