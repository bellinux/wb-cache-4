50|$|Chambers {{pulls back}} on the yoke in a banking left turn, but an engine clips the derrick and catches fire. Chambers {{immediately}} hits the fire extinguishing button, and the flames are momentarily extinguished. Because the aircraft is at such a low altitude, the sudden loss of airspeed threatens to stall the airplane. As the engine reignites, Chambers is forced to use another fire suppression bottle. But by this time, the aircraft <b>stall</b> <b>alarm</b> is activated and the aircraft's tail hits the water. All the passengers wake up, and realizing what is happening, most panic. Chambers is able to pull up, but the plane's right wing hits the water again. The plane lifts into the air for a moment, then hits the water. Because of the hard impact, the plane becomes grounded in the ocean and begins to sink.|$|E
5000|$|A brief {{bulletin}} by Air France {{indicated that}} [...] "the misleading stopping and starting of the <b>stall</b> warning <b>alarm,</b> contradicting the actual {{state of the}} aircraft, greatly contributed to the crew's difficulty in analyzing the situation." ...|$|R
50|$|Unprocessed events queued {{up after}} the alarm system failure and the primary server failed within 30 minutes. Then all {{applications}} (including the <b>stalled</b> <b>alarm</b> system) were automatically transferred to the backup server, which itself failed at 14:54. The server failures slowed the screen refresh rate of the operators' computer consoles from 1-3 seconds to 59 seconds per screen. The lack of alarms led operators to dismiss a call from American Electric Power about the tripping and reclosure of a 345 kV shared line in northeast Ohio. But by 15:42, after the control room itself lost power, control room operators informed technical support (who were already troubleshooting the issue) of the alarm system problem.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{noted the}} lack of {{preparedness}} {{on the part of}} the aircrew and the unsuitability of the rocky ground near the airfield for emergency landings.The lack of co-ordination between the pilots at the moment when tasks were transferred meant the Captain had to manage an emergency situation, which he had not had time to analyse completely. For the same reasons, he did not rely on the co-pilot, whom he simply asked on several occasions to let go (of the controls). He likely encountered some problems in taking over control, given that he repeated the terms “let go” and “take your hand off”, this continuing until the end of the recording. The co-pilot appears to have carried out the Captain’s orders by reading back in the affirmative and indicating her willingness to act (proposal to retract the gear, radio message to the tower with the hand mike) though without being sure of the role she was supposed to play. This may, for example, have resulted in her placing her hands on the control column at the time of the <b>stall</b> warning <b>alarms,</b> which would explain the repeated requests from the Captain. She was thus not fully carrying out her role as PNF and did not monitor or at least call out the speeds as they were decreasing. The co-pilot’s offer to retract the gear was probably not even noticed by the Captain, due to his sudden excess workload.|$|R

The projects under the industry involve many parties namely the contractors, consultants, clients, suppliers, subcontractors and other project parties [...] Studies carried in Kenya have established relationship between; hiring skilled manpower and timely completion of projects, skilled manpower and quality project output, timely release of funds and project completion and supervision style and quality projects. However, none of the studies have considered the relationship between contractors and subcontractor in project delivery which is the area {{of interest in this}} study. Further, the government enactment of stiff policies and regulations to enhance quality project delivery and mutual relationship between contractors and subcontractors has not borne fruition as government continue witnessing an <b>alarming</b> <b>stalled</b> or poor quality projects. The objective of the study is to identify and categorize the most common factors used by general contractors in the selection of suitable subcontractors for project implementation in Nairobi area. The multiple comparative case study design and a population of 70 firms were used. The response rate of the study was 81. 5 %. The results revealed that, "Compliance with regulations" was ranked in the first position by both the contractors and subcontractors with RII of (0. 808). Also, each of them separately ranked it in the first position with RII of (0. 778) and (0. 838), respectively. This emphasizes that, {{this is the most important}} factor used by general contractors for selection of suitable subcontractors in this group, since the knowledge and compliance with regulations reduce the problem. The study recommends the contractor selects the subcontractors according to their experience, capabilities, resources and reputation. The study may help various relevant government agencies in policy formulation...|$|R
50|$|Two {{people stand}} out in Ely Cathedral's eighteenth century history, one a minor canon and the other an {{architectural}} contractor. James Bentham (1709 - 1794), building {{on the work of}} his father Rev. Samuel Bentham, studied the history of both the institution and architecture of the cathedral, culminating in 1771 with his publication of The History and Antiquities of the Conventual and Cathedral Church of Ely. He sought out original documents to provide definitive biographical lists of abbots, priors, deans and bishops, alongside a history of the abbey and cathedral, and was able to set out the architectural development of the building with detailed engravings and plans. These plans, elevations and sections had been surveyed by the architect James Essex (1722-1784), who by this means was able to both highlight the poor state of parts of the building, and understand its complex interdependencies. The level of expertise that Bentham and Essex brought to the situation enabled a well-prioritised series of repairs and sensitive improvements to be proposed that occupied much of the later eighteenth century. Essex identified the decay of the octagon lantern as the starting point of a major series of repairs, and was appointed in 1757 to oversee the work. 400 years of weathering and decay may have removed many of the gothic features, and shortage of funds allied to a Georgian suspicion of ornament resulted in plain and pared down timber and leadwork on the lantern. He was then able to move on to re-roof the entire eastern arm and restore the eastern gable which had been pushed outwards some 2 ft. Bentham and Essex were both enthusiastic proponents of a longstanding plan to relocate the 14th century choir stalls from under the octagon. With the octagon and east roof dealt with, the scheme was embarked on in 1769, with Bentham, still only a minor canon, appointed as clerk of works. By moving the choir stalls to the far east end of the cathedral, the octagon became a spacious and dramatic public area for the first time, with grand vistas to east and west and spectacular views of the octagon vaulting. They also removed the Romanesque pulpitum and put in a new choir screen two bays east of the octagon, surmounted by the 1690s organ case. Despite their antiquarian interests, Bentham and Essex appear to have dismantled the choir <b>stalls</b> with <b>alarming</b> lack of care, and saw no problem in clearing away features at the east end, and removing the pulpitum and medieval walls surrounding the choir stalls. The north wall turned out to incorporate the bones of seven 'Saxon worthies' which would have featured on the pilgrim route into the pre-reformation cathedral. The bones were rehoused in Bishop West's Chapel. The choir stalls, with their misericords were however retained, and the restoration as a whole was relatively sympathetic {{by the standards of the}} period.|$|R
