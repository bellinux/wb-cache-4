5|$|The Betsimisaraka {{constitute}} approximately 15 {{percent of}} the population of Madagascar and numbered over 1,500,000 in 2011. A <b>sub-set</b> of the population, the zana-malata, has partly European origins resulting from generations of intermarriage between the local Malagasy population and European pirates, sailors and traders who docked or settled along the eastern coast. Like the Sakalava to the west, the Betsimisaraka are composed of numerous ethnic sub-groups that formed a confederation in the early 18th century. Most Betsimisaraka are of mixed Bantu African and Asian Austronesian descent. The Betsimisaraka occupy a long, narrow band of territory that stretches along the east coast of Madagascar from Mananjary in the south to Antalaha in the north, including the island's main port at Toamasina and the major towns of Fénérive Est and Maroansetra. They are often subdivided into northern Betsimisaraka (Antavaratra) and southern Betsimisaraka (Antatsimo), separated by the Betanimena Betsimisaraka sub-clan (called the Tsikoa before around 1710).|$|E

This finding is generally stronger for men than women, though the pattern between genders is not universal across all studies and some results suggest sex-based differences only appear in certain age groups, for certain causes of mortality and within a specific <b>sub-set</b> of self-ratings of health.|$|E

500|$|Another {{name for}} the faith is the Icelandic Ásatrú, which {{translates}} as [...] "allegiance to the Æsir" [...] the Æsir being a <b>sub-set</b> of deities in Norse mythology. This is more commonly rendered as Asatru in North America, with practitioners being known as Asatruer. This term is favored by practitioners who focus on the Nordic deities of Scandinavia, although is problematic as many self-identified Asatruer worship deities and entities other than the Æsir, such as the Vanir, valkyries, elves, and dwarves. Although initially a popular term of designation among practitioners and academics, usage of Ásatrú has declined as the religion has aged.|$|E
500|$|Goff's {{judgment}} {{made several}} significant and immediate {{changes to the}} law. First, {{it was the first}} decision which imposed a requirement of foreseeability of harm to cases brought under Rylands v Fletcher; [...] "it must be shown that the defendant has done something which he recognised, or judged by the standards appropriate at the relevant place or time, or ought reasonably to have recognised, as giving rise to an exceptionally high risk of danger or mischief if there should be an escape, however unlikely an escape may have been thought to be". Secondly, it was the first decision to state that Rylands may be a <b>sub-set</b> of nuisance, and as such applied the same requirement of foreseeability of harm to nuisance, where previously such a requirement had not existed.|$|E
500|$|Grunge lit is an Australian {{literary}} {{genre of}} fictional or semi-autobiographical writing [...] {{in the early}} 1990s about young adults living in an [...] "inner cit" [...] "...world of disintegrating futures where the only relief from...boredom was through a nihilistic pursuit of sex, violence, drugs and alcohol". Often the central characters are disfranchised, lacking drive and determination beyond the desire to satisfy their basic needs. It was typically written by [...] "new, young authors" [...] who examined [...] "gritty, dirty, real existences" [...] of everyday characters. [...] It {{has been described as}} both a <b>sub-set</b> of dirty realism and an offshoot of Generation X literature. Stuart Glover states that the term [...] "grunge lit" [...] takes the term [...] "grunge" [...] from the [...] "late 80’s and early 90’s—...Seattle [...] bands". Glover states that the term [...] "grunge lit" [...] was mainly a marketing term used by publishing companies; he states that most of the authors who have been categorized as [...] "grunge lit" [...] writers reject the label.|$|E
40|$|Biomarker related {{patient data}} is {{generally}} assessed {{in order to}} determine relevant but generalized subset of the biomarkers. However, it fails to identify specific sub-groups of the patients or their corresponding (subset of) the biomarkers. This paper therefore proposes a novel framework that is capable of discovering disease sub-groups (types) and associated subset of biomarkers, which is expected to lead to enable the discovery of personalized bio-marker set. The framework is based on the utilization of a histogram obtained by using the Euclidean distances between the samples in a given data set. The t-test method is used for the selection of <b>sub-set(s)</b> of the biomarkers whereas the classification is performed by means of k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines and naive Bayes (NBayes) classifiers. For the assessment of the methods, leave-out-out cross validation is employed. As a case study, the method is applied in the analysis of male hypertension microarray data that consists of 159 patients and 22184 gene expressions. The method has helped identify specific sub-groups of the patients and their corresponding bio-marker <b>sub-sets.</b> The results therefore suggest that the generalized bio-marker <b>sub-sets</b> are not representative of the disease and therefore more focus should be on the sub-groups of the patients and their biomarker subsets identified through the proposed approach. It is particularly observed that the threshold values over the histogram are crucial to discover both <b>sub-sets</b> of the samples and biomarkers, and therefore can be used to determine complexity level of the study...|$|R

500|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where Kennedy J {{dismissed}} claims under nuisance, negligence and Rylands v Fletcher because the harm was not foreseeable. His decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, who cited an [...] "obscure decision" [...] to justify doing so. The case {{then went to the}} House of Lords, where a decision was read by Lord Goff on 9 December 1993. Goff first countered the Court of Appeal decision, restoring Kennedy's dismissal of the case, before moving on to the deeper legal points. Based on the original decision in Rylands, Goff argued that it had always been intended for foreseeability of harm to be a factor, something not previously put into law by the English judiciary. He then stated that Rylands was arguably a <b>sub-set</b> of nuisance, not an independent tort, and as such the factors which led him to including a test of foreseeability of harm in Rylands cases also imposed such a test on all nuisance cases.|$|E
