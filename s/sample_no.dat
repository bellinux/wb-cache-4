50|$|In {{the year}} 2000, a DNA {{sequence}} for the rbcL gene of Whittonia was produced {{and used in}} a molecular phylogenetic study of the eudicots. This study placed Peridiscaceae in a clade with Elatinaceae and Malpighiaceae, a very surprising and unexpected result. On {{the basis of this}} phylogeny, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group placed Peridiscaceae in Malpighiales when they published the APG II system of plant classification in 2003.

50|$|Investigations of {{mosquitoes}} at Zika started in 1946 {{as part of}} the study of human yellow fever at the Yellow Fever Research Institute (renamed East African Virus Research Institute in 1950, and then Uganda Virus Research Institute in 1977), established in Entebbe, Uganda in 1936 by the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1947, the Zika virus was isolated from a rhesus monkey stationed at Zika. In 1960, a 36.6-metre (120-ft) steel tower was moved from Mpanga Forest to Zika to study the vertical distribution {{of mosquitoes}}, allowing for a comprehensive study of the mosquito population in 1964. In that same year, the Zika virus was identified from a collected Aedes africanus <b>sample.</b> <b>No</b> routine mosquito collections were performed for about the next four decades, while human activities encroached on the forest. An updated mosquito collection finally took place in 2009 and 2010.|$|E
5000|$|Capillary {{condensation}} bridges two surfaces together, {{with the}} formation of a meniscus, as is stated above. In the case of atomic-force microscopy (AFM) a capillary bridge of water can form between the tip and the surface, especially in cases of a hydrophilic surface in a humid environment when the AFM is operated in contact mode. While studies have been done on {{the formation of}} the meniscus between the tip and the <b>sample,</b> <b>no</b> specific conclusion can be drawn as to the optimum height away from the sample the tip can be without meniscus formation. Scientific studies have been done on the relationship between relative humidity and the geometry of the meniscus created by capillary condensation. One particular study, done by Weeks, illustrated that with the increase in relative humidity, there is a large increase {{in the size of the}} meniscus. This study also states that no meniscus formation is observed when the relative humidity is less than 70%, although there is uncertainty in this conclusion due to limits of resolution.|$|E
50|$|Belarussian and Russian {{textbooks}} generally {{adhere to}} the notion that the Second World War involved a violation of national territories. The authors of Belarussian textbooks, for example, refer to ‘the occupied territory’ and to that fact that ‘The territory of Belarus was covered with a network of concentration camps’. Russian textbooks likewise largely displace the Holocaust behind a history of the suppression of Slavs and of Soviet heroism. Textbooks in Albania also appear to uphold the Holocaust as a measure of local heroism by defining the Holocaust as the ‘age of upheaval 1914-1945’ while drawing attention to heroic acts of Albanian citizens who rescued Jews, and to the humanitarian values of hospitality, religious tolerance, humanism and antifascism. Although Polish textbooks firmly focus on the Polish dimension of the Holocaust by presenting it as an event in Polish history with Polish figureheads and {{as a consequence of the}} occupation of Poland, the books in this <b>sample</b> <b>no</b> longer nationalize victimhood, but render multiple perspectives with meta-historical critiques. However, representations from countries of the former Soviet Union and former members of the Warsaw Pact do not conform to a uniform pattern. Research has shown that Baltic States traditionally depict a ‘symmetry between Nazi and communist crimes’. And in Ukraine, the famine known as the Holomodor continues to compete with and even displace representations of the Holocaust, which harbours more ambiguous recollections of both persecution and collaboration among Ukrainian citizens.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} was the control of {{disinfection}} in selected meat processing-plant by two methods – swabbing method and The 3 M™ Petrifilm™ plates. Samples were collected within three months (September, October, November 2014). Together 54 samples selected surfaces were collected. Each month six samples were collected using imprint method with Petrifilm plates on total count of microorganisms, 6 samples using imprint method with Petrifilm plates on the number of coliforms and 6 samples using sterile swab method. Samples were collected from the workbench, conveyor belt, cutting blades, meat grinder, wall and knife. Total viable counts (TVC) and coliform bacteria (CB) were determined in samples. The values of TVC in September obtained by swabbing method were higher than allowable limit in <b>sample</b> <b>no.</b> 1 (3. 70 × 102 CFU. cm- 2) and in <b>sample</b> <b>no.</b> 4 (3. 35 × 101 KTJ. cm- 2).
