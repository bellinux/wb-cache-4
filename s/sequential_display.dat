40|$|Recent neurophysiological and imaging {{studies have}} {{investigated}} how neural representations underlying working memory (WM) are dynamically updated for objects presented sequentially. Although such studies implicate information encoded in oscillatory activity across distributed brain networks, {{interpretation of findings}} depends crucially on the underlying conceptual model of how memory resources are distributed. Here, we quantify the fidelity of human memory for sequences of colored stimuli of different orientation. The precision with which each orientation was recalled declined with increases in total memory load, but also depended on when in the sequence it appeared. When one item was prioritized, its recall was enhanced, but with corresponding decrements in precision for other objects. Comparison with {{the same number of}} items presented simultaneously revealed an additional performance cost for <b>sequential</b> <b>display</b> that could not be explained by temporal decay. Memory precision was lower for sequential compared with simultaneous presentation, even when each item in the sequence was presented at a different location. Importantly, stochastic modeling established this cost for <b>sequential</b> <b>display</b> was due to misbinding object features (color and orientation). These results support the view that WM resources can be dynamically and flexibly updated as new items have to be stored, but redistribution of resources with the addition of new items is associated with misbinding object features, providing important constraints and a framework for interpreting neural data...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for minimizing power consumption of backlights in color <b>sequential</b> <b>displays.</b> The proposed algorithm reduces power consumption by scaling the luminous {{intensity of the}} red, green, and blue backlights independently according to the image histograms of each color field. The algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase, chromaticity scaling, finds the optimal ratios of red, green, and blue backlights subject to a perceived color difference constraint. The second phase, luminance scaling, finds the optimal dimming factor subject to a perceived lightness difference constraint. The perceived color and lightness differences are measured by the CIELAB Color Difference Equation ∆ E, a standard metric for ab measuring color variation.

Saccadic eye movements were induced by requiring subjects to recognize text targets displayed at two different screen locations in rapid suc-cession. The speed of saccadic movements was varied by manipulating the distance between the two target locations. A white bar, either with or without a yellow and red color fringe on the right edge, was displayed as subjects moved their eyes for the text recognition task. The two versions of the white bar will not be distinguishable if color break-up is present, thus performance of this task {{can be used as a}} measure of color break-up.

40|$|The {{multitude}} of cameras constantly present nowadays redefines the mean-ing of capturing an event {{and the meaning}} of sharing this event with others. The images are frequently uploaded to a common platform, and the image navigation challenge naturally arises. We introduce RingIt: a spectral tech-nique for recovering the spatial order of a set of still images capturing an event taken by a group of people situated around the event. We assume a nearly instantaneous event, such as an interesting moment in a performance captured by the digital cameras and smartphones of the surrounding crowd. The ordering method extracts the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) of each image from a rough all-pairs dissimilarity estimate. The KNN dissimilarities are refined to form a sparse weighted Laplacian, and a spectral analysis then yields a ring angle for each image. The spatial order is recovered by sorting the obtained ring angles. The ordering of the unorganized set of images allows for a <b>sequential</b> <b>display</b> of the captured object. We demonstrate our technique on a number of sets capturing momentary events, where the im-ages were acquired with low-quality consumer cameras by a group of people positioned around the event...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that visual short-term memory (VSTM) can substantially be improved when the to-be-remembered objects are split in 2 half-arrays (i. e., sequenced) or the entire array is shown twice (i. e., repeated), rather than presented simultaneously. Here we investigate the hypothesis that sequencing and repeating displays overcomes attentional “bottlenecks ” during simultaneous encoding. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that se-quencing and repeating displays increased brain activation in extra-striate and primary visual areas, relative to simultaneous displays (Study 1). Passively viewing identical stimuli did not increase visual activation (Study 2), ruling out a physical confound. Importantly, areas of the frontoparietal attention network showed increased acti-vation in repetition but not in sequential trials. This dissociation suggests that repeating a display increases attentional control by allowing attention to be reallocated in a second encoding episode. In contrast, sequencing the array poses fewer demands on control, with competition from nonattended objects being reduced by the half-arrays. This idea was corroborated by a third study in which we found optimal VSTM for <b>sequential</b> <b>displays</b> minimizing attentional demands. Importantly these results provide support within the same experimental paradigm for the role of stimulus-driven and top-down attentional control aspects of biased competition theory in setting constraints on VSTM...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} spatial {{position}} on visual short-term memory (VSTM) for sequentially presented objects {{has been investigated}} relatively little, {{despite the fact that}} vision in natural environments is characterised by frequent changes in object position and gaze location. We investigated the effect of reusing previously examined spatial positions on VSTM for object appearance. Observers performed a yes – no recognition task following a memory display comprising briefly presented 1 /f noise discs (ie possessing spectral properties akin to natural images) shown sequentially at random coordinates. At test, single stimuli were presented either at original spatial positions, new positions, or at a fixed central position. Results, interpreted in terms of appearance and position preview effects, indicate that, where original spatial positions were reused at test, memory performance was elevated by more than 25 %, despite that spatial position was task-irrelevant (in the sense that it could not be used to facilitate a correct response per se). This study generalises object – spatial-position binding theory to a <b>sequential</b> <b>display</b> scenario in which the influences of extrafoveal processing, spatial context cues, and long-term memory support were minimised, thereby eliminating the hypothesis that object priming is the principal cause of the ‘same-position advantage’ in VSTM...|$|E

A number of studies using a transcript-based sociolinguistic research method inspired by Conversation Analysis (CA) {{suggest that it is}} helpful to focus on how patients talk. Previous reports communicated these findings by using particularly clear examples of diagnostically relevant interactional, linguistic and topical features from different patients. They did not discuss the <b>sequential</b> <b>display</b> of different features although this is crucially important from a conversation analytic point of view. This case comparison aims to show clinicians how the discriminating features are displayed by individual patients {{over the course of a}} clinical encounter. MethodsCA-inspired brief sequential analysis of two first 30 -min doctor–patient encounters by a linguist blinded to all medical information. A gold standard diagnosis was made by the recording of a typical seizure with video-EEG. ResultsThe patient with epilepsy volunteered detailed first person accounts of seizures. The NES patient exhibited resistance to focusing on individual seizure episodes and only provided a detailed seizure description after repeated prompting towards the end of the interview. Although both patients also displayed some linguistic features favouring the alternative diagnosis, the linguist's final diagnostic hypothesis matched the diagnosis made by video-EEG in both cases. ConclusionThis study illustrates the importance of the time point at which patients share information with the doctor.
