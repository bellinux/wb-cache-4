40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken with a two-fold purpose: 1) {{to obtain the}} synopsis of yeasts for the taxonomic studies, and 2) to determine the specific features of “Shiokara” yeasts. In this report the description of morphological and cultural characteristics of true yeasts (23 strains isolated from 15 samples) was made. The summarized characteristics are as follows: {{almost all of the}} species of Zygosaccharomyces have around cell while those of Debaryomyces have a round, egg-Shaped or ellipsoid cell containing one or two oil drops (Table 1). Most fi 1 m- or ring-forming yeasts belong to Debaryomyces(Table 2). The fermentable strains of “Shiokara 2 ̆ 2 ?yeasts belong almost all to Zygosac-charomyces and their fermentability is continuous, though not vigorous.

40|$|SAMMENDRAG: Termotolerante Campylobacter er en viktig næringsmiddelbåren patogen bakterie og regnes i dag blant de viktigste årsakene til bakterielt betinget diaré hos mennesker verden over. Bakterien er vanlig i tarmen hos en lang rekke pattedyr og fugler, og kan overleve flere dager i vann og jord, men kan ikke formere seg der. Hensikten med denne oppgaven er å belyse forekomsten av Campylobacter som miljøbakterie i vann, fjørfe og gris, og å vurdere isolater/ stammer fra ulike kilder, og se på genetisk diversitet innen miljø og mellom kildene. For identifisering og karakterisering av Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli og Campylobacter lari er fire metoder brukt. 1) Filtrering og utstryk på selektiv agar med kontroll av typiske kolonier ved hjelp av fase-kontrast mikroskop, 2) Biotyping ved hippurathydrolyse og nalidixinsyretest, 3) Multipleks PCR {{for arts}} identifisering, 4) Ribotyping med RiboPrinter® Microbial Characterization System for tester på genetisk likhet. I 125 prøver fra vann, som er hentet fra to lokaliteter langs Bøelva; Oterholt og Storkaasa, er 45 stammer isolert. Av disse er 37, 8 % identifisert som C. jejuni, 4, 4 % som C. coli, 11, 1 % som C. lari og 46, 7 % som Campylobacter spp. Totalt er 10 bakterieisolater fra vann DuPont ID identifisert av riboprinteren. Bakteriene blir DuPont identifisert når båndmønsteret fra vår prøve og båndmønsteret i DuPont Identifikasjons bibliotek i RiboPrinter har en likhet > 0, 86. Dendrogrammet av de 45 isolatene fra vann inndeles i 2 hovedgrupper. Disse kan inndeles i 5 undergrupper. Fem av de 17 C. jejuni isolatene er identifisert med DuPont ID: DUP_PST 1 - 1130, DUP_PST 1 - 1122, DUP_PST 1 - 2073, DUP_PST 1 - 2000 og DUP_PST 1 - 2058. Fire av de fem C. lari isolatene er DUP identifisert av riboprinteren som: DUP_PST 1 - 1166 (n= 2), DUP_PST 1 - 1178 og DUP_PST 1 - 1179. En av C. spp. er identifisert av riboprinteren som C. hyointestinalis: DUP_PST 1 - 1170. Den store genetiske diversiteten kan skrive seg fra kontinuerlig tilførsel av Campylobacter til elven fra ville fugler og tilsig av forurenset avrenning fra områder rundt elven. I 113 prøver fra kylling og and er 46 stammer isolert. Av disse er 73, 9 % identifisert som C. jejuni, 17, 4 % som C. coli og 8, 7 % som C. lari. Av disse er 26 DuPont ID identifisert av riboprinteren. Dendrogrammet viser at isolatene inndeles i to hovedgrupper som igjen kan inndeles i fem undergrupper. De tre ulike artene grupperer seg i egne undergrupper. Dendrogrammet viser at isolatene i to undergrupper samler isolater fra kylling. En undergruppe samler isolater fra and, mens to undergrupper har isolater fra kylling og and. Av 35 C. jejuni isolater er 13 identifisert med DuPont ID; DUP_PST 1 - 2050 (n= 2), DUP_PST 1 - 1146, DUP_PST 1 - 2061 (n= 5), DUP_PST 1 - 1131 (n= 4) og DUP_PST 1 - 2086. Alle C. lari isolater er identifisert med: DUP_PST 1 - 1166 (n= 4) og DUP_PST 1 - 1181. Alle åtte C. coli er gitt en DUP-ID, seks av disse er samlet i en hovedgruppe i dendrogrammet. DUP_PST 1 - 1211 (n= 6) og DUP_PST 1 - 1140 (n= 2). Klusteranalysen viser stor genetisk variasjon blant isolatene fra kylling og and. I 100 prøver fra slaktegris er Campylobacter isolert i 88, hvorav C. coli representerte 97, 7 %, C. jejuni 1, 1 % og 1, 1 % C. lari. Av 81 isolater testet på riboprinter er 19 C. coli identifisert med DuPont ID. DUP_PST 1 - 1182 (n= 6), DUP_PST 1 - 1208 (n= 10), DUP_PST 1 - 1175, DUP_PST 1 - 1163 og DUP_PST 1 - 1140. Dendrogrammet viser at isolatene inndeles i to hovedgrupper. Hovedgruppene deler seg igjen inn i 5 undergrupper. Dendrogrammet viser at isolatene i en av undergruppene samler 15 isolater fra en besetning. De andre undergruppene samler isolater fra flere besetninger. Klusteranalysen viser stor genetisk variasjon blant isolatene fra slaktegris, både innen besetningen og mellom besetninger. ENGLISH SUMMARY: Campylobacter is {{recognized}} as a leading human food-borne pathogen and the bacteria is normally found in cattle, swine and birds. The bacteria can survive in water and mud but not multiply here. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the occurrence of Campylobacter as environmental bacteria, to evaluate isolates and groups or categories from various sources, and to study genetic diversity within the environment and amongst those sources. Four methods have been used to identify and characterize C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari: 1) filtration and <b>streak</b> <b>culture</b> on selective agar, with the control of typical colonies by using phase contrast microscope; 2) biotyping by hippurate hydrolysis and nalidixic acid test; 3) multiplex PCR for species identification and 4) ribotyping using RiboPrinter® Microbial Characterization System for testing of genetic similarities. Forty-five strains were isolated from 125 water samples collected from two localities along the Bø River of which 17 (37. 8 %) were C. jejuni, 2 (4. 4 %) C. Coli, 5 (11. 1 %) C. lari and 21 (46. 7 %) C. spp. A total of 10 DuPont ID were identified by the riboprinter. The bacteria is given a DupPont identification when the pattern from the sample and the pattern in DuPont Identificasjons library match with similarity > 0, 86. The dendrogram of the 45 isolates was classified into two main categories, which in turn were divided into five subgroups. Five of the 17 C. jejuni isolates were identified with the following DuPont ID: DUP_PST 1 - 1130 (n= 1), DUP_PST 1 - 1122 (n= 1), DUP_PST 1 - 2073 (n= 1), DUP_PST 1 - 2000 (n= 1) and DUP_PST 1 - 2058 (n= 1). Four of the five C. lari isolated were DUP identified by the riboprinter as: DUP_PST 1 - 1166 (n= 2), DUP_PST 1 - 1178 (n= 1) and DUP_PST 1 - 1179 (n= 1). One of the C. spp. was identified by the riboprinter as C. hyointestinalis: DUP_PST 1 - 1170. The large genetic diversity observed could be the result of a flow of Campylobacter from wild birds or local sources of pollution near the river. A total of 46 strains were isolated from 113 fecal swabs of chicken and ducks. Thirtyfour of these (73. 9 %) were identified as C. jejuni, 8 (17. 4 %) as C. coli, and 4 (8. 7 %) as C. lari. Twenty-six of these were DuPont ID identified by riboprinter. The dendrogram shows that the isolate divides into two main groups and five subgroups. The isolates of two of the subgroups originate from chicken, one from duck and two from both. Thirteen of the 35 C. jejuni isolates were identified with DuPont ID: DUP_PST 1 - 2050 (n= 2), DUP_PST 1 - 1146 (n= 1), DUP_PST 1 - 2061 (n= 5), DUP_PST 1 - 1131 (n= 4) and DUP_PST 1 - 2086 (n= 1). All of the C. lari isolates were identified as: DUP_PST 1 - 1166 (n= 4) and DUP_PST 1 - 1181 (n= 1). All of the eight C. coli were given a DUP-ID, and six of these gathered in a main category in the dendrogram, DUP_PST 1 - 1211 (n= 6) and DUP_PST 1 - 1140 (n= 2). The cluster analysis showed large genetic variety among the isolates from chicken and duck. Campylobacter were isolated in 88 of 100 pig fecal swabs of which C. coli was found in 86 (97. 7 %), and C. jejuni and C. lari in 1 each (1. 1 %). Of 81 isolates tested on the riboprinter, 19 C. coli were identified with DuPont ID. DUP_PST 1 - 1182 (n= 6), DUP_PST 1 - 1208 (n= 10), DUP_PST 1 - 1175 (n= 1), DUP_PST 1 - 1163 (n= 1) and DUP_PST 1 - 1140 (n= 1). The dendrogram shows that the isolates divide into two main categories which further divide into five subgroups. The dendrogram shows that the isolates of one of the subgroups are a collection of 15 isolates from one strain. The other subgroups were collections of isolates from several strains. The cluster analysis showed large genetic variety among the isolates from pigs, both within and between strains...|$|E

We optimized a DME: Ham's F 12 - 5 % FBS- containing solid agar medium for plating Perkinsus marinus. This solid medium supported trophozoite propagation both by binary fission and schizogony. Colonies were visible to the naked eye 17 days after plating. We tested the suitability of this method for several applications, including the following: 1) Subcloning P. marinus isolates: single discrete P. marinus colonies were obtained from DME: Ham's F 12 - 5 % FBS- 0. 75 % agar plates, which could be further propagated in liquid medium; 2) Subcloning engineered Perkinsus mediterraneus MOE[MOE]: GFP by <b>streaking</b> <b>cultures</b> on plates; 3) Chemical susceptibility: Infusing the DME: Ham's F 12 - 5 % FBS- 0. 75 % agar plates with triclosan resulted in inhibition of the parasite propagation in a dose-dependent manner.

40|$|The {{effect of}} growth {{temperature}} on {{the loss of}} virulence of the fish pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida was investigated. Three virulent strains were grown in Trypticase soy broth at temperatures ranging from 22 to 30 degrees C. Growth at a higher-than-optimal temperature (26 to 27 degrees C for the three strains studied) resulted {{in the selection of}} spontaneous attenuated derivatives in the initial bacterial population. For example, virulent bacteria represented less than 10 % of the population of a culture grown at 30 degrees C, and attenuated derivatives were easily isolated by <b>streaking</b> the <b>culture</b> on solid medium and picking single colonies. Virulent strains autoaggregated during growth and possessed a cell wall layer (A-layer) external to the outer membrane, as previously described. Attenuated strains did not autoaggregate and did not possess the A-layer. The A-layer apparently shielded bacteriophage receptors and a mannose-specific yeast agglutinin located in the outer membrane. Thus, virulent strains exhibited impaired adsorption of phages, whereas attenuated strains were phage sensitive. Furthermore, attenuated strains agglutinated yeast cells but virulent strains did not. The attenuated strains had higher maximum growth temperatures than their virulent parent strains, and this accounts for their selection at high temperatures. It is proposed that the A-layer contributes significantly to the physical properties of the A. salmonicida cell envelope and that these physical properties of the A. salmonicida cell envelope and that these physical change upon loss of the A-layer to permit growth at a higher-than-usual temperature...|$|R

40|$|Methyl {{tertiary}} butyl ether (MTBE) is an oxygenated compound used {{to enhance}} the octane index of gasoline and replace lead in gasoline. MTBE can reduce air pollution but causes water pollution due to its high water solubility and low sorption to soil and thus can easily contaminate the environment. Biodegradation {{is one of the}} promising techniques to reduce MTBE contaminated in the environment and MTBE degrader was proposed as an efficient method used to degrade MTBE. In this study, MTBE degraders were isolated from gasoline contaminated soil and then were evaluated with the hypothesis that MTBE degraders could improve biodegradation of MTBE in soil and mixed culture could degrade MTBE more rapidly than monoculture. Gasoline contaminated soil samples were taken from retail gas stations and a motorcycle repair shop in Khon Kaen University. Isolation of MTBE degrader was conducted by using Basal Salt Medium (BSM) containing 200 mg/L of MTBE as a carbon source. Mixed culture of MTBE degrader was successfully isolated under aerobic condition.

The results obtained from these identification procedures, indicated that of the 114 aerobic bacterial isolates tested, 107 (93. 8 %) were 116 Staphylococci, 2 (1. 8 %) were Escherihia coli, 1 (0. 9 %) was P. aeruginosaand 1 (0. 9 %) was Proteus species. All bacterial isolateswere tested for their antibiotic sensitivity using the–disk diffusion technique against fifteen antimicrobial agents in different specific concentrations. These included ampicillin (10 mcg), streptomycin(10 mcg), tetracycline (30 mcg), chloramphenicol (30 mcg), Co–trimoxazole (25 mcg), Gentamicin (10 mcg), penicillin G (10 U), Augmentin (10 mcg), cloxacillin (5 mcg), colistin (10 mcg), Vancomycin (30 mcg), Clindamycin (2 mcg), Ciprofloxacin (30 mcg), Ofloxacin (5 mcg), and Methicillin (5 mcg). The results have shown that some of the bacterial isolates tested exhibited marked drug– resistance against some antimicrobial agents used. Furthermore, the study included aninvestigation of antimicrobial administration in twenty individuals who all underwent different surgical operations, for evaluation of the prevalence of post– operative wound infections due to drug–resistant hospital pathogens. 117 The results have shown that out of the twenty patients, ten developed post – operative wound infectionsafter prophylactic antibiotic administration. All these findings point out to the very seriousconditions prevailing in these surgical sites and seriously some levels of drug–resistance in the hospital pathogens investigated, and call outfor proper attention to the problem of aerobic bacterial contamination in operating theatres and surgical wards in addition to proper administration of antimicrobial agents to prevent the rapid emergence of antibiotic drug–resistance in pathogenic bacteria...|$|R
