40|$|The mean {{trophic level}} (MTL) <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> has been {{proposed}} to track changes in marine ecosystems resulting from fishing. Despite the ongoing debate surrounding its validity, catch MTL is a key indicator for measuring progress toward global biodiversity goals. Evaluations <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> MTL have found no linear correlation between trends in the indicator and the ecosystem state. I use simulation models and a method common in epidemiology to evaluate catch MTL as a strategic indicator for ecosystem changes {{even though it is}} not linearly related. The performance <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> MTL was ‘fair’ when applied globally, but varied considerably across individual simulated ecosystems. Catch MTL performed most reliably when the composition <b>of</b> the <b>catch</b> reflected the ecosystem and fishing pressure was constant over time. The inconsistent performance <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> MTL suggests it is not a reliable indicator of ecological change, but it still provides useful information about fisheries catch over time...|$|R
