It was canceled several months before release because Jewel was worried about Murray's mother's reaction to her intimate confessions. On September 15, 2015, Jewel released a new memoir entitled Never Broken: Songs Are Only Half the Story.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Harmon {{left the}} show after three seasons (with Abbie Carmichael {{written off as}} being called on to serve the U.S. Attorney's office) {{and was replaced by}} Elisabeth Röhm as Assistant District Attorney Serena Southerlyn. The year after that, Wiest left the show after two seasons and was replaced by retiring U.S. Senator Fred Thompson as District Attorney Arthur Branch, whose character was conceived of as being much more right-leaning than his predecessors in the DA's office, and was a direct reaction to the September 11 attacks. No mention was made on the show of what happened to Nora Lewin, though producers said her character was only <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> interim DA.|$|E
25|$|However, {{his time}} at Harrow was not spent just in idleness or with his friends; Byron busied himself by reading books; history was his primary subject, {{followed}} by biography, poetry, philosophy, and other topics. He was originally <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> orator, and he would read various passages in aloud for others. However, Byron's attitude caused problems {{between him and the}} administration at Harrow (markedly, he led a rebellion among the boys against the new headmaster, the Revd Dr George Butler) and during the 1804 Christmas holidays, Byron, at Drury's prompting, wanted to leave the school. However, Carlisle intervened and Byron stayed at Harrow until July 1805. He was accepted at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he went up the following October.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Japan invaded Indochina in 1940, {{keeping the}} Vichy French colonial {{administration}} {{in place as}} a puppet. In 1941 Nguyễn Ái Quốc, now known as Hồ Chí Minh, arrived in northern Vietnam to form the Việt Minh Front, and it was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> umbrella group for all parties fighting for Vietnam's independence, but was dominated by the Communist Party. The Việt Minh had a modest armed force and during the war worked with the American Office of Strategic Services to collect intelligence on the Japanese. A famine broke out in 1944–45. Japan's defeat by World War II Allies created a power vacuum for Vietnamese nationalists of all parties to seize power in August 1945, forcing Emperor Bảo Đại to abdicate and ending the Nguyễn dynasty. Their initial success in staging uprisings and in seizing control {{of most of the}} country by September 1945 was partially undone, however, by the return of the French a few months later.|$|E
25|$|He {{was working}} on two poetry series, Super Flumina Babylonis (a {{reference}} to Psalm 137) and L'Exode ("The Exodus"), {{as well as on}} his last essay, focusing on 19th-century poet Charles Baudelaire, and titled Baudelaire et l'expérience du gouffre ("Baudelaire and the Experience of the Abyss"). In addition to these, his other French texts, incomplete or unpublished by 1944, include: the poetic drama pieces Philoctète, Les Puits de Maule ("Maule's Well", an adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables) and Le Féstin de Balthazar ("Belshazzar's Feast"); a study about the life and work of Romanian-born philosopher Stéphane Lupasco; and the selection from his interviews with Shestov, Sur les rives de l'Illisus ("On the Banks of the Illisus"). His very last text is believed to be a philosophical essay, Le Lundi existentiel ("The Existential Monday"), on which Fondane was working in 1944.

25|$|Modern-day {{authorities}} disagree as to {{how much}} of Gerard's Herball was original. Garret made a chance visit to the Norton publishing shop, where he discovered the proofs of the Herball, and alerted the Nortons as both to errors he discovered in the proofs and to the incorporation of some of L'Obel's material in Gerard's new book. This story is recounted by L'Obel in his Stirpium illustrationes (1655) in which he accuses Gerard of plagiarism. Although they were not concerned about plagiarism, the Nortons, fearing errors in a book that was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> expert reference guide, hired L'Obel, as an internationally recognized expert on plants (who had as Gerard’s friend, unwittingly contributed to his book) to proof the translations, fix the mismatched illustrations, and right its textual wrongs. When Gerard discovered L'Obel's thankless efforts, he had him dismissed. Although Gerard was an experienced collector and plantsman, unlike L'Obel he lacked scholarship, as is evident in his dedication to Burghley, where he paints a picture of himself as a gardener. Gerard dismissed L'Obel's criticisms as being due to his unfamiliarity with English idioms. Norton decided to proceed with publication despite these difficulties. He decided against using Dodoens' original illustrations since this would have revealed the actual source of the material, but instead rented woodblocks from Nicolaus Bassaeus in Frankfurt, about 1,800 in all, only 16 being original. However, Gerard was then faced with the difficulty of matching them to the text and frequently mislabelled them.|$|E

500|$|According to Stefan Marschal, the post-World War II years, {{particularly}} the 1980s and 1990s, saw tremendous growth in parliamentary assemblies, {{with more than}} 40 established since 1949. About 42% of the world's parliamentary assemblies are formally affiliated with an intergovernmental organization; 32% are informally affiliated; and 26% are unaffiliated. The spread in parliamentary assemblies was spurred by acceptance of parliamentarism {{as a means of}} legitimizing decisions; initiatives for intergovernmental cooperation reaching a point at which stronger parliamentary backing was needed; and regional integration. However, many global organizations, such as the UN and WTO, still lack a parliamentary assembly and [...] "have been heavily criticized for what is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> institutional deficit." ...|$|E
500|$|In the film, {{she plays}} Eli, a child vampire who {{develops}} {{a friendship with}} the main character, 12-year-old Oskar (played by Kåre Hedebrant). Oskar is frequently tormented by bullies. Eli initially tells Oskar to fight back, and rescues him in the end, killing three of the bullies in process. Because Eli is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> androgynous character in the film, director Tomas Alfredson decided to overdub Leandersson's voice with a less feminine one. [...] "Lina's voice is beautiful, but I thought it was too high in pitch", he said. Eli's voice throughout the whole film was provided by Elif Ceylan. In an interview with Dagens Nyheter, Leandersson laughingly commented that [...] "it was actually nice to be dubbed, my voice sounds weird".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} {{directors}} Kripke had become acquainted with and learned from was David Nutter. Kripke thus wanted to include homages to Nutter's work on the pilot; some scenes of the new reality {{were meant to be}} recreations from the first episode. The crew attempted to match the camera angles, lighting, and music as much as possible. While Sam and Jessica sleeping together in bed was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> exact replica of a similar scene, the fight between the brothers differed. Because the new Sam is [...] "pretty much a wussy", Dean is able to take him down instantly. Tucker noted that it was also a [...] "sneaky way" [...] of hinting that the new reality was merely an illusion, as he is [...] "re-experiencing that moment from the pilot because his fantasy world is being generated by what he already knows and has lived".|$|E

500|$|Before {{shooting}} {{began in}} November, Hitchcock dispatched assistant director Hilton A. Green to Phoenix to scout locations and shoot the opening scene. The shot was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> aerial shot of Phoenix that slowly zoomed {{into the hotel}} window of a passionate Marion and Sam. Ultimately, the helicopter footage proved too shaky {{and had to be}} spliced with footage from the studio. Another crew filmed day and night footage on Highway 99 between Gorman and Fresno, California for projection when Marion drives from Phoenix. Footage of her driving into Bakersfield to trade her car is also shown. They also provided the location shots for the scene in which she is discovered sleeping in her car by the highway patrolman. In one street scene shot in downtown Phoenix, Christmas decorations were discovered to be visible; rather than re-shoot the footage, Hitchcock chose to add a graphic to the opening scene marking the date as [...] "Friday, December the Eleventh".|$|E
500|$|The film marked Robin Williams' first {{animation}} role, {{with the}} character Batty Koda being created specifically for him. Williams provided 14 hours worth of improvised lines for the part which was originally only <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> 8-minute role. Director Bill Kroyer {{was so impressed with}} the voice work he ended up tripling the screen time given to the character. Williams went on to provide the critically applauded voice of the Genie in Disney's Aladdin later the same year. Williams accepted the role in FernGully because he agreed with the film's message, as did the rest of the voice cast, who all worked for scale wages. The film marked the first time that both members of Cheech & Chong had worked together in six years, with the two voicing beetle brothers Stump and Root. Cheech Marin said [...] "It was just like old times, but we only worked for two or three hours, had a pizza and split." ...|$|E

[...] Nothing was reported until about 6am, when three scratches were heard, apparently while the girl was asleep.

Now you've got entire teams doing it. I think we're killing the meaning. It should be special wearing Jackie's number, not just because it looks cool." [...] Cleveland Indians pitcher CC Sabathia, who decried the lack of African-American players in the game in March 2007, told USA Today that [...] "It kind of waters it down.

500|$|However, the Expressionistic visual {{elements}} of the film are present {{not only in the}} main narrative, but also in the epilogue and prologue scenes of the frame story, which are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> objective account of reality. For example, the frame story scenes still have trees with tentacle-like branches and a high, foreboding wall in the background. Strange leaf and line patterns are seen on the bench Francis sits upon, flame-like geometric designs can be seen on the walls, and his asylum cell has the same distorted shape as in the main narrative. If the primary story were strictly the delusions of a madman, the frame story would be completely devoid of those elements, but the fact they are present makes it unclear whether that perspective can be taken as reliable either. Instead, the film offers no true normal world to oppose to that of the twisted and nightmarish world as described by Francis. As a result, after the film's closing scene, it can be seen as ambiguous whether Francis or the asylum director is truly the insane one, or whether both are insane. Likewise, the final shot of the film, with an iris that fades to a close-up on the asylum director's face, further creates doubt over whether the character is actually sane and trustworthy. As Brockmann writes, [...] "In the end, the film is not just about one unfortunate madman; it is about an entire world that is possibly out of balance". Mike Budd notes that, during the scene in which asylum doctors restrain Francis, his movements closely mimic those of Dr. Caligari from a similar scene during the main story. Budd says this suggests a [...] "dream logic of repetition" [...] that throws further confusion on which perspective is reality.|$|E
