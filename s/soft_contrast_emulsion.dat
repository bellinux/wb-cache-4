50|$|Pastelling is also {{referred}} to as tint leaf embossing. It involves the process of using a combination die to provide a subtle antique appearance to a substrate that is embossed and foil stamped. Pearl finishes, clear gloss, or similar pastel foil finishes can be selected that provide a soft two-color antique look (without scorching) to the embossed image. Lighter colored stocks work best to provide this <b>soft</b> <b>contrasting</b> effect.|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of micro-CT in longitudinal studies is still hampered by the total absorbed dose, leading to low <b>soft</b> tissue <b>contrast.</b> We have previously developed regularized CT reconstruction applicable for sparse-view imaging and noise reduction, called SpBR-TV [2].

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to gain {{information concerning the}} mechanism by which a high <b>contrast</b> <b>emulsion</b> is developed to a significantly increased exposure latitude, without loss of toe speed. Developer properties were altered through variations in pH, bromide ion concentration, developing agent concentration, and the Phenidone */hydroquinone ratio. The {{results indicate that the}} bromide ion concentration is the predominant factor reducing both the exposure latitude and the toe speed. The experimental evidence suggests that the bromide reduces the rate of development throughout the exposure range. The other facts investigated produced primarily changes in development rate without affecting the latitude at a given contrast, until the rate and exposure are sufficient so that exhaustion of available silver occurs. The ability to increase the useful exposure scale without loss of toe speed depends upon maintaining a relatively constant rate of development over the desired exposure range, and having no soluble bromide present. *Ilford trademark...|$|R
40|$|The cooling {{intensity}} of topical emulsions added with encapsulated or free menthol was evaluated by a screened and trained panel recruited {{based on the}} American Society for Testing and Materials method. A sensory panel composed of 10 trained judges performed the evaluation of samples stored at 22 +/- 2 C for 24 h and, after 28 days of storage, at 37. 0 +/- 0. 5 C. The obtained data were analyzed by analysis of variance and Tukey`s test. The results showed an increase of cooling intensity {{as a function of}} encapsulated menthol concentration. The opposite was observed in samples added with free menthol, which may have caused sensory fatigue. Storage at 37 +/- 0. 5 C for 28 days had no impact on the cooling {{intensity of}} emulsions containing encapsulated menthol, demonstrating high stability and suggesting its application in cooling skin care products. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>emulsions</b> added with free menthol showed a drastic decrease of cooling intensity at 37 +/- 0. 5 C. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{interfacial}} instability {{process is}} an emerging general method to fabricate nanocrystal-encapsulated micelles (also called micellar nanocrystals) for biological detection, imaging, and therapy. The present work utilized fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots or QDs) {{as the model}} nanocrystals to investigate the interfacial instability-based fabrication process of nanocrystal-encapsulated micelles. Our experimental results suggest intricate and intertwined roles of the emulsion droplet size and the surfactant poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) used in the fabrication process of QD-encapsulated poly (styrene-b-ethylene glycol) (PS-PEG) micelles. When no PVA is used, no emulsion droplet and thus no micelle is successfully formed; Emulsion droplets with large sizes (~ 25  μm) result in two types of QD-encapsulated micelles, {{one of which is}} colloidally stable QD-encapsulated PS-PEG micelles while the other of which is colloidally unstable QD-encapsulated PVA micelles; In <b>contrast,</b> <b>emulsion</b> droplets with small sizes (~ 3  μm or smaller) result in only colloidally stable QD-encapsulated PS-PEG micelles. The results obtained in this work not only help to optimize the quality of nanocrystal-encapsulated micelles prepared by the interfacial instability method for biological applications but also offer helpful new knowledge on the interfacial instability process in particular and self-assembly in general.|$|R
40|$|Encapsulation of biomacromolecules in {{polyester}} micro- and nano-particles is now {{a routine}} procedure in many laboratories for achieving controlled and targeted delivery strategies. Objectives: Proteins are notoriously difficult to encapsulate without some degree of unfolding and loss of bioactivity, and this is despite around two decades of research. A case by case analysis appears necessary when determining which mechanism, generally unfolding at the emulsion interface or acidification of the particle interior, is most detrimental. The transient nature of the emulsion systems makes in situ, real-time analysis of interfacial events difficult, necessitating interpretation from model interfacial systems or analysis post-fabrication. The review will focus on: i) the emulsification efficiency of proteins, cf. interfacial adsorption; ii) current excipients and techniques used to stabilise proteins, outlining work towards the oral delivery of insulin as a case study; iii) analytical techniques used to characterise encapsulated protein. There {{appears to be a}} recent trend towards the stabilization of proteins via direct complexation with polymers but, in <b>contrast,</b> <b>emulsion</b> techniques are emerging which err away from the use of stabilisers and/or excipients. A number of spectroscopic and spectrometric methods have found new application to the study of protein integrity in microspheres...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{ultrasound}} treatment (∼ 34 Wcm− 2 for 2 min) on unadsorbed and adsorbed milk protein isolate (MPI) and pea protein isolate (PPI) {{was investigated in}} terms of the ability to form and stabilise emulsion droplets. Submicron emulsions were prepared using a microfluidiser with a single pass at 100 MPa with untreated proteins (control), proteins ultrasound treated prior to pre-emulsification (unadsorbed) or proteins sonicated post pre-emulsification (adsorbed). Emulsions were also prepared with a low molecular weight surfactant, Tween 80, for comparative purposes. Ultrasound treatment reduced the size of both MPI and PPI to the nanoscale (∼ 150 nm) from micron sized aggregates (∼ 20 μm). Emulsions prepared with ultrasound treated post pre-emulsification MPI yielded significantly smaller emulsion droplet sizes than those prepared with untreated or unadsorbed MPI. This behaviour is ascribed to rearrangement of interfacial protein allowing for the formation of smaller <b>emulsion</b> droplets. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>emulsions</b> produced with PPI yielded no significant differences, regardless of treatment, in emulsion droplet size, this was attributed to the more highly structured nature of PPI in contrast to MPI. Nevertheless, emulsions prepared with ultrasound treated PPI, both unadsorbed and adsorbed, yielded significantly more stable emulsion droplets than untreated PPI. This behaviour is associated with an enhanced interfacial layer and greater electrostatic repulsive forces as observed by an increased zeta-potential...|$|R

40|$|Image-guided {{stereotactic}} biopsy of a {{deep brain}} tumor is a surgical procedure in which the biopsy needle is guided with pinpoint precision to the target based on pre-operative images using a frame-based stereotactic system. Positioning error of the biopsy needle occurs because of intraoperative brain shift or poor imaging properties of the modalities used (e. g. poor <b>soft</b> tissue <b>contrast</b> between tumor and normal tissues, image distortion). The former error can be minimized by using intraoperative images, and the latter by a low magnetic field MRI system that produces better <b>soft</b> tissue <b>contrast</b> with less image distortion {{than that of a}} high magnetic field MRI system. MRI-guided stereotaxy based on intraoperative imaging requires both a receiver coil with high diagnostic performance and a conventional stereotactic system allowing uninterrupted MRI scanning. We developed a stereotactic coil which serves both as a radiofrequency receiver coil for intraoperative MR imaging, and as a stereotactic frame. This integrated coil provided adequate <b>soft</b> tissue <b>contrast</b> images for intraoperative diagnosis in a clinical trial. Using the integrated coil we built an intraoperative biopsy system. During experimental testing, biopsy needle positioning error, based on T 2 -weighed images obtained at the magnetic field center, was 0. 2 mm. In a clinical trial, positioning error between the estimated target center and the actual position was 0. 93 mm. Thus, this system could work as a stereotactic surgical apparatus. We conclude that our system would be clinically useful and functional, allowing integration of intraoperative MR imaging and stereotactic needle biopsy...|$|R
