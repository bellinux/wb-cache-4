40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} in the journal SAE International Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems and the definitive published version is available at [URL] paper demonstrates the use of large scale tomographic PIV to study the wake region of a Windsor model. This forms part of a larger study intending to understand the mechanisms that drive drag force changes when rear end optimizations are applied. For the first time, tomographic PIV has been applied to a large airflow volume (0. 125 m 3, 500 x 500 x 500 mm), which is of sufficient size to capture the near wake of a 25 % scale Windsor model in a single measurement. The measurement volume is illuminated using a 200 mJ double pulsed Nd:Yag laser fitted with a volume optic and seeded with 300 μm helium filled soap bubbles generated by a novel high output seeder. Images were captured using four 4 M Pixel LaVision cameras. The tomographic results are shown to produce high quality data with the setup used, but further improvements and tests at higher Reynolds number could be conducted if an additional <b>seeding</b> <b>rake</b> was used to increase seeding density. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) was applied to both the 2 D and tomographic data to show the presence of a bi-stable wake structur...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Streamline <b>seeding</b> <b>rakes</b> {{are widely}} used in vector field visualization. We present new {{approaches}} for calculating similarity between integral curves (streamlines and pathlines). While others have used similarity distance measures, the computational expense involved with existing techniques is relatively high due to the vast number of Euclidean distance tests, restricting interactivity and their use for streamline <b>seeding</b> <b>rakes.</b> We introduce the novel idea of computing streamline signatures based {{on a set of}} curve-based attributes. A signature produces a compact representation for describing a streamline. Similarity comparisons are performed by using a popular statistical measure on the derived signatures. We demonstrate that this novel scheme, including a hierarchical variant, produces good clustering results and is computed over two orders of magnitude faster than previous methods. Similarity-based clustering enables filtering of the streamlines to provide a non-uniform seeding distribution along the seeding object. We show that this method preserves the overall flow behavior while using only a small subset of the original streamline set. We apply focus + context rendering using the clusters which allows for faster and easier analysis in cases of high visual complexity and occlusion. The method provides a high level of interactivity and allows the user to easily fine-tune the clustering results at run-time while avoiding any time-consuming re-computation. Our method maintains interactive rates even when hundreds of streamlines are used...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the situation of}} conservation tillage (CT) in Shandong province, analyses the various techniques including straw mulching, no-tillage <b>seeding,</b> <b>raking</b> tillage on the stubble, rotary tillage on the stubble, deep loosening, and control of weeds and insect pests. The paper also {{presents the}} ecological and social benefits of CT. It further analyzes questions related to CT such as seeding quality, use of agricultural machinery and agronomy, crop planting technologies, weed control, and fertilizer use. Measures to develop CT in Shandong province are also presented which include strengthening the organization with corresponding policy; reinforcing training interventions to increase the understanding of CT; combining agricultural machinery and agronomy; and enhancing the study on the theory behind CT...|$|R
40|$|Several {{restoration}} methods {{intended to}} increase the success of aerially‐seeded perennial grasses were assessed to determine their effects on cheatgrass metrics and soil nutrient bioavailabilities. These methods were: 1) imazapic herbicide application (140 g ai ∙ ha‐ 1, 210 g ai ∙ ha‐ 1, and no application [control]), 2) vegetation manipulation treatments (50 % sagebrush overstory thinning, 100 % sagebrush overstory thinning, sagebrush overstory and/or vegetative thatch burning, and no manipulation [control]), and 3) alternative seeding treatments (aerial <b>seeding</b> with <b>raking,</b> aerial <b>seeding</b> with activated carbon [AC] addition, aerial seeding with sucrose addition, and regular aerial seeding [control]). Treatments were arranged in 3 ‐way factorial designs, which allowed main effects and interactions between treatments to be assessed. Responses were followed for two growing seasons following treatment. Main effects of treatments and their interactions on cheatgrass metrics are described in Chapter 2. Herbicide reduced cheatgrass weights and tiller and spikelet numbers in 2009, but these variables were greater than in no‐herbicide plots in 2010. Burning decreased cheatgrass densities but increased weights and tiller and spikelet numbers in both years. One hundred percent sagebrush thinning resulted in greater cheatgrass weights and tiller and spikelet numbers in both years and greater densities in 2010. Sucrose addition decreased cheatgrass weights and tiller and spikelet numbers in 2009, but increased these variables in 2010. An interaction between AC and herbicide treatment was observed, with AC potentially sequestering and lessening the negative effect of herbicide on cheatgrass. Aerial <b>seeding</b> with <b>raking</b> and 50 % sagebrush thinning treatments were not found to significantly affect cheatgrass either year. The effects of treatments (herbicide, 50 % sagebrush thinning, aerial seeding on snow, and aerial <b>seeding</b> with <b>raking</b> treatments omitted) on soil nutrient availabilities are described in Chapter 3. We used ion exchange resin (IER) membrane probes to measure extractable quantities of 15 ions over three time periods following treatment applications. Burning resulted in short‐term increases in many soil nutrient availabilities, including nitrate (NO 3 ‐), phosphate (H 2 PO 4 ‐), and sulfate (SO 4 2 ‐). Sucrose addition reduced availabilities of NO 3 ‐ and H 2 PO 4 ‐ during the first winter and growing season. No changes were detected with AC addition or 100 % sagebrush thinning during any sampling time...|$|R
40|$|This study {{represents}} part of {{a broader}} investigation into novel seed broadcasting methodologies as a means to optimize rehabilitation techniques following sand mining. Specifically, the study investigated the use of polymer seed coatings, time of sowing application, and in situ raking of the topsoil to optimize seedling recruitment to site. For polymer seed coatings, an ex situ trial was undertaken to evaluate seed coating effects on seedling emergence. Results demonstrated that seed coatings did not significantly inhibit maximum emergence percentage of 10 Banksia woodland species (out of 11 evaluated), but coated seeds from four species were on average 2 – 6 days slower to emerge than noncoated seeds. Seed coatings were found to have a greater effect in situ, with more coated seeds emerging than noncoated <b>seeds.</b> Topsoil <b>raking</b> (following <b>seed</b> sowing) and time of sowing were found to have the greatest impact on seedling emergence, with higher emergence following topsoil raking (5 - to 90 -fold increase) and sowing in May (late autumn) (1. 4 - to 12 -fold increase) rather than in July (mid-winter). The implications for mining rehabilitation are discussed, and areas for further research are considered...|$|R
40|$|Vegetation within {{some parts}} of Western Australia has been {{degraded}} by resource extraction, and ecological restoration is necessary to prevent erosion and reinstate plant biodiversity. Two restoration approaches, seed broadcasting and planting of seedlings, were tested with plant species (Acacia tetragonophylla F. Muell., Atriplex bunburyana F. Muell. and Solanum orbiculatum Poir.) {{known to have been}} dominant prior to mining activities in the World Heritage Area at Shark Bay. For broadcast <b>seeding,</b> soil <b>raking</b> and/or ripping increased seedling emergence, but only after sufficient rainfall. Survival of A. bunburyana seedlings (<= 92 %) was higher than A. tetragonophylla (<= 13 %) almost two years after planting and soil ripping partly alleviated soil impedance and resulted in increased seedling survival. Shoot pruning, fertiliser and moisture retaining gel had a reduced or detrimental effect on survival. Seedling survival differed between the three experimental sites, with electrical conductivity being the most noted soil difference between the sites. Restoration in the arid environs of the World Heritage Area at Shark Bay in Western Australia is challenging, but this study shows that seedling establishment is technically feasible and provides methodology useful to other arid restoration projects...|$|R
60|$|Mark found Betts's {{deposit of}} decayed {{vegetable}} matter even {{larger and more}} accessible than he had hoped for. A hundred loads might be got without even using a wheelbarrow; and to all appearances there was enough of it to give a heavy dressing to many acres, possibly to the whole area of the crater. The first thing the young man did was to choose a suitable place, dig it well up, mixing a sufficiency of guano with it, agreeably to Betts's directions, and then to put {{in some of his}} asparagus roots. After this he scattered a quantity of the <b>seed,</b> <b>raking</b> the ground well after sowing. By the time this was done, Bob had both dingui and raft loaded, when they pulled the last back to the reef, towing the boat. In this manner our two mariners continued to work most of the time, for the next fortnight, making, daily, more or less trips to the 'loam-rock,' as they called the place where this precious deposit had been made; though they neglected none of their other necessary duties. As the distance was short, they could come and go many times in a day, transporting at each trip about as much of the loam as would make an ordinary American cart-load of manure. In the whole, by Mark's computation, they got across about fifty of these cargoes, {{in the course of their}} twelve days' work. The entire day, however, was on no occasion given up wholly to this pursuit. On the contrary, many little odd tasks wore completed, which were set by their necessities, or by fore thought and prudence. All the empty water-casks, for one thing, were rolled ashore, and filled at the largest pool; the frequency of the rains admonishing them of the wisdom of making a provision for the dry season. The Rancocus had a good deal of water still left in her, some of it being excellent Delaware river water, though she had filled up at Valparaiso, after passing the Horn. Mark counted the full casks, and allowing ten gallons a day for Bob and himself, a good deal more than could be wanted, there remained in the ship fresh water enough to last them two years. It is true, it was not such water as the palate often craved of a warm day; but they were accustomed to it, and it was sweet. By keeping it altogether between decks, the sun had no power on it, and it was even more palatable than might have been supposed. Mark occasionally longed for one good drink at some gushing spring that he remembered at home, it is true; and Bob was a little in the habit of extolling a particular well that, it would seem, his family were reputed to have used for several generations. Notwithstanding these little natural backslidings on this subject, our mariners might be thought well off on the score of water, having it in great abundance, and with no reasonable fear of ever losing it altogether. The casks taken ashore were filled for their preservation, as well as for convenience, an old sail being spread over them, after they were rolled together and chocked. As yet, no water was given to any of the stock, all the animals finding it in abundance, in the cavities of the lava.|$|R
40|$|Have {{you seen}} {{red and black}} insects {{crawling}} all over your grass and {{up the sides of}} your house? Do you have a Goldenrain tree or Chinaberry tree in your yard or close by? Then most likely the insect you are seeing is the harmless Jadera haematoloma. This is a seed-eating insect. These bugs are providing a service to you. They are eating the seeds of the tree so that you do not have thousands of baby trees sprouting up under the adult tree. In central Florida, April and May are usually the peak months for Jadera bugs. The adults are 9. 5 - 13. 5 mm long (with wings) and 3 - 4 mm wide. Their color is mostly black except for reddish eyes, shoulders and border area of the abdomen. The nymphs (young) are mostly reddish in color, with the mid-section, antennae, beak and legs brown to black. CONTROL: Usually, no control is necessary. A small concentration on a plant can often be destroyed by hand collecting. If the bugs are a nuisance in lawns or playgrounds, removing the tree <b>seeds</b> by <b>raking</b> shortly after the seedpods or lanterns have fallen to the ground is recommended, but should be done when the trees first drop the seedpods, before the seeds detach. Attempting to rake them when the bugs become noticeable in March or April, after the seeds have detached from the seedpods, is too late. The Goldenrain tree or Chinaberry tree can be removed- the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council has listed the Goldenrain tree as a Category II invasive species, and the Chinaberry tree as a Category I invasive species. The preference of Jadera haematoloma for seeds of these trees may help to prevent unwanted germination of the seeds and the invasive spread of these trees. If you remove the invasive tree, please replace it with a preferred tree (preferably a native tree). Call and ask for our publication on "Favorite Trees. "...|$|R
