5|$|Escape from Woomera is a point-and-click {{adventure}} game. The player, controlling Mustafa, {{explores the}} Woomera centre, which is populated with non-player characters—computer-controlled individuals that move about the facility on their own. Some of these characters can speak with Mustafa, giving him {{information about the}} facility, <b>sharing</b> <b>their</b> backgrounds or experiences at Woomera, or directing him to find and retrieve objects scattered throughout the facility. Speaking with characters and completing their tasks allows Mustafa to progress towards his goal of escaping the facility.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to disaster relief following hurricanes with names <b>sharing</b> <b>their</b> initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following Hurricane Katrina). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.|$|E
5|$|At {{the ranch}} {{inhabited}} by the Proletheans, a religious extremist group, following her impregnation, Helena is {{introduced to the}} group's nursery where she bonds with a young girl. The Prolethean leader, Henrik Johanssen (Peter Outerbridge), impregnates his teenage daughter Gracie (Zoé de Grand'Maison) with his and Helena's embryos. <b>Sharing</b> <b>their</b> displeasure with what Henrik has done, Helena and Gracie decide to flee the ranch together, but are caught by Henrik as they are preparing to leave. Henrik's protégé and Gracie's lover, Mark (Ari Millen), arrives to defend Gracie. Mark and Gracie flee together as Helena attacks Henrik. Helena tortures Henrik with his own medical instruments before burning down the ranch and running away herself.|$|E

5|$|From {{that date}} on, through the Age of Discovery, European {{colonization}} brought extensive American territory {{under the control}} of Europe's monarchs, though the majority of these colonies subsequently gained independence from their rulers. Some did so via armed conflict with their mother countries, as in the American Revolution and the Latin American wars of independence, usually severing all ties to the overseas monarchies in the process. Others gained full sovereignty by legislative paths, such as Canada's patriation of its constitution from the United Kingdom. A certain number of former colonies became republics immediately upon achieving self-governance. The remainder continued with endemic constitutional monarchies—in the cases of Haiti, Mexico, and Brazil—with their own resident monarch and, for places such as Canada and some island states in the Caribbean, <b>sharing</b> <b>their</b> monarch with their former metropole, the most recently created being that of Belize in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Jenny {{spends her}} final days putting {{together}} a film of memories for Bette and Tina. The film contains friends past and present <b>sharing</b> <b>their</b> best moments. During the going-away party held for Bette and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, they watch the film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool in the back yard. It is assumed that she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper railing. Because {{so many people have}} been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{entry into}} the war {{prompted}} French communists to join the French Resistance, augmenting its presence in Brittany significantly. The majority of Breton nationalists adopted a neutral stance, refusing to join French collaborationist units such as Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism, while <b>sharing</b> <b>their</b> hatred of what they perceived as a worldwide Judeo-Bolshevist conspiracy. In the meantime, Breton nationalists became targets of a guerilla campaign waged by Francs-Tireurs et Partisans, who continued to view them as traitors. The first such killing took place on 4 September 1943, with the shooting of Yann Bricler, a relative of Breton nationalist Olier Mordrel. Lainé decided to directly aid the Germans in their anti partisan operations, hoping {{for a change in}} policy regarding the question of Breton independence. He believed that the mere presence of a purely Breton force would inspire others to join his cause.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of silicon is generally nonmetallic (covalent) in nature. It {{is not known}} to form a cation. Silicon can form alloys with metals such as iron and copper. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. The high strength of the silicon-oxygen bond dominates the chemical behaviour of silicon. Polymeric silicates, built up by tetrahedral SiO4 units <b>sharing</b> <b>their</b> oxygen atoms, are the most abundant and important compounds of silicon. The polymeric borates, comprising linked trigonal and tetrahedral BO3 or BO4 units, are built on similar structural principles. The oxide SiO2 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Traditional organometallic chemistry includes the carbon compounds of silicon (see organosilicon).|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Romans {{hoped to}} resolve the {{situation}} by diplomatic means: Corbulo and Ummidius Quadratus, the governor of Syria, both sent embassies to Vologases, proposing that he give up hostages, as was customary during negotiations, to ensure good faith. Vologases, himself preoccupied by the revolt of his son Vardanes which forced him to withdrew his troops from Armenia, readily complied. A period of inactivity ensued, while the Armenian issue remained in limbo. Corbulo used this lull to restore his troops' discipline and combat readiness, which had diminished in the peaceful garrisons of the East. According to Tacitus, Corbulo discharged all who were old or in ill health, kept the entire army under canvas in the harsh winters of the Anatolian plateau to acclimatize them to the snows of Armenia, and enforced a strict discipline, punishing deserters by death. At the same time however, he took care to be constantly present amongst his men, <b>sharing</b> <b>their</b> hardships.|$|E
5|$|The mercenaries pursue Zangurak to Lazulis Island. Lowell is fatally {{injured by}} a Gurak warrior. Zael finds Calista with Zangurak, who has used her Arganan {{blood and the}} Gurak half of the Outsider to anoint his right arm. After the group defeats Zangurak, he rips off his right arm and sends it to use the full power of the Outsider to revive him. However, Dagran kills Zangurak's arm so he can use the Arganan blood and Outsider half on it for himself. He reveals that he murdered Asthar because he learned that Asthar had {{commanded}} the Lazulis knights who killed his family. He has been collaborating with Zangurak with {{the ultimate goal of}} using the Outsider to remake the world so the mercenaries have a better life. Finding he is still not powerful enough to defeat the group, Dagran tries to absorb the Lazulis half of the Outsider into the center of his body, giving Zael an opening to kill him. Dagran reconciles with the group before dying, then his spirit uses the Outsider's energy to resurrect Lowell. Zael and Calista reunite the two halves of the Outsider, which leaves the planet after explaining that its true purpose is to collect scattered energy in outer space and use it to create life on new worlds. Humans and Gurak begin coexisting, <b>sharing</b> <b>their</b> technology and using Lazulis as a neutral land where the two races freely interact. Therius decides to train new knights in the empire while leaving Lazulis in Zael's care, Zael and Calista are married in her ancient family home, the mercenaries hold a funeral for Dagran, and Zael is finally made a knight by Calista.|$|E
