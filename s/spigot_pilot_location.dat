30|$|As {{explained}} earlier, conventional {{methods for}} {{estimation of the}} CFR at non-pilot subcarriers (given the noisy measurements at pilots) are interpolation-based techniques which require relatively high sampling rates (number of pilots) to produce acceptable mean squared error (MSE). Also, the optimum structure of the <b>pilot</b> <b>locations</b> for these techniques which minimizes the MSE of the estimated channel, is the uniform distribution (equidistance) of the pilots in the spectrum.|$|R
40|$|In {{practical}} {{wireless communication}} systems, the transmitter send the information {{out through a}} multipath fading channel. At the receiver side, the received information distorted by the channel characteristic (due to multipath fading). So, in order to recover the transmitted information accurately, the channel effect must be known at the receiver. In this paper channel estimation for STBC-MIMO-OFDM system has been investigated by implementing the most popular channel estimators least Square (LS) and Minimum Mean Error Square (MMSE) both based on comb type pilot arrangement to estimate the channel effect at <b>pilot</b> <b>locations,</b> and channel interpolation between <b>pilot</b> <b>locations</b> was done using linear interpolation.

30|$|Considering the {{inherent}} sparsity in the impulse {{response of the}} wireless channels {{which is due to}} the sparse structure of the scattering objects, it is possible to estimate the channel impulse response (CIR) more accurately even from non-uniform pilot patterns. The common estimation techniques in this case are those introduced in the field of compressed sensing such as basis pursuit [5] and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) [6]. Unlike the interpolation case, equidistant <b>pilot</b> <b>locations</b> are not the best choices here. In [7], using the results of [5] for sparse signal recovery, it is mentioned that uniformly random pilot locationsa can provide the possibility of perfect channel reconstruction with overwhelming probability. Although this is an important theoretical result, it is not practical. In this article, we suggest a deterministic structure for the <b>pilot</b> <b>locations</b> in sparsity-based channel estimation methods which minimizes the inter-atom interference in discrete fourier transform (DFT) submatrices. Simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed pilot allocation method when greedy methods are used for channel estimation. Also, we propose an iterative thresholding method for channel estimation which results in appropriate performance in time-variant frequency selective OFDM channels.|$|R
