50|$|The {{research}} on high frequency screens {{has led to}} {{new developments in the}} field which enhance the operation and performance of the equipment. These new developments include the stacking of up to 5 individual screen decks placed {{on top of the other}} and operating in parallel. A divider system splits the feed slurry to each Stack Sizer® screen, then to each <b>screen</b> <b>deck</b> on the machine. Each <b>screen</b> <b>deck</b> has an undersize and oversize collection pan which will respectively go into their common outlet. The stacking of the machines thus allows more production while using less space. Another new development is the fabrication of Polyweb urethane screen surfaces that have openings as fine as 45 µm and open areas from 35% - 45%. This leads to the screen being able to separate finer particles. The screens can be used for both wet and dry applications and urethane formulation is still an ongoing process. Thus, research and development is still being invested in high frequency screening equipment to improve the overall separation efficiency and also to lower costs.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem that}} is often {{encountered}} is that the particles clump together due to the moist.

It is recommended that screening at less than around 5mm aperture size is normally performed on perfectly dry materials. A heated <b>screen</b> <b>deck</b> may be used to evaporate the moist in the feed. It will also break the surface tension between the screen wire and the particles.

An Increase of deck angle speeds particle motion with proportional relationship to particle size. This decreases residence time and size stratification along the mesh screen. However, if the angle is greater than 20°, efficiency decreases due to reduction of effective mesh area. Effect of deck angle on efficiency is also influenced by particle density. In mining the optimal inclination angle is about 15°. Exceptions are the dewatering screens at 3° to 5° and steep screens at 20° to 40°.|$|E

The screen, Mogensen Sizer G 054 with electrically heated decks, was during the trials located in the pilot plant at Mineral Processing, where a test station was built for it. The purpose of the investigations was to test some specific applications, and to prepare a standard test procedure for evaluating screening tests with a Mogensen Sizer.

This uses some intelligent rule-based machine fault detection algorithms developed by experts of such machine systems. Given this, the RVS machine diagnosis system involves the utilization of sensors such as thermocouples, strain gauges, accelerometers, oil level sensors and smart bolt wireless sensors to measure in real-time the temperature at which the vibrating motor powering the RVS machine is running. The sensors must measure the real-time stress and deformation that the RVS subsystems such as screen panels, <b>screen</b> <b>deck</b> frame, side plates, side liner plates, back plates, torsion bar, torsion bar brackets and M- 16 bolts e.t.c. of the machine are subjected to.

The oil is responsible for the lubrication of shaft and bearing powering the vibrating motor. The measured values obtained from these sensors are then compared with the rule-based RVS subsystems performance algorithms developed by RVS machine manufacturer. This will alert the users and maintenance managers of this machine when over-heating and knocking of the vibrating motor occurs and when deformation, degradation and wear of the aforementioned subsystems of the RVS machine sets in.

50|$|Conventional {{and general}} {{design for a}} high {{frequency}} vibrating screen consists of mainframe, screen web, eccentric bock, electric motor, rub spring and coupler. The two most common types of vibrators which induce the high frequency vibrations are hydraulic or electric vibrators, these electric vibrators are either electric motors or solenoids. Common designs for <b>screening</b> <b>decks</b> are either single or double deck. In addition, another feature of high frequency vibrating screens are the static side plates which provide benefits such as smaller support structure, less noise, longer life, and hence less maintenance. In industry, the screens are operated at a tiled angle up till 40 º. The high frequency (1500 - 7200 rpm) and low amplitude (1.2 - 2.0 mm) characteristics leads to the vertical-elliptical movement that rapidly transports oversized particles down the screen. Creating a thin bed of particles, this improves the efficiency and capacity of the screen.|$|R
40|$|Large banana screens with {{multiple}} decks are used {{extensively in the}} process separation of many valuable export commodities. They are high capacity vibrating screens with a curved profile. Discrete Element Method (DEM) modelling using non-spherical particles has previously provided significant insight into the operation of these dry industrial screens. Here we introduce the use of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the flow of slurry (water and fine material) through a double deck banana screen. This paper firstly reports on the underlying DEM model of the coarse particulate flow on a full-scale banana screen. We then use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the transport of fine particle slurry over and through the double deck banana screen. Finally, we combine the DEM with SPH models using a one-way coupling to simulate the effects of adding a slurry flow to coarse particulates on the banana screen. The key outcomes from this study are that; SPH is ideally suited for the high speeds and the high fragmented and filamentary nature of the fluid flow through the <b>screen</b> <b>deck</b> openings; the fluid only (SPH) model of slurry behaves similarly to the DEM approach in that more fluid is screened as the velocity slows, except near the earlier panels on the top deck; and, use of a porous media derived from DEM in one-way coupled approach with SPH produces clear and reasonable changes in fluid structure, separation and wetting of the screens consistent with slurry behaviour. Specifically, the fluid layer was much thicker in the coupled case, with slurry being trapped inside a coarse particle bed and which is sensitive to the fluid viscosity. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) in the mining industry, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is {{conducting}} research to develop noise controls for mining equipment whose operators exceed the Permissible Exposure Level (PEL). The process involves three steps: 1) Noise source identification (NSI), 2) development of noise controls, and 3) evaluation of the developed noise controls. For the first and third steps, microphone phased array measurements are typically conducted and data are processed using the conventional beamforming (CB) algorithm. However, due to the size and complexity of the machines, this task is not straight forward. Furthermore, because of the low frequency range of interest, i. e., 200 Hz to 1000 Hz, results obtained using CB may show poor resolution issues which result in inaccuracy in the noise source location. To overcome this resolution issue, two alternative approaches are explored in this paper, namely the CLEAN-SC algorithm and a variarion of an adaptive beamforming algorithm known as Robust Capon Beamformer (RCB). These algorithms were used along with the CB algorithm to process data collected from a horizontal Vibrating Screen (VS) machine used in coal preparation plants. Results with the array in the overhead position showed that despite the use of a large array, i. e., 3. 5 -meter diameter, the acoustic maps obtained using CB showed "hot spots" that covered various components, i. e., the <b>screen</b> <b>deck,</b> the side walls, the I-beam, the eccentric mechanisms, and the electric motor. Thus, {{it was not possible to}} identify which component was the dominant contributor to the sound radiated by the machine. The acoustic maps obtained using the RCB algorithm showed smaller "hot" spots that in general covered only one or two components. Nevertheless, the most dramatic reduction in "hot" spot size was obtained using the CLEAN-SC algorithm. This algorithm yielded acoustic maps with small and well localized "hot" spots that pinpointed dominant noise sources. However, because the CLEAN-SC algorithm yields small and localized "hot" spots, extra care needs to be used when aligning the acoustic maps with the actual pictures of the machine. In conclusion, use of the RCB and the CLEAN-SC algorithms in the low frequency range of interest helped pinpoint dominant noise sources which otherwise would be very hard to identify...|$|E
40|$|Screening or sieving is an {{important}} unit operation to separate particles {{on the basis of}} size by a screening surface which will either accept or reject particles. In spite of its wide application, the understanding of this process is still limited, particularly considering the large number of variables which are related to the screen geometries, operational conditions and particle properties. A better understanding of the process can lead to improvements on the performance and has a great economic significance. Generally, a screening involves two processes: stratification (or percolation) and the passage of free particles through the apertures, in which a particle always experiences complicated particle-particle and particle-wall interactions. Therefore, it is essential to study screening processes at a particle scale. In this work, numerical models based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM) are developed, which readily provides information at a particle scale that can help understand the process better but hardly be obtained from physical experiments. Using DEM, different screening processes have been studied. Firstly, particle percolation in a vibrated screen is investigated. The effects of vibration amplitude and frequency on the percolation behaviours are studied in terms of percolation velocity, residence time distribution and radial dispersion. Further analysis of the diffusion coefficient and porosity shows that the percolation behaviours can be related to the dimensionless vibrational velocity (Vb) for different amplitudes and frequencies. Interestingly, it is found that the percolation velocity can be linked to the dimensionless vibrational velocity, and the critical percolation velocity can always be achieved when Vb equals 2, which corresponds to the onset of the fluidized state. Secondly, a numerical study of particle &# 64258;ow and sieving behaviour in a sieve-shaker is presented, with the sieve-shaker consisting of three sieves in one column. The e&# 64256;ects of variables like vibrational amplitude and frequency, volume ratio and sliding and rolling friction coefficients are studied through a series of controlled numerical experiments. Such a process is modelled by reaction kinetics. The sieving performance is then analysed in terms of sieving rate constant (the kinetic rate) for different sized particles at the top, middle and bottom screens, and a mathematical model is proposed to link sieving rate constant with the considered variables, which can satisfactorily estimate the process kinetics. Finally, the effect of aperture shape, sliding friction coefficient, moisture content and feed rate in different vibration conditions in a vibrated screening process are studied through a series of controlled numerical experiments. The sieving performance is analysed in terms of overall percentage passings of different sized particles and the distribution of percentage passing along the <b>screen</b> <b>deck.</b> The performance of such a screening process is shown to be related to particle &# 64258;ow on the screen such as the structure of particle bed, particle velocities and particle-screen interactions. The sieving behaviour of individual particles is analysed based on the microdynamics information, particularly the particle-screen interactions. On this basis, the probability of a single attempt and the number of attempts for a particle to pass an aperture are modelled which are linked to the macroscopical sieving performance. The results are useful for developing a fundamental understanding of the effect of operational conditions, particle properties and screen geometries on sieving, which will help design, control and optimise practical processes...|$|E

The chemical supply process is responsible for delivering compounds to chemists that would otherwise cost hundreds of dollars per compound with a delay of between one and four weeks, or would require a multiple day synthesis procedure. Stockroom automation, content and process scope, and physical layout were all evaluated. The following major conclusions were developed as a result of the research. First, the procedures for using the compound archives and libraries must be clearly presented to the end user so that s/he is fully able to utilize and contribute to the libraries. Second, compound libraries should be conglomerated into one large library that is also responsible for compound acquisition.

40|$|Bulk solids {{handling}} play {{a critical}} role in modern industrial processes. Particulate classification is one aspect of materials (bulk solids) handling, the aim of which is to distinguish unique particles by virtue of predetermined criteria. Construction, foods, mining, pharmaceutical industries, power generation (e. g. the now versatile biomass-based co-generation plants), and waste management etc., often require sorting in terms of size, specific gravity, grain loading, shape, chemical composition, bulk density, resistivity, friability, wettability, cohesiveness, resilience etc., prior to end-use or further utilization in downstream unit operations. Moreover, bulk solids have been a complex material for several decades, as the process is often referred to as ‘not fully understood’. This dissertation is aimed at developing enhanced, and deeply understood methods for modelling the flow of particles during size classification, by incorporating modern study tools, including computer simulations, and experimental designs, targeted at improved processes. One key objective is to understand the dynamics of granular flow in depth, and to find ways to correlate the energy spent, and the efficiency in such solids classification, both with gravity and vibrated screening equipment. This direct link holds the key to a better understanding that may lead to optimal design and operation of particle classification equipment. The second objective is to address the inefficiency caused by operations at high capacity, through further development of the methods of determination of the rates and optimization of classification processes. The final objective is to simplify these models, to make them easy and applicable for rapid prototyping, fabrication and up-scaling in relevant the industries. First order rate law (FORL) has been used for a long time to estimate the rate of particles’ classification during screening. However FORL only calculates the current population of particle (overflow), but does not estimate the difference in particle population, or the underflow. In order to get the passage, the overflow must be subtracted from the original mass or the particle count. Due to this problem, there are only a few mathematical models (apart from someWeibull distribution functions), that can estimate underflow growth from zero. The existence (or non-existence), of such models is usually described as failure, as it censors some useful results. Secondly, FORL does not necessarily relate the moments or rate constants, to the key design parameters of the unit operation, such as screen dimensions and area, aperture sizes and shapes, and transient motion of particles along the sieve lengths in general. These problems present a challenge for, and are a limitation of the FORL, and thus necessitates empirical, or data-driven modelling. In this thesis, all the components of particle population are estimated simultaneously, which seems to be a successful methodology for further development. An attempt is made to link these constants to the design parameters, used in a representative case study on designing the unit operation. An improved theoretical model for the quantification of the rate of classification is postulated, based on discrete and continuum mathematical theories. These models are tested through a prototype screening equipment designed for studying the impacts of feed throughput, flowability, and <b>screen</b> <b>deck</b> declinations on the overall performance of the screen. Two extremes usually exist when considering rheology in fluid flow. Either it is assumed purely compressible or incompressible. Contrary to these assumptions, it is shown in this study that granular flows are divided into two regimes - the continuum constituting the middle of the flow cross-section, and the bulk flow around it. The specific gravity of the particle fluid tend to vary with the position (vector in space) in the continuum, but invariant with time. In the bulk region, however, the specific gravity varies more with time, but less with position, and thus the flow forms a quasi-compressible flow. Granular flow is therefore described in this study as turbulent, unsteady, Newtonian fluid flow (in a wide channel), with nominal to high densities, and generally low dynamic viscosities, and consequently even lower kinematic viscosities. It is therefore incompressible within the core continuum, but compressible around the bulk flow regime. The volume of the continuum changes with space, and thus the density varies only macroscopically, but remains nearly constant microscopically inside the continuum. The flow over the screens is classified as unidirectional subsonic, meaning that the flow velocity is low (<_ 3 : 5 ms - 1) and only in one direction (downslope), giving Mach numbers below 0. 011. On the other hand, when discrete models are considered, granular materials and powders are assumed to be incompressible, dry, non-cohesive, and rigid, in order to allow time averaging of the bulk velocity. Both models result in Newton’s second law for variable masses, whose solution is found analytically and numerically. Obtaining and zeroing the gradient of the fluctuation velocity enables achieving the agitation force requirements in G-force. A close correlation was found between the developed theoretical and simulation models, and experimental results. In general, dense screen loading is the main source of momentum accumulation that increases the underflow rates, rather the capacity in ton per hour, but reduces the flowability, and consequently the efficiency of size classification. For multi-sized screens, it was shown that up to 99. 99 % efficiency can be achieved for gravity separators while operating at low to medium capacity, but the same efficiency can only be achieved operating at low capacities in vibrated screens...|$|E

With more sophisticated use of fiber optics, satellites, and remote-control robots, scientists one day may explore the deep sea from a computer <b>screen</b> on the <b>deck</b> rather than out of a porthole.|$|R
40|$|Aminergic G-protein coupled receptors (GPRCs) {{represent}} well-known {{targets of}} central nervous-system related diseases. In this study a structure-based consensus virtual screening scheme {{was developed for}} designing targeted fragment libraries against class A aminergic GPCRs. Nine representative aminergic GPCR structures were selected by first clustering available X-ray structures and then choosing the one in each cluster that performs best in self docking calculations. A consensus scoring protocol was developed using known promiscuous aminergic ligands and decoys as a training set. The consensus score (FrACS-fragment aminergic consensus score) calculated for the optimized protein ensemble showed improved enrichments in most cases as compared to stand-alone structures. Retrospective validation was carried out on public screening data for aminergic targets (5 -HT 1 serotonin receptor, TA(1) trace-amine receptor) showing 8 - 17 -fold enrichments using an ensemble of aminergic receptor structures. The performance of the structure based FrACS in combination with our ligand-based prefilter (FrAGS) was investigated both in a retrospective validation on the ChEMBL database and in a prospective validation on an in-house fragment library. In prospective validation virtual fragment hits were tested on S-HT 6 serotonin receptors {{not involved in the}} development of FrACS. Six out of the 36 experimentally tested fragments exhibited remarkable antagonist efficacies, and 4 showed IC 50 values in the low micromolar or submicromolar range in a cell-based assay. Both retrospective and prospective validations revealed that the methodology is suitable for designing focused class A GPCR fragment libraries from large <b>screening</b> <b>decks,</b> commercial compound collections, or virtual databases...|$|R
