5|$|Due to this {{extremely}} thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing {{can significantly}} {{contribute to the}} organism's total gas exchange efficiency. Because of the high energy demand of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. When the bat has its wing in an open/spread out position it allows {{for an increase in}} <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> to volume ratio. The <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the wings is about 85% of the total body <b>surface</b> <b>area,</b> suggesting the possibility of a useful amount of gas exchange. The subcutaneous vessels in the membrane very close to the surface allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.|$|E

5|$|We {{consider}} the <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> {{of the entire}} mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire <b>surface</b> <b>area,</b> including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact <b>surface</b> <b>area.</b> So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E

Much of the volcano is covered in historical flows, and 90 percent of its surface dates from the last 1,100 years.

40|$|The Orlicz-Brunn-Minkowski theory {{receives}} {{considerable attention}} recently, and many {{results in the}} L_p-Brunn-Minkowski theory have been extended to their Orlicz counterparts. The aim {{of this paper is}} to develop Orlicz L_ϕ affine and geominimal <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> for single convex body as well as for multiple convex bodies, which generalize the L_p (mixed) affine and geominimal <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> [...] fundamental concepts in the L_p-Brunn-Minkowski theory. Our extensions are different from the general affine <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> by Ludwig (in Adv. Math. 224 (2010)). Moreover, our definitions for Orlicz L_ϕ affine and geominimal <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> reveal that these affine invariants are essentially the infimum/supremum of V_ϕ(K, L^∘), the Orlicz ϕ-mixed volume of K and the polar body of L, where L runs over all star bodies and all convex bodies, respectively, with volume of L equal to the volume of the unit Euclidean ball B_ 2 ^n. Properties for the Orlicz L_ϕ affine and geominimal <b>surface</b> <b>areas,</b> such as, affine invariance and monotonicity, are proved.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of edge and basal <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> of phyllosilicate particles {{is an essential}} parameter for understanding the interaction mechanisms at solid/gas or solid/liquid interfaces. Among the techniques proposed to determine the geometrical heterogeneities of flat solids, low pressure argon adsorption and AFM analysis are the most promising ones to derive the weight-averaged values of specific <b>surface</b> <b>areas.</b> A series of publications [1, 2] have been recently dedicated to the combination of both methods showing {{the correlation between the}} two approaches. As the obtention of a large set of high resolution AFM images is time consuming it is necessary to test the ability of AFM routine analysis to derive systematically and statistically <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> and aspect ratio, with all possible experimental and instrumental artefacts. In the present study, the expected agreement was found between AFM and argon adsorption determination for total, basal and edge specific <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> of non swelling clay minerals, except for one kaolinite, which is very heterogeneous in sizes. In addition, it was observed that for a given sample, individual particles present similar shapes, whatever their size, allowing to derive statistical relationship between AFM basal and total <b>surface</b> <b>areas.</b> On the basis of the obtained results, recommendations are given to derive accurate edge, basal and total specific <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> of phyllosilicates by combining conventional gas adsorption (nitrogen BET) and routine AFM techniques...|$|R

Another possible function is that the plates may have helped the animal increase heat absorption from the sun.

For the ices annealed at temperatures above 200 K, external <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> calculated from the observed particle sizes agree reasonably well with the BET areas, which indicates that the annealed ices are composed of nonporous particles and that the porosity of these ices is due to interstices among the particles...|$|R

Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the pan and again decreased boiling time.
