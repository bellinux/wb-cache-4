The {{existing}} programs for public support {{have been made}} {{with reference to the}} need for essential air <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> for providing local communities with lifeline <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> However, the criteria for giving public support (via the programs in USA, Canada and Europe) allows for quite wide interpretation of the terms “remote regions” and “lifeline services”. In some places, subsidies are given to routes with quite heavy traffic where the potential for ordinary commercial services could have been offered. In other subsidy programs, air services’ role as lifeline transport can be questioned because there are modes of <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> that probably can serve these lifeline needs. A clearer set of criteria for “remoteness” and “lifeline services” could perhaps be developed. The allocative efficiency of the services should be focused, i. e. that the level of service are aligned with market needs and regional policy objectives. There should also be a coordinated approach to the funding of services to remote regions across relevant transport modes. ...|$|R

40|$|Transport is {{a crucial}} {{component}} in logistics, which joints each activity in the logistics chain. The performance of logistics heavily relies on the efficiency of <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> However, until now {{there has not been}} a clear definition about <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> Moreover, along with the rapid rise of fuel prices, the input-output ratio of transport has been trapped in an unreasonable situation, which causes the poor performance of logistics.

However, these <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> phenomena are buried in the presence of metallic bulk conduction. We synthesized very high quality Bi 2 Te 2 Se single crystals by using a modified Bridgman method that possess high bulk resistivity of > 20 Omega cm below 20 K, whereas the bulk is mostly inactive and <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> dominates. The temperature dependence of resistivity follows an activation law like a gap semiconductor in temperature range 20 - 300 K. To extract the <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> from that of the bulk, we designed a special measurement geometry to measure the resistance and found that single-crystal Bi 2 Te 2 Se exhibits a crossover from bulk to surface conduction at 20 K. Simultaneously, the material also shows strong evidence of weak antilocalization in magnetotransport owing to the protection against scattering by conducting surface states. This simple geometry facilitates finding evidence of <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> in topological insulators, which are promising materials for future spintronic applications...|$|R
