Hackney, Incorporated, its metal components subsidiary, produced materials for piping systems. Trinity produced completed railcars, including tank cars, covered and open hoppers, and gondolas to transport chemicals, coal, structural steel and other commodities, at locations in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Longview, Texas, and held two railcar leasing subsidiaries. The company also produced containers for fertilizer, liquified petroleum gas, and nuclear fuel and waste. In 1981 Trinity acquired a metal fabrication firm at Channelview, Texas, and Babcock & Wilcox plants in Elkhart, Indiana, and Koppel, Pennsylvania, and in 1983 it acquired Halter Marine. In 1984 Trinity absorbed Quick Car and acquired the railcar designs and production facilities of the Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company, once the largest railcar manufacturer in North America. That same year Trinity also acquired the railcar designs of General American Transportation Corporation. In 1986 the rail car designs and production facilities of Greenville Steel Car Company were purchased, including the auto rack designs of Portec-Paragon. Also acquired in 1986 were the railcar designs of North American Car Corporation, and in 1987 Ortner Freight Car was acquired.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Industrial engineering. The manufacturing industry has shifted its approach from traditional manufacturing to agile manufacturing. The production of customized products will increase in response to the individual demands of customers. In exploring various industry trends, researchers have developed different approaches to designing <b>structural</b> <b>products.</b> The most popular and most commonly used approach in contending with <b>structural</b> <b>products</b> is the modularity approach. Moreover, there are several studies that address modularity with respect to structural representations. Even so, there is not yet a unified method for supporting product structure development and for integrating information. Another aspect that current research has not yet adequately addressed is product information retrieval. Those studies that did contend with product information retrieval, addressed one-level retrieval models, while ignoring <b>structural</b> <b>products.</b> Thus, limitations persist in current intelligent retrieval systems. To answer the aforementioned difficulty, a unified indexing scheme is introduced. In this study, the information can be put into numerical form as the proposed unified indexing scheme, which is represented by a component and structure matrix. The component and structure matrix is the way to achieve an application of modular design retrieval because (1) it is a unique presentation of a structural product and provides a uniform representation; and (2) it lists all modules, as well as all components, in one representation. As a result of the proposed method, an intelligent retrieval system will give an enterprise the ability to communicate with its partners efficiently. Therefore, the aim of this research is to develop a system that will enable more efficient and more effective product-design retrieval systems for <b>structural</b> <b>products,</b> and to demonstrate this framework through a Web-based application using Web technology. To obtain reference designs after utilizing the unified indexing scheme, a Fuzzy-ART neural network is implemented in order to handle retrieval tasks...|$|E
40|$|In this study, Nordic Scots pine wood is benchmarked, {{based on}} literature, against {{selected}} competing tree species and non-wood substitute materials in selected end-use segments of mechanical wood products. In joinery, interior, and furniture products, the comparisons were made against Western red cedar, ponderosa pine, loblolly pine, and radiata pine, whereas in segment of <b>structural</b> <b>products,</b> lodgepole pine, Norway spruce, and Douglas-fir were included into the study. It {{should be noted}} that the material comparisons are valid for small clear wood specimens, not exactly for sawn timber. With respect to the substitute materials, the comparisons were made against a variety of materials in joinery products (case window frames), exterior cladding (siding), and <b>structural</b> <b>products.</b> Based on the literature findings, the main strengths, the weaknesses that could be improved, and the weknesses that must be accepted were concluded for Nordic Scots pine wood as a raw material for joinery products, exterior claddings, and <b>structural</b> <b>products</b> and their end-uses. Compared to the competing tree species, Nordic Scots pine wood is quite superior in the strength and the stiffness properties essential for joinery, interior, and furniture products, as well as for <b>structural</b> <b>products.</b> The variation in several wood properties is the higher the southerly is the geographical origin; with this respect, Scots pine wood from the Nordic countries is more homogeneous compared to wood from the more southerly latitudes. In general, Nordic Scots pine wood is a suitable material for a wide selection of joinery, interior, and furniture products when it is processed and treated properly, and moderately high-quality wood material is selected. Also in structural uses Nordic Scots pine wood is well able to compete against other species, even if moderately large variations may be expected, especially in the strength and stiffness properties due to the geographical origin, knottiness properties, grain angle, and other background variables. Compared to the competing non-wood substitute materials, the main problems of wood as a raw material for several end-uses are associated with the large variations in a variety of properties, as well as with the hygroscopicity and anisotropy of wood material. The main strengths of wood are based on good overall mechanical performance, operational safety and friendliness to the environment, and on the fact that wood is a well-known, traditional material...|$|E

Instead {{of relying on}} larger, more expensive old-growth timber, LP found ways to make <b>structural</b> building <b>products</b> from small-diameter, fast-growing trees. LP pioneered the use of oriented strand board (OSB) — a reconstituted plywood substitute made by pressing wood wafers together.
