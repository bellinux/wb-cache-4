5|$|Apple's US distributor, Capitol Records, {{mastered}} the <b>single</b> <b>to</b> run {{at a faster}} speed than the album track, {{in order to make}} the song sound brighter on the radio. Unusually for an Apple release by a former Beatle, the single was packaged in a plain sleeve in the main markets of Britain and the United States. A variety of picture sleeves were available in European countries, including a design incorporating Harrison's signature and a red Om symbol, both of which were aspects of Tom Wilkes's artwork for the Material World album.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{struggled}} {{against the new}} ball in the first {{hour of the day}} three. Miller played and missed three times in one over before being trapped lbw for 31; the tourists added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Morris reached 51 and fell to Bedser, leaving Australia at 5/139. It had been a slow morning for Morris—he took 21 minutes to add a <b>single</b> <b>to</b> his overnight total and reached 50 after taking another 24 minutes to register his second run of the day. Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the last morning after many rain delays. This left Bradman’s team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary critics {{gave the}} song mixed reviews, some complimenting the production, while others {{considered}} it fell flat as the album's last song. The single peaked inside the top 20 {{of the charts}} in New Zealand and on the UK Singles Chart, where it became her third <b>single</b> <b>to</b> do so. The accompanying music video portrayed Allen's brother as a puppet while the storyline follows the lyrical meaning of the song. The song was performed live by Allen during her 2007 concert tour, {{as part of the}} encore.|$|E

5|$|Deep Purple was {{practically}} {{ignored by the}} music press in the US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced {{up and down on}} the Billboard 200 chart for a few weeks, peaking at No. 162 and not coming close to the success of its two predecessors. Tetragrammaton's financial problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit <b>single</b> <b>to</b> be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} inning, deGrom allowed a leadoff walk to Alex Gordon and {{subsequent}} <b>single</b> <b>to</b> Alex Rios before Alcides Escobar's RBI single tied the game.
