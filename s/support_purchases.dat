5|$|The IMA {{has relied}} on {{affiliates}} to support and raise awareness about the museum's collections since the early 20th century. In 1919 the Friends of American Art was founded to <b>support</b> <b>purchases</b> for the Art Association of Indianapolis and Herron Museum. For two decades the Friends purchased 22 works of art for the collection, funded by members' annual donations. The Alliance of the Indianapolis Museum of Art was founded in 1958 and planned lectures, black tie balls, and related activities {{in order to raise}} funds for the museum. Major gifts included a $350,000 contribution in 1979 toward the $40 million centennial endowment campaign and a $500,000 contribution toward the IMA's 1990 expansion. By 2007 the Alliance had provided purchase funds for over 300 works of art. The Contemporary Art Society was formed in 1962 to acquire contemporary art for the museum's permanent collection. In 1963, the first major acquisition consisted of 65 works. The Horticultural Society was founded in 1972 to contribute to the care and education of the museum's gardens and grounds, raising $65,000 in 1989 toward the restoration of Oldfields' gardens. In the late 1970s the Second Century Society and the Print and Drawing Society were both formed. The Second Century Society, later known as the IMA Council, was founded to celebrate donations of $1,000 or more to the museum's annual operating fund, attracting more than 200 contributors during its inaugural year. In 1979, the Print and Drawing Society exhibited 70 artworks spanning 500 years in their first exhibit, The Print and Drawing Society Collections. By the late 1980s the museum had expanded its affiliate program to include the Decorative Arts Society, the Asian Arts Society, the Ethnographic Arts Society, and the Fashion Arts Society.|$|E
40|$|NetCents is a lightweight, {{flexible}} and secure protocol for electronic commerce over the Internet {{that is designed}} to <b>support</b> <b>purchases</b> ranging in value from a fraction of a penny and up. NetCents differs from previous protocols in several respects: NetCents uses (vendor-independent) floating scrips as signed containers of electronic currency, passed from vendor to vendor. This allows NetCents to incorporate decentralized verification of electronic currency at a vendor's server with offline payment capture. Customer trust is not required within this protocol and a probabilistic verification scheme is used to effectively limit vendor fraud. An online arbiter is implemented that will ensure proper delivery of purchased goods and that can settle most customer/vendor disputes. NetCents can be extended to support fully anonymous payments. In this paper we describe the NetCents protocol and present experimental results of a prototype implementation. 1 Introduction This paper introduces Net [...] ...|$|E
40|$|By one hand, {{the nature}} of money {{influences}} the objects, the objectives and the methods of production and consumption. On the other hand, the distribution of money influences human behaviors, the supply and the demand of goods, and hence their prices. Today, the banking sector enjoys the privilege of creating around 95 % of the money supply. Moreover, as bank money bears interest {{as a condition of}} its existence, it has long been argued that a systemic growth imperative is inherent to its design. The pursuit of the interrelated goals of ecological sustainability and social justice calls for changes to money-as-usual. This article focuses on degrowth as a novel paradigm that advances changes in money nature and distribution. We scrutinize electronic currencies, which may be defined as alternatives or complements to legal tender money that circulate in electronic forms. At the hearth of the electronic currencies, Information and Communication Technology has the potential for changing modern society. But does Information and Communication Technology shape our society for purposive degrowth? The article aims to explore to what extent electronic currencies can be considered as practical initiatives for advancing socially equitable and ecologically sustainable degrowth. A literature review is the method employed to bring a first preliminary answer to the research question. Our results show that electronic currencies can contribute at the individual level to <b>support</b> <b>purchases</b> and at the society level to support optimal allocation of resources. Nothing emerged, in literature, supporting the hypothesis that electronic currency could shape our society for purposive degrowth. Extension of the literature review and empirical study of electronic currencies in action will be the next research steps. Track: Degrowth for the ric...|$|E

40|$|Planners {{and others}} have {{proposed}} developing high-density residential nodes around transit stations to reduce auto dependence and encourage transit use. Such nodes, the argument goes, would provide more patrons for the transit system, more shoppers for nearby stores, {{and more of a}} community for the residents. However, such high-density housing runs counter to the assumed American preference for low-density, detached homes. This study investigates the relationship between residential density and housing satisfaction. It also examines the extent to which other factors, such as proximity of the residential development to transit and respondent background variables, influence this relationship. Data were collected through the presentation of computer-simulated slides to respondents in two urban areas in California. Slides of residential developments of various densities were overlaid on slides of four different settings, two settings next to transit stations and two next to freeway interchanges. Respondents indicated levels of satisfaction with each slide, selected slides they most and least liked, identified housing and neighborhood attributes and other factors associated with their selections, and provided information on their travel behavior and socioeconomic and demographic variables. High-density housing was strongly disliked by a large majority of respondents. However, this reaction was affected by various design features. Housing near transit was generally preferred to housing near freeways. Familiarity with and proximity to sites used in the study did not influence satisfaction ratings. Certain respondent variables did influence the satisfaction-density relationship, including age, income, and presence or absence of children. These results suggest that the desire for single-family detached housing is still quite strong, although not absolute. The concluding section discusses some reasons for this, including cultural norms that confer status and social position on owners of a single-family house with a yard and federal policies that <b>support</b> <b>purchases</b> of single-family detached housing, particularly in suburban areas. Planners and others concerned with increasing residential densities around transit stations should recognize these factors in their planning efforts. Recommendations stemming from this work include utilizing what has been learned about reducing perceived densities while maintaining relatively high objective densities, and identifying and designing high-density living for selected submarkets, such as younger residents, lower-income residents, and households without children...|$|E
