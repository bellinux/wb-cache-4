40|$|In recent years, five modern {{municipal}} {{waste incineration plants}} have been built in Poland. Next ones are being constructed {{and at the same}} time building of several others is being considered. Despite positive experience with the operation of the existing installations, each project of building a new incinerator raises a lot of emotions and social protests. The main argument against construction of an incineration plant is the emission of pollutants. The work compares emissions from {{municipal waste}} incineration plants with those from typical heating plants: in the first part, for comparison large heating plants equipped with pulverized coal-fired <b>boilers</b> (OP- 140), <b>stoker-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> (three OR- 32 boilers) or gas blocks with heat output of about 100 MW have been selected, while the second part compares WR- 10 and WR- 25 <b>stoker-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> most popular in our heating industry with thermal treatment systems for municipal waste or refuse-derived-fuel (RDF) with similar heat output.

40|$|In Krakow, Poland, {{coal-fired}} boilers {{are used}} to heat single apartment buildings and local heating districts. Tile population includes 2, 930 small, hand-fired boilers and 227 larger traveling grate <b>stoker-fired</b> <b>boilers.</b> These boilers are important contributors to air quality problems in Krakow, and an assessment of their efficiency and emissions characteristics was recently undertaken. For the larger, <b>stoker-fired</b> <b>boilers,</b> efficiency was measured using a stack-loss method In addition to the normal baseline fuel, the effects of coal cleaning and grading were evaluated Testing was done at two selected sites. Boiler efficiencies {{were found to be}} low- 50 % to 67 %. These boilers operate without combustion controls or instrumentation for flue gas analysis. As a result, excess air levels are very high (up to 400 %) leading to poor performance. Emissions were found to be typical for boilers of this type. Using the improved fuels yields reductions in emissions and improvement in efficiency when combined with proper adjustments. In the case of the hand-fired boilers, one set of cast-iron boilers and one set of steel boilers were tested. Efficiency in this case was measured using an input-output method for sets of three boilers taken together as a system. Emissions from these boilers are lowest when low volatile fuels, such as coke or smokeless briquettes, are used...|$|R

The effort under this program has been focused into 5 main areas of interest as follows: (1) energy conservation and extension of central station district heating; (2) replacement of coal- and coke-fired boilers with natural gas-fired boilers; (3) replacement of coal-fired home stoves with electric heating appliances; (4) reduction of emissions from <b>stoker-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> houses; and (5) reduction of emissions from coal-fired home heating stoves...|$|E
40|$|In 1991, US and Polish {{officials}} {{signed a}} Memorandum of Understanding formally initiating and directing the Cracow Clean Fossil Fuels and Energy Efficiency Program. Developing a program approach {{for the most}} effective use of the available funds required considerable {{effort on the part}} of all project participants. The team recognized early that the cost of solving the low emissions problem even in only one city far exceeded the amount of available US funds. Economic conditions in Poland limited availability of local capital funds for environmental projects. Imposing environmental costs on struggling companies or city residents under difficult conditions of the early 1990 's required careful consideration of the economic and political impacts. For all of these reasons the program sought to identify technologies for achieving air quality goals which, through improved efficiency and/or reduced fuel cost, could be so attractive economically as to lead to self-sustaining activities beyond the end of the formal project. The effort under this program has been focused into 5 main areas of interest as follows: (1) Energy Conservation and Extension of Central Station District Heating; (2) Replacement of Coal- and Coke-Fired Boilers with Natural Gas-Fired Boilers; (3) Replacement of Coal-Fired Home Stoves with Electric Heating Appliances; (4) Reduction of Emissions from <b>Stoker-Fired</b> <b>Boiler</b> Houses; and (5) Reduction of Emissions from Coal-Fired Home Heating Stoves...|$|E

40|$|In summary, <b>stoker-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> that cofire or {{switch to}} biomass fuel may {{potentially}} {{have to deal}} with ash behavior issues such as production of different concentrations and quantities of fine particulate or aerosols and ash-fouling deposition. Stoker boiler operators that are considering switching to biomass and adding potential infrastructure to accommodate the switch may also at the same time be looking into upgrades that will allow for generating additional power for sale on the grid. This is the case for the feasibility study being done currently for a small (< 1 -MW) stoker facility at the North Dakota State Penitentiary, which is considering not only the incorporation of a lower-cost biomass fuel but also a refurbishing of the stoker boiler to burn slightly hotter with the ability to generate more power and sell excess energy on the grid. These types of fuel and boiler changes can greatly affect ash behavior issues...|$|R

Compliance stoker fuels come from locations such as Kentucky and West Virginia and the price for fuels from these locations is high relative to the current price of Illinois coal. This market offers the most attractive near-term economic environment for commercialization of pelletization technology. For this effort, we will be investigating the use of fines from two Illinois mines which currently mine relatively low-sulfur reserves and that discard their fines fraction (minus 100 mesh).

40|$|AbstractAs Thai's energy {{security}} heavily relies on imported crude oil products, the Thai government has promoted {{the use of}} alternative energy sources {{as a substitute for}} fossil fuel through the Renewable Energy Development Plan. According to this plan, 3, 630 MW of electricity should be derived from biomass or agricultural residue in 2021. Although some agricultural residue has been commercially used as fuel in biomass power plants, corn residue is still leftover and has a high energy potential in some regions, e. g. {{in the northern part of}} Thailand. This study focuses on the supply chain management in using corn residue as an alternative energy source for power production in Nakorn Sawan and Petchchaboon Provinces. In 2011, almost two million tons of corn residue were generated; about 200, 000 tons of which were corncob (HHV of 15 - 16 MJ/kg) and the rest was corn trash/skin and stems (HHV of 13 - 15 MJ/kg). Because of the uniform and compact shape of corncobs, they can be completely utilized as fuel in a conventional <b>stoker-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> for heat production. In contrast, corn trash/skin and stems are leftover in the field or burnt on the field without any energy recovery because they are bulky and non-uniform fuel, with high moisture content, which leads to difficulty in collection and transportation, as well as for thermal conversion. According to the results of this study, a processing unit is necessary to improve the properties of corn trash/skin and stems to be used as solid fuel. This processing unit can be established as a centralized plant or on the field where the residue is generated. Regarding the economic analysis, the overall cost of bio-pellet from corn trash/skin/stems is estimated to be 49. 4 - 56. 8 US$ per ton, depending on the pelletizing capacity. The bio-pellets from corn residue can easily be transported to be used as feedstock for heating or power generation by direct combustion, co-firing, or gasification technology...|$|E

5000|$|Originally {{equipped}} with reciprocating steam engines, during its long life {{a total of}} eighteen generating sets were installed and in turn replaced with larger units or scrapped. The final equipment was of fairly typical 1940's design with eight Babcock <b>stoker-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> using the range system, feeding two British Thomson-Houston 34 MW sets and two Richardsons-Westgarth 30 MW sets, running at 650 psi and 875 F superheat. Two of the cooling towers were unique, nationally and probably globally, in having the control room, 33 kV switchgear, relay room, garages and main stores beneath them. The station was coal-fired throughout its life, although small quantities of more unusual low-cost fuels were burned,including coke, sawdust, and at one period chicken droppings. Fuel was delivered originally by canal and later by rail,with small quantities by road. Although in later years the station was small in comparison with modern stations, it was extremely successful,and had a high availability, load factor and thermal efficiency when compared with most stations similar in design and age. It was the first station {{in the country to}} use the innovative [...] "Taprogge" [...] system of on-load condenser tube cleaning.For thirteen years, from 1959 to 1971, the load factor never dropped below 50%, well above that of the system as a whole. In 1968-1970, Ocker Hill had the highest load factor of any CEGB stoker-fired station, and the third highest thermal efficiency. During periods of plant shortage, it repeatedly carried overloads of up to 20%.|$|R

Previously it has been decided that corn starch would be used as binder and a roller-and-die mill would be used for pellet manufacture. A quality starch binder has been identified and tested. To potentially lower binder costs, a starch that costs about 50 % of the high quality starch was tested. Results indicate that the lower cost starch will not lower binder cost because more is required to produce a comparable quality pellet.

40|$|Utilisation of waste-water sludge {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} processes of environment protection because of the high moisture and contents of harmful substances. The waste-water treatment systems in Poland, especially in small towns, are often not separate from industrial sewage systems and this causes relatively large contents of heavy metals and other toxic substances in the sludge. Incineration is the only effective method of utilisation of such waste material. From the other side, coal is still the most popular fuel in Poland, and it is often used in many boilers producing hot water for the central heating of buildings or parts of the towns. Mostly they are stoker fired boilers of old construction, and they need urgent modernisation. The use of <b>stoker-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> for incineration of the sludge in small towns is the object of the analysis presented in this paper. There are two important points in the co-combustion of sludge with coal in a stoker-fired boilers: ecological and exploitation requirements. The important restriction of the sludge/coal ratio is the emission of harmful substances with the flue gas. There are substances originating from the components of the sludge: SO 2, NOx, HCl, heavy metals and dust. Their concentrations in the flue gas should meet the environmental regulations. The other factor influencing the co-combustion process is the change of physical and thermal properties of the fuel: heating value, moisture content and ash composition. These influence the thermal output of the boiler, the amount of air required for combustion, the volume of flue gases and dust concentration and particle distribution. In this paper, the results of experiments performed with an experimental boiler are presented. The effects of the following parameters are considered: composition and thermal parameters of the sludge and their change during the year, emissions of SO 2, NOx, CO and dust from the experimental boiler for various compositions of the fuel (sludge/coal ratio, moisture content). As a result of the analysis, the parameters limiting the amount of sludge in a mixture with coal are identified. Incineration Sludge Combustion Emission...|$|R
