40|$|My {{goal is to}} {{understand}} how a legged system can transfer support between the feet during a dynamic walking gait. My approach {{is to build a}} legged robot that uses a dynamic gait and to explore control algorithms that provide smooth transfer. The robot I have built has five links that move in a plane: a pelvis, two legs, and two feet. The links are connected by revolute joints which are actuated by electric motors. The robot can balance on one foot and walk with a dynamic rocking gait. Ground <b>speed</b> <b>matching</b> has been used to improve the exchange of support. In ground <b>speed</b> <b>matching</b> the closing velocity between the foot and the ground is manipulated by appropriate ankle motions. The improvement in transfer of support included reduced peak forces and a gradual loading of the striking foot. Thesis Supervisor: Marc H.

40|$|Regular {{expression}} {{pattern matching}} {{is the foundation}} and core engine of many network functions, such as network intrusion detection, worm detection, traffic analysis, web applications and so on. DFA-based solutions suffer exponentially exploding state space and cannot be remedied without sacrificing <b>matching</b> <b>speed.</b> Given this scalability problem of DFA-based methods, there has been increasing interest in NFA-based methods for memory efficient regular expression matching. To achieve high <b>matching</b> <b>speed</b> using NFA, it requires potentially massive parallel processing, and hence represents an ideal programming task on Graphic Processor Unit (GPU). Based on in-depth understanding of NFA properties as well as GPU architecture, we propose effective methods for fitting NFAs into GPU architecture through proper data structure and parallel programming design, so that GPU's parallel processing power can be better utilized to achieve high <b>speed</b> regular expression <b>matching.</b> Experiment results demonstrate that, compared with the existing GPU-based NFA implementation method [9], our proposed methods can boost <b>matching</b> <b>speed</b> by 29 ∼ 46 times, consistently yielding above 10 Gbps <b>matching</b> <b>speed</b> on NVIDIA GTX- 460 GPU. Meanwhile, our design only needs {{a small amount of}} memory space, growing exponentially more slowly than DFA size. These results make our design an effective solution for memory efficient high <b>speed</b> regular expression <b>matching,</b> and clearly demonstrate the power and potential of GPU as a platform for memory efficient high <b>speed</b> regular expression <b>matching.</b> Copyright © 2012 ACM...|$|R

Following {{the completion of the}} speed-matching task, participants were asked three questions regarding (1) strategy used to match speed: “What strategies did you use to complete the <b>speed</b> <b>matching</b> task?”; (2) awareness of GFOV setting: “Did you notice any changes in the simulation {{at any time during the}} experiment?”; and (3) subjective accuracy: “How accurate do you think you were in performing the task on a one to ten scale, one being ‘extremely inaccurate’ and ten being ‘extremely accurate’?” Results indicated participants were not (directly) aware of changes in the GFOV; some misattributed the change in GFOV to a change in the vehicle’s acceleration rate. Furthermore, many participants’ cited strategies that were later categorized as ‘using optic flow’ and, in general, were unsure about their accuracy in the task...|$|R

40|$|Area V 3 A was {{identified}} in five human subjects on both a functional and retinotopic basis using functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} techniques. V 3 A, along with other visual areas responsive to motion, was then targeted for disruption by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) whilst the participants performed a delayed <b>speed</b> <b>matching</b> task. The stimuli used for this task included chromatic, isoluminant motion stimuli that activated either the L-M or S-(L+M) cone-opponent mechanisms, in addition to moving stimuli that contained only luminance contrast (L+M). The <b>speed</b> <b>matching</b> task was performed for chromatic and luminance stimuli that moved at slow (2 degrees/s) or faster (8 degrees/s) speeds. The application of rTMS to area V 3 A produced a perceived slowing of all chromatic and luminance stimuli at both slow and fast speeds. Similar deficits were found when rTMS was applied to V 5 /MT+. No deficits in performance were found when areas V 3 B and V 3 d were targeted by rTMS. These results provide evidence of a causal link between neural activity in human area V 3 A and the perception of chromatic isoluminant motion. They establish area V 3 A, alongside V 5 /MT+, as a key area in a cortical network that underpins the analysis of not only luminance but also chromatically-defined motion...|$|R
40|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>matches</b> were obtained, using {{a spatial}} two-alternative forced-choice task, between asecond-order motion {{stimulus}} and a first-order motion stimulus. The second-order motion stimulus {{was composed of}} contrast-modulated noise [produced by multiplying two-dimensional (2 -d), static noise by a drifting, one-dimensional (l-d) sinusoid]. The first-order motion stimulus was composed of luminance-modulated noise (produced by summing, rather than multiplying, 2 -d noise and a drifting sine grating). In Expt 1, {{the relationship between the}} perceived speed of first- and second-order motion was examined. The motion stimuli had the same spatial frequency (1 or 3 c/deg) and were equated for visibility by presenting them at the same multiple of direction-identification threshold. Over a range of physical speeds, the perceived speeds of the first-order and second-order motion stimuli were identical when their physical speeds were the same. In Expt 2, the effect of varying stimulus "contrast " (contrast modulation depth) on the perceived speed of second-order motion was examined. The contrast of the first-order motion stimulus was fixed and <b>speed</b> <b>matches</b> were obtained for second-order motion stimuli at several contrast modulation depths.
