25|$|This {{argument}} has been formulated by Paul Churchland, among others. The point is that, in instances {{of some sort}} of brain damage (e.g. caused by automobile accidents, drug abuse, pathological diseases, etc.), it is always the case that the mental substance and/or properties of the person are significantly changed or compromised. If the mind were a completely separate substance from the brain, how could it be possible that every <b>single</b> <b>time</b> the brain is injured, the mind is also injured? Indeed, it is very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind of mental or psychological deterioration or change that human beings will undergo when specific parts of their brains are damaged. So the question for the dualist to try to confront is how can all of this be explained if the mind is a separate and immaterial substance from, or if its properties are ontologically independent of, the brain.|$|E
25|$|Juan Andrés Rodríguez Silva participated on Guatemala's behalf as {{its only}} equestrian athlete in the Beijing Olympics. Born in September 1971, Rodríguez was 36 {{years old at}} the time he participated in Beijing, where he {{qualified}} for the individual jumping event. He had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During the first part of the August 15 preliminary round, Rodríguez and Orestus accrued eight points from jump penalties and one point from a time penalty, earning nine penalty points overall. Of the 77 competitors in this first portion of the event, Rodríguez tied Venezuela's Pablo Barros and Mexico's Enrique Gonzalez for 52nd place. In the second round, the pair again accrued seven jumping penalties and one time penalty, bringing their total up to 18 penalty points. This placed Rodríguez at 40th place out of the 71 finishing athletes, tying German riders Ludger Beerbaum and Christian Ahlmann as well as Brazil's Camila Benedicto. In the third round, Rodríguez and Orestus accrued 12 jumping penalties and a <b>single</b> <b>time</b> penalty, raising their total to 31 penalty points. With this, Juan Rodríguez ranked 41st in the event.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} of the Roman vicariate, as described above, rested largely on usage; it was not constructed as a compact whole at one <b>single</b> <b>time.</b> The most important ordinances respecting it were issued at various times {{during the course of}} the last two centuries, showing that for a long time the inadequacy of its organization, especially as regards the great length of time necessary for the settlement of matters brought before it, had been severely felt, more, however, by the subordinates of the vicariate than by its higher officials. It could not be said that its methods of business were in any way compatible with modern ideas as to efficient management. The lack of harmony was doubly evident after the entire central administration of the Church had been reformed by the Constitution Sapienti Consilio, of 29 June 1908. During the past various difficulties had stood in the way of a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate. Not the least of these was the lack of space in the former office of the vicariate. It was not until after the purchase of the Palazzo Mariscotti near San Francesco alle Stimmate, which was assigned to the cardinal vicar and his officials and arranged for their use, that Pius X was able to carry out his long cherished plan for a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate.|$|E
