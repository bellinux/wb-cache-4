5|$|Bradford {{opened the}} scoring after only eight {{minutes of the}} match through teenage {{hometown}} midfielder Hamilton. A long pass from Huxford down the right flank was headed by <b>Shutt</b> into Hamilton's path. He beat three defenders and, despite the fact he was stumbling, shot past Notts County goalkeeper Ward, with the ball going in after hitting the crossbar. It had been Bradford's first shot of the game. Steve Finnan had County's first chance after 14 minutes but shot straight at Bradford keeper Jonathan Gould. Minutes later, City had two successive chances through <b>Shutt</b> and Youds, but the first was blocked and the second went wide. During this spell of play, County's two central defenders Murphy and Gary Strodder both received yellow cards. Just before half-time, <b>Shutt</b> {{had the chance to}} double City's lead but his weak shot hit Ward's ankles after good work by Kiwomya.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens added {{ten more}} championships in 15 seasons from 1965 to 1979, with another dynastic run of four-straight Cups from 1976 to 1979. In the 1976–77 season, the Canadiens set two still-standing team records – for most points, with 132, and fewest losses, by only losing eight games in an 80-game season. The next season, 1977–78, {{the team had}} a 28-game unbeaten streak, the second-longest in NHL history. The next {{generation}} of stars included Guy Lafleur, Yvan Cournoyer, Ken Dryden, Pete Mahovlich, Jacques Lemaire, Pierre Larouche, Steve <b>Shutt,</b> Bob Gainey, Serge Savard, Guy Lapointe and Larry Robinson. Scotty Bowman, who would later set a record for most NHL victories by a coach, was the team's head coach for its last five Stanley Cup victories in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Kamara's main {{selection}} dilemma was in attack {{where he}} had to pick a strike partner for Stallard, a player who had joined from Derby County in January for £120,000 and gone on to score ten goals. Kamara opted for <b>Shutt,</b> who was given only a 50 per cent of playing {{in the run-up to}} the match because of a slight knock, with Ian Ormondroyd, a veteran of three play-off finals with his previous club Leicester City, selected as substitute. Captain Eddie Youds, who overcame a knee problem to return to the side in defence in place of David Brightwell, was the only player not to have played in the second leg against Blackpool. Notts County's side featured only two of the players that had been relegated the previous season – Tony Agana and Shaun Murphy. Their side also contained Darren Ward, who was selected for the Second Division PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) representative side, and Steve Finnan, on loan from First Division Birmingham City.|$|E

40|$|This essay, {{written for}} a {{symposium}} on the 20 th anniversary of Philips Petroleum v. <b>Shutts,</b> critically examines {{the legacy of}} <b>Shutts.</b> The first part argues that Shutss solved the immediate problem of allowing a centralized forum to adjudicate common claims of market-based harms, despite the multistate citizenship of the affected individuals. <b>Shutts</b> handled this by applying a due process balancing approach {{to the question of}} personal jurisdiction and, in turn, allowing notice and the ability to opt out to suffice to establish binding personal jurisdiction over class actions. <b>Shutts</b> could not, however, provide a mechanism to ensure that the forum in which the case was consolidated was the most appropriate place to litigate the matter, as opposed to simply being an appropriate forum. The result was widespread forum-shopping in class actions. That problem has been addressed, to some extent, by the newly enacted Class Action Fairness Act. The second part of this essay addresses the problem of choice of law once a case is consolidated in a single proceeding. <b>Shutts</b> struck down the application of forum law to transactions that were unrelated to the Kansas site of the litigation. But <b>Shutts</b> left open the question of what the permissible parameters of choice of law should be. This essay concludes with an argument for why the use of a standardized body of law, such as that from the home state of the defendant, is the necessary next step for the efficient adjudication of common market-based claims...|$|R

They purchased the Pippin for $2,500, having initially planned {{to bid on}} {{only one of the}} roller coaster cars. The sale agreement required the buyer to remove the ride within 30 days. Reynolds and <b>Shutts</b> consulted with a coaster expert to determine the practicality of moving the entire coaster to another location.

25|$|He {{gradually}} {{worked his}} way into the Leeds first team, making his professional debut against Millwall on 12 April 1986, and was part of the Leeds squad that lost the 1986–87 Division One playoff final, losing to Charlton Athletic in a replay. By the 1987–88 season he had become a regular in the side. However, when Howard Wilkinson succeeded Bremner as Leeds manager in 1988, the young centre-forward found himself surplus to requirements. Taylor believed that this was because Wilkinson wanted immediate success, and needed to bring in established, experienced players in order to achieve this. Thus in March 1989 Taylor moved to Bristol City, with Carl <b>Shutt</b> moving to Leeds as part of the deal.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no public}} access to the {{interior}} of the tower. It contains three floors, a very narrow stone spiral staircase on the south side, and a roof area with a trapdoor. The staircase has steep risers and is naturally lit when the sun is in the southern quarter by three very small glazed windows, however at other times {{all or part of the}} staircase is pitch dark. The ground floor contains the vestry with its own loft above, incorporating the west window which is inaccessible to visitors. The middle floor is the clock chamber, containing a turret clock mechanism serving the three blue clock faces of the tower, and chiming on the hour. It probably dates from the 19thcentury, and has been wound and maintained for generations by the local <b>Shutt</b> family. In recent years the cranks and clock weights were removed to Pannal Hall (where they were lost) and the clock and chime mechanism is now driven by two electric motors. The clock employs a clapper mechanism on the largest bell to chime the hour. The top floor of the tower is the bell chamber. Two of the three hung and functioning bells are dated 1669 and 1703, both re-cast by Samuel Smith of York. This might imply that the smallest bell could be contemporary with the 15th to 16thcentury tower.|$|E

500|$|The 1976 Canada Cup final was a best-of-three series. [...] The {{first game}} was played September 13 at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto.

[...] Dzurilla was unable to duplicate his success as Gilbert Perreault opened the scoring one minute into the game {{en route to a}} four-goal onslaught by the Canadians in the first period. [...] The Czechoslovaks were stronger in the final 40 minutes, but were unable to beat Canada's Vachon, who recorded his second shutout of the tournament in a 6–0 victory for Canada.

500|$|Comics scholar Arnold T.

[...] Silver Age {{historian}} Craig <b>Shutt</b> disputes this, saying, [...] "Gwen Stacy's death shocked Spider-Man readers. Such a tragedy makes a strong symbolic ending. This theory gained adherents when Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross' Marvels miniseries in 1994 ended with Gwen's death, but I'm not buying it. It's too late. Too many new directions — especially [...] Conan and monsters [...] — were on firm ground by this time." [...] He also dismisses {{the end of}} the 12-cent comic book, which went to 15 cents as the industry standard in early 1969, noting that the 1962 hike from 10 cents to 12 cents had no bearing in this regard. Shutt's line comes with Fantastic Four #102 (Sept. 1970), Jack Kirby's last regular-run issue before the artist left to join DC Comics; this combines with DC's Superman #229 (Aug. 1970), editor Mort Weisinger's last before retiring.|$|E
