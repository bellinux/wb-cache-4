5|$|In 2016, {{spin-off}} title Dragon Quest Builders {{was released}} as an alternate {{sequel to the}} first game. The story is <b>set</b> <b>over</b> 100 years after the consequences of Erdrick, who instead accepts Dragonlord's offer to rule half the world.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{was absent}} from screens in 1996, but {{returned}} {{the following year}} with Alan Rickman's directorial debut, The Winter Guest. <b>Set</b> <b>over</b> one day in a Scottish seaside village, the drama allowed Thompson and her mother (Phyllida Law) to play mother and daughter on screen. She then returned to America to appear in an episode of Ellen, and her self-parodying performance received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the {{original}} game introduced the F3600 anti-gravity racing league in 2052, Wipeout 2097 is <b>set</b> <b>over</b> four decades later and introduces the player to the much faster, more competitive, and more dangerous F5000 AG racing league. The game {{introduced a new}} damage interface and new weapons and tracks. The Sega Saturn version supported analogue control by using its 3D Control Pad, whereas the PlayStation version supported analogue control only through using the optional Negcon twist controller.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} algebraic <b>sets</b> <b>over</b> certain {{finitely generated}} torsion-free metabelian groups. The class of groups under consideration is {{the class of}} so-called ρ-groups. It consists of all wreath products of finitely generated free abelian groups and their subgroups. In particular, it includes all free metabelian groups of finite rank. Our main result is a characterization of certain irreducible algebraic <b>sets</b> <b>over</b> ρ-groups. More precisely, we consider irreducible algebraic sets which are determined by a system of equations in n indeterminates. For their coordinate groups, we introduce a discrete invariant called the relative characteristic. This is an ordered pair of non-negative integers. We determine {{the structure of the}} coordinate group of the n-dimensional affine space, and show that its relative characteristic is (n, n). Then we characterize the irreducible algebraic sets of relative characteristic (n, n) and (0, k) where 0 ≤ k ≤ n. We also obtain some examples of somewhat unusual algebraic <b>sets</b> <b>over</b> ρ-groups, thus demonstrating that algebraic <b>sets</b> <b>over</b> these groups are much more varied and complicated than, say, algebraic <b>sets</b> <b>over</b> free groups...|$|R

5|$|Despite these efforts, on 21February {{it became}} clear just how {{fundamentally}} opposed the groups were. Philip Nye, one of the dissenting brethren, asserted in a speech that a presbytery <b>set</b> <b>over</b> local congregations would become as powerful as the state and was dangerous to the commonwealth, provoking vigorous opposition from presbyterians. The next day, the Assembly finally began to establish a prescription for presbyterian government. Owing to a strong belief in {{the unity of the}} church, the Assembly continued to try to find ways to reconcile the dissenting brethren with the majority throughout 1644, including the establishment of a special committee for that purpose in March. However, on 15November, the dissenting brethren presented their reasons for disagreement {{with the rest of the}} Assembly to Parliament, and on 11December the majority submitted a draft of a presbyterian form of government.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, Michigan {{became the}} leader in the conference with a 5–2 record, thanks to conference wins over ranked Wisconsin and Michigan State teams. Michigan {{remained}} in first place until losing to Ohio State ten days later. The team went 5–2 in conference in February, including wins over ranked Indiana and Ohio State teams. Michigan lost its final home {{game of the season}} to Purdue on February 25 to finish with a 15–1 home record. On March 1, the team defeated Illinois for their first road win in Illinois since 1995. During the game, Michigan's 30th of the season, Trey Burke broke Gary Grant's school freshman assists record, <b>set</b> <b>over</b> the course of 30 games in the 1984–85 season, by pushing his total to 143. The March 4 victory over Penn State clinched a share of the 2011–12 Big Ten Conference season regular season championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Drakengard series, and follows the fifth ending of the first game, the events of which have left the planet Earth {{in a state of}} decay. <b>Set</b> <b>over</b> one thousand years after this, the game puts the player in control of the titular protagonist Nier, as he attempts to find a cure for an illness, known as the Black Scrawl, to which his daughter Yonah has succumbed. Partnering with a talking book known as Grimoire Weiss, he journeys with two other characters, Kainé and Emil, as he attempts to find a remedy and understand the nature of the creatures known as Shades that stalk the world. The gameplay borrows elements from various video game genres, occasionally switching between them and the main role-playing-based gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Various {{technological}} and aesthetic {{changes have been}} made to the Jeopardy! <b>set</b> <b>over</b> the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount {{on one side and the}} clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall, which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the seven}} books is <b>set</b> <b>over</b> {{the course of one}} school year. Harry struggles with the {{problems}} he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers, the Death Eaters, with the stakes {{a matter of life and}} death – a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books. In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement.|$|E
5|$|Filming moved {{once again}} in January 2011 to the Druid Hills {{quadrant}} of Atlanta, which contains {{the headquarters of the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The restricted nature of the CDC campus meant that producers were only allowed to shoot exterior scenes of the area, as well as within the parking garage and reception area for the CDC's museum onsite. Principal photography then proceeded into Atlanta's central business district and Decatur, before advancing to London, Geneva, and lastly San Francisco, California, in the ensuing month. The San Francisco Film Commission charged filmmakers $300 per day for production within the city limits. In the North Beach and Potrero Hill sections of the city, production designer Howard Cummings scattered trash and discarded clothing on the ground to depict the rapid decline of civilization. For the Civic Center <b>set,</b> <b>over</b> 2,000 extras were sought for in background roles; actors who were a part of the Screen Actors Guild were paid $139 per day, while nonunion workers received $64 per day for their work. Other filming locations were established at Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, and Candlestick Park; it cost $60,000 to rent the football stadium for six days.|$|E

5|$|Ross {{utilized}} {{his many}} hockey connections throughout Canada and the United States to sign players. Even so, the team started poorly. Early {{in the first}} season the University of Toronto hockey team was in Boston for matches against local universities. The team's manager, Conn Smythe, who later owned and managed the Toronto Maple Leafs, said that his team could easily defeat the Bruins—Ross's team had won only two of their first fifteen NHL games. This began a feud between Smythe and Ross which lasted for over 40 years, until Ross' death; while mostly confined to newspaper reports, they refused to {{speak to each other}} at NHL Board of Governor meetings. The Bruins finished their first season with six wins in thirty games, one of the worst records {{in the history of the}} league. Several records were <b>set</b> <b>over</b> the course of the season; the three home wins are tied for the second fewest ever, and an eleven-game losing streak from December 8, 1924, until February 17, 1925, set a record for longest losing streak, surpassed in 2004 and now second longest in history. With 17 wins in 36 games the following season, the team greatly improved, and finished one point out of a playoff spot.|$|E

Penalties are assessed at the open water when any of the horse's feet touch the water or white tape marking its boundary. If a rail is <b>set</b> <b>over</b> the middle of the water, faults are not accumulated for landing in the water.|$|E
25|$|There were {{intended}} to be four Medici tombs, but those of Lorenzo the Magnificent and his brother Giuliano (modestly buried beneath the altar at the entrance wall) were never begun.
