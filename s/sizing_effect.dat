30|$|Four rosin derivatives, {{including}} {{rosin esters}} and rosinamides, were synthesized {{and used to}} prepare neutral rosin sizes. Their effects during sizing are discussed in detail. Compared to natural rosin, the rosin derivatives had nearly no effect on sizing even at high retention levels in paper. However, the rosin derivatives in the rosin sizes improved {{the stability of the}} emulsion size particles, and there was good correlation between the <b>sizing</b> <b>effect</b> and the stability of the emulsion sizes under neutral to alkaline conditions. On the other hand, the structure of the rosin derivatives significantly influenced the stability and <b>sizing</b> <b>effect</b> of the neutral rosin sizes. In particular, for glycerin rosin ester-rosin sizes, the emulsion stability and <b>sizing</b> <b>effect</b> increased with an increasing proportion of dirosinate, among the glycerin rosin esters. Consequently, it was suggested that the rosin derivatives hardly contribute to the sizing performance of paper but predominantly function to stabilize the neutral rosin size particles, thereby improving the efficiency of the size under neutral to alkaline sizing conditions. Also it was supposed that glycerol dirosinate in the neutral rosin size would probably enable formation of a more stable particle structure to prevent the destructive action of the OH− ion.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWithin the {{framework}} of Bažant’s theory, the <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> on nominal strength of notched structures deduced from a size-dependent R-curve is proposed. It is shown that the expected <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> {{is more complicated than}} the one proposed in Bažant’s <b>Size</b> <b>Effect</b> Law (SEL) and especially in the crossover regime. As a function of the fracture parameters describing the R-curve, two kinds of <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> on the resistance at peak load are possible and lead to three different scalings on the nominal strength. We argue that these expected <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> are mainly driven by the value of the scaling exponent characterizing the <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> on the critical crack length increment and on the critical resistance assumed in the R-curve behavior. The three resulting <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> on the nominal strength are compared to Bažant’s SEL.

40|$|AbstractAlkyl ketene dimer (AKD) is the {{reactive}} synthetic {{sizing agent}} {{that is used}} in alkaline or neutral papermaking conditions to provide certain level of hydrophobicity to the paper and board. The sizing mechanism of AKD involves its reaction with the hydroxyl groups on cellulose.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the conducted research work was to {{explore the influence of}} chain length and amount of n-paraffins as well as the chemical composition of technical paraffins (chain length and amount of n- and iso-alkanes) on the thickness swelling, water absorption and internal bond strength of MDF. Pronounced differences in the sizing efficiency of n-paraffins with different chain length (C 20, C 28, C 36) were found. On using 0. 1 % paraffin (based on dried fibers) sizing efficiency increases between C 20 and C 28. Higher paraffin content (> 0. 25 %) has an insignificant influence on the swelling behaviour of MDF. In the range between 0. 1 % and 1. 0 % (solid based on dry fibers) paraffin has no negative impact on the physical-mechanical properties of the boards. The influence of paraffin chain length on the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) seems to be negligible. Further investigations were carried out using technical paraffins with different chemical composition (chain length and amount of n- and iso-alkanes) as a sizing agent for MDF. The results show that technical paraffins with a high content of long-chain-n-alkanes are more effective sizing agents than technical paraffins with low-chain-n-alkanes.

Composite and resin samples have been characterised both dry as moulded and after conditioning at either 120 °C or 150 °C for a range of times up to 1000 hours. The results reveal that hydrothermal ageing in water-glycol mixtures results in significant changes in the mechanical performance, weight, and dimensions of these materials. The negative effects of conditioning could be mitigated to some degree by the appropriate choice of the glass fibre sizing; however the <b>sizing</b> <b>effect</b> diminished with increasing conditioning time. All materials showed a weight increase due to conditioning at 120 °C which was typical of a single Fickian diffusion process and there was clear evidence of multiple processes involved when conditioning at 150 °C. It was not apparent that the glass fibre sizing affected the dimensional stability of the composites. We show that there is a strong correlation between the swelling of these samples and the level of fluid adsorption. Although the PA 66 resin showed reasonably homogeneous swelling, the composites exhibited different levels of swelling depending on direction. These effects were well in line with the known effects of fibres on restriction of the matrix deformation (mechanical, thermal or moisture swelling) in the fibre direction. These differences correlate well with the average fibre orientation with respect to the various direction axes.

40|$|Many {{grades of}} paper have shifted from acid to {{alkaline}} production conditions. This change excludes {{the usage of}} traditional alum-rosin sizing chemistry. In some cases however, rosin sizing could prove beneficial {{if it could be}} used under neutral to alkaline paper making conditions. One effort toward this goal has been the use of epi-halohydrin modified polyamine/polyaminoamide in place of alum. The optimum sizing conditions, as well as the mechanism that modified polyamines/polyaminoamides use to size rosin, is investigated. Polyethyleneimine modified with epi-chlorohydrin was used in these studies. Rosin dosage was found to be the main variable that controlled the degree of sizing achieved. As the only hydrophobic material added, this was expected. In addition to rosin dosage, the polymer and pH had significant impacts on this sizing chemistry. Laboratory data shows that the synthesis procedure for and structure of polyethyleneimine-epi-cholohydrin (PEI-epi) impacts the degree of sizing achieved. Use of different modification techniques and degrees of modification illustrated several key factory regarding the polymer as a rosin sizing mordant. Prevention or removal of by-products from epi-chlorohydrin imporves the sizing efficiency of PEI-epi with rosin. A critical molecular weight of the PEI-epi was found to be important to sizing. Higher charge density on PEI-epi provides better the sizing efficiency. In addition to the polymer, other important factors where examined. The pH of the stock impacted the degree of sizing and permanency of the sizing achieved. Varying stock pH showed changes in sizing that are consistent with effects seen for rosin retention and of PAE as a wet strength agent. Low and high pH levels also caused reversion of the <b>sizing</b> <b>effect.</b> A pilot trial of the PEI-epi-rosin sizing chemistry was conducted at the Herty Foundation. The pilot trial shows that PEI-epi-rosin can reach the required level of sizing for linerboard. Trial results showed that calcium carbonate filled sheets could be sized by this chemistry. No significant impact on strength is seen from the sizing chemistry at the required dosage levels. As would be expected, addition of filler diminishes sheet strength. No sizing reversion was seen from any samples of this trial. Size reversion at low stock pH indicated that acid catalytic cleavage of an ester bond could have been occurring. Addition of acid or base to permanently sized sheets showed significant levels of reversion, similar to that seen for low stock pH sheets. This provides further supporting eviden ce for the formation and importance of an ester bond between rosin and PEI-epi. FTIR spectra were collected for model compounds to further examine the presence and importance of ester bonds. An ester bond was found to form at room temperature with aging or immediately with drying. Further, the ester bonds were found to decrease when the sample was subjected to acidic or basic environments. Solid state NMR was run to demonstrate the presence and importance of ester bonds to sizing in handsheets. Use of a [superscript 13]C labeled fatty acid showed that the ester bond peak dominated when sizing was present. After treatment with sodium hydroxide, the sizing disappeared and much of the ester bond signal shifted to a carboxylic acid or salt. Further solid state NMR of a non-reactive cationic polymer or a fully pre-reacted PEI-epi polymer shows retention of the fatty acid, but no ester bond and no sizing. The sizing mechanism of PEI-epi-rosin sizing appears to be connected to an ester bond formed during drying or with aging. While the amount of rosin retained controls the degree of sizing, retention alone is not enough to give sizing. The most effective pH for this sizing chemistry is near neutral, pH 6 - 8. FTIR and solid state NMR shows that an epichlorohydrin modified polyamine can form ester bonds with fatty acids in handsheets under conditions comparable to papermaking. The presence of residual acid or base in handsheets destroys the <b>sizing</b> <b>effect</b> achieved. Destruction of the sizing by addition of sodium hydroxide parallels the cleavage of many of the ester bonds present. PEI-epi appears to function as a mordant for rosin by creating an ester bond to anchor and help orient the hydrophobic portion of rosin. Ph. D. Advisor: Yulin Deng, Ph. D. Assoc.

40|$|The paper {{industry}} utilizes fillers either {{to reduce the}} cost or to provide desired functional or end-use properties of paper products. However, there are disadvantages associated with higher filler loadings beyond a certain level, which reduces paper strength. The present study focused on improving the physical property of filled papers. Three methods of structuring fillers were designed; precipitation with starch, complexation with starch and fatty acid, and regeneration with cellulose. Because cellulose and starch have hydroxyl groups on the chemical structure, the hydrogen bonding between fillers and wood fibers is assumed to be occurred by structuring fillers. For starch application, we used two different approaches; salt precipitation and fatty acid complexation. The cooked starch can be precipitated by certain salt solutions such as (NH 4) 2 SO 4. Also, the cooked starch can be complexed with fatty acid to produce an insoluble crystalline structure. When starch composites with clay made by both methods were put into the furnish as fillers, dramatic strength improvement was achieved such as 100 - 200 % gains in tensile strength. This is due to the strong bonding between clay fillers and wood fibers, which is determined by Z-directional tensile strength. One of advantages is that using the starch-fatty acid complex has an inherent water repellent property, <b>sizing</b> <b>effect.</b> For cellulose as a bonding material, N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide was used as a solvent to dissolve the cellulose. The advantage of using this method is that we can use the low grade cellulose. The physical properties of the cellulose coated clay handsheets were significantly improved, but optical properties such as brightness and opacity were inferior to the hadnsheets filled with starch-clay composites due to relatively large particle size. In order to model the strength improvement by the composite filler, BDT theory, which is a modified Pages Equation, was used. After calculating the factors such as surface area and specific bond strength, the model matched well with the experimental results. Using this model, the tensile strength improvement could be predicted in terms of the change of bond strength and composite size. Ph. D.

Here we briefly demonstrate that for a simple heterogeneous material the <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> predicted when loaded in bending depends {{on the nature of the}} sample surface. Diverse <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> may thus be exhibited by the same material. We then show by detailed finite element analysis of a more representative material with regular heterogeneity that this diversity of <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> might actually be observed in practice thereby providing an explanation for the contradictory <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> that have sometimes been reported for real materials...|$|R
40|$|This paper, which {{represents}} the text of an introductory report pre-sented at Cardiff workshop in 1995, reviews the <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> from two different viewpoints: (1) the need to eliminate or minimize the <b>effect</b> of specimen <b>size</b> on the measured material fracture characteristics, and (2) the exploitation f measured <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> on the nominal strength for determining the material fracture characteristics. Three methods of fracture testing are examined in {{the perspective of the}} <b>size</b> <b>effect,</b> and the merits and weaknesses of various methods in regard to the <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> are pointed out. The parameters of all three methods can bedetermined by simple formulas and linear regression from measurements allowing calibration of two parameters of the <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> law.

40|$|The <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> on the tensile {{strength}} of concrete is investigated experimentally {{for the case}} of equi-biaxial tension. Tests of {{tensile strength}} under uniaxial tension were carried out for comparison using four-point bend beams. For measuring the biaxial tensile strength, the ASTM C 1550 test and the biaxial flexure test were examined. To study the <b>size</b> <b>effect,</b> unreinforced circular plates of three different sizes are tested, with 13 specimens per <b>size.</b> The <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> on the equi-biaxial tensile strength {{is found to be}} stronger than it is on the uniaxial tensile strength, and to exhibit the charac-teristics of the deterministic Type I <b>size</b> <b>effect.</b> The detailed experi-mental procedure and the results are reported in this paper. Under the assumption that a distinct continuous crack develops only after the peak load, the approximate law of <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> is derived from the stress redistribution due to a boundary layer of cracking. The analysis leads to a deterministic Type I <b>size</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} generalized law for combined energetic-probabilistic <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> on {{the nominal}} strength for structures failing by crack initiation from a smooth surface {{is used for}} practical purposes – the paper proposes a procedure to capture both deterministic and statistical <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> on the nominal strength of quasibrittle structures failing at crack initiation. The advantage of the proposed approach is that the necessity of time consuming statistical simulation is avoided, only deterministic nonlinear fracture mechanics FEM calculation must be performed. Results of deterministic nonlinear FEM calculation should follow deterministic-energetic formula, a superimposition with the Weibull <b>size</b> <b>effect,</b> which dominates for large sizes using the energetic-statistical formula, is possible. As the procedure {{does not require a}} numerical simulation of Monte Carlo type and uses only the results obtained by deterministic computation using any commercial FEM code (which can capture satisfactorily deterministic <b>size</b> <b>effect),</b> it can be a simple practical engineering tool. 1 INTRODUCTION AND <b>SIZE</b> <b>EFFECT</b> FORMULAE Practical and simple approach to incorporate the statistical <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> into the design or the as-sessment of very large unreinforced concrete structures (such as arch dams, foundations and earth retaining structures, where the statistical <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> plays a significant role) is important.
