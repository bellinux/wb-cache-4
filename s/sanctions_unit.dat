5000|$|In the United Kingdom {{the regime}} was {{implemented}} through the Financial <b>Sanctions</b> <b>Unit</b> of the Bank of England using the powers {{granted by the}} United Nations Act 1946. [...] A number of individuals and their families have been swept up by the measures.|$|E
5000|$|The Financial <b>Sanctions</b> <b>Unit</b> of the Bank of England {{formerly}} administered financial {{sanctions in}} the United Kingdom {{on behalf of}} HM Treasury. It was in operation since before 1993, when it applied sanctions against the Government of Libya. [...] More recently, since Libya became an ally of the United Kingdom, sanctions have been applied against those who allegedly fought against the Government of Libya {{at the time it}} was not an ally (see Incidents which have involved the Financial <b>Sanctions</b> <b>Unit).</b> Responsibility for the administration of Financial Sanctions in the UK transferred from the Bank of England to HM Treasury on 24 October 2007. In April 2016 HM Treasury set up the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, a new body whose mission is to [...] "provide a high-quality service to the private sector, working closely with law enforcement to help ensure that financial sanctions are properly understood, implemented and enforced." ...|$|E
5000|$|If {{credible}} {{information is}} found implicating a unit in a gross violation of human rights, the unit will be prohibited from receiving assistance until remediation steps are taken. The law requires the U.S. government to offer {{assistance to the}} country's government in bringing those responsible to justice and remediate the <b>sanctioned</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|R
25|$|The South Texas Intermediate <b>Sanction</b> Facility <b>Unit,</b> {{a parole}} {{confinement}} facility for males operated by Global Expertise in Outsourcing, is in downtown Houston, west of Minute Maid Park.|$|R
25|$|Joe Kegans Unit, {{located in}} Downtown, is a Texas Department of Criminal Justice state jail for men. It is {{adjacent}} to the county facilities {{on the north side}} of the Buffalo Bayou. Kegans opened in 1997. The South Texas Intermediate <b>Sanction</b> Facility <b>Unit,</b> a parole confinement facility for males operated by Global Expertise in Outsourcing, is in Downtown Houston, west of Minute Maid Park.|$|R
50|$|Asset {{freezing}} by the Financial <b>Sanctions</b> <b>Unit</b> of the Bank of England {{was established}} by the The Al-Qa'ida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2002, The Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 and The Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 to implement sanctions against terrorist suspects as designated by the UN Security Council Resolution 1267; which covered individuals and bodies associated with Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, or the Taliban.|$|E
50|$|On 10 October 2005, the United Kingdom's Home Office banned LIFG and {{fourteen}} other militant groups from {{operating in the}} UK. Under the United Kingdom's Terrorism Act 2000, {{being a member of}} a LIFG is punishable with a 10-year prison term. The Financial <b>Sanctions</b> <b>Unit</b> of the Bank of England acting on behalf of HM Treasury issued the orders to freeze all their assets.Mohammed Benhammedi lived and worked in Liverpool {{at the time of the}} UN sanction against him. Sergey Zakurko, the father to his Lithuanian mistress was suspended from his job at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (INPP) for fear that the link could pose a security threat.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2007, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) in the UK petitioned Cable and Wireless (C&W) for [...] "automatic recognition" [...] {{of their}} Field Service team by filing form 1A which defines and {{describes}} the potential unit to the CAC (Central Arbitration Committee). [...] After review, CAC <b>sanctioned</b> the <b>unit.</b> However C&W Worldwide decided {{to challenge the}} decision due to the relatively small size of the unit and concerns about potential fragmentation.|$|R
5000|$|At Kelly Field, the {{squadron}} {{was assigned to}} the re-formed 1st Pursuit Group, effective 22 August 1919. The pursuit school was the first step in building a new, permanent air service and by providing a course of instruction for pilots at Kelly, {{it was a way to}} transfer the hard-earned knowledge gained during World War I to a new generation of fliers. Pilots received hands-on experience in aircraft and engine maintenance. They also flew a training program that covered formation flying, aerobatics, air-to-air and air to ground gunnery, reconnaissance and patrol tactics. The aircraft used were British Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s and U.S.-built Airco DH.4s that were excess from the war effort.On 14 March 1921, the 147th Aero Squadron was re-designated as the 17th Squadron (Pursuit) and in July the 1st Pursuit Group moved from Kelly to Ellington Field, near Houston, Texas. In June, 1922, the 1st PG prepared to return to Selfridge. The four squadrons of the group (17th, 27th, 94th and 95th) departed Ellington on 24 June. The long deployment to Michigan was a novelty, and the press followed the group's progress closely. The group arrived at Selfridge Field on 1 July 1922. Selfridge served as the 1st Pursuit Group's home for many years. As the Army's only pursuit group, the War Department took special pains to ensure that it was maintained in a high state of readiness. On 21 January 1924, the War Department <b>sanctioned</b> <b>unit</b> emblems. The [...] "Great Snow Owl", chosen by the World War I 17th Pursuit Group as its emblem when transferred to the American Expeditionary Forces in 1918 was adopted by the 17th Pursuit Squadron on 4 March 1924.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} the public sector, {{given the lack of}} output prices and exit decisions to <b>sanction</b> inefficient <b>units,</b> is finding the optimal industry structure. We apply a novel approach to Italian courts of justice, a typical example of a small sector in the public domain but with important effects on economic agents׳ behavior, firm size, FDI, and on the overall economy. The suggested approach enables us to break down the aggregate court inefficiency into different sources and to investigate the optimal structure of the justice sector. Results show that technical inefficiency (lack of best practice) accounts for more than one third (38 %) of total inefficiency, while size inefficiency (courts that are too big) is about 22 – 25 %. The remaining inefficiency is represented by a sub-optimal allocation of inputs (30 – 40 %). If reallocation is confined to macroregional or regional borders, then technical and size inefficiencies increase in relative terms compared to reallocation inefficiency. We suggest that, together with reallocating inputs by merging smaller courts, a complementary set of policy interventions would be to adopt best practices and split larger courts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a decision theoretic model which {{was developed to}} aid regulatory agencies in standard setting and regulation tasks. The one stage three decision maker model encompasses the decision making of a regulator, a developer, and an impactee unit. Each decision unit is assumed to follow a basic decision model, which {{is a combination of}} a probability model, a difference value judgment model, and an expected utility model. The developer unit is linked to the regulator unit through possible detections of violations of a regulation and <b>sanctions.</b> The impactee <b>unit</b> is linked to the developer unit through pollution generating events stemming from the developer's actions, and the subsequent damages which may result from pollution. This basic regulation model is then specified to safety and emission standard setting. Central in these specifications is a signal detection model which characterizes the uncertainty with which the regulator will detect or miss violations of his regulation. A multistage conditional probability model links the developer's actions, pollution generating events, amounts of pollutants, and possible effects on impactees...|$|R
40|$|New state-sanctioned family units {{headed by}} couples in {{committed}} relationships {{are on the}} rise. They include marriages encompassing same sex couples, civil unions, and domestic partnerships. These new family units can originate in state statutes or in judicial decisions. The pace of change is so fast that new units occasionally replace units only recently recognized, as when same sex marriages replace civil unions or domestic partnerships. U. S. Supreme Court precedents permit broad governmental discretion in sanctioning new families and in recognizing parentage therein. Yet such discretion is limited by constitutionally-recognized parental rights and interests when children are born of sex. At times states can and do deny parental status under law at birth to biological fathers. Differences in parentage laws will likely continue for some time. When same sex marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships are expanded or created, the new family units typically are deemed equal to, or the same as, longstanding opposite sex marriages. However, when there are children born of sex, equality and sameness are impossible. Same sex couples simply cannot produce children through intrafamily intercourse as can opposite sex couples. Yet, extrafamily intercourse by those in same sex, as well as opposite sex, families can produce children. Given the policies of equality and sameness, should all children conceived through adultery similarly be deemed born into <b>sanctioned</b> family <b>units?</b> That is, should there always operate a presumption of parentage as now typically operates for a husband in an opposite sex marriage? If so, are new written laws needed since the existing parentage presumptions for husbands usually require the possibility of genetic ties – an impossibility in same sex settings? Further, are there limits on any equality between same and opposite sex couples? Finally, are additional laws beyond parentage presumptions at birth needed for children born of sex to same sex couples? This article posits that explicit statutory presumptions are needed for children born to state-sanctioned same sex female couples although there cannot be genetic ties in both mates. Further, it proposes that current voluntary parentage acknowledgment processes, now operating for men who prompt children born of sex to married and unmarried women, be expanded to allow certain same sex male mates to become legal parents at birth, or sooner, to children born of sex into their family units...|$|R
5|$|The view of some modern {{scholars}} {{that the}} 4th-century cavalry {{was a more}} efficient service than the infantry was certainly not shared by Ammianus and his contemporaries. Ammianus describes three major battles which were actually or nearly lost due to the incompetence or cowardice of the Roman cavalry. (1) The Battle of Strasbourg (357), where the cavalry, including cataphracts, were routed by their German counterparts at an early stage, leaving the Roman infantry right wing dangerously exposed. After fleeing behind the infantry lines, it took the personal intervention of Julian to rally them and persuade them {{to return to the}} fight. (The cataphracts were later ordered to wear female clothes by Julian as punishment). (2) During his Persian campaign (363), Julian was obliged to <b>sanction</b> two cavalry <b>units</b> for fleeing when caught by surprise attacks (one unit was decimated, the other dismounted). Later, the Tertiaci cavalry regiment was ordered to march with the camp followers for deserting the field just as the infantry was on the point of breaking the Persian line. (3) At the Battle of Adrianople (378), the Roman cavalry was largely responsible for the catastrophic defeat. Scholae units started the battle by an unauthorised attack on the enemy wagon circle, at a moment when their emperor Valens was still trying to negotiate a truce with the Goths. The attack failed, and when the Gothic cavalry appeared, the Roman cavalry fled, leaving the Roman infantry left wing exposed. The Gothic cavalry then routed the Roman left wing, and the battle was as good as lost.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the EU-US sanctions {{dispute over the}} Helms-Burton and D’Amato Acts from 1996 to 1998. In this study {{the focus is on}} analysing whether during the santions dispute the US was hastening the end of its favourable unipolar position in the international system due to its own foreign policy choices or whether the dispute qualifies as a balancing attempt by the EU. The systemic level theoretical framework consists of neorealism and <b>sanction</b> studies. <b>Unit</b> level factors are used as explanatory factors without a theory. The general EU-US relationship is used to reflect tendencies stated in the research question. Earlier sanctions and sanctioning patterns are reviewed. The study concludes that the US made a dual error in its decision to impose extraterritorial sanction laws against the EU. Firstly, the US confused the targets of the sanctions laws. Secondly, the US confused its foreign and economic policy strategies. This meant using confrontational economic strategy towards a foreign policy objective. Taken together, the US succumbed to arrogance of power and ended up possibly deteriorating its future systemic position. The EU's response was a twofold implicit balancing. The EU's first reaction was to shield itself against the US sanctions with Blocking Statue and Joint Action and so to protect its sovereignty and retain independent capacity to act. The EU's second implicit balancing reaction was meant to discipline the US against its arrogance of power by initiating a dispute settlement procedure in the WTO. The conclusion is that the sanctions dispute had both the effects of deteriorating the US future position as well as possibly increasing the position of the EU in the future. Yet, the US as an initiator of the sanctions dispute gives more explanatory power to the former. The source material of this study consists of neorealist theories. The most important source has been the edited book of Ethan Kapstein and Michael Mastanduno 'Unipolar Politics'(1999) Also sanction studies have been used. An important source has been 'Feeling Good or Doing Good with Sanctions – Unilateral Economic Sanctions and the US National Interest' (1999) by Ernst Preeg. Endast sammandrag.
