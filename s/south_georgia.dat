5|$|In the Year 2000 the German polar {{explorer}} Arved Fuchs built {{a detailed}} copy of Shackleton's boat named James Caird II. In his expedition titled 'Shackleton 2000' he succeeded {{to replicate the}} voyage of Shackleton and his crew from Elephant Island to <b>South</b> <b>Georgia.</b> The James Caird II {{was among the first}} expositions when the International Maritime Museum in Hamburg was first opened. A further replica, James Caird III was built by boat builder Bob Wallace of Massachusetts; it was purchased by the <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> Heritage Trust and since 2008 has been on display at the Carr Maritime Gallery, part of the <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> Museum at Grytviken. In 2011, a new 10.5–metre survey motor boat (SMB) was named James Caird IV; it operates from , the Royal Navy's ice patrol ship.|$|E
5|$|The Falkland Islands, off {{the south}} coast of Argentina, were {{simultaneously}} claimed for Louis XV of France, in 1764, and George III of the United Kingdom, in 1765, though the French colony was ceded to Charles III of Spain in 1767. By 1833, however, the islands were under full British control. The <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> and South Sandwich Islands were discovered by Captain James Cook for George III in January 1775, and from 1843 were {{governed by the}} British Crown-in-Council through the Falkland Islands, an arrangement that stood until the <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> and South Sandwich Islands were incorporated as a distinct British overseas territory in 1985. The monarch is represented in these regions by Nigel Phillips, who is both the Governor of the Falkland Islands and the Commissioner for <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> and the South Sandwich Islands.|$|E
5|$|Despite this setback, the {{expedition}} continued with Wild in command while Hussey returned to England with Shackleton's body. On 22 January, Worsley suffered a serious accident. Under sail, the Quest had been rolling heavily and ropes securing a lifeboat snapped. The lifeboat, full of stores, swung against the wheelhouse and crushed Worsley against the bridge. He broke several ribs {{and had to}} rest for several days. By the end of March, after being briefly trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea, the ship reached Elephant Island. The expedition then returned to <b>South</b> <b>Georgia,</b> where Hussey was waiting. Shackleton's widow had directed that he be buried on <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> and Hussey {{had returned to the}} island in late February to fulfil her request.|$|E

5|$|Elephant Island was remote, uninhabited, {{and rarely}} visited by whalers {{or any other}} ships. If the party was to return to civilization it would be {{necessary}} to summon help. The only realistic way this could be done was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an 800-mile (1,300km) voyage across the Southern Ocean, to <b>South</b> <b>Georgia.</b> Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the party on the less dangerous journey to Deception Island, because of the poor physical condition of many of his party. Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was closer than <b>South</b> <b>Georgia,</b> but could not be reached, as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds.|$|E
5|$|The James Caird was {{returned}} to England in 1919. In 1921 Shackleton went back to Antarctica, leading the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition. On 5 January 1922 he died suddenly of a heart attack, while the expedition’s ship Quest was moored at <b>South</b> <b>Georgia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Within {{months he}} was making {{proposals}} for a scientific expedition to <b>South</b> <b>Georgia,</b> but the RGS would not support his plans. In early 1896 he considered collaboration with the Norwegians Henryk Bull and Carsten Borchgrevink {{in an attempt to}} reach the South Magnetic Pole. This, too, failed to materialise.|$|E

50|$|The usual {{food supply}} is krill and fish, of which each Antarctic fur seal eats about a ton in a year. Due to the {{enormous}} and growing populations of these seals, their food is {{a significant proportion of}} <b>South</b> <b>Georgia's</b> krill and fish stocks.|$|R
5|$|After {{the race}} to the South Pole ended in December 1911 with Roald Amundsen's conquest, Shackleton turned his {{attention}} to the crossing of Antarctica from sea to sea, via the pole. To this end he made preparations for what became the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–17. Disaster struck this expedition when its ship, Endurance, became trapped in pack ice and was slowly crushed before the shore parties could be landed. The crew escaped by camping on the sea ice until it disintegrated, then by launching the lifeboats to reach Elephant Island and ultimately the inhabited island of <b>South</b> <b>Georgia,</b> a stormy ocean voyage of 720 nautical miles and Shackleton's most famous exploit. In 1921, he returned to the Antarctic with the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, but died of a heart attack while his ship was moored in <b>South</b> <b>Georgia.</b> At his wife's request he was buried there.|$|E
5|$|British {{sovereignty}} {{of several of}} the overseas territories is disputed by their geographical neighbours: Gibraltar is claimed by Spain, the Falkland Islands and <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> and the South Sandwich Islands are claimed by Argentina, and the British Indian Ocean Territory is claimed by Mauritius and Seychelles. The British Antarctic Territory is subject to overlapping claims by Argentina and Chile, while many countries do not recognise any territorial claims in Antarctica.|$|E

Clough's parents ran the local ice and coal plant. After electricity spread to <b>south</b> <b>Georgia,</b> {{the family moved to}} Chattanooga, Tennessee, where Clough attended City High School. Clough also met his future wife, Anne Olivia Robinson, during this time. They have two children, Eliza and Matthew.|$|E

He also destroyed all the machinery and sawmills that would be beneficial to the Union armies.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Trevor Potts re-enacted the Boat Journey from Elephant Island to <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> {{in honour of}} Sir Ernest Shackleton, totally unsupported, in {{a replica}} of the James Caird. In 2002, Channel 4 {{produced}} Shackleton, a TV serial depicting the 1914 expedition with Kenneth Branagh in the title role. Broadcast in the United States on the A Network, it won two Emmy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the three}} lifeboats, the James Caird was deemed {{the strongest and}} most likely to survive the journey. Shackleton had named it after Sir James Key Caird, a Dundee jute-manufacturer and philanthropist, whose {{sponsorship}} had helped finance the expedition. Before its voyage, the ship's carpenter Harry McNish strengthened and adapted the boat to withstand the mighty seas of the Southern Ocean. Surviving a series of dangers, including a near capsizing, the boat reached the southern coast of <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> after a voyage lasting 16days. Shackleton and two companions then crossed the island's mountainous interior to reach a whaling station on the northern side. Here he organised the relief of the Elephant Island party, {{and the return of}} his men home without loss of life. After the end of the First World War in 1918, the James Caird was brought back from <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> to England in 1919 and put on permanent display at Shackleton's old school, Dulwich College from 1922.|$|E

5|$|Shackleton {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} on 5 January 1922, while Quest was {{anchored}} at <b>South</b> <b>Georgia.</b> After his death the original programme, which had included an exploration of Enderby Land, was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island. They anchored off Cape Wild, and were able to see the old landmarks, but sea conditions made it impossible for them to land.|$|E

5|$|Athens' local country {{scene has}} never been as {{significant}} as the profusion of indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock takes many elements from the folk, bluegrass and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers. The band Drive-By Truckers, and the , have done much {{in recent years to}} make country rock a major part of Athens' musical identity. Recent bands such as The Broken String Band have emerged influenced by the folk rock genre. The rapper Bubba Sparxxx, originally from <b>South</b> <b>Georgia,</b> has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his Dirty South style of hip hop music.|$|E
