40|$|The {{celebration of}} the 200 th {{birthday}} of the courts of the District of Columbia offers an opportunity {{to focus on the}} diversification and proliferation of the federal institutions of judging. During the twentieth century, the federal courts and Congress worked together to create a host of <b>statutory</b> federal <b>judges,</b> including magistrate and bankruptcy judges who serve through appointments from Article III judges, as well as administrative law judges and hearing officers working within agencies. In addition to inventing this array of judicial officers, the federal judiciary also redefined the work of judging to include efforts to settle cases and to influence congressional deployment and allocation of jurisdiction. The innovations have many sources. One is doctrinal. The authority of <b>statutory</b> <b>judges</b> stems from a rereading of Article III to license a great deal of federal adjudication without Article Ill 2 ̆ 7 s structural protections. As litigants challenged the devolution of judicial power their claims became an occasion to explore the import of judicial independence. In general, the life-tenured judiciary permitted (and sometimes welcomed) congressional generation of many adjudicative forms, seen not to pose a threat to 2 ̆ 2 Article III values. 2 ̆ 2 The doctrine in turn was crafted in the face of pressures from an expanding federal docket that required some form of change. The particular programs chosen were based in part on perceptions of the lessening utility of adjudicatory methods, in part on a sense of varying levels of import of cases within the federal docket, and in part on incentives created by legal rules and practices. For example, magistrate judgeships were particularly useful for the Article III judiciary, which gained the power to create slots without the need to obtain specific lines from Congress. As of 2000, the number of non-life-tenured judgeships within Article III was roughly equal to the number of life-tenured trial judgeships. Moreover, in some twenty federal districts, the number of magistrate judges equaled or exceeded that of district judges. What are the effects of such innovations on the constitutional commitment to, and the prudential belief in, judicial independence? In addition to focusing on the import of contemporary doctrine, Professor Resnik examines the relatively new practices of the appointment and reappointment of judges by judges. After showing {{the degree to which the}} life-tenured judiciary is dependent on, and its fortunes are linked with, its non-life-tenured siblings, Professor Resnik argues that Article III judges ought to learn to relax their own status privileges and attempt, self-consciously, to blur distinctions among kinds of judges so as to broaden the embrace of Article III. 2 ̆ 2 Article III values 2 ̆ 2 are, in her view, at stake, and their preservation requires life-tenured judges to attempt to infuse these values into all aspects of federal judging...|$|R

50|$|The {{separate}} small claims {{procedure was}} first introduced for claims up to £75 in 1973. This flowed from the <b>statutory</b> power of <b>judges</b> to order arbitration. The limit was raised to £1,000 in 1991, £3,000 in 1996, £5,000 in 1999 and £10,000 in 2013. As of 2011 consultation is underway on raising the limit to £15,000. It {{should be noted that}} the limit is only a guideline. The court may allocate a case to the small claim track where the claim is over the guideline if it is considered that the case is simple enough that it is an appropriate way of disposing of the matter.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{proposes a}} textualist {{approach}} to regulatory interpretation. Regulatory textualism, however, should be distinct from <b>statutory</b> textualism. <b>Judges</b> should interpret regulations armed not with dictionaries or other general linguistic aids, but rather with {{a hierarchy of}} sources that sheds light on the text’s public meaning. Methodologically, this approach tailors positive political theory insights to the rulemaking process. That process features a number of pivotal actors, or veto-gates, who must sign off on a regulation before it can proceed. The court’s interpretive task is to privilege those statements that {{are more likely to}} be credible—sincere, not strategic—reflections of the text’s public meaning. Specifically, the judge should first consider the preamble’s provision-by-provision explanations, which frequently respond to public comments raising potential ambiguities. If ambiguity persists, the judge should then consult the regulatory analyses, which predict the rule’s consequences under specific factual scenarios. Both congressional and presidential veto-gates, as well as the public more generally, rely on these analyses when engaging with the regulatory process. Finally, if these materials conflict, the court should then defer to the agency’s interpretation—provided that the agency provides a reasoned explanation. In this manner, regulatory textualism asks how the reasonable reader of a rule would have understood its meaning as negotiated by the President, Congress, and other politically legitimate actors...|$|R
500|$|Judges are {{required}} to interpret laws {{in the light of}} section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act, which requires an interpretation that would [...] "promote the purpose or object" [...] underlying written law is to be [...] "preferred" [...] over an interpretation that would not, thus mandating a purposive interpretation. The Interpretation Act provides for the types of extrinsic materials and the circumstances under which such extrinsic materials can be referred to, to aid judges in determining the purpose of the statute. Thus, when determining the purpose of a <b>statutory</b> provision, a <b>judge</b> can refer to relevant extrinsic materials such as the explanatory statement relating to the bill in which the provision appears and the speech made in Parliament by a minister moving a motion for the second reading of the bill, when circumstances call for it.|$|R
40|$|Centuries ago, Aristotle illuminatingly {{discussed}} {{the problems of}} <b>statutory</b> interpretation. When <b>judges</b> today grumble that invariably their difficulty in learning the meaning of statutes is {{the fault of the}} legislature, they should be told to recall that long ago he wrote that on many subjects a wise legislature will deliberately use vague and flexible standards. Most of the modern expositions of legislative construction are but restatements, with here and there a bit of embroidery, of what Aristotle said. For instance, recent essays on 2 ̆ 2 gaps 2 ̆ 2 in legislation, on 2 ̆ 2 unprovided cases, 2 ̆ 2 and on the 2 ̆ 2 equity 2 ̆ 2 of a statute, rely on sources which in turn are glosses on passages in the Stagarite 2 ̆ 7 s writings.

40|$|Almost {{every member}} of Congress voted to approve the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), a bill {{endorsed}} by an unprecedented coalition of dozens of religious and civil rights organizations spanning the political and ideological spectrum. President Clinton quipped at the signing ceremony that perhaps only divine intervention could explain such an unusual meeting of the minds: the establishment of “new trust” across otherwise irreconcilable “ideological and religious lines,” he remarked, “shows... {{that the power of}} God is such that, even in the legislative process, miracles can happen. ” The RFRA consensus was especially “miraculous” because the legislation addressed a deeply divisive question: whether and under what circumstances religious objectors should be exempt from generally applicable laws. RFRA’s supporters, both within and outside Congress, would surely have had sharp disagreements about many specific claims for religious exemptions to particular laws. Yet they coalesced around RFRA, which circumvented such disagreements at the retail level by codifying a “cross-cutting” <b>statutory</b> standard that <b>judges</b> would be required to apply to an undifferentiated and unknown array of future claims for exemptions to every generally applicable law in the land...|$|R
40|$|Spending on U. S. incarceration has {{increased}} dramatically {{over the last several}} decades. Much of this cost is on incarcerating pretrial detainees—inmates not convicted of a crime—which constitute the majority of individuals in our nation’s jails. Current <b>statutory</b> schemes give <b>judges</b> almost complete discretion to order pretrial detention based on unexplained or unidentified factors. With this discretion, judges tend to make inconsistent decisions in every jurisdiction, some releasing almost all defendants—including the most dangerous—and others detaining most defendants—even those who are safe to release. There are constitutional and moral reasons to evaluate our current detention scheme, but even the fiscal impact of pretrial detention alone calls for an empirical analysis. Although legal scholarship has applied cost-benefit analysis to other areas of criminal law, this Article is the first attempt at conducting such analysis in the pretrial arena. This Article compares the risk posed by each defendant and the cost of any crimes they may potentially commit while released with the costs incurred by detaining these defendants. The results show that relying on the cost-benefit model provided here, judges could bring significant savings—approximately $ 78 Billion, increased safety, and potentially more equitable pretrial detention decisions...|$|R
40|$|When decided, both Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U. S. 837 (1984), and United States v. Mead, 533 U. S. 218 (2001) were trumpeted, {{whether by}} {{supporters}} or critics, as marking substantial {{changes in the}} law governing judicial review of agency statutory interpretation. This essay argues that what the Court actually decided in each case was entirely consistent with {{the fabric of the}} law of judicial review of administrative action as woven during earlier decades. Unfortunately, however, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s rhetoric in both opinions is confusing and unhelpful at key points, creating impressions of substantial changes in the law when none was being made. As a result, agencies, judges, and lawyers are better served by focusing less on what Chevron and Mead say and more on what they decided, and treating both decisions as elaborating a fairly straightforward approach based on (a) judicial reaction to the clarity of the statute and (b) whether the statute at issue is intended to create an opportunity for genuine agency policy making. In particular, a reviewing judge should first determine whether the statute in question is susceptible to more than one plausible legal reading, and, if only one plausible legal reading is available, the judge should bind the agency to it. If, however, more than one plausible reading is available, the judge should then ask whether the ambiguity in the statute signals an occasion for policy making. In other words, is the agency, in filling the statutory gap at issue, intended to balance expert judgment and relevant political values in order to accommodate the competing interests that need {{to be taken into account}} in order to further Congress 2 ̆ 7 s objectives in enacting the statute? If so, then, so long as the agency has rationally identified any plausible <b>statutory</b> reading, the <b>judge</b> should consider herself duty-bound to defer to it. If the statute does not contemplate significant agency policy making in its interpretation, then the court should ask itself a third question: Of the plausible readings available, does any appear to the court to be plainly more attractive than its competitors? If not, then the court should likewise defer to an agency choice of any rational interpretation because the agency is the primary policy maker, and the court has no legal ground to prefer any alternative reading to the agency 2 ̆ 7 s own. If, however, the court initially finds one plausible reading most compelling, then it retains the authority to impose that reading on the agency. Before doing so, however, the court should pause, open-mindedly. It should consider, if the agency has an alternative preference, whether the agency 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning is not in fact sufficient to make its alternative at least as attractive as the court 2 ̆ 7 s initial view. In such a case, notwithstanding its own initial view, the court should deem itself persuaded by the agency 2 ̆ 7 s statutory reading. This approach, which is guided by the judicial sense of statutory clarity and does not speak of ambiguities or certainties inherent in the statutory texts themselves, is the most straightforward reconciliation of Chevron and Mead...|$|R
40|$|Robert Bork, former {{judge for}} the District of Columbia Circuit and {{antitrust}} scholar, has characterized {{the social and}} political goals underlying merger law as 2 ̆ 2 pure intellectual mush. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 Social and political values have formed the foundation of the most famous United States Supreme Court decisions interpreting section 7 of the Clayton Act, the primary <b>statutory</b> standard for <b>judging</b> the legality of corporate acquisitions. Judge Bork 2 ̆ 7 s dismissive and derogatory comments challenge both judges and scholars to provide a rigorous intellectual foundation and a procedure for incorporating these values into the merger law enforcement process. Current trends in antitrust policy also force decision makers to confront directly whether anything is wrong with mergers other than the potential increase in market power associated with one firm 2 ̆ 7 s acquisition of stock or assets of another. The statutory standards in the Clayton Act for judging the legality of mergers have not been amended since 1950, but courts have differed widely in their application of those standards-from the per se, populist approach of the Warren Court to the rule-of-reason, economic efficiency approach of the Burger Court. In the past, proposed amendments to the Clayton Act have recommended prohibiting all mergers between large firms on the grounds that bigness is bad for social and political reasons. The current trend, however, is toward enforcement and statutory amendments based on economic theories that would permit mergers regardless {{of the size of the}} firms involved if the merger would not lead to an excessive increase in market power. The proposed Merger Modernization Act of 1986, reintroduced as part of the omnibus 2 ̆ 2 competitiveness 2 ̆ 2 package of the Reagan administration in 1987 would, by statutory amendment, eliminate from consideration in merger cases all concerns other than those associated with market power. It is important, then, to appreciate the nature or character of those social and political goals not served by an exclusively economic orientation. This focus is likely to continue during the Bush administration. This Article focuses attention on goals other than economic efficiency by contrasting them to economic goals both in terms of their substantive content and their underlying assumptions. Alternative articulations of the nonefficiency goals are examined to state as precisely as possible what legislators, judges, and scholars had in mind when advocating these goals. Although one can easily appreciate the political and social values scholars and policy makers espouse, it is difficult to identify from the current literature in this area either the connection between mergers generally and undesirable consequences or those particular mergers most likely to have unwanted side effects. Although this Article calls for greater specificity and precision by proponents of nonefficiency goals, it also argues that many of these goals can be included systematically in antitrust enforcement. In response to the appeal of social and political values and their established place in antitrust cases, this Article suggests a more dynamic and democratic interpretation of economic efficiency that incorporates a broader spectrum of values...|$|R
