While differential acceleration measurements performed with different atomic species under free fall test the validity of EP, minute displacements between the test masses in a {{gravity gradient}} produces a false EP-violating signal that limits the precision of the test. We show that gravity inversion and modulation using a gimbal mount can suppress the systematics due to gravity gradients caused by both moving and <b>stationary</b> <b>parts</b> of the instrument as well as the environment, strongly reducing the need to overlap two species.

5000|$|The {{sequence}} of turning a particular coil {{on or off}} dictates what direction the effective electromagnetic fields are pointed.
