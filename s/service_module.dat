5|$|Starting with Apollo 13, descent orbit {{insertion}} {{was to be}} performed using the <b>Service</b> <b>Module</b> engine instead of the LM engine, {{in order to allow}} a greater fuel reserve for landing.

5|$|The Command and Service Modules were mated in the KSC {{altitude}} chamber in September, and combined system testing was performed. Altitude testing was performed first unmanned, then {{with both the}} prime and backup crews, from October 10 through December 30. During this testing, the Environmental Control Unit in the Command Module {{was found to have}} a design flaw, and was sent back to the manufacturer for design changes and rework. The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a propellant tank in <b>Service</b> <b>Module</b> 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the <b>Service</b> <b>Module</b> could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.|$|E
5|$|One example {{superalloy}} is Inconel 718, {{consisting of}} roughly 50% nickel, 18.6% chromium, 18.5% iron, 5% niobium, 3.1% molybdenum, 0.9% titanium, and 0.4% aluminium. These superalloys are used, for example, in advanced air frame {{systems for the}} Gemini program. Another niobium alloy {{was used for the}} nozzle of the Apollo <b>Service</b> <b>Module.</b> Because niobium is oxidized at temperatures above 400°C, a protective coating is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle.|$|E

40|$|An Evolutionary Approach to Locate Urban Public Services postulates how {{the concept}} of {{negotiation}} in multi agent technology {{can be used to}} locate urban public services during city planning. The solution fundamentally comprises of three major categories of public service agents, namely, request, resource and message agents. Once the system is loaded by the human user, terrain data is fed into the system. The terrain agent will be created and draws the city map in the panel. Once the user creates a public service in the city environment, public service agents will be initialized on behalf of them. These, public service agents locate its position in the city, based on the tolerable influence and the inference between them. The system comprises of five modules, geography <b>module,</b> building <b>services</b> <b>module,</b> water <b>services</b> <b>module,</b> natural <b>services</b> <b>module</b> and transportation <b>services</b> <b>module.</b> Geography module handles the terrain related operations in the city environment. Building <b>services</b> <b>module</b> maintains the agent operations of buildings in the city. Water <b>services</b> <b>module</b> handles the operations related to water resources in the city while, natural <b>services</b> <b>module</b> represents agent operations of natural resources. Transportation <b>services</b> <b>module</b> maintains operations related to roads and other transportation resources. Each of the module acts as agents in the multi agent system. All the modules were implemented using Java platform and the agent functionalities were implemented on top of the madkit agent framework. Implemented system was tested to locate different public services under different city conditions. The system was evaluated by providing an evaluator panel an opportunity to build a specific city environment with some public services and to observe the interactions between those public services in the city. Thereafter, their comments about the functionality of the system were obtained and used to enhance the system. The test results reflect that the definition, planning, implementation, testing and documentation of the system had been carried out in an affective and efficient manner.

5|$|The {{delay in}} the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA {{to catch up on}} man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first {{unmanned}} flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the <b>Service</b> <b>Module</b> engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this {{mission was to}} achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the <b>Service</b> <b>Module</b> engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines {{in the second and}} third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the <b>Service</b> <b>Module</b> engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test.|$|E
5|$|Apollo {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} American scientific programs ever. It cost more than $20 billion in 1960s dollars or an estimated $ in present-day US dollars. (In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost roughly $, accounting for inflation.) It used the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects. The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and <b>service</b> <b>module</b> (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth.|$|E

5|$|As of May 12, 2017, {{there have}} been 200 spacewalks devoted to {{assembly}} and maintenance of the International Space Station totaling 1247 hours and 55 minutes. As of March 2, 2011, a total time of 973 hours and fifty-three minutes has been spent in extra-vehicular activity (EVA), with 127 of these EVAs performed from station airlocks, totaling 787 hours and twenty-eight minutes in spacewalk time from the station itself. Twenty-eight spacewalks have been performed from a shuttle, ninety-three from the Quest Joint Airlock, thirty-two from the Pirs docking compartment, and two from the transfer compartment at the forward end of the Zvezda <b>Service</b> <b>Module.</b>|$|E

5|$|With {{the clear}} {{goal of a}} manned landing {{replacing}} the more nebulous goals of space stations and cislunar flights, NASA had to hit the ground running, and decided to discard the feasibility study designs of Convair, GE, and Martin, and proceed with Faget's command / <b>service</b> <b>module</b> design. The mission module {{was determined to be}} only useful as an extra room, and therefore deemed unnecessary. They used Faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in October 1961. On November 28, 1961, it was announced that North American Aviation had won the contract, although its bid was not rated as good as Martin's. Webb, Dryden and Robert Seamans chose it in preference due to North American's longer association with NACA.|$|E
5|$|The Gemini Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft was {{intended}} to fly a direct ascent mission, launched by a Saturn V. Descent stages, built from either the descent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module, or from the Apollo <b>Service</b> <b>Module,</b> would have reduced the spacecraft's velocity as it approached the Moon. One configuration used two Service Modules and one LEM descent stage, with the LEM descent stage performing the final landing, and then being reused for ascent from the Lunar surface and trans-Earth injection. The other configuration used three LEM descent stages, with the second being used for landing and the third for ascent and TEI. The LSRS would have landed close to the Apollo Lunar Module on the Moon, and the Apollo crew would have transferred to it by EVA.|$|E
