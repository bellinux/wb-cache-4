An important managerial insight is that, typically, no order should be placed at a review moment, although this may seem intuitive and is also the standard assumption in periodic review models.

Analysis of large numbers of tissue samples, improved tissue <b>salvage,</b> <b>cost</b> reduction, ease of interpretation, and significant time saving were realized by using the arrays. Material and Methods: Two-hundred and eighty cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma were arrayed. Immunohis-tochemical stains of TMA sections were performed for survivin, bcl- 2, and p 53. Cases were followed up for 5 years. Results: Survivin was detected in 147 of 230 cases (63. 9 %). No expression of survivin was observed in normal tissues. There was no correlation between survivin immu-noreactivity and age, sex, tumor site, tumor size, histo-pathologic subtype, tumor grade and clinical stage (p> 0. 05). Prevalence of survivin expression was significantly higher in bcl- 2 positive than in bcl- 2 negative cases (88. 1 % versus 42. 1 %, p< 0. 0001), but was not associated with p 53 (p= 0. 09). The 5 -year disease free survival (DFS) for patients with survivin positive colorectal adenocarcinoma was significantly lower than that for patients with survivin negative tumors (46 % versus 68. 7 %, p= 0. 001). Conclusion: Survivin expression in colorectal adenocarcinoma provides an important prognostic param-eter and targeted antagonists of survivin may be beneficial as apoptosis-based therapy for colon cancer...|$|E

Myopic policies for such problems order as if the salvage value in the current period for ending inventory were the full purchase price, so that information about the future would not be needed. They have been shown in the literature to be optimal when demand "is increasing over time," and to provide upper bounds for the stationary finite horizon problem (and in some other situations). Some results are also known, given special salvaging assumptions, about lower bounds on the optimal policy which are near-myopic. Here analogous but stronger bounds are derived for the general finite horizon problem, without such special assumptions. The best upper bound is an extension of the heuristic used by industry for some years for end of season (EOS) problems; the lower bound is an extension of earlier analytic methods. Four heuristics were tested against the optimal obtained by stochastic dynamic programming for 969 problems. The simplest heuristic is the myopic heuristic itself: it is good especially for moderately varying problems without heavy end of season <b>salvage</b> <b>costs</b> and averages only 2. 75 % in cost over the optimal.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Randomness is {{a common}} and yet quite an {{expensive}} challenge that every manufacturing and marketing system faces. In this research we focus on products for which the malfunction likelihood of the production outputs are not independent of one another, such as flu vaccine and semiconductors. Production has random yield that is interpreted as {{the ratio of the}} faultless items in a production batch. We also assume that these products have a limited marketing season, suggesting the news-vendor model with randomness on the supply side is an outstanding platform to analyze the production and marketing processes of such products. Our base model studies a single manufacturer present in a single market, where the manufacturer dynamically selects the production commitment and the price {{at the beginning of the}} production season and marketing season, accordingly. Also, we assume that demand is deterministic but price dependent. For strategically important products such as the flu vaccine, the government may find it necessary to intervene in the pricing or manufacturing process in order to coordinate the market. The need for coordinating the market may also be met by other consumer interest groups such as distribution channel owners, think-tanks or policy making agencies. We incorporate the presence of a social planner in our model by studying the centralized case and the socially optimum production commitment and pricing schema. The challenge is to find contracts that can set the conditions for the manufacturer in a way that his optimum production and pricing policy is exactly the same as the one of the social planner. Our study introduces three contracts that can coordinate the market. In the second phase of this research, we study the same problem for the cases where there are two symmetrical manufacturers with inter-dependent demands. By the third phase, we study the case with one manufacturer who has the option to provide the product to two different markets with different characteristics. Our study shows that production commitment is smaller if there is no randomness and the yield ratio is known. We also show that the production commitment of the centralized setting can be either less or more than the production commitment of the decentralized setting, depending on the <b>salvage</b> <b>cost.</b> Numerical analysis, managerial insights, and conclusions are presented at the end of each chapter...|$|E

40|$|Colonies of Apis florea, {{which only}} abscond a short distance, usually return to salvage old nest wax; but, those colonies, {{and all other}} {{honeybee}} species which go considerably further, do not. Wax salvage would clearly be counter-productive unless the energy input/energy yield threshold was a profitable one. There are two possible trade-offs in this scenario, the trade-off between the energy expended to recover the wax (recovering hypothesis) as against that of replacing the wax by new secretion (replacing hypothesis). In order to compare the two hypotheses, the fuel <b>costs</b> involved in <b>salvaging</b> wax on one return trip, the average flower handling time, flight time and relative values for substituting the salvaged wax with nectar were calculated. Moreover, the energy value of the wax was determined. Net energy gains for salvaged wax were calculated. The energy value of the salvaged wax was 42. 7 J/mg, thus too high to be the limiting factor since <b>salvaging</b> <b>costs</b> are only 642. 76 mJ/mg (recovering hypothesis). The recovery costs (642. 76 mJ/mg) only fall below the replacement costs for absconding distance below 115 m thus supporting the replacing hypothesis. This energetic trade-off between replacing and recycling plus the small absconding range of A. florea might explain why A. florea is probably the only honeybee species known to salvage wax and it parsimoniously explains the underlying reasons why A. florea only salvages wax from the old nest if the new nesting site is less than 100 – 200 m away—energetically, it pays off to recycle.

40|$|The pricing {{problem in}} a multi-period setting is a {{challenging}} problem and has attracted much attention in recent years. In this thesis, we consider a monopoly and an oligopoly pricing problem. In the latter, several sellers simultaneously seek an optimal pricing policy for their products. The products {{are assumed to be}} differentiated and substitutable. Each seller has the option to set prices for her products at each time period, and her goal is to find a pricing policy that will yield the maximum overall profit. Each seller has a fixed initial inventory of each product to be allocated over the entire time horizon and does not have the option to produce additional inventory between periods. There are no holding costs or back-order costs. In addition, the products are perishable and have no <b>salvage</b> <b>costs.</b> This means {{that at the end of}} the entire time horizon, any remaining products will be worthless. The demand function each seller faces for each product is uncertain and is affected by both the prices at the current period and past pricing history for her and her competitors. In this thesis, we address both the uncertain and the competitive aspect of the problem. First, we study the uncertain aspect of the {{problem in a}} simplified setting, where there is only one seller and two periods in the model. (cont.) We use ideas of robust optimization, adjustable robust optimization, dynamic programming and stochastic optimization to find adaptable closed loop pricing policies. Theoretical and numerical results show how the budget of uncertainty, the presence of a reference price, delayed resource allocation, and feedback control affect the quality of the pricing policies. Second, we extend the model to a multi-period setting, where the computation becomes a major issue. We use a delayed constraint generation method to significantly increase the size of the problem that our models can handle. Finally, we consider the pricing problem in an oligopoly setting. We show the existence of solution for both the best response subproblem and the market equilibrium problem for all of the models we discuss in the thesis. We also consider an iterative learning algorithm and illustrate through simulations that an equilibrium pricing policy can be computed for all of our models. by Lei Zhang. Thesis (S. M.)
