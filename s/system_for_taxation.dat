5000|$|Almost {{all states}} operate a {{collection}} <b>system</b> <b>for</b> <b>taxation</b> revenues within {{a framework of}} law, and enforced through independent courts. Enabling statutes must be strictly applied, and it is generally against public policy to allow the tax administration to agree {{to reduce the amount}} of tax payable by any one individual. Like criminal law where agreements by the policing authorities to exempt a criminal are prohibited, tax law has a special status as being essential to an organised society in maintaining public trust through the policy of equal treatment in the legal system. Nevertheless, if a tax payer organises his or her affairs so as to exploit a loophole in the law and avoid the incidence of tax liability, this will usually be permitted. It is not for the courts to legislate and plug the gaps left by the legislature. The test of avoidance will be whether there is a legitimate purpose for the given behaviour. Many states adopt a [...] "business purpose" [...] test, decomposing the transaction into its component steps to determine the true purpose of the transaction(s) (see tax avoidance/evasion).|$|E

Usually currencies are found in state-organized societies; large states invariably use currency <b>systems</b> <b>for</b> <b>taxation</b> and payment. Valuables and currencies are much more portable, easily centralized, and they do not lose value through spoilage. The disadvantage is that they cannot be directly consumed; they have to be exchanged in markets for consumption goods.

40|$|The {{reason for}} writing {{this article was}} a {{statement}} of the First Deputy Finance Minister Tatyana Nesterenko who claimed that in 2017 the government would {{run out of money}} to pay salaries to budgetary sphere employees [3]. Indeed, the reserves accumulated in the fat years are running out. The Government of the Russian Federation finds the following sources to cover the growing budget deficit: first, privatization of the remnants of state property, which will create a momentary effect and will not become a stable channel for filling the treasury; and second, major cuts on spending that {{on the eve of the}} electoral cycle can aggravate protest moods of Russians caused by a sharp deterioration of the standard of living. The majority of representatives of the expert and scientific community, including ISEDT RAS employees, consider the urgent need to reform the <b>system</b> <b>for</b> <b>taxation</b> of individual income tax by introducing a progressive tax scale as one of the main solutions to the growing imbalance of the budgetary system. This scale is applied successfully in all the countries of the OECD, G 20 and BRICS. The goal of the present paper is to substantiate the need for reformation of individual income tax as a driving force of sustainable mobilization of budget funds. As a hypothesis, an assumption is made concerning the existence of a direct link between the redistribution of income through progressive taxation and an increase in the resource potential of the budgetary system. Research findings presented in the paper confirm that the current mechanisms for taxation of people’s incomes do not correspond to the constitutional principles of equality, social orientation and economic viability. As a result, judging by the most important indicators of socioeconomic development, Russia lags behind developed countries and some comparable developing countries. Excessive income polarization brings to the fore the issue concerning individual income tax modification. The Russian leadership ignores the introduction of progressive taxation of individual income. Meanwhile, according to the most approximate calculations, if incremental taxation rate is applied to the incomes of 77 super-rich Russian businessmen, it will help replenish the budget by 2. 2 trillion rubles that will solve the debt crisis issue in Russia’s regions, and in the future – significantly reduce the level of subsidization and dependence on the federal center...|$|E

50|$|In {{the period}} between 1869 and 1875, with the {{founding}} of the new Hungarian political system, the Hungarians chose to style their economic system under a French model. The problem they encountered was that their current political system was more advanced in comparison to their archaic economic <b>system.</b> <b>For</b> example, <b>taxation</b> of the people {{came in the form of}} quasi-military campaigns that only raised taxes by 11% (Janos 106), while it embittered the rural population. Thus, these 6 years were known as a period of poor management of the economy by a failing government. When Tisza came to power in 1875, he consolidated the economy in many ways similar to his power consolidation of the government. He initiated taxation reforms that saved the state from bankruptcy. In 1887, Sándor Wekerle became the Minister of Finance. He worked with Tisza to develop a new tax system that focused on the taxation of land. The successes of these reforms were tremendous, even though the land tax increased by 30%, the revenues of the government increased by 330% (Janos 108). Between 1880 and 1895, public revenue doubled due to the successful tax reforms. Though the Tisza-Wekerle system saved the government from bankruptcy, the tax system proved to be too harsh and eventually prevented the rise of a domestic market for the products produced by Hungary.|$|R

The peasant could organize the production of the family farm, but his mobility and his use of the land was regulated, and he had to give to the state the percentage of his revenue that had been decided at that time. In the system of taxation, the peasant household counted as a single unit with a single annual income. The amount of land and the labor capacity of the family, with different classifications for men, women and children, determined each household's tax status. The central bureaucracy oversaw this system with surveys every twenty or thirty years and registration of each family farm unit.
