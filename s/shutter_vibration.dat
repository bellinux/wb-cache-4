5000|$|Two leaf-shuttered lenses {{were also}} made available, first the 90mm 2.8 {{and later a}} 165mm 2.8 that both {{allowing}} flash sync at all speeds, thereby solving many mirror and <b>shutter</b> <b>vibration</b> problems as well as allowing for fast shutter speeds for use with strobes and portable flashes while in bright shooting conditions. Lenses {{are linked to the}} body by the operation of the aperture stop-down lever being tripped. The camera body is set to the [...] "time-exposure" [...] setting. The through-the-lens (TTL) metering pentaprism viewfinder and included a knurled shutter dial ring with fitted case. The TTL-metered Pentaprism is the same coverage as the non-metered pentaprism, a coverage of 90% of frame and has a sensitivity pattern of 60% center-weight and 30% inner field sensitivity. The TTL Metering Pentaprism has no internal power of its own, instead, the operating power comes from one of the three contacts found in the finder bay of the body as well as grounding to the body. Only two of the three contacts are utilized and depending on the two modes: Normal as 'AUTO' mode and in an override to stopdown mode in the 'MAN' mode as found on many equipped lenses. In 'AUTO' is where the lens is fully opened and adjustments are read from the coupled index from the lens-through the index ring of the body mount-to the chain and index shuttle, the TTL-Meter receives the position information via a protruding tab facing the finder bay. The tab operates a linear potentiometer. In 'MAN' or manual mode with so equipped lenses, the sliding of the lens switch will move an internal lever that then presses down on the activating switch in the body. The switch is located inside the pin of the lens release pin. This inner pin is connected to an electrical toggle inside the body and switches the current from body grounded to bay connector to activate the secondary circuit. The installation of the TTL-Meter into the finder bay requires first the removal or turning of the lens to remove tension on the aperture chain. When the lens is rotated to allow the index on the chain to properly match up with the tab under the meter, the finder can then be seated and firmly pressed until the locks {{on either side of the}} finder latch. Removal of the finder is the reverse by first removing the lens and then pressing in the locks on the sides of the finder and lifting out. The physical difference of the TTL-Meter to the regular prism is the bulky arm that extends to the shutter speed dial. The dial covers the body dial and is coupled via a spring loaded index to the shutter speed dial. The included knurled ring assists the reach of the shutter speed dial due to the bulk of the TTL-Meter prism. The stop-down mode or direct metering through while the aperture is allowed to operate and change the amount of light, is similar to the 'MAN' mode, but activates when a non-auto-aperture lens is mounted causing index ring to be positioned to place the meter's linear potenioment into a bypass mode to activate the secondary circuit in the meter. The lens is allowed to stop-down and the light is directly measured, however, the shutter speed dial link operates the same in 'MAN' mode. As did the body receiving improvements over time, so did the TTL-Meter have had some changes. Although the image coverage remained unchanged, the type of metering and the circuitry received some upgrades. CdS (cadmium sulfide) to Gpd (gallium photo diode) photo cells and a two part circuit to a single board to improve response time and reliability. The early version is identified by the single marked 'ON' switch and the meter needle starts from UP to down and the later model has a 'ON' & 'OFF' marked switch and the meter needle starts from BOTTOM to top. The later model would also have the sole PENTAX badge by 1986.|$|E
40|$|The {{image quality}} {{analysis}} carried {{out during the}} third thermal-vacuum campaign (TV 3) revealed that vibrations of the UVIS shutter cause changes in the width and in the central pixel flux of point sources in short exposures. During the Servicing Mission Observatory Verification (May-August 2009) we observed the flux standard star GD 153 {{with a series of}} 0. 5 sec, 1. 0 sec, 3. 0 sec, 10. 0 sec and 20. 0 sec exposures to investigate the impact of the <b>shutter</b> <b>vibration</b> on data acquired in orbit. Our analysis shows that in the very short exposures (< 3. 0 - 10. 0 sec) the PSF is significantly degraded, but that the flux is preserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA novel {{closed-loop}} SOI MEMS resonant {{electrostatic field}} sensor (EFS) {{has been designed}} in this paper. The sensor architecture has three major blocks: a <b>vibration</b> <b>shutter,</b> sensing electrodes, and a closed-loop driving electrode that feeds back to the shutter. With a phase and an amplitude closed loop feedback control, the sensor can be adjusted automatically to operate at its resonant frequency. Prototyped by the SOI fabrication process, the device has a lower driving voltage and a higher quality factor (Q) over existing electrostatic comb driven EFS. An improved uncertainty of 2. 1 % is achieved for the SOI device operating in ambient air in a measured range of 0 – 50  kV/m...|$|R
40|$|Embodiments of {{the present}} {{invention}} provide structures for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) that can be sensed, activated, controlled or otherwise addressed or made to respond by the application of forcing functions. In particular, an optical shutter structure suitable for use in an optical switch arrangement is disclosed. In one embodiment, an optical shutter or switch can be scaled and/or arranged to form arbitrary switch, multiplexer and/or demultiplexer configurations. In another embodiment {{of the present}} invention, an optical switch can include: a shutter; and a flexure coupled to the <b>shutter,</b> whereupon a <b>vibration</b> transmitted to the flexure when {{in the presence of}} a resonant frequency causes the shutter to move across an opening for the passage of an optical signal...|$|R
50|$|Normal {{operation}} in an SLR camera involves flipping the mirror {{up out of}} the light-path just before the shutter opens, and then returning it when the shutter closes (although very early SLR's required the shutter to be cocked for the mirror to return). This causes vibration of the camera, particularly when the mirror slaps into the top of the mirror box. This vibration quickly dies away so the most motion blur is actually seen with short shutter times that capture multiple 'swings' of the <b>vibration</b> (<b>shutter</b> speeds of 1/2 to 1/60 second are often affected by this). While longer exposures will capture all of the vibrations, the exposure will be dominated by light captured when the camera is vibration-free (assuming a steady mount).|$|R
40|$|Measurements of vibrations, such as sound hitting {{an object}} or running a motor, {{are widely used}} in {{industry}} and research. Traditional methods need either {{direct contact with the}} object or a laser vibrometer. Although computer vision methods have been applied to solve this problem, high speed cameras are usually preferred. This study employs a consumer level rolling shutter camera for extracting main frequency components of small <b>vibrations.</b> A rolling <b>shutter</b> camera exposes continuously over time on the vertical direction of the sensor, and produces images with shifted rows of objects. We utilize the rolling shutter effect to boost our capability to extract vibration frequencies higher than the frame rate. Assuming the vibration amplitude of the target results in a horizontal fronto-parallel component in the image, we compute the displacement of each row from a reference frame by our novel phase matching approach in the complex-valued Shearlet transform domain. So far the only way to process rolling <b>shutter</b> video for <b>vibration</b> extraction is with the Steerable Pyramid in a motion magnification framework. However, the Shearlet transform is well localized in scale, location and orientation, and hence better suited to vibration extraction than the Steerable Pyramid used in the high speed video approach. Using our rolling shutter approach, we manage to recover signals from 75 Hz to 500 Hz from videos of 30 fps. We test our method by controlled experiments with a loudspeaker. We play sounds with certain frequency components and take videos of the loudspeaker's surface. Our approach recovers chirp signals as well as single frequency signals from rolling shutter videos. We also test with music and speech. Both experiments produce identifiable recovered audio...|$|R
