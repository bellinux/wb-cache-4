25|$|Benjamin Graham is {{regarded}} {{by many to}} be the father of value investing. Along with David Dodd, he wrote <b>Security</b> <b>Analysis,</b> first published in 1934. The most lasting contribution of this book to the field of <b>security</b> <b>analysis</b> was to emphasize the quantifiable aspects of <b>security</b> <b>analysis</b> (such as the evaluations of earnings and book value) while minimizing the importance of more qualitative factors such as the quality of a company's management. Graham later wrote The Intelligent Investor, a book that brought value investing to individual investors. Aside from Buffett, many of Graham's other students, such as William J. Ruane, Irving Kahn, Walter Schloss, and Charles Brandes went on to become successful investors in their own right.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Security {{testing and}} <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> are key issues and central to {{strengthening}} {{the ability of}} companies to face the new security challenges posed by the future internet. We present a conceptual framework clarifying the notions of security testing, <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis,</b> and related concepts, as well as defining the relations among them. The conceptual framework is built upon established concepts from state-of-the-art standards. We focus on model-based approaches for security testing and <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> and distinguish between model-based security testing (MST) and model-based <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> (MSR). In particular, we present the two possible combinations of MST and MSR, which are risk-driven model-based security testing (RMST) and test-driven model-based <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> (TMSR). The conceptual framework offers a basis for future research by providing a common understanding of the central notions within security testing and <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis...</b>|$|R

25|$|Value {{investing}} is {{an investment}} paradigm which generally involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of fundamental analysis, though it has taken many forms since its inception. It derives from the ideas on investment that Benjamin Graham and David Dodd began teaching at Columbia Business School in 1928 and subsequently developed in their 1934 text <b>Security</b> <b>Analysis.</b> As examples, such securities may be stock in public companies that trade at discounts to book value or tangible book value, have high dividend yields, have low price-to-earning multiples or have low price-to-book ratios.|$|E

In Phase 1, a <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> is carried out. In Phase 2, security testing is carried out with respect to the <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis.</b> In the 3 rd and final phase, the results obtained from the <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> are validated and updated with respect to the test results. Our objective with the case study was to assess how useful testing is for gaining confidence in the correctness of the risk models produced in the risk analysis. To make the evaluation precise, we analysed the difference between the risk model produced before testing and the updated risk model after testing. The results obtained from the case study shows that testing contributes in gaining higher confidence of the correctness of the risk models. Oppdragsgiver: Norwegian Research Counci...|$|R
25|$|Value {{investing}} {{was established}} by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, both professors at Columbia Business School and teachers of many famous investors. In Graham's book The Intelligent Investor, he advocated the important concept of margin of safety— first introduced in <b>Security</b> <b>Analysis,</b> a 1934 book he co-authored with David Dodd— which calls for an approach to investing that is focused on purchasing equities at prices less than their intrinsic values. In terms of picking or screening stocks, he recommended purchasing firms who have steady profits, are trading at low prices to book value, have low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, and who have relatively low debt.|$|E

30|$|Risk {{analysis}} is the quantitative analysis of risk {{present in a}} system. Risk {{analysis is}} done based on the threat modeling results. Risk analysis is performed to find the vulnerable states {{that need to be}} tested. Risk Driven Security Testing (RST) and Test Driven <b>Security</b> Risk <b>Analysis</b> (TSR) are the two approaches of risk <b>analysis.</b> <b>Security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> is a specialized risk analysis approach in which information security risk associated with the potential threats will be evaluated. In RST, security testing is supported by security risk assessment in order to make security testing more effective. The aim is to focus the security testing process to carry out security tests on the most important parts of the System Under Test, and to execute only the selected test cases. In TSR <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> is supported by security testing in order to develop and/or validate risk models. The objective of TSR is to strengthen the correctness of the <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> models.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} to clearly distinguish the combinations of security testing and <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> depending on whether it is viewed from a security testing perspective or a <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> perspective. The main focus in the former view is security testing in which test objectives are to be achieved, while the main focus in the latter view is <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> with the aim to fulfill risk acceptance criteria. The literature’s lack of addressing this distinction is accompanied {{with the lack of}} addressing two immediate problems within this context, namely the gap between high-level <b>security</b> risk <b>analysis</b> models and low-level security test cases, and the consideration of investable effort. We present initial ideas for methods that address these problems followed by an industrial case study evaluation in which we have gathered interesting results...|$|R
