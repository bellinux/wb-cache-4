60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{swiftly and}} surely; {{and shook her}} head again.|$|E
60|$|The joy {{passed from}} her face. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{a moment as}} if without understanding.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a smile, half-sweet, half-wistful, {{that has}} {{stuck in my}} memory for ever.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> sidelong <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with that}} {{stealthy}} gravity that lay under all her lightness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} she {{had had enough of}} visitors!" [...] her {{companion}} rejoined. [...] "But you don't mean to stay ten years," [...] <b>she</b> added, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|From {{under her}} painted lashes <b>she</b> flashed a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I hope never {{to see again}} that look upon a woman's face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Would {{you mind}} reading a letter for me, in French,' she said, her face {{immediately}} black and bitter-looking. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> frowning.|$|E
6000|$|... “I do want it—I {{happen to}} want it.” And her light laugh, with which <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{was like the}} flutter of some gage of battle.|$|E
6000|$|... "He will {{be there}} unless he is dead. That is why I sent for you, Monsieur." [...] <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Sometimes it is {{convenient}} to have a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Professor Gilroy is not satisfied," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>glancing</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with her}} strange little eyes. [...] "My poor fan {{is to get}} the credit of that experiment. Well, we must try {{something}} else. Miss Marden, would you have any objection to my putting you off?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> cast a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from {{eyes that}} {{appeared}} to be very small, unless for that instant it was mine that I saw reflected there.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> strangely <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Ask of {{the night}} that burns so many stars," [...] she said. [...] "All's done; all passes. Yet my poor busy Uncle Pandar had no such changes, nor Hector, nor ... Men change not: they love and love again--one same tune of a myriad verses." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{think that}} I {{must have been}} rather overacting my delight, and that she {{detected}} a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her eyebrows rise a little, and <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> curiously.|$|E
60|$|My cousin had {{not said}} one word or taken any notice of my presence, {{but at this}} joining of our names <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with the same hostile {{expression}} which I had already remarked.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again, {{her lips}} trembling, her eyes now clouded with some secret trouble. [...] "Yes," [...] she replied in a whisper, and then: [...] "No, {{it is not}} you," [...] and after a moment, doubtfully: [...] "Is it you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] <b>she</b> said, and <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> as if {{over her}} spectacles. Her next {{question}} was even less manageable. [...] "Was the young fellow a gentleman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Charmion {{shivered and}} made answer: [...] "It is true, O Queen; I also {{was of the}} plot, and because Harmachis scorned me I betrayed him; and because of my great love for him I have {{remained}} unwed." [...] And <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and caught my eyes, then let the modest lashes veil her own.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's said," [...] {{she added}} with long, {{straight}} mouth, [...] "that that unfortunate young man, Mr Crimble--is ill." [...] <b>She</b> gave a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> without appearing to see me, {{and left the}} room.|$|R
6000|$|... "The manageress had sat {{all this}} while busy with her papers {{without a word}} to either of us, but <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> now with so much {{annoyance}} upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{quickly and}} nodded her head. Then without more words, for {{officers}} were pressing towards us, {{she drew a}} ring off her finger, a thick and ancient golden ring on which were cut what looked like flowers, or images of the sun, {{and gave it to}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} been taking care of yourself," [...] said Madame. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and bit her lips, as though {{guessing}} the emotion which my visit had caused. [...] "Listen," [...] she said, [...] "the vesper bells! You must go into the house, and Mr. Ritchie and I must leave you." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{seemed about}} to say something, but changed his mind. He left me without another word. I {{stepped back into the}} sitting-room. My father, with an empty tumbler in his hand, was {{crouched}} forward over the table, breathing heavily. My stepmother, with marble 'face and hard set eyes, was leaning forward in her chair, looking into the dying fire. <b>She</b> scarcely <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as I entered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Greeting, my uncle," [...] <b>she</b> said, after <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> whose {{presence}} I think she understood. [...] "Are you {{the bearer of}} more prophecies? I pray not, since your last were overtrue," [...] and she touched the black veil with her finger.|$|R
60|$|So saying <b>she</b> shot a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> that pierced {{me through}} and through, as my arrows had pierced the Frenchmen, {{and what is}} more beneath {{the cover of the}} board for a moment let her slim hand rest upon my own.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is my {{favorite}} walk," [...] she said, simply, [...] "since I have been in Edinburgh. I don't mind the loneliness. I like the perfect tranquillity here at night." [...] <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again. [...] "What is the matter?" [...] she asked. [...] "You say nothing; you only look at me." ...|$|E
60|$|Having her {{so close}} {{gave me an}} {{opportunity}} of examining that light sheeny garment she wore always in the woods. It felt soft and satiny to the touch, and there was no seam nor hem in it that I could see, but it was all in one piece, like the cocoon of the caterpillar. While I was feeling it on her shoulder and looking narrowly at it, <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a mocking laugh in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Some {{four hours}} later, {{in the midst}} of a raging storm of wind and rain, I was brought at last to the bridge that spanned the moat of the Hall of Aar, laid like a corpse across the back of one of the horses. They had been searching for us at Aar, but in that {{darkness}} had found nothing. Only, at the head of the bridge was Freydisa, a torch in her hand. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> by the light of the torch.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> shot a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{from under}} her eyelids. The blind was not drawn, and the weak {{sunlight}} played upon her features. She was over-powdered and over-rouged, made up like all the smart women of her world, but her features were still good and her eyes delightful.|$|R
60|$|I {{never saw}} such a {{beautiful}} colour on my mother's face before. She gently chid me for being rude; and, keeping me close to her shawl, turned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her home. She put out her hand to him as she spoke, and, as he met it with his own, <b>she</b> <b>glanced,</b> I thought, <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|On the morrow the Court met in {{the great}} hall one hour before mid-day, and I went thither with a {{trembling}} heart to hear Cleopatra's answer to Dellius, and to hear myself also named King-consort to the Queen of Egypt. It was a full and splendid Court; there were councillors, lords, captains, eunuchs, and waiting-women, all save Charmion. The house passed, but Cleopatra and Charmion came not. At length Charmion entered gently by a side entrance, and took her place among the waiting-ladies about the throne. Even {{as she did so}} <b>she</b> cast a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and there was triumph in her eyes, though I knew not over what she triumphed. I little guessed that she had but now brought about my ruin and sealed the fate of Egypt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Temple, {{we were so}} sure of that--Mr. Ritchie and I--that {{we should}} not have sought for you here otherwise," [...] she replied quickly. Then <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as though seeking my {{approval}} for her next move. It was characteristic of her that she did not now shirk a task imposed by her sense of duty. [...] "We have little time, Mr. Temple, and much to say. Perhaps you will excuse us, Lamarque," [...] she added graciously, in French.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again, {{with her}} wonderful, unchanging eyes, that {{were like the}} visible heavens, unthinking, or like two flowers that are open in pure clear un{{consciousness}}. To her I {{was a piece of}} the environment. That was all. Her world was clear and absolute, without consciousness of self. She was not self-conscious, because she was not aware that there was anything in the universe except her universe. In her universe I was a stranger, a foreign signore. That I had a world of my own, other than her own, was not conceived by her. She did not care.|$|E
6000|$|I {{knew from}} his face that this was so, and that further words might be a fatal mistake, and I went out hurriedly, forgetting, I am afraid, to return his salutation, though when I met his sister <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with sympathy as she pointed toward another door. When I entered this Grace rose to meet me. The time we spent in the cañon had drawn us closer {{together}} than many months of companionship might have done, and it was with no affectation of bashful diffidence that she beckoned me to a place {{beside her on the}} casement logs, saying simply, [...] "You have bad news, sweetheart. Tell me everything." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought that}} if there was any danger my first care was to avert suspicion. Accordingly I began to work the {{conversation}} round to rag-picking--to the drains--of the things found there; and so by easy stages to jewels. Then, seizing a favourable opportunity, I asked the old woman if she knew anything of such things. She answered that she did, a little. I held out my right hand, and, showing her the diamond, asked her what she thought of that. She answered that her eyes were bad, and stooped over my hand. I said as nonchalantly as I could: 'Pardon me! You will see better thus!' and taking it off handed it to her. An unholy light came into her withered old face, as she touched it. <b>She</b> stole one <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> swift and keen as a flash of lightning.|$|R
6000|$|We {{had been}} talking about the masters who had {{achieved}} but a single masterpiece--the artists and poets who but once in their lives had known the divine afflatus and touched the high level of perfection. Our host had been showing us a charming little cabinet picture by a painter whose name we had never heard, and who, after this single spasmodic bid for fame, had apparently relapsed into obscurity and mediocrity. There was some discussion as to the frequency of this phenomenon; during which, I observed, H--- sat silent, finishing his cigar with a meditative air, and looking at the picture which was being handed round the table. [...] "I don't know how common a case it is," [...] he said at last, [...] "but I have seen it. I have known a poor fellow who painted his one masterpiece, and"--he added with a smile--"he didn't even paint that. He made his bid for fame and missed it." [...] We all knew H--- for a clever man who had seen much of men and manners, and had a great stock of reminiscences. Some one immediately questioned him further, and while I was engrossed with the raptures of my neighbour over the little picture, he was induced to tell his tale. If I were to doubt whether it would bear repeating, I should only have to remember how that charming woman, our hostess, who had left the table, ventured back in rustling rose-colour to pronounce our lingering a want of gallantry, and, finding us a listening circle, sank into her chair in spite of our cigars, and heard the story out so graciously that, when the catastrophe was reached, <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> across <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and showed me a tear in each of her beautiful eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the shapeless heap, and shuddered. Agravaine nodded.|$|R
