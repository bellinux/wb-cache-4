5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature in}} the non-dipolar part of the secular variation is a westward drift {{at a rate of}} about 0.2 degrees per year.

5|$|American crows succumb {{easily to}} West Nile virus infection. This was {{originally}} a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock <b>since</b> <b>about</b> 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by an infected air traveller who got {{bitten by a}} mosquito after arrival. It is estimated that the American crow population has dropped by up to 45% since 1999. Despite this decline, the crow is considered a species of least concern.|$|E

5|$|Berlioz's {{version is}} one of many which combine the Italian and French scores, {{although}} it is the most influential and well regarded. <b>Since</b> <b>about</b> 1870 three-act adaptations of the Berlioz score, translating it back into Italian and restoring much of the music from the 1774 French version which Berlioz had left out, were common. An 1889 edition for contralto, published by Ricordi, became the most popular. On occasion the role of Orfeo has even been transposed down an octave for a baritone to sing. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann Prey are two notable baritones who have performed the role in Germany. Fischer-Dieskau recorded the opera several times; his recordings are still available commercially.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{migration}} routes {{have been}} studied {{by a variety of}} techniques including the oldest, marking. Swans have been marked with a nick on the beak <b>since</b> <b>about</b> 1560 in England. Scientific ringing was pioneered by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen in 1899. Other techniques include radar and satellite tracking. The rate of bird migration over the Alps (up to a height of 150 m) was found to be highly comparable between fixed-beam radar measurements and visual bird counts, highlighting the potential use of this technique as an objective way of quantifying bird migration.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald came to {{the throne}} {{on the death of}} his father on 24 February 616, or {{possibly}} 618. Although Æthelberht had been Christian <b>since</b> <b>about</b> 600 and his wife Bertha was also Christian, Eadbald was a pagan. Bertha died some time before Eadbald's accession, and Æthelberht remarried. The name of Æthelberht's second wife is not recorded, but it seems likely that she was a pagan, since on his death she married Eadbald, her stepson: a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church.|$|E

5|$|In {{line with}} the hadith's {{prohibition}} against creating images of sentient living beings, which is particularly strictly observed with respect to God and Muhammad, Islamic religious art {{is focused on the}} word. Muslims generally avoid depictions of Muhammad, and mosques are decorated with calligraphy and Quranic inscriptions or geometrical designs, not images or sculptures. Today, the interdiction against images of Muhammad– designed to prevent worship of Muhammad, rather than God– is much more strictly observed in Sunni Islam (85%–90% of Muslims) and Ahmadiyya Islam (1%) than among Shias (10%–15%). While both Sunnis and Shias have created images of Muhammad in the past, Islamic depictions of Muhammad are rare. They have, until recently, mostly been limited to the private and elite medium of the miniature, and <b>since</b> <b>about</b> 1500 most depictions show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>about</b> 1900, the Black Canyon {{and nearby}} Boulder Canyon had been {{investigated}} for their potential {{to support a}} dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power. In 1928, Congress authorized the project. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies, Inc., which began construction on the dam in early 1931. Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, {{and some of the}} techniques were unproven. The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned over the dam to the federal government on March 1, 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Ward Wardroom was {{constructed}} {{and used as}} a polling place and meeting hall in a critical time when Pawtucket was incorporated as a city before becoming the Major Walter G.

5|$|The First Ward Wardroom is a {{historic}} meeting hall at 171 Fountain Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. It is a single-story red brick building, with a low-pitch gable-over-hipped roof. Basically rectangular, an enclosed entry pavilion projects from the main block. The building, designed by William R. Walker & Son and built in 1886, {{is one of only}} three ward halls (structures built by the city and used as polling places and meeting halls) to survive in the state. <b>Since</b> <b>about</b> 1920 it has been the Major Walter G. Gatchell Post No. 306 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The first {{non-indigenous}} settler at Wolf Point {{may have}} been a trader named Guarie. Writing in 1880 Gurdon Hubbard, who first arrived in Chicago on October 1, 1818, stated that he had been told of Guarie by Antoine De Champs and Antoine Beson, who had been traversing the Chicago Portage annually <b>since</b> <b>about</b> 1778. Hubbard wrote that De Champs had shown him evidence of a trading house and the remains of a cornfield supposed to have belonged to Guarie. The cornfield was located on {{the west bank of the}} North Branch of the Chicago River, a short distance from the forks at what is now Fulton Street; early settlers named the North Branch of the Chicago River the Guarie River, or Gary's River.|$|E
5|$|The local {{way of life}} {{reflects}} the Scottish and Norse heritage of the isles, including the Up Helly Aa fire festival, and a strong musical tradition, especially the traditional fiddle style. The islands have produced a variety of writers of prose and poetry, often in the distinct Shetland dialect of Scots. There are numerous areas set aside to protect the local fauna and flora, including {{a number of important}} sea bird nesting sites. The Shetland pony and Shetland Sheepdog are two well-known Shetland animal breeds. Other local breeds include the Shetland sheep, cow, goose, and duck.
