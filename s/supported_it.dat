5|$|A poll {{released}} by Angus Reid on January 7, found that 53% of respondents {{were opposed to}} the prorogation, while 19% <b>supported</b> <b>it.</b> 38% believed Harper used the prorogation to curtail the Afghan detainee inquiry, while 23% agreed with Harper's explanation that the prorogation was necessary economically.|$|E
5|$|At party level, the Labour Party, in {{opposition}} until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and {{supportive of the}} black nationalist movement on ideological and moral grounds. The Liberal Party, holding a handful of parliament seats, took a similar stance. The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was more sympathetic to the Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly <b>supported</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

It also has {{ties with the}} leadership in Syria, specifically President Hafez al-Assad (until his death in 2000) <b>supported</b> <b>it.</b> It's also a close Assad ally, and its leader pledged support to the embattled Syrian leader. Although Hezbollah and Hamas are not organizationally linked, Hezbollah provides military training as well as financial and moral support to the Sunni Palestinian group.

5|$|In 1903, a dam in the {{northern}} portion of the park was proposed. Located in the Hetch Hetchy Valley, its purpose was to provide water and hydroelectric power to San Francisco. Muir and the Sierra Club opposed the project, while others, including Gifford Pinchot, <b>supported</b> <b>it.</b> In 1913, the U.S. Congress authorized the O'Shaughnessy Dam through passage of the Raker Act.|$|E
5|$|Major issues {{brought up}} during the {{campaign}} were the candidates' positions on President Obama's stimulus plan, which Tedisco did not take a stance on {{until late in the}} race. Murphy <b>supported</b> <b>it</b> while Tedisco eventually opposed it. Tedisco portrayed Murphy's support of the plan as a potential cause of the AIG bonus scandal. Tedisco's campaign also brought up Murphy's failure to pay taxes on a company he founded in the 1990s. A frequent Murphy talking point was that Tedisco's primary residence was not in the Congressional district.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{objected to}} Douglas's speech, stating {{that he had}} opposed the Korea bill {{because it did not}} include aid to Taiwan, and had <b>supported</b> <b>it</b> once the aid had been included. As for the Europe charge, {{according}} to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon was so well known as a supporter of the Marshall Plan that Douglas's charge had no credibility. In fact, Nixon had opposed a two-year reauthorization of the Marshall Plan, favoring a one-year reauthorization with a renewal provision, allowing for more congressional oversight.|$|E

5|$|The Ohio {{legislature}} reelected Sherman {{to another}} six-year term that year, and when (after a three-month vacation in Europe) he resumed his seat he again {{turned to the}} greenback question. Public support for greenbacks had grown, especially among businesspeople who thought withdrawal would lead to lower prices. When a bill passed the House suspending the authority to retire greenbacks under the Contraction Act, Sherman <b>supported</b> <b>it</b> in the Senate. It passed the Senate 33–4, and became law in 1868.|$|E
5|$|The UCR and the Frepaso united as a {{political}} coalition, the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education, led by Alfonsín, Fernando delaRúa and Rodolfo Terragno from the UCR, and Carlos Álvarez and Graciela Fernández Meijide from the Frepaso. The coalition won the 1997 legislative elections. Alfonsín {{did not agree with}} delaRúa about the fixed exchange rate used by then. He thought that it had been a good measure in the past but had become detrimental to the Argentine economy, while delaRúa <b>supported</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Peninsular War in Spain and the capture of the Spanish king Ferdinand VII generated a political crisis in the Spanish colonies in the Americas. The first project to maintain the monarchy was the short-lived Carlotism, which sought to crown Carlota Joaquina as regent. This project was supported by criollos like Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli, but whether Saavedra <b>supported</b> <b>it</b> is disputed. The Carlotism was abandoned soon afterwards, and the people sought other projects.|$|E

5|$|A primary issue {{during the}} {{election}} was {{the construction of a}} dam on the Red River. Cook opposed the dam, but Ford <b>supported</b> <b>it</b> and allocated some of the state's budget surplus to its construction. In the election, Ford defeated Cook by a vote of 399,406 to 328,982, completing his revitalization of the state's Democratic party by personally ousting the last Republican from major office. Cook resigned his seat in December so that Ford would have a higher standing in seniority in the Senate. Ford resigned as governor to accept the seat, leaving the governorship to Carroll, who dropped state support for the project, killing it.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, Roosevelt's {{international}} role as {{spokesperson for}} women {{led her to}} stop publicly criticizing the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), although she never <b>supported</b> <b>it.</b> In the early 1960s, she announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA {{was no longer a}} threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that they could have the amendment if they wanted it. In 1961, President Kennedy's undersecretary of labor, Esther Peterson proposed a new Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. Kennedy appointed Roosevelt to chair the commission, with Peterson as director. This was Roosevelt's last public position. She died just before the commission issued its report. It concluded that female equality was best achieved by recognition of gender differences and needs, and not by an Equal Rights Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Harper was {{the only}} Reform MP to support the {{creation}} of the Canadian Firearms Registry at second reading in 1995, although he later voted against it at third reading stage. He said {{at the time that he}} initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents <b>supported</b> <b>it,</b> and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.|$|E

5|$|Henry had a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed {{a substantial number}} of sexual partners, resulting in a large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and <b>supported.</b> <b>It</b> was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{redevelopment}} began {{over most}} of the area above the platforms. The new buildings were named Embankment Place, a postmodern office and shopping complex designed by Terry Farrell and Partners. This development led to the replacement of almost the whole of the 1906 roof. The rear two spans of this structure – immediately adjacent to the existing concourse roof – were retained as part of an enlarged waiting area. In addition the original retaining side walls of the station which once <b>supported</b> <b>it</b> remain in near complete condition. The works were completed in November 1990. Most of the Embankment Place complex is office space, with a selection of restaurants on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|In May 1409 an {{uprising}} in Teutonic-held Samogitia started. Lithuania <b>supported</b> <b>it</b> and the knights threatened to invade. Poland announced {{its support for}} the Lithuanian cause and threatened to invade Prussia in return. As Prussian troops evacuated Samogitia, Teutonic Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen declared war on the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on 6 August 1409. The Knights hoped to defeat Poland and Lithuania separately, and began by invading Greater Poland and Kuyavia, catching the Poles by surprise. The Knights burned the castle at Dobrin (Dobrzyń nad Wisłą), captured Bobrowniki after a 14-day siege, conquered Bydgoszcz (Bromberg) and sacked several towns. The Poles organized counterattacks and recaptured Bydgoszcz. The Samogitians attacked Memel (Klaipėda). However, neither side {{was ready for a}} full-scale war.|$|E

5|$|One {{source of}} {{opposition}} to the proposed amendment was the women's suffrage movement, which {{before and during the}} Civil War had made common cause with the abolitionist movement. However, {{with the passage of the}} Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the civil rights of women divorced from those of blacks. Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not gender discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the American Equal Rights Association, the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the National Woman Suffrage Association of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who opposed the amendment, and the American Woman Suffrage Association of Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell, who <b>supported</b> <b>it.</b> The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The deputies and the Junta met on December 18, {{to decide}} what to do. Funes, who was close to Saavedra, argued that Buenos Aires had no right to appoint {{national}} authorities by itself and expect obedience from the provinces. The nine deputies voted for their incorporation, as did Larrea, Azcuénaga, Matheu and Alberti, founding members of the Junta. Saavedra declared that the incorporation was not fully legal, but that he <b>supported</b> <b>it</b> for public convenience. Only Juan José Paso voted with Moreno against the incorporation of the deputies. Left in a minority within the Junta, Moreno resigned. He was appointed to a diplomatic mission in Europe, but died in high seas, in unclear circumstances. Some historians consider that Saavedra plotted to murder Moreno, others that it was a negligence of the captain, and others that it was because of Moreno's frail health.|$|E
5|$|The tercentenary of {{the capture}} of Gibraltar was celebrated in the {{territory}} in August 2004 but attracted criticism from some in Spain. In September 2006, tripartite talks between Spain, Gibraltar and the UK resulted in a deal (known as the Cordoba Agreement) {{to make it easier}} to cross the border and to improve transport and communications links between Spain and Gibraltar. Among the changes was an agreement to lift restrictions on Gibraltar's airport to enable airlines operating from Spain to land there and to facilitate use of the airport by Spanish residents. It did not address the vexed issue of sovereignty, but this time the government of Gibraltar <b>supported</b> <b>it.</b> A new Constitution Order was promulgated in the same year, which was approved by a majority of 60.24% in a referendum held in November 2006.|$|E
