40|$|Thermal laser polymer bonding is a {{non-contact}} {{process for}} the joining of polymer laminates using thermally activated adhesives. Conventional, contact based bonding techniques suffer from mechanical wear, geometric inflexibility and poor energy efficiency. The application of lasers offers the potential for highly localized delivery of energy and increased process flexibility whilst achieving controlled and repeatable bonding of polymer laminates in a contact free process. Unlike previously reported techniques, here it is reported that laser based non-contact bonding is both viable and highly desirable due to the increased levels of control it affords the user. In this work, laser polymer bonding of 75 μm thick {{linear low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) film backed with a thermally activated adhesive to a 640 μm thick polypropylene (PP) substrate was conducted using continuous wave 10. 6 μm laser radiation and scanning galvanometric optics.

Methods: A methodological study and retrospective investigation of selected cases. Sixty-five human subjects were included, 61 healthy subjects and four female carriers of blue-cone monochromacy. Thickness data from B <b>scans</b> <b>traversing</b> the foveal pit was fit to a mathematical model designed to capture the contour of the foveal surface. From this model, various metrics of foveal morphology were extracted (pit depth, diameter, and slope). Results: Mathematical descriptions of foveal morphology enabled quantitative and objective evaluation of foveal dimensions from archived OCT data sets. We found large variation {{in all aspects of}} the foveal pit (depth, diameter, and slope). In myopes and BCM carriers, foveal pits were slightly less deep and had a more shallow slope though these differences were not significant.

40|$|The {{effectivity}} of multichannel Wiener filters {{to improve}} images obtained with passive microwave systems was investigated by applying Wiener filters to passive microwave images of first-year sea ice. Four major parameters which define the filter were varied: the lag or pixel offset between {{the original and}} the desired scenes, filter length, the number of lines in the filter, and the weight applied to the empirical correlation functions. The effect of each variable on the image quality was assessed by visually comparing the results. It {{was found that the}} application of multichannel Wiener theory to passive microwave images of first-year sea ice resulted in visually sharper images with enhanced textural features and less high-frequency noise.

This rotating gantry can transport heavy ions having 430 MeV/nucleon to an isocenter with irradiation angles of over 0 - 360 degrees, and enables advanced radiation-therapy. To reduce the size and weight of the rotating gantry, we designed superconducting magnets that can independently excite dipole and quadrupole field. The three-dimensional scanning-irradiation method is performed in this rotating gantry. Therefore, uniformity of magnetic field is quite important, since <b>scanned</b> beams <b>traverse</b> through these superconducting magnets before reaching to the isocenter. In the present work, we precisely measured the magnetic-field distributions of the superconducting magnets for the rotating gantry. We used Hall probes to measure the magnetic-flux density. The magnetic-field distributions were determined by measuring Hall voltage, while moving the Hall probes on a rail, which has the same curvature as a center trajectory of beams. The measured-field distributions were compared with designed distributions by using a three-dimensional electromagnetic-field solver, the OPERA- 3 D code. Furthermore, beam-tracking simulations were performed by using the measured magnetic-field distributions to verify {{the design of the}} superconducting magnets...|$|R

Scan data (treated as {{a cloud of}} points) is first tesselated out to its convex hull using Delaunay triangulation. The line-of-sight between each surface point and the <b>scanning</b> device is <b>traversed,</b> and any tetrahedra which are pierced by it are removed. The remaining tetrahedra form an approximate solid model of the scanned object. Due to the inherently limited resolution of any scan, this algorithm requires two additional procedures to produce a smooth, polyhedral surface: one process removes long, narrow tetrahedra which span indentations in the surface between digitized points; the other smooths sharp edges.

Because each scan is likely to produce a reflection indicating {{only a portion of}} the defect, summing of the individual reflections must be used to obtain a reasonably complete characterization of the defect. The ability of the collimated pitch-catch technique to detect relatively small amounts of flaw growth was shown. The method has a problem in characterizing the portions of the defect near the top surface or web intersection. The work performed was a preliminary evaluation of the prospects for automated mapping of rail flaws...|$|R

In this Appendix, detailed representative and selected analyses of carbonate aggregate only are presented. These analyses were not presented in the main report because they {{would be interesting to}} only a few specialists in dolomite· rocks. In this Appendix, individual point analyses of mineral compositions in the paste have been omitted along with dolomite compositions at grain boundaries and cracks. Clay minerals and quartz inclusions in the aggregate are also not included.

Furthermore, a path planning algorithm based on grid <b>scan</b> which can <b>traverse</b> entirely in sensor field is described. At the same time, the start conditions of localization algorithm are also proposed to improve localization accuracy. To evaluate the proposed path planning algorithm, the localization results of beacon nodes randomly deployed in sensor field are also provided.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} binding of Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes to glutaraldehyde-fixed mammalian cells has {{the characteristics of a}} receptor-mediated process and that it mimics the attachment step of the invasion of live cells by this parasite. In this study we examined the metabolic requirements for the attachment of trypomastigotes to glutaraldehyde-fixed fibroblasts. The attachment of trypomastigotes to fixed cells is prevented when the energy conservation mechanisms are inhibited with the drugs 2 -deoxyglucose, sodium azide, antimycin, crystal violet, oligomycin, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and carbonyl cyanide 3 -chlorophenylhydrazone. However, under the same experimental conditions, the movement of parasites is not significantly affected. Several of these drugs totally inhibit the penetration of the parasite into live target cells. We conclude that the attachment of trypomastigotes to mammalian cells is an active process that requires trypomastigote energy. In addition, we present evidence that penetration into nonphagocytic cells can also be an active process. Trypomastigotes can be seen in <b>scanning</b> electron micrographs <b>traversing</b> extended lamellipodia and entering paraformaldehyde-fixed epithelial cells.

40|$|International audienceThe {{measurement}} of SO 2 flux from volcanoes is of major importance for monitoring and hazard assessment purposes, and {{for evaluation of}} {{the environmental impact of}} volcanic emissions. We propose here a novel technique for accurate and high time resolution estimations of the gas flux. We use two wide field of view UV spectrometers capable of collecting, instantaneously, light from thin parallel cross sections of the whole gas plume, obviating the need for either <b>traversing,</b> <b>scanning</b> or imaging. It enables tracking of inho-mogeneities in the gas cloud from which accurate evaluation of the plume velocity can be made by correlation analysis. The method has been successfully applied on Mt. Erebus volcano (Antarctica). It yields estimations of the plume velocity and gas flux at unprecedented time resolution (1 Hz) and high accuracy (uncertainty of 33 %). During a ∼ 2 h experiment on 26 December 2006, SO 2 flux varied between 0. 17 and 0. 89 ± 0. 2 kg s − 1 with a vertical plume velocity varying between 1 and 2. 5 ± 0. 1 m s − 1. These measurements provide insight into the short-term variations of the passive degassing of this volcano renowned for its active lava lake. A cyclicity in flux, ranging from about 11 - 24 min, is evident. We propose two physical mechanisms to explain this degassing pattern, associated to periodic supply of either gas-rich magma or gas alone into the lake. The dual-wide field of view DOAS technique promises better integration of geochemical and geophysical observations and new insights into gas and magma dynamics, as well as processes of magma storage and gas segregation at active volcanoes...|$|R

It has revealed that very limited research has been carried out to investigate the pulsed laser milling process for difficult-to-machine materials like polycrystalline diamonds (PCD), and to understand the physics behind this process. An experimental investigation has been undertaken to study the feasibility of nanosecond-pulsed laser milling process for PCDs and to understand the process characteristics. Plausible trends for the various milling performance measures, such as material removal rate, surface roughness and subsurface thermal damage, with respect to the process parameters have been revealed. A computational model for single-pulse laser ablation process has been developed and solved using the finite element method to understand the heating/cooling and material removal process in laser ablation of PCD. A comparison between the model predicted and the measured ablation depths has been carried out and shown that the model predictions agree well with the corresponding experimental data. The simulation results have shown that surface evaporation dominates the material removal process when laser pulse fluence exceeds the ablation threshold for PCD. Diamond graphitization results in heat accumulation, which leads to higher evaporation rates; melting and ejection of cobalt takes place at smaller pulse energies, which increases the heat loss. The single-pulse laser ablation model has then been extended to the study of laser milling process incorporating multiple <b>traverse</b> <b>scans.</b> The model predicted depths and profiles of the milled pockets show a good agreement with the corresponding experimental data. A simulation study has been carried out to investigate the temperature evolution and the material removal process involving different milling conditions, which has provided an in-depth understanding of the effects of process parameters on the laser milling process. This study has demonstrated the capability of laser milling process for PCDs. The analysis of the material removal mechanisms in both single pulse ablation and laser milling process has provided an in-depth understanding of the physical phenomena involved.
