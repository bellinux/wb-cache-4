40|$|Members of {{different}} voltage-gated K+ channel subfamilies {{usually do not}} form heteromultimers. However, coassembly between <b>Shaker</b> <b>and</b> ether-à-go-go (eag) subunits, members of two distinct K+ channel subfamilies, was suggested by genetic and functional studies (Zhong and Wu. 1991. Science. 252 : 1562 - 1564; Chen, M. -L., T. Hoshi, and C. -F. Wu. 1996. Neuron. 17 : 535 - 542). We investigated whether <b>Shaker</b> <b>and</b> eag form heteromultimers in Xenopus laevis oocytes using electrophysiological and biochemical approaches. Coexpression of <b>Shaker</b> <b>and</b> eag subunits produced K+ currents that were virtually identical to the sum of separate <b>Shaker</b> <b>and</b> eag currents, with {{no change in the}} kinetics of Shaker inactivation. According to the results of dominant negative and reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments, the <b>Shaker</b> <b>and</b> eag proteins do not interact. We conclude that <b>Shaker</b> <b>and</b> eag do not coassemble to form heteromultimers in Xenopus oocytes...|$|R
