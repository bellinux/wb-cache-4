25|$|For {{the gravity}} {{below the surface}} we have to apply the free-air {{correction}} {{as well as a}} double Bouguer correction. With the infinite slab model this is because moving the point of observation below the slab changes the gravity due to it to its opposite. Alternatively, we can consider a spherically symmetrical Earth and <b>subtract</b> <b>from</b> the mass of the Earth that of the shell outside the point of observation, because that does not cause gravity inside. This gives the same result.|$|E

For example, human rights groups say that the casualty count provided by the Health Ministry most likely includes victims of Hamas executions, domestic violence, and natural deaths, but they (the human rights groups) remove the accused collaborators (who were shot as close range) from their own counts. Israel contends that the Health Ministry's casualty count also includes deaths caused by rocket or mortar malfunctions.|$|E

The amount of shielding depends on the exact local environment. For example, a hydrogen bonded to an oxygen will be shielded differently from a hydrogen bonded to a carbon atom. In addition, two hydrogen nuclei can interact via {{a process known as}} spin-spin coupling, if they are on the same molecule, which will split the lines of the spectra in a recognizable way.|$|E

500|$|Thompson and Doran {{discussed}} {{how much of}} the love stories to depict, as the male characters spend much of the novel away from the Dashwood sisters. The screenwriter had to carefully balance the amount of screentime she gave to the male leads, noting in her film production diary that such a decision would [...] "very much lie in the editing." [...] Thompson wrote [...] "hundreds of different versions" [...] of romantic storylines. She considered having Edward re-appear midway through the film before deciding that it would not work as [...] "there was nothing for him to do." [...] Thompson also opted to exclude the duel scene between Brandon and Willoughby, which is described in the novel, because it [...] "only seemed to <b>subtract</b> <b>from</b> the mystery." [...] She and Doran agonised about when and how to reveal Brandon's backstory, as they wanted to prevent viewers from becoming bored. Thompson described the process of reminding audiences of Edward and Brandon as [...] "keeping plates spinning".|$|E

2500|$|The Yamaha DX7, {{the most}} well known synth of the 1980s, used entirely digital {{circuitry}} leaving it {{free from the}} need of calibration, and vast numbers of parameters that could be accessed. [...] The [...] "FM" [...] (frequency modulation) synthesis method was something {{that had not been}} explored to near this depth. [...] Most synthesizers before this were subtractive. [...] i.e. You start with a very harmonic-laden sound and you selectively <b>subtract</b> <b>from</b> them using low, high or bandpass filters, or some other methods that tended to result in stranger sounds like ring modulation. Also in 1983 Dave Smith's company SCI marketed the first polyphonic synthesizer keyboard that could play more than one sound at a time called the 'Six-Trak'. [...] It had a six track sequencer and each track could access a different sound. [...] The same year the SCI Prophet T8 with optical key sensing became the first piano action emulating midi keyboard.|$|E
2500|$|An {{idealised}} grating {{is considered}} here {{which is made}} up of a set of slits of spacing d, that must be wider than the wavelength of interest to cause diffraction. Assuming a plane wave of monochromatic light of wavelength λ with normal incidence (perpendicular to the grating), each slit in the grating acts as a quasi point-source from which light propagates in all directions (although this is typically limited to a hemisphere). After light interacts with the grating, the diffracted light is composed of the sum of interfering wave components emanating from each slit in the grating. At any given point in space through which diffracted light may pass, the path length to each slit in the grating will vary. Since the path length varies, generally, so will the phases of the waves at that point from each of the slits, and thus will add or <b>subtract</b> <b>from</b> one another to create peaks and valleys, through the phenomenon of additive and destructive interference. When the path difference between the light from adjacent slits is equal to half the wavelength, , the waves will all be out of phase, and thus will cancel each other to create points of minimum intensity. Similarly, when the path difference is λ, the phases will add together and maxima will occur. The maxima occur at angles θm, which satisfy the relationship [...] = |m|, where θm is the angle between the diffracted ray and the grating's normal vector, and d is the distance from the center of one slit {{to the center of the}} adjacent slit, and m is an integer representing the propagation-mode of interest.|$|E

Besides, it would much <b>subtract</b> <b>from</b> the glory of the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep.

6000|$|Let us now add {{a second}} {{step to the}} argument: we require, what? Another {{assumption}}? No: the same assumption a second time; and so on to a third, and a fourth. I confess I do not see how, on Mr. Spencer’s own principles, the repetition of the assumption at all weakens {{the force of the}} argument. If it were necessary the second time to assume some other axiom, the argument would no doubt be weakened, since it would be necessary to its validity that both axioms should be true, and it might happen that one was true and not the other: making two chances of error instead of one. But since it is the same axiom, if it is true once it is true every time; and if the argument, being of a hundred links, assumed the axiom a hundred times, these hundred assumptions would make but one chance of error among them all. It is satisfactory that we are not obliged to suppose the deductions of pure mathematics to be among the most uncertain of argumentative processes, which on Mr. Spencer’s theory they could hardly fail to be, since they are the longest. But the number of steps in an argument does not <b>subtract</b> <b>from</b> its reliableness, if no new premises, of an uncertain character, are taken up by the way.(93) ...|$|E
60|$|Our supreme want to-day, {{if we are}} to {{continue}} a belligerent people, is a greater supply of able educated men, versatile men capable of engines, of aviation, of invention, of leading and initiative.
