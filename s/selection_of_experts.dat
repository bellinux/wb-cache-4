30|$|Delphi surveys do not {{strive for}} {{representativity}} in sampling, {{but for the}} highest possible degree of expertise [25, 26]. Thus, the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> for the Delphi panel is crucial and significantly influences the reliability of research results [38, 39]. We included experts from the fields of the European chemical industry, governmental institutions and politicians as well as media representatives based on their designated and documented knowledge and expertise, {{as well as their}} capacity, willingness and time to participate [40]. Overall, 371 experts within the 27 EU member states were contacted by phone and/or email. All invited industry experts were at senior management level.

30|$|Not {{just these}} characteristics, but certain other issues are also {{relevant}} and necessary {{to develop a}} rigorous process. Following Okoli & Pawlowski [51], the choice of experts {{is one of the}} most valuable elements for achieving a successful result when applying a Delphi method; the papers reviewed above have covered the selection process and criteria exhaustively (e.g., [5, 58]). Depending on the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts,</b> whatever their expertise and the criterion on which this decision is based, the results will either be useful or simply biased by this process [68]. Secondly, the Delphi process can be continuously iterated until consensus is achieved or disruptions of positions are clear, although a three-round Delphi method is acceptable to the experts [17]. The business papers reviewed have maintained this minimum exigency.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{develop an}} {{instrument}} to assess the content and balance of media stories about genetic discoveries relevant to human diseases and assess its ability to detect variability. Methods: Consumer focus groups to help develop the instrument, and surveys of scientists and journalists to evaluate the items. Ratings by at least two readers assessed reliability. Variability was measured by comparing scores of 47 stories emanating from two discoveries. Results: Reader agreement on content items was good (kappa = 0. 74). Consumers, scientists, and journalists were in substantial agreement about what content items should be included. Some items deemed essential by journalists appeared in very few stories. One-third of stories exaggerated {{the benefits of the}} discovery and one-third presented a balanced <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> opinion. Coverage <b>of</b> specific items varied from 11. 5 percent to 84. 6 percent.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The French Ministry, {{in charge}} of mining and post-mining issues, plans to perform as {{effectively}} as possible its future investigations (Mining Risk Prevention Plans, MRPP, in particular). In this way, an ambitious program, called Screening, has been engaged in order to classify and to evaluate all French mining sites according to their mining risk level and then, to perform a quick risk evaluation for the most critical sites. This process included an important stage of hierarchisation. After many months of works, a multi-criteria analysis (based on ELECTRE’s method) was finally adopted. It required an appropriated <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts,</b> an effective criteria definition, use of adapted tools and a precise validation before application to given mining sites. The different steps of this work are presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{investigation}} or {{evidence is}} becoming increasingly important. Especially, {{there has been a}} dramatic increase in DNA testing. However, if the scientific evidence is false, this might lead to false accusation. It is difficult for laypersons including judges to understand and evaluate scientific evidence. Therefore, legal regulation is required for scientific examination or evidence. The Japanese Code of Criminal Procedure has the concept <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> evidence/examination that originated from “Gutachten” of German Law. Expertise, which may be scientific or nonscientific, is required because it does not belong to rules <b>of</b> thumb. <b>Expert</b> examiners have the dual character of being judges’ assistants and evidence themselves in the Japanese and European continental legal systems. In the Anglo-American legal system, experts are merely a type of witness（expert witnesses）. They work for the party（prosecutors or defendants）and impartiality is not required <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> witnesses. In contrast, expert examiners are appointed by judges and impartiality is required and expected of them. However, the legal status <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> examiners does not necessarily guarantee the appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> evidence/examination. We should consider the system required for maintenance and improvement <b>of</b> quality. <b>Expert</b> examination at the investigation stage is different from that at the trial stage. It is requested by police officers or prosecutors. Judges and defense lawyers have no involvement in the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> examiners and assignment of examination theses and materials. Expert examination requested by investigators might be influenced by unconscious biases. The major part <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> evidence presented in criminal trials is presented at the investigation stage. We must consider the appropriate system for handling expert evidence, with a clear picture <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> examination for investigation in mind...|$|R
