25|$|In 1795, with French help, {{the last}} <b>Stadholder</b> William V {{was forced to}} flee and the Batavian Republic (1795–1806) was proclaimed. At first this had no {{influence}} {{on the use of}} the arms of the former Republic. However, the following year the lion, that had served for approximately 280 years, was replaced by an allegoric image of a “Dutch maiden of Freedom”.|$|E
25|$|In March 1577, the Spanish {{brought a}} {{contingent}} of soldiers from Wallonia to maintain their rule in the rebellious province of Overijssel. In March 1580, amidst outrage amongst the Protestant Dutch over the betrayal of George van Lalaing (Count of Renneberg and former <b>Stadholder</b> of Groningen) - who had turned {{to be in the}} service of Spain - the occupation force, their wages overdue, went {{over to the side of}} the Dutch rebels.|$|E
25|$|The House of Orange {{reacted with}} severity, relying on Prussian troops led by Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick {{and a small}} {{contingent}} of British troops to suppress the rebellion. Dutch banks at this time still held much of the world's capital. Government-sponsored banks owned up to 40% of Great Britain's national debt and there were close connections to the House of Stuart. The <b>stadholder</b> had supported British policies after the American Revolution.|$|E

25|$|In 1785 the <b>stadholder</b> left The Hague {{and moved}} his court to Nijmegen in Guelders, a city {{remote from the}} heart of Dutch {{political}} life. In June 1787, his energetic wife Wilhelmina (the sister of Frederick William II of Prussia) tried to travel to The Hague. Outside Schoonhoven, she was stopped by Patriot militiamen and taken to a farm near Goejanverwellesluis. Within two days she was forced to return to Nijmegen, an insult not unnoticed in Prussia.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch were {{determined}} to fortify both towns with their own troops, no longer trusting the neutrality of the German princes garrison. Thus {{the keys to the}} land of Cleves and Julliers the scene of the Francisco de Mendoza's successful and brutal campaign were now held by the <b>stadholder.</b> Maurice then sent more reinforcements to Ostend and halted further campaigning for two months. In November he tried to take 's-Hertogenbosch but the onset of a brutal cold winter and the threat of a Spanish relief force under Van den Bergh forced Maurice into winter quarters.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} the <b>stadholder</b> took {{possession}} bestowing the nominal government of the place upon his brother Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. On top of the capture of the town, a vast haul had been captured, including ten galleys which the Spanish had failed to scuttle and fifteen merchant ships {{with most of the}} goods. In addition a large store of munitions, 84 brass and 24 iron guns, were captured as well. The Dutch and English garrisoned the town and subsequently strengthened the place in case of a Spanish counterattack. Losses amongst the Dutch and English were light – Sir John Ogle had lost an eye during the Oostberg battle. Many suffered from disease – Count Louis of Nassau died of fever {{a few days after the}} surrender.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to most other provinces of the Dutch Republic, in 1584 {{at the death}} of William of Orange, the States of Friesland did not confer the stadholderate upon his son Maurice (1567 - 1625). In contrast, they opted for William-Louis (1560 - 1620) out of the junior branch of Nassau-Dillenburg. Notwithstanding the continuous efforts of the Orange Princes to ousted their less prominent Nassau relatives, the province kept its own <b>stadholders</b> until the early eighteenth century. In order to convince the Frisian states to maintain this particularistic tradition, the Nassau branch staged comparatively lavish funeral services for its <b>stadholders,</b> during which {{the virtues of the}} deceased and his lineage were emphasized. Moreover, in these ceremonies the Leeuwarden citizenry participated actively. This strategy turned out to be successful and contributed to the survival of a distinct line of <b>stadholders,</b> even when the institution threatened to disappear in Holland in the 1650 s. These Frisian funeral ceremonies were held in the provincial capital Leeuwarden, where the former Franciscan church was transformed into a mausoleum for the local dynasty. Prints publicized the events well beyond the borders of the province. In this paper, I shall analyse the funeral services four successive Frisian <b>stadholders</b> and I shall compare them to the better known ceremonies for the contemporary Princes of Orange. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|When French {{troops had}} {{approached}} the rivers Rhine and Meuse in November 1794, the Patriots started {{to prepare for}} a revolution and to stockpile weapons. The hiding place was discovered, and Jacobus van Staphorst and Cornelis Rudolphus Theodorus Krayenhoff had to leave the city to avoid being captured. The society in the Kalverstraat was closed down by the police and Wiselius, the president, had to announce the message to its members. In January 1795 Wiselius and Nicolaas van Staphorst were part of the revolutionary committee that occupied the townhall. Wiselius stood before the city government in the nearby townhall on the Dam Square to state that the time had arrived for them to resign. The next morning, the new leaders moved in without much ado and voted Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck as their president. <b>Stadholder</b> William V escaped by boat from the beach near the Hague to England; there were no casualties and it is known as a velvet revolution.|$|E
2500|$|In 1813 the French {{were forced}} out of the Netherlands and the son of the last <b>Stadholder,</b> William VI / I was proclaimed 'Sovereign Prince' (1813–1815). To symbolize his new status he assumed a new coat of arms. In it the old lion with the sword and arrows made his second reappearance, now with a Royal crown upon his head. Again it was placed in de prime {{locations}} of a quartered shield (I and IV quarter). [...] In the II and III quarter where the arms of Châlon-Orange-Geneve, the arms of Nassau (Otto) where placed on an escutcheon {{in the center of the}} shield.|$|E
2500|$|The confederal {{structure}} of the old Dutch Republic was permanently replaced by a unitary state. [...] The 1798 constitution had a genuinely democratic character, though a coup d'état of 1801 put an authoritarian regime in power. Ministerial government was introduced {{for the first time}} in Dutch history and many of the current government departments date their history back to this period. [...] Meanwhile, the exiled <b>stadholder</b> handed over the Dutch colonies in [...] "safekeeping" [...] to Great Britain and ordered the colonial governors to comply. [...] This permanently ended the colonial empire in Guyana, Ceylon and the Cape Colony. The Dutch East Indies was returned to the Netherlands under the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814.|$|E

50|$|In The Hague's Binnenhof on 2 November 1794, Zappa {{played in}} the court's last concert before the <b>stadholder's</b> family abdicated, fleeing to England {{in the face of}} the invading French army, which put an end to the court's music programme.|$|R
50|$|When in 1649 Coques was {{commissioned}} with {{the decoration of}} the Oranjezaal in the Huis ten Bosch, the country house in The Hague of the <b>stadholder’s</b> widow, Amalia von Solms, he organized for his fellow townsmen such as Pieter Thijs, Justus Danneels and Pieter de Witte II to execute the commission.|$|R
2500|$|This severe {{military}} response overwhelmed the Patriots {{and put the}} <b>stadholder</b> firmly back in control. A small unpaid Prussian army was billeted in the Netherlands and supported themselves by looting and extortion. The exercitiegenootschappen continued urging citizens to resist the government. They distributed pamphlets, formed [...] "Patriot Clubs" [...] and held public demonstrations. The government responded by pillaging those towns where opposition continued. Five leaders were sentenced to death (but fled first). Lynchings also occurred. For a while, no one dared appear in public without an orange cockade to show their support for Orangism. Many Patriots, perhaps around 40,000 in all, fled to Brabant, France (especially Dunkirk and St. Omer) and elsewhere. However, before long the French became involved in Dutch politics and the tide turned.|$|E
2500|$|In Voorburg, Spinoza {{continued}} {{work on the}} Ethics and {{corresponded with}} scientists, philosophers, and theologians throughout Europe. He also wrote and published his Theological Political Treatise in 1670, in defence of secular and constitutional government, and in support of Jan de Witt, the Grand Pensionary of the Netherlands, against the <b>Stadholder,</b> the Prince of Orange. Leibniz visited Spinoza and claimed that Spinoza's life was in danger when supporters of the Prince of Orange murdered de Witt in 1672. While published anonymously, the work did not long remain so, and de Witt's enemies characterized it as [...] "forged in Hell by a renegade Jew and the Devil, and issued {{with the knowledge of}} Jan de Witt." [...] It was condemned in 1673 by the Synod of the Reformed Church and formally banned in 1674.|$|E
2500|$|The Wilhelmus {{originated}} in the Dutch Revolt, the nation's struggle to achieve independence from the Spanish Empire. It tells of the Father of the Nation William of Orange who was <b>stadholder</b> in the Netherlands under the king of Spain. In the first person, as if quoting himself, William speaks to the Dutch people about both the revolt and his own, personal struggle: {{to be faithful to}} the king, without being unfaithful to his conscience: to serve God and the Dutch people. In the lyrics William compares himself with the biblical David who serves under the tyrannic king Saul. As the merciful David defeats the unjust Saul and is rewarded by God with the kingdom of Israel, so too William hopes to be rewarded a kingdom. Both the Wilhelmus and the Dutch Revolt should be seen {{in the light of the}} 16th century Reformation in Europe ...|$|E
50|$|The {{third and}} most {{extensive}} part of De la Court's {{work is the}} series of republican and anti-monarchist pamphlets he published in 1662 and 1663. The most well-known are the Historie der gravelike regering in Holland (History of the counts of Holland) and De stadthouderlijcke regeeringe in Hollandt ende West-Vrieslandt (History of the <b>stadholders</b> of Holland and West-Friesland). Both books contain vivid albeit rather one-sided descriptions of the damage {{that had been done}} to the country by monarchical leaders since the Middle Ages.|$|R
50|$|The {{most ambitious}} constructions {{of the period}} {{included}} the seats of self-government in Amsterdam (1646) and Maastricht (1658), designed by Campen and Post, respectively. On the other hand, the residences of the House of Orange are closer to a typical burgher mansion than to a royal palace. Two of these, Huis ten Bosch and Mauritshuis, are symmetrical blocks with large windows, stripped of ostentatious Baroque flourishes and mannerisms. The same austerely geometrical effect is achieved without great cost or pretentious effects at the <b>Stadholder's</b> summer residence of Het Loo.|$|R
5000|$|As an {{independent}} merchant {{he had a}} large share in Baltic trade and reshipped herring, oil and grain. In 1584 he {{became a member of}} the vroedschap, in which he remained until its final session. In 1588 he was chosen as mayor. As a member of the government of Amsterdam, he was delegated to the States of Holland and through them to the States General. Hooft was opposed to the appointment of foreigners to important posts, pointing to the Flemish Calvinists and preachers such as Petrus Plancius. He also resisted the expansion of the <b>stadholder's</b> power.|$|R
2500|$|In 1524, {{nearly a}} century {{before the arrival of}} the Dutch, the site that later became New Amsterdam was named New Angoulême by the Italian {{explorer}} Giovanni da Verrazzano, to commemorate his patron King Francis I of France, former Count of Angoulême. The first recorded exploration by the Dutch of the area around what is now called New York Bay was in 1609 with the voyage of the ship Halve Maen (English: [...] "Half Moon"), captained by Henry Hudson {{in the service of the}} Dutch Republic, as the emissary of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, Holland's <b>stadholder.</b> Hudson named the river the Mauritius River. He was covertly attempting to find the Northwest Passage for the Dutch East India Company. Instead, he brought back news about the possibility of exploitation of beaver by the Dutch who sent commercial, private missions to the area the following years.|$|E
2500|$|Mitchell did {{not fall}} for this ruse, {{probably}} because the two Dutch negotiators were actually the ringleaders of the mutiny. He issued an ultimatum giving Story one hour to defect and join the invasion force with his ships, or face the consequences. Faced with this ultimatum, Story convened a council of war aboard his flagship with all his captains. According to Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Maitland, who {{was present at the}} discussions on board Washington as a British parlimentaire, Van Capellen, De Jong, and Van Braam did their best to influence the council in the direction of accepting the ultimatum. He later asked in a letter to General Dundas that [...] "...the opinions and sentiments expressed by the captains Van Capelle, Van Braam and the [...] Jong generally in the presence of Admiral Story might not become public and those officers thereby endangered. To you in this letter, I apprehend I do right inform you, that above mentioned captains did declare their attachment to the <b>Stadholder</b> and the former government and their disgust at the present government and their French connections...".|$|E
60|$|We {{thought it}} right to pay our respects to the Princess of Orange, but she was keeping very little state. Her husband, the <b>Stadholder,</b> was on bad terms with the States, and had just failed in a great attack on Amsterdam; and both he and she were indisposed. The Princess Royal replied {{therefore}} to our request for admittance, {{that she could not}} refuse to see such old friends of her family as the ladies of Ribaumont, but that we must excuse her for giving us a private reception.|$|E
50|$|This {{painting}} {{was in the}} collection of Albertina Agnes (1634-1696), Princess of Oranje-Nassau, at the Frisian <b>Stadholder’s</b> Court, Leeuwarden, and a century later was appropriated for the national collection from Paleis Het Loo to the museum then in The Hague, 18 September 1798. The appropriation of art from the stadtholder's collection was a tactical move to prevent the abduction of more national treasure to Paris as had happened with the Gallery Prince William V in 1795. The painting has been in the national collection owned by the Rijksmuseum ever since. Since 1948 it has been on loan to the Mauritshuis.|$|R
5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of the [...] "True Freedom" [...] was expounded by political philosophers like the Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt in his [...] "Deduction" [...] and Pieter de la Court in his the Interest van Holland (Interest of Holland) and De stadthouderlijcke regeeringe in Hollandt ende West-Vrieslandt (History of the <b>stadholders</b> of Holland and West-Friesland). In these works the doctrine was extended into a distinctly anti-monarchical and pro-republican direction as a justification for the de facto abolition {{of the office of}} stadtholder in most provinces as [...] "superfluous" [...] and [...] "positively harmful to the general welfare." ...|$|R
50|$|Clotilde is {{the last}} patrilineal {{descendant}} of the House of Nassau, the male line of which ruled the Duchy of Nassau until 1866, provided a 12th-century German king, a line of Princes of Orange who served first as <b>stadholders</b> of the United Dutch Provinces and, from 1815 to 1948, as kings of the Netherlands, and reigned as grand dukes of Luxembourg until 1968. Neither she, however, nor her father or paternal grandfather were deemed full members of the Nassau dynasty, the last member of which, Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg, died in 1985. While Countess Clothilde's branch of the family had legitimate male members until 1965, they had been bypassed for Luxembourg's throne since 1907.|$|R
60|$|For {{some months}} before the assault upon Breda the army of Holland had been gaining vastly in {{strength}} and organization. Prince Maurice, aided by his cousin Lewis William, <b>stadholder</b> of Friesland, had been hard at work getting it {{into a state of}} efficiency. Lewis William, a man of great energy and military talent, saw that the use of solid masses of men in the field was no longer fitted to a state of things when the improvements in firearms of all sorts had entirely changed the condition of war. He therefore reverted to the old Roman methods, and drilled his soldiers in small bodies; teaching them to turn and wheel, advance or retreat, and perform all sorts of manoeuvres with regularity and order. Prince Maurice adopted the same plan in Holland, and the tactics so introduced proved so efficient that they were sooner or later adopted by all civilized nations.|$|E
60|$|In all our vast {{collection}} of States {{there is probably}} not one the title-deeds to which are more incontestable than to this one. We had it by two rights, the right of conquest {{and the right of}} purchase. In 1806 our troops landed, defeated the local forces, and took possession of Cape Town. In 1814 we paid the large sum of six million pounds to the <b>Stadholder</b> for the transference of this and some South American land. It was a bargain which was probably made rapidly and carelessly in that general redistribution which was going on. As a house of call upon the way to India the place was seen to be of value, but the country itself was looked upon as unprofitable and desert. What would Castlereagh or Liverpool have thought could they have seen the items which we were buying for our six million pounds? The inventory would have been a mixed one of good and of evil; nine fierce Kaffir wars, the greatest diamond mines in the world, the wealthiest gold mines, two costly and humiliating campaigns with men whom we respected even when we fought with them, and now at last, we hope, a South Africa of peace and prosperity, with equal rights and equal duties for all men. The future should hold something very good for us in that land, for if we merely count the past we should be compelled to say that we should have been stronger, richer, and higher in the world's esteem had our possessions there never passed beyond the range of the guns of our men-of-war. But surely the most arduous is the most honourable, and, looking back from the end of their journey, our descendants may see that our long record of struggle, with its mixture of disaster and success, its outpouring of blood and of treasure, has always tended to some great and enduring goal.|$|E

40|$|Revised {{papers of}} the conference {{organized}} by the Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio, Vicenza. It is our contention that the “problem” of Palladio’s so-called success in the Northern part of the former Burgundian federation (the Seven Provinces, ruled by the house of Orange as <b>stadholders</b> of the Republic) and his lack thereof in the Southern part (the remaining Ten, under Spanish Habsburg rule) stems from the nineteenth and twentieth-century reading of the evidence. The wide-spread success of Palladio’s models throughout {{the world in the}} late eighteenth century (and this does include at the time the Southern Netherlands, albeit mediated by French and English Palladianist examples) has profoundly coloured scholarly thought on his “afterlife”. status: publishe...|$|R

After this, in 1689, Jeronimo Clifford hit difficulties with governor Johan van Scharphuizen, causing bad blood {{and years of}} court proceedings undertaken by Jeronimo that 60 years later finally had to be arbitrated by the English. In 1689 Jeronimo was imprisoned in , then in 1692 he was condemned to be hanged, though this was commuted to seven years' imprisonment. Clifford was even allowed to build his own house {{within the walls of}} the prison.

50|$|Potter {{became a}} member of the Guild of Saint Luke in Delft, but by 1649, Paulus moved to The Hague, next to Jan van Goyen. Potter married in the Hague and his father-in-law, who was the leading {{building}} contractor in the Hague, introduced him to the Dutch elite. Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, a member of the <b>stadholder's</b> family and an art-lover, bought a painting with a pissing cow, but some court ladies seemed to have advised against it. By May 1652, after a case about delivering a new painting, he returned to Amsterdam. Potter was invited by Nicolaes Tulp, who was impressed by his civilized behavior and politeness. Potter painted his son Dirck Tulp, but only changed the face on an earlier work he was not able to sell. Potter died in Amsterdam.|$|R
