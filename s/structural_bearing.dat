They also transmit the external forces, acting on the superstructure, to the foundation. In the past years the traffic loads and intensity on the European traffic system has continuously increased.

The bearings are however not tested with the forces, translations and rotations which occur in practice. To make a critical judgement regarding these standards, the wear behaviour of a large arch bridge, the first Van Brienenoord Bridge, is analysed. The analysis is performed by means of a linear elastic, finite element model. The bridge model is then subjected to a modified fatigue load model based on the European standards for traffic loads NEN-EN 1991 - 2 and traffic measurements at the Moerdijk Bridge. Translations and rotation were consequently found along with the simultaneously occurring reaction forces.

40|$|A {{three year}} {{research}} programme has recently started in Sweden, aiming at improving the mutual {{connection between the}} perceived sound, vibration and springiness and their corresponding measured values in lightweight structures. The main goal is to describe new objective measures of assessing the acoustic quality, with the expected result that the experienced sound, vibration and springiness are not dependent of <b>structural</b> <b>bearing</b> system in the building any more. The consequence of new methods will be that various structural systems within one certain sound class in a classification scheme will provide fairly equal evaluation with regard to subjective response. The research programme, Aku- Lite, is divided into seven work packages (WP). Initial results from one work package (WP 4), related to current subjective and objective field data are presented in this paper. The aim of topical {{part of the study}} is to investigate the liability of measurements results and evaluation procedure when those are carried out in accordance to ISO 140 and ISO 717. It involves an initial inventory and analysis from objective measurements, according to ISO 140, performed on light weight structures on the field by various consultants in Sweden. The study considers principal problems with current standards, affecting each operator performing field measurements in light weight structures and thereby impacting the final result quality. Typically, the measured sound pressure level and the reverberation time differ a lot in low frequencies, compared to heavy structures. The measurement result (distribution) between various measurement positions is rather random in the low frequency region, i. e. there is no typical pattern for light weight structures in general. The complexity of different light weight <b>structural</b> <b>bearing</b> systems and their sensitivity in the low frequency range requires a more rigid description of the measurement and evaluation procedure. The lack of objective sound and vibration data below 50 Hz is also a problem since subjective disturbance often emanates from this frequency range. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|Equipment and {{components}} {{made of plastics}} and composites are widely used in highly corrosive environments in the processing industry. Examples are the storage tanks, pumps and pipes for chemical transport and stacks in combustion plants. The demand for reliable nondestructive testing of plastic process equipment has increased significantly in recent years. Glass fiber reinforced plastics (GRP) is a common construction material for process equipment in the chemical industry. It can be used both as <b>structural</b> <b>bearing</b> in a dual laminate with a thermoplastic material as a corrosion barrier or as a solid GRP. In the latter case, the laminate is generally built up with a resin rich corrosion barrier (about 2. 5 to 5 mm thick) with a low content of glass closest to the chemical. The glass fiber in this layer is usually a surface veil and chopped strand mats (CSM), i. e. it has no general fiber orientation. Outside this is the <b>structural</b> <b>bearing</b> layer with much higher glass content, usually wound fiber and / or woven fiber mats with a preferential fiber direction. The corrosion barrier is not load bearing and corrosion of this layer can be allowed. However, no corrosion can be permitted in the structural support layer. Because of this {{it is important to}} measure the thickness of the corrosion barrier for quality control but also to determine how far an attack has reached in the corrosion barrier. Today there is no non-destructive testing method that can answer this. Instead destructive sampling (often a drill core) must be made. This is difficult, expensive and sometimes impossible. There is thus a great interest in a method that, preferably at any time during operation, can provide answers to these questions. Due to the heterogeneity of the GRP material in terms of amount, type and direction of the fibers, conventional algorithm for ultrasound imaging will not work. One aim of our work is thus to develop new signal processing methods to handle this heterogeneity. In addition we are also looking at the possibility to use optical fibers and Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors for corrosion monitoring of GRP structure...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Satisfactory {{performance}} of the transverse joints is crucial for achieving the intended service life of jointed plain concrete pavement. An accurate prediction of joint opening and movement is desired in order to quantify {{the effects of the}} environment, base type, concrete material constituents, and slab geometry on the concrete pavement responses. In this paper, an analytical model based on elasticity theory is presented to predict joint opening using a bilinear slab-subbase interfacial constraint assumption. The proposed model predicts the mean joint opening based on uniform temperature change and drying shrinkage through the slab thickness. To account for the temperature curling effect, a “correction ” term to the joint opening is proposed using a closed-form solution derived from Westergaard’s temperature curling deflection equation. Initial model calculation using in-situ measured pavement temperature profile suggests that proposed analytical model generates reasonable joint opening during the Performance of the transverse joints is crucial for achieving the intended service life of jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP).

However, the material can suffer from loss of mechanical durability {{as a result of}} an attack of the media. In order to protect the <b>structural</b> <b>bearing</b> laminate, the composites are segmented in different levels, the structural layer and the corrosion barrier layer, each containing a higher or lower percentage of glass fibre and thereby holds varying durability towards chemical attacks. This work applies the total focusing method, a delay-and-sum beamformer technique based on the full matrix capture, a routine that provides a complete set of time series from an array. Glass fibre-reinforced composites have directional dependent properties and high attenuation, complicating the modelling of ultrasonic propagation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Natural rubber distinguishes {{itself by}} its {{particular}} mechanical properties. It {{has become an}} al-most irreplaceable important component part in industrial applications such as vibration isolator, sealing system, flexible piping or <b>structural</b> <b>bearing.</b> During the service, these components are subjected to fluctuating mechan-ical loading. Under cyclic loading conditions, rubber exhibits strong inelastic responses such as stress-softening due to Mullins effect. It is believed that such inelastic response plays major {{role in determining the}} durability in service of rubber component. In engineering applications where the components are concurrently exposed to aggressive solvent, further material degradation in the form of swelling occurs. Thus, it is essential to inves-tigate the effect of swelling on the stress-softening due to Mullins effect in rubber like materials for durability analysis. In this study, the Mullins effect in swollen carbon black-filled natural rubber under cyclic loading con-ditions is investigated. The swollen rubbers are obtained by immersing initially dry rubber in solvent at room temperature for various immersion durations. The stress-strain responses for both dry and swollen rubber are found qualitatively similar. However, the stress-softening in swollen rubbers are notably lower compared to that in the dry one.

40|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} and {{effective}} numerical approach is presented {{on the basis of}} the Member Discrete Element Method (MDEM) to investigate static and dynamic responses of steel frames with semi-rigid joints. In the MDEM, structures are discretized into a set of finite rigid particles. The motion equation of each particle is solved by the central difference method and two adjacent arbitrarily particles are connected by the contact constitutive model. The above characteristics means that the MDEM is able to naturally handle structural geometric nonlinearity and fracture. Meanwhile, the computational framework of static analysis is consistent with that of dynamic analysis, except the determination of damping. A virtual spring element with two particles but without actual mass and length is used to simulate the mechanical behaviors of semi-rigid joints. The spring element is not directly involved in the calculation, but is employed only to modify the stiffness coefficients of contact elements at the semi-rigid connections. Based on the above-mentioned concept, the modified formula of the contact element stiffness with consideration of semi-rigid connections is deduced. The Richard-Abbort four-parameter model and independent hardening model are further introduced accordingly to accurately capture the nonlinearity and hysteresis performance of semi-rigid connections. Finally, the numerical approach proposed is verified by complex behaviors of steel frames with semi-rigid connections such as geometric nonlinearity, snap-through buckling, dynamic responses and fracture. The comparison of static and dynamic responses obtained using the modified MDEM and those of the published studies illustrates that the modified MDEM can simulate the mechanical behaviors of semi-rigid connections simply and directly, and can accurately effectively capture the linear and nonlinear behaviors of semi-rigid connections under static and dynamic loading. Some conclusions, as expected, are drawn that <b>structural</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity under static loading will be overestimated if semi-rigid connections are ignored; when the frequency of dynamic load applied is close to structural fundamental frequency, hysteresis damping of nonlinear semi-rigid connections can cause energy dissipation compared to rigid and linear semi-rigid connections, thus avoiding the occurrence of resonance.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The mid-way {{station of}} a {{chairlift}} {{located in the}} ski resort Grächen (Swiss Alps) was originally built in 1997 at 2453 m ASL in alpine permafrost terrain. A few months after construction it became evident that the terrain at the mid-way station was unstable: settlement and creep occurred and cracks formed in the structure. Two 25 m boreholes were drilled near the foundations and equipped with inclinometer tubes and thermistors. The presence of permafrost with exceptionally large active layer depths and a 20 m thick talik containing water was confirmed. The deformation rates of the ground attained high values between 2002 and 2003. As a consequence, a specially developed new mid-way station had {{to be built in}} 2003. The excavation trench was lined with insulating material in order to avoid thermal disturbance of the underlying permafrost during the setting of the concrete. The new foundation consists of a concrete T-girder with three point bearings. Repositioning of the entire structure in response to creep is possible, due to the unique character of the <b>structural</b> <b>bearings</b> which can be raised or lowered using hydraulic cylinders and steel plates. Ground temperatures and slope deformation continue to be monitored to determine the long term evolution of the mid-way station...|$|R
