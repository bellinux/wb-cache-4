5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Akkadian Empire, Hurrians began to settle in the city and its <b>surroundings,</b> <b>and</b> by c. 1725 BC they {{constituted}} a sizable portion of the population. The presence of a large Hurrian population brought Hurrian culture and religion to Halab, as evidenced by the existence of certain religious festivals that bear Hurrian names.|$|E

5|$|Dominican {{folk music}} is an oral tradition, learned informally through {{watching}} others perform. As of 1987, most performers of traditional music were either over 50 {{years old or}} under 35, which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions. Music is evaluated based on both characteristics of the music, such as complex syncopated rhythms, {{as well as social}} factors, such as the ability of the performers to improvise and respond to their <b>surroundings</b> <b>and</b> to keep the audience excited and participating in the music.|$|E

5|$|During heavy rains, it {{was much}} more {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, were able to flee into the bush (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the <b>surroundings</b> <b>and</b> local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{continued}} to publish with Warnes, and, in August 1905, used sales profits {{and a small}} legacy from an aunt to buy Hill Top, a working farm of 34 acres (13.85ha) at Sawrey in the Lake District.

5|$|The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, {{which include}} reality {{orientation}} and cognitive retraining, is {{the reduction of}} cognitive deficits. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person to ease {{the understanding of the}} person about its <b>surroundings</b> <b>and</b> his or her place in them. On the other hand, cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities, although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.|$|E

5|$|The {{perceived}} {{shortcomings of}} the mass housing movement led to efforts to create cost-effective housing solutions that were more varied, more integrated with natural <b>surroundings,</b> <b>and</b> above all more customized to families' needs. In 1973, the Parliament of Norway recommended a shift toward small residential houses rather than large apartment buildings. The Norwegian State Housing Bank (Husbanken) provided citizens {{with the ability to}} fund construction of their homes, and an entire construction industry formed to build these needs.|$|E
5|$|From 1898 to 1909, {{architect}} Frank Lloyd Wright {{lived and}} worked out of his home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909. They met up in Florence, Italy, in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by Michelozzo's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its <b>surroundings,</b> <b>and</b> featured gardens on two levels.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Otto {{produced}} days of torrential rain {{over much}} of the northeastern Caribbean in October2010. Otto originated as a subtropical cyclone lingering north of Puerto Rico on October6, and transitioned into a tropical storm the next day, the fifteenth of the 2010 hurricane season. Accelerating toward the northeast, Otto strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale on October8, attaining peak winds of 85mph (140km/h). The storm began weakening due to incompatible <b>surroundings</b> <b>and</b> became extratropical west of the Azores on October10. Otto was the first Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to transition from a subtropical storm since Tropical Storm Laura in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Most {{microorganisms}} {{and plants}} can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids, while animals (including humans) must obtain {{some of the}} amino acids from the diet. The amino acids that an organism cannot synthesize on its own {{are referred to as}} essential amino acids. Key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals — such as aspartokinase, which catalyses {{the first step in the}} synthesis of lysine, methionine, and threonine from aspartate. If amino acids are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino acids from their <b>surroundings</b> <b>and</b> downregulating their biosynthetic pathways.|$|E
5|$|Newspaper {{publishing}} in Mysore {{started in}} 1859 when Bhashyam Bhashyacharya began publishing a weekly newspaper in Kannada called the Mysooru Vrittanta Bodhini, {{the first of}} a number of weekly newspapers published in the following three decades. A well-known Mysore publisher during Wodeyar rule was M. Venkatakrishnaiah, known as the father of Kannada journalism, who started several news magazines. Many local newspapers are published in Mysore and carry news mostly related to the city and its <b>surroundings,</b> <b>and</b> national and regional dailies in English and Kannada are available, as in the other parts of the state. Sudharma, the only Indian daily newspaper in Sanskrit, is published in Mysore.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{stated that}} the caste system in south India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked {{with the arrival of}} Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a {{different}} stratification of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural <b>surroundings</b> <b>and</b> adequate means of living. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.|$|E

30|$|Urban space {{consists}} of built-up areas that include variety of land uses in commercial, institutional and residential areas. It also {{consists of}} non-built {{area that is}} mostly dominated by greenery and open spaces (Moroney and Jones, 2006; Tzoulas et al. 2007; Mansor et al. 2010). Previous researches (Kong and Nakagoshi 2006; Phan and Nakagoshi 2007; Byomkesh et al. 2012) indicated that urban green spaces are those lands that are covered with natural or man-made vegetation but are present in built-up areas. However, the universally agreed definition is still arguable. Most developed countries have their own definition (Byomkesh et al. 2012). Therefore this research used as its working definition stated by the Ethiopian Ministry of Urban Development and Housing (MoUDH): green infrastructure typologies to include parks, sports fields, roadside and squares, plazas and festive areas, river and riverside areas, lakes and lakeside areas, watershed areas, urban agriculture development, woodlots and green belts (inside and surrounding forests), private compounds <b>and</b> <b>surroundings,</b> institutional compounds <b>and</b> <b>surroundings</b> (both governmental <b>and</b> non-governmental), communal housing compounds <b>and</b> <b>surroundings</b> (condominiums, real estate, etc.), religious institutions compounds <b>and</b> <b>surroundings,</b> neighborhood open spaces, cemeteries, nursery sites, and green roofs and walls (MoUDH 2015).|$|R

5|$|Quadrophenia was revived for a {{film version}} in 1979, {{directed}} by Franc Roddam. The film attempted to portray an accurate visual interpretation of Townshend's vision of Jimmy and his <b>surroundings,</b> <b>and</b> included Phil Daniels as Jimmy and Sting as the Ace Face. Unlike the Tommy film, the music was largely relegated to the background, and was not performed by the cast as in a rock opera. The film soundtrack included three additional songs written by Townshend, which were Kenney Jones' first recordings as an official member of the Who. The film was a commercial and critical success, as it conveniently coincided with the mod revival movement of the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS's two screens {{act as one}} tall screen; however, in practice, this {{essentially}} {{just gives}} the player {{a better view of}} the <b>surroundings</b> <b>and,</b> save for one boss battle, (Hector the Reflector, where the bottom screen acts as a mirror through which to see Hector during the battle) only provides the benefit of being able to see more (above) and, when the player is on the top screen, below. The game does not make use of the bottom screen's touch sensitivity for basic gameplay, though it is an option for selecting levels and in some mini-games. Each of DSs five worlds has two bosses, each with a weakness that must be identified and exploited. Most of the time, these are simply giant-sized versions of normal enemies, though some are more inventive.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} hunts by flying slowly, {{quartering}} {{the ground and}} hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its <b>surroundings,</b> <b>and</b> this is the main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it {{a wide spread of}} talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce.|$|E

5|$|There {{are seven}} {{recognized}} subspecies across {{the range of}} these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance. The birds are generally inconspicuous, avoiding the open for extended periods of time. When out in the open, they investigate their <b>surroundings</b> <b>and</b> are rarely stationary. After finding a mate, pairs maintain a territory and stay together for several years. Both sexes give out alarm calls, but only males sing to advertise territory. Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season, but can fall victim to brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, among other species. Some populations {{have been affected by}} mercury contamination.|$|E
