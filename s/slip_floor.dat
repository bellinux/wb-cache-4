40|$|High speed trains {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of the transportation systems around the world. With increasing speed, very high velocities are generated in the region around the train known as slipstream. Experimental studies have been conducted over the last few decades to study the effect of these phenomena. Slipstream velocities have been measured using anemometers placed near real trains running on the tracks and model trains running on rigs like moving model rig and rotating rail rig. However, most of these studies are quite expensive to conduct. The purpose of this thesis is to find an alternative way to measure the slipstream. Detached Eddy Simulation is used to simulate the flow around a 1 : 15 scaled model of an ETR 500 high speed train with different configurations similar to tests conducted on the track and in the wind tunnel. The results from the simulations are compared with the data obtained from experimental tests conducted on the Torino-Novara high speed line. A wind tunnel test is also carried out to validate the CFD data. It is concluded from the results that the wind tunnel setup with a <b>slip</b> <b>floor</b> in front of the train can be used to find out if the train produces slipstream velocities that are within the limits indicated by the TSI standards...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} certain {{characteristics of the}} occurrence of occupational back injury among nursing staff, all workers affected {{during a period of}} six months were interviewed. These individuals were 43. 2 years old on average and were basically female. There was no statistical significative difference showing a predominance among working turns and among the different nursing ranks involved in the accident. Most of the accidents happened within the hospital unit while they were moving or transporting patients and equipment, because of falls due to <b>slipping</b> <b>floor.</b> The most affected regions of the spinal column were the lumbar and cervical portions. The majority of the subjects affirmed that they had some type of back problem...|$|R
50|$|<b>Floor</b> <b>slip</b> {{resistance}} {{testing is}} {{the science of}} measuring the coefficient of friction (or resistance to <b>slip</b> accidents) of <b>flooring</b> surfaces, either in a laboratory (before or after installation) or on <b>floors</b> in situ. <b>Slip</b> resistance testing (or floor friction testing) is usually desired by the building's owner or manager when {{there has been a}} report of a slip and fall accident, when there has been a report of a near accident, or (preferably) before the flooring is installed on the property. Flooring is tested using a tribometer (<b>floor</b> <b>slip</b> resistance tester) to discover if there is a high propensity for slip and fall accidents on it, either dry and/or (most often) when wet with water or lubricated with other contaminants such as kitchen grease, hydraulic oil, etc. There have been numerous <b>floor</b> <b>slip</b> resistance testing tribometers and lab devices produced around the world to measure both the static (stationary) and dynamic (in motion) coefficient of friction, but presently {{there are only a few}} that have been proven to be reliable for obtaining useful safety results and that have current official test methods.|$|R

50|$|To {{assess a}} <b>floor's</b> <b>slip</b> resistance, a reliable, {{thoroughly}} researched (in interlaboratory studies) floor friction test method must be used, {{and then a}} minimum safety criterion (0.43, 0.60, 36, etc.) is needed {{to apply to the}} results. If the floor is likely to be lubricated with water or grease in use, it needs to be anti-slip under these expected conditions. <b>Floor</b> <b>slip</b> resistance testing can be carried out dry, wet with water, or lubricated with oils and other contaminants. Dry slip resistance is not an indicator of wet slip resistance — in fact the two often vary inversely — so reliable wet slip resistance testing is often needed as well as reliable dry testing.|$|R

40|$|Hoof {{abrasion}} and <b>slips</b> on <b>floors</b> {{are known}} to have negative effects on animal health and welfare. This paper describes a new design of test rig for use in a universal materials test machine. The rig enables the frictional and abrasion-resisting properties of hoof horn to be investigated under controlled conditions, in vitro. To assess the performance of the rig, pilot experiments were carried out which indicated both test surface roughness and specimen hydration interact to alter frictional coefficient and mechanical work done to lose a unit volume of hoof material by abrasive wear...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Falling {{accidents}} {{caused by}} slipping represent {{a high proportion}} of all accidents and are cost intensive in industry {{as well as in the}} private sphere. To prevent such accidents, the <b>slip</b> resistance of <b>flooring</b> must be evaluated. Therefore, measurement methods are necessary. These methods must provide results that comply with an individual’s perception of when a floor is slippery. This article describes the analysis of human walking motion to derive essential parameters and estimate their values for measuring the <b>slip</b> resistance of <b>flooring.</b> Human walking motion of 22 persons is analysed to discover the critical phases for slipping. The heel strike was extracted as the critical phase for falling accidents caused by slipping. A model of the friction between the shoe and flooring is set up to describe the conditions in that phase. Heel strike velocity, requirements quotient and contact pressure are extracted as essential parameters from the friction model. With the biomechanical gait analyses of the walking of more than 170 single steps made by 22 test persons, values for these parameters are derived. Suggestions are made to adopt these values as test parameters for slip resistance test devices...|$|R
5000|$|In some cases, {{analogous}} to the variable-angle ramp test-related standards mentioned above, the SSR safetystandards are situation-specific rather than “one size fits all.” Thus a minimum pre-abrasion wet PTV of 35 might be required for hotel or hospital bathroom floors; a minimum of 45 (hard rubber slider) for stair nosings that get wet in use; and 54 (hard slider) for commercial kitchens and steep outdoor ramps. If the flooring is to be sealed after installation, the laboratory tests should be conducted with the correct sealer applied. Cleanability tests with expected contaminants (local mud, coffee, red wine, ketchup, etc.) by owners and/or other duty holders are also advisable before final selection of flooring. The methods ofcleaning should be planned. (A dirty mop with dirty water might not be adequate for <b>slip</b> resistant <b>flooring,</b> but abrasive pads can destroy wet slip resistance quickly.) ...|$|R
50|$|Because of its timing, {{the slip}} jig {{is longer than}} the reel for {{the same number of}} bars of music. In Irish stepdance competition, the tempo of 113 beats per minute is the same as other dances, but as each bar is longer, instead of dancing to 48 bars of music the dancer is only {{required}} to dance 40 bars of music (each of 2 steps). Stepdance judges prefer sliding motions with the feet and graceful movements that seem to <b>slip</b> across the <b>floor.</b>|$|R
60|$|Anne was {{curled up}} Turk-fashion on the hearthrug, gazing into that joyous glow where the {{sunshine}} {{of a hundred}} summers was being distilled from the maple cordwood.

30|$|Some coal {{measures}} rocks such as shale, mudstone, and siltstone show an excessive slaking behavior {{leading to a}} severe deterioration of their mechanical properties.

Therefore, {{in order to discuss}} a suitable highwall mining design in Indonesia, a series of laboratory tests and numerical analysis were conducted in this research.|$|R
60|$|One of the {{sleepers}} moved. He {{opened his}} eyes. Stealthily he raised {{himself on his}} elbow and gazed at the other across the apartment. He listened intently. The regular breathing of the sleeper proclaimed the soundness of his slumber. Gingerly the man placed one foot upon the floor. The eye glued to the crack {{at the edge of}} the great, gilt frame of the Blentz princess remained fastened upon him. He let his other foot <b>slip</b> to the <b>floor</b> beside the first. Carefully he raised himself until he stood erect upon the floor. Then, on tiptoe he started across the room.|$|R
