500|$|Meanwhile, at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{is shocked}} when NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gets more laughs {{than he does}} in the elevator, {{compelling}} {{him to go to}} Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) for help. The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> to Jenna and in retaliation, she starts singing [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings", prompting Kenneth to start singing [...] "99 Bottles of Beer", to which everyone in the elevator joins in. As revenge for upstaging them, Tracy and Jenna start doing his page duties which confuses Kenneth. After Tracy explains what Kenneth was doing, Kenneth feels terrible about it and swears never to upstage them again.|$|E

500|$|Most of the episode's plot, namely a {{group of}} {{children}} trapped on an island and the breakdown of law, order and civility, is a reference to William Golding's 1954 novel Lord of the Flies. The title comes from the 1981 film Das Boot, although it would be [...] "" [...] in German. When the children are squabbling in the classroom, Principal Skinner restores order by banging his shoe on the desk. Skinner's actions are a reference to the shoe-banging incident by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev at the UN in 1960. When escaping from the other children, Bart, Lisa and Milhouse have to swing across a gap on a vine; Milhouse goes across first, but refuses to throw the vine back in a reference to the opening scene of the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, where the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> to Indiana Jones.|$|E
500|$|Following {{its home}} video release, [...] "Brawl in the Family" [...] {{received}} negative reviews from critics. Aaron Peck of High-Def Digest criticized the episode for being unoriginal, writing [...] "Homer is always {{doing something that}} jeopardizes his marriage to Marge. When Homer's 'Vegas Wife' shows up unexpectedly [...] the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens.</b> This is a storyline that has worn out its welcome, but it still continues." [...] 411Mania's Ron Martin described the episode as having a [...] "ridiculous set up". Andre Dellamorte of Collider thought negatively of the episode as well, calling it [...] "Mannered {{to the point of}} ridiculousness." [...] While he didn't consider it the worst episode he's ever seen, he criticized the episode's pacing and lack of satire, writing [...] "it’s just that the plates spin so fast and so pointlessly that it becomes just about the gags. [...] the satire is gone; it’s just incident after incident to set up gags (some of which are funny) and get the show to an end time." ...|$|E

2500|$|This last {{integral}} , since f(2n+1) is {{the null}} function (because f is a polynomial function whose degree is2n). Since each function f(k) (with [...] ) takes integer values on 0 and on [...] (see Claim1 from Niven's proof) {{and since the}} <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> with the sine and the cosine functions, this proves that A'n(b) is an integer. Since it is also greater than0, {{it must be a}} natural number. But it was also proved that An(b)<nbsp&1 if n is large enough, thereby reaching a contradiction.|$|E
2500|$|I {{can speak}} {{endlessly}} of myself, to myself or to someone else, without ever succeeding in giving {{a complete and}} truthful picture of myself... The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> with all these {{people who come to}} see me, and take so much trouble over their efforts to describe themselves to me with strict accuracy; inevitably I form an image of them which derives as much from myself as from them. [...] If they go and see one of my colleagues he will certainly not see them exactly as I do. And they for their part will not show themselves to him in the same way they show themselves to me.|$|E
2500|$|In QCD the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> with virtual quark-antiquark pairs; {{they tend}} to screen the color charge. [...] However, QCD has an {{additional}} wrinkle: its force-carrying particles, the gluons, themselves carry color charge, and in a different manner. [...] Each gluon carries both a color charge and an anti-color magnetic moment. [...] The net effect of polarization of virtual gluons in the vacuum is not to screen the field, but to augment it and change its color. [...] This is sometimes called antiscreening. [...] Getting closer to a quark diminishes the antiscreening effect of the surrounding virtual gluons, so the contribution of this effect would be to weaken the effective charge with decreasing distance.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, the Veterans Committee was {{reformed}} {{to comprise}} the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees. The revamped Committee held three election, in 2003 and 2007, for both players and non-players, and in 2005 for players only. No individual {{was elected in}} that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members, {{most of whom were}} Hall members, were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt noted, [...] "The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors." [...] In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.|$|E
60|$|This is {{manifest}} by {{the ninth}} and tenth Experiments: For {{in the ninth}} Experiment, by turning the Prism about its Axis, until the Rays within it which in going out into the Air were refracted by its Base, became so oblique to that Base, as to begin to be totally reflected thereby; those Rays became first of all totally reflected, which before at equal Incidences with the rest had suffered the greatest Refraction. And the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> in the Reflexion made by the common Base of the two Prisms in the tenth Experiment.|$|E
60|$|And if {{two pieces}} of Island Crystal be placed one after another, in such manner that all the Surfaces of the latter be {{parallel}} to all the corresponding Surfaces of the former: The Rays which are refracted after the usual manner in the first Surface of the first Crystal, shall be refracted after the usual manner in all the following Surfaces; and the Rays which are refracted after the unusual manner in the first Surface, shall be refracted after the unusual manner in all the following Surfaces. And the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens,</b> though the Surfaces of the Crystals be any ways inclined to one another, provided that their Planes of perpendicular Refraction be parallel to one another.|$|E

60|$|Or again: Suppose we are {{comparing}} two {{shades of}} colour, one blue and one green. We {{can be quite}} sure they are different shades of colour; but if the green colour is gradually altered to {{be more and more}} like the blue, becoming first a blue-green, then a greeny-blue, then blue, there will come a moment when we are doubtful whether we can see any difference, and then a moment when we know that we cannot see any difference. The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> in tuning a musical instrument, or in any other case where there is a continuous gradation. Thus self-evidence of this sort is a matter of degree; and it seems plain that the higher degrees are more to be trusted than the lower degrees.|$|E
6000|$|In all our {{knowledge}} of general principles, what actually happens is that first of all we realize some particular application of the principle, and then we realize that the particularity is irrelevant, {{and that there is}} a generality which may equally truly be affirmed. This is of course familiar in such matters as teaching arithmetic: 'two and two are four' is first learnt in the case of some particular pair of couples, and then in some other particular case, and so on, until at last it becomes possible to see that it is true of any pair of couples. The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> with logical principles. Suppose two men are discussing what day of the month it is. One of them says, 'At least you will admit that if yesterday was the 15th to-day must be the 16th.' 'Yes', says the other, 'I admit that.' 'And you know', the first continues, 'that yesterday was the 15th, because you dined with Jones, and your diary will tell you that was on the 15th.' 'Yes', says the second; 'therefore to-day is the 16th.' ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the whole}} series of these phenomena, from the {{beneficial}} effects of the crossing of different stocks and the evil effects of close interbreeding, up to the partial or complete sterility induced by crosses between species belonging to different genera, we have, as Mr. Darwin points out, a curious parallelism with the effects produced by change of physical conditions. It {{is well known that}} slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all living things. Plants, if constantly grown in one soil and locality from their own seeds, are greatly benefited by the importation of seed from some other locality. The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> with animals; and the benefit we ourselves experience from [...] "change of air" [...] is an illustration of the same phenomenon. But the amount of the change which is beneficial has its limits, and then a greater amount is injurious. A change to a climate a few degrees warmer or colder may be good, while a change to the tropics or to the arctic regions might be injurious.|$|E

60|$|Now, desert plants would {{naturally}} retain this primitive {{tendency in}} a very high degree; for they are specially organized to resist drought--being the survivors of generations of drought-proof ancestors--and, like the camel, they have often to struggle on through {{long periods of time}} without a drop of water. Exactly the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> at home to many of our pretty little European stone-crops. I have a rockery near my house overgrown with the little white sedum of our gardens. The birds often peck off a tiny leaf or branch; it drops on the dry soil, and remains there for days without giving a sign of life. But its thick epidermis effectually saves it from withering; and as soon as rain falls, wee white rootlets sprout out from the under side of the fragment as it lies, and it grows before long into a fresh small sedum plant. Thus, what seem like destructive agencies themselves, are turned in the end by mere tenacity of life into a secondary means of propagation.|$|E
60|$|You make us out, my dear Mr. Martin, {{to be such}} perfect {{parallel}} lines that I should be half afraid of completing the definition by our never meeting, {{if it were not}} for what you say afterwards, of the coming to London, and of promising to come and see Flush. If you should be travelling while I am writing, it was only what happened to me when I wrote not long ago to dearest Mrs. Martin, and everybody in this house cried out against the fatuity of the coincidence. As if I could know that she was travelling, when nobody told me, and I wasn't a witch! If the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> to-day, believe in the innocence of my ignorance. I shall be consoled if it does--for certain reasons. But for none in the world can I help thanking you for your letter, which gave me so much pleasure from the first sight of the handwriting to the thought of the kindness spent upon me in it, that after all I cannot thank you as I would.|$|E
60|$|Exactly the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> to {{professional}} men. Probably {{a majority of}} journalists are engaged in writing for newspapers whose politics they disagree with; only a man of wealth can own a large newspaper, and only an accident can enable {{the point of view}} or the interests of those who are not wealthy to find expression in a newspaper. A large part of the best brains of the country are in the civil service, where the condition of their employment is silence about the evils which cannot be concealed from them. A Nonconformist minister loses his livelihood if his views displease his congregation; a member of Parliament loses his seat if he is not sufficiently supple or sufficiently stupid to follow or share all the turns and twists of public opinion. In every walk of life, independence of mind is punished by failure, more and more as economic organizations grow larger and more rigid. Is it surprising that men become increasingly docile, increasingly ready to submit to dictation and to forego the right of thinking for themselves? Yet along such lines civilization can only sink into a Byzantine immobility.|$|E
