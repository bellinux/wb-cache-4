40|$|Workers {{with long}} term {{exposure}} to mixtures of organic solvents below regulatory limits {{have been reported}} to experience mild, but clinically detectable, sensory or <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>polyneuropathies.</b> In conjuction with a cross sectional study of behavioural performance a clinical neurological evaluation was conducted among printers and spray painters to examine dose response relations. All 240 subjects completed an occupational history and symptom questionnaire and underwent a clinical neurological examination. On average, subjects had been employed on their current job for six years. Classification of solvent exposure for each subject was based on exposed versus non-exposed job titles and observations during an industrial hygiene walk-through or on the measured concentration of solvents in full shift personal air samples. The average full shift solvent concentration was 302 ppm for printing plant workers and 6 - 13 ppm for workers at other plants. Isopropanol and hexane were the major constituents. Neurological abnormalities consistent with mild polyneuropathy were found in 16 % of subjects; none was clinically significant. Exposed/non-exposed comparisons showed slightly higher frequency of symptoms in the exposed subjects which was not related to solvent level. Subjects categorised as exposed during the walk- through survey also had poorer vibratory sensation measured at the foot and diminished ankle reflexes. In multiple linear regression models, however, controlling for age, sex, alcohol intake, and examiner, no significant (p less than 0. 05) relation was found between solvent concentration and poor neurological function except for two point discrimination measured at the foot.

40|$|Introduction. Paraneoplastic choreo-athetoses are rare. We {{report a}} case of anti-Hu {{syndrome}} with choreoathetosis. Case report. A 48 -year-old woman developed a small-cell lung carcinoma revealed by an anti-Hu syndrome. The neurological features included choreo-athetosis predominating in the upper limbs, chronic <b>sensorimotor</b> axonal <b>polyneuropathy,</b> and opsoclonus. The cerebrospinal fluid was acellular and contained several oligoclonal IgG bands, {{not found in the}} corresponding serum. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral high-intensity lesions on T 2 /FLAIR sequence in the corona radiata. Moderate transitory improvement of the paraneoplastic neurological syndrome was observed after several carboplatin-etoposid cycles. Conclusion. A paraneoplastic origin must be considered in all cases of unexplained choreo-athetosis. Paraneoplastic choreo-athetosis is most often associated with other neurological symptoms. The most frequent associated tumor is a small-cell lung carcinoma with anti-CRMP 5 and/or anti-Hu antibodies. Our patient developed paraneoplastic choreo-athetosis related to an anti-Hu syndrome in the absence of anti-CRMP 5 /CV 2 antibodies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — We {{aimed to}} {{establish}} whether multi-nerve testing with a point-of-care nerve conduction device {{could be used}} to diagnose diabetic <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>polyneuropathy.</b> RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODS — A total of 72 consecutive patients with dia-betes underwent a full neurological examination and a concurrent evaluation for nine standard electrophysiological parameters using conventional nerve conduction studies (the reference standard) and a point-of-care device. RESULTS — Spearman coefficients for correlation of point-of-care and conventional param-eters ranged between 0. 76 and 0. 91 (P 0. 001 in all comparisons). Agreement by the method of Bland and Altman was acceptable despite small systematic biases. Fifty subjects (69 %) had neuropathy according to conventional criteria. The sensitivity and specificity for the point-of-care device to identify such neuropathy was 88 and 82 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS — A novel point-of-care device has reasonable diagnostic accuracy and thus may represent a sufficiently accurate alternative for detecting the diffuse electrophysiolog-ical criteria necessary to make the diagnosis of diabetic <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>polyneuropathy.</b> Diabetes Care 31 : 522 – 524, 2008 U niversal nerve conduction studytesting for suspected neuropathy isnot feasible due to limitations in availability of specialized laboratories (1 – 3).

40|$|Background: Autosomal {{recessive}} spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) {{is a rare}} neurodegenerative disorder {{caused by}} mutations in the SACS gene (13 q 12) encoding the protein sacsin. It is characterized by early-onset cerebellar ataxia, lower limb spasticity, <b>sensorimotor</b> axonal <b>polyneuropathy,</b> and atrophy of the superior cerebellar vermis. Cerebellar disorders in general may be accompanied by the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) which presents with disturbances of executive functioning, spatial cognition, linguistic capacities, and affect. Sampling and Methods: Two middle-aged brothers with ARSACS, {{one of whom was}} referred for behavioral disinhibition, are described. A detailed neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessment was performed.

40|$|Prior to a {{joint meeting}} of the Neurodiab Association and International Symposium on Diabetic Neuropathy held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 13 ‐ 18 October 2009, Solomon Tesfaye, Sheffield, UK, convened a panel of neuromuscular experts to provide an update on polyneuropathies {{associated}} with diabetes (Toronto Consensus Panels on DPNs, 2009). Herein, we provide definitions of typical and atypical diabetic polyneuropathies (DPNs), diagnostic criteria, and approaches to diagnose <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> {{as well as to}} estimate severity. Diabetic <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> (DSPN), or typical DPN, usually develops on long‐standing hyperglycaemia, consequent metabolic derangements and microvessel alterations. It is frequently associated with microvessel retinal and kidney disease—but other causes must be excluded. By contrast, atypical DPNs are intercurrent painful and autonomic small‐fibre polyneuropathies. Recognizing {{that there is a need}} to detect and estimate severity of DSPN validly and reproducibly, we define subclinical DSPN using nerve conduction criteria and define possible, probable, and confirmed clinical levels of DSPN. For conduct of epidemiologic surveys and randomized controlled trials, it is necessary to pre‐specify which attributes of nerve conduction are to be used, the criterion for diagnosis, reference values, correction for applicable variables, and the specific criterion for DSPN. Herein, we provide the performance characteristics of several criteria for the diagnosis of <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> in healthy subject‐ and diabetic subject cohorts.

40|$|We {{report an}} eleven year old girl with early motor {{difficulties}} initially {{diagnosed with a}} peripheral neuropathy in another hospital based on abnormal electrophysiological findings. Our clinical assessment did not highlight obvious clinical features supporting a peripheral neuropathy but evidence of mild proximal weakness. Electrophysiological studies performed at our hospital revealed evidence of a <b>sensorimotor</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> with possible axonal involvement. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed subtle white matter signal abnormalities, interpreted as nonspecific. Given the patient's proximal weakness and a mildly elevated serum creatine kinase, we performed a muscle biopsy. The muscle had mildly dystrophic features and subtly depleted laminin α 2 expression. There was diffusely upregulated laminin α 5 expression, and depletion of laminin α 2 in intramuscular motor nerves, which made us suspect a partial laminin α 2 (merosin) deficiency. Muscle MRI showed predominant posterior and medial compartments involvement. The patient {{was found to have}} autosomal recessively inherited double heterozygous LAMA 2 mutations.

The degree of mutant heteroplasmy for the m. 8993 T>C mutation was evaluated by real-time allele refractory mutation system quantitative PCR of mtDNA from hair bulbs (ectoderm) and blood leukocytes (mesoderm).
