40|$|A {{thermoelectric}} generator is a solid-state device that converts a heat flux into electri-cal power via the Seebeck effect. When a {{thermoelectric generator}} is inserted between a solar-absorbing surface and a heat sink, a solar thermoelectric generator is created which converts sunlight into electrical power. This thesis describes {{the design and}} optimization of solar thermoelectric generators, {{with a focus on}} systems with high optical concentration which utilize multiple material systems to maximize efficiency over a large temperature difference. Both single-stage and cascaded (multi-stage) generators are considered, over an optical concentration range of 0. 1 to 1000 X. It is shown that for high-concentration Bi 2 Te 3 /skutterudite solar thermoelectric gen-erators, conversion efficiencies of 13 % are possible with current thermoelectric ma-terials and <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Better <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces</b> are needed to improve the efficiency of solar thermoelectric generators.

One of the basic properties of the metasurfaces, which renders them as frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces,</b> is the ability to transmit or reflect radiation within a narrow spectral band that can be engineered on demand. Here we introduce and demonstrate experimentally in the THz domain the concept of wavevector <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces</b> – metasurfaces transparent only within a narrow range of light propagation directions operating effectively as tunnel visionfilters. Practical implementations of the new concept include applications in wavefront manipulation, observational instruments, vision and free-space communication in light-scattering environments...|$|R
50|$|The main {{drawback}} {{of thermal}} storage walls is their heat {{loss to the}} outside. Double glass (glass {{or any of the}} plastics) is necessary for reducing heat loss in most climates. In mild climates, single glass is acceptable. A <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> (high-absorbing/low-emitting surface) applied to the exterior surface of the thermal storage wall improves performance by reducing the amount of infrared energy radiated back through the glass; typically, it achieves a similar improvement in performance without the need for daily installation and removal of insulating panels. A <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> consists of a sheet of metal foil glued to the outside surface of the wall. It absorbs almost all the radiation in the visible portion of the solar spectrum and emits very little in the infrared range. High absorbency turns the light into heat at the walls surface, and low emittance prevents the heat from radiating back towards the glass.|$|E
50|$|A simple solar air {{collector}} {{consists of an}} absorber material, sometimes having a <b>selective</b> <b>surface,</b> to capture radiation {{from the sun and}} transfers this thermal energy to air via conduction heat transfer. This heated air is then ducted to the building space or to the process area where the heated air is used for space heating or process heating needs.|$|E
50|$|A <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> can be {{used when}} energy is being {{extracted}} from the sun. For instance, when a green house is made, most of the roof and walls are made out of glass. Glass is transparent in the visible (approximately 0.4 µm<λ<0.8 µm) and near-infrared wavelengths, but opaque to mid- to far-wavelength infrared (approximately λ>3 µm). Therefore, glass lets in radiation in the visible range, allowing {{us to be able}} to see through it, but does not let out radiation that is emitted from objects at or close to room temperature. This traps what we feel as heat. This is known as the greenhouse effect and can be observed by getting into a car that has been sitting in the sun. Selective surfaces can also be used on solar collectors. We can find out how much help a <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> coating is by looking at the equilibrium temperature of a plate that is being heated through solar radiation. If the plate is receiving a solar irradiation of 1350 W/m² (minimum is 1325 W/m² on July 4 and maximum is 1418 W/m² on January 3) from the sun the temperature of the plate where the radiation leaving is equal to the radiation being received by the plate is 393 K (248 °F). If the plate has a <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> with an emissivity of 0.9 and a cut off wavelength of 2.0 µm, the equilibrium temperature is approximately 1250 K (1790 °F). The calculations were made neglecting convective heat transfer and neglecting the solar irradiation absorbed in the clouds/atmosphere for simplicity, the theory is still the same for an actual problem.|$|E

50|$|Normally, a {{combination}} of materials is used. One of the first selective surfaces investigated was simply copper {{with a layer of}} black cupric oxide. Black chromium ("black chrome") nickel-plated copper is another <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> that is very durable, highly resistant to humidity or oxidizing atmospheres and extreme temperatures while being able to retain its selective properties - but expensive. Another combination consists of steel plated with gold, silicon, and silicon dioxide.|$|E
5000|$|First, heat {{transfer}} between the absorber and the thermal fluid must be maximized. This {{relies on the}} surface of the steam tubes being selective. A <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> optimizes the ratio of energy absorbed to energy emitted. Acceptable surfaces generally absorb 96% of incident radiation while emitting only 7% through infra-red radiation. Electro-chemically deposited black chrome is generally used for its ample performance and ability to withstand high temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|Second, the {{absorber}} must {{be designed}} so that the temperature distribution across the <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> is uniform. Non-uniform temperature distribution leads to accelerated degradation of the surface. Typically, a uniform temperature of [...] is desired. Uniform distributions are obtained by changing absorber parameters such as the thickness of insulation above the plate, {{the size of the}} aperture of the absorber and the shape and depth of the air cavity.|$|E

50|$|Generally speaking, metasurfaces {{could include}} some {{traditional}} concepts {{in the microwave}} spectrum such as frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> (FSS), impedance sheet and even Ohmic sheet. In the microwave regime, the thickness of these metasurfaces can be {{much smaller than the}} wavelength of operation (for example, 1/1000 of the wavelength), since the skin depth could be extremely small for highly conductive metals. Recently, some novel phenomena such as ultra-broadband coherent perfect absorption were demonstrated. The results are astonishing since a 0.3 nm thick film could absorb all electromagnetic wave across the RF, microwave, and even terahertz frequencies.|$|E
