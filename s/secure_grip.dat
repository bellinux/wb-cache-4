500|$|The handle {{material}} of the CQC-6 {{is composed of}} two titanium liners utilizing a Walker linerlock and a single or double detent as the locking mechanism, although one experimental model exists with a ratchet lock. [...] Titanium bolsters make up the front half of the knife with the back half represented by linen micarta scales. The reasons for using titanium as a linerlock material were due to its memory characteristics and corrosion resistance. [...] The screws in the handle, and pivot are traditional straight-head screws to accommodate easy disassembly in the field with an improvised tool, if needed. [...] Most models feature traction grooves for a more <b>secure</b> <b>grip</b> in a wet environment and a chamfered lockface. Early knives were made with black linen micarta and later models featured a proprietary green color made exclusively for Emerson. [...] A pocket clip {{held in place by}} three screws allows the knife to be clipped to a pocket, web-gear, or MOLLE.|$|E

500|$|After {{their first}} trip to the Himalaya and {{subsequent}} labor problems, the Workmans hired Matthias Zurbriggen, the best and most experienced mountain climbing guide of the time. Thus, in 1899, with 50 local porters and Zurbriggen, the Workmans began to explore the Biafo Glacier in the Karakoram, but dangerous crevasses and poor weather forced them instead to shift to the Skoro La Glacier and the unclimbed peaks around it. They reached Siegfriedhorn, an 18,600-foot (5,700 m) summit that she named after her son, giving Fanny an altitude record for women at the time. They next camped at [...] and climbed a higher peak of , naming it Mount Bullock Workman. Admiring the view of a far-off mountain, they commented on the grand view: they were looking at K2, the second-highest mountain in the world. Fanny Workman may have been the first woman recorded to have seen it. Finally, they climbed Koser Gunge (...) , giving Fanny her third successive altitude record. It was very challenging: they had to hire new porters, establish a new base camp, and remain overnight at around [...] In the morning, they climbed a wall that measured , and were buffeted by winds. During the summit push, Fanny's fingers were so numb that she could no longer hold her ice ax and one of the porters abandoned them. Pauly writes, [...] "propelled to the summit by adrenalin and desperation, the foursome lingered only long enough for their instruments to assess that the temperature was ten degrees Fahrenheit [...] and their elevation was 21,000 feet." [...] Fanny was a [...] "slow, relentless, and intrepid" [...] climber; [...] "bearlike, she solidly planted one foot and then groped for another <b>secure</b> <b>grip</b> with the other". Climbing {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, she did not have specialized equipment like pitons or carabiners. She was able to climb to such heights, Pauly argues, because of [...] "her dauntless persistence and her immunity to altitude sickness".|$|E
2500|$|Large silk trails help {{increase}} adhesion to {{the host}} plant. As caterpillars advance in groups, they form thick mats of silk that provide them with secure adhesion.

50|$|After {{capturing}} Bordeaux on {{the wake}} of duke Hunald's detachment attempt, Charles Martel directed his attention to Septimania and Provence.

In 737 the Frankish leader went on to attack Narbonne, but the city held firm, defended by its Goths and Jews under the command of its governor Yusuf, 'Abd er-Rahman's heir.

40|$|The {{interest}} {{in the development of}} climbing robots is growing rapidly. Motivations are typically to increase the operation efficiency by obviating the costly assembly of scaffolding or to protect human health and safety in hazardous tasks. Climbing robots are starting to be developed for applications ranging form cleaning to inspection of difficult to reach constructions. These robots should be capable of travelling on different types of surfaces, with varying inclinations, such as floors, walls, ceillings, and to walk between such surfaces. Furthermore, these machines should be capable of adapting and reconfiguring for various environment conditions and to be self-containde. Regarding the adhesion to the surface, {{they should be able to}} produce a <b>secure</b> <b>gripping</b> force using a light-weight mechanism.

40|$|Abstract — While {{humanoid}} {{feet are}} made of rigid plates, human feet have evolved into highly articulated and flexible elements. This adaptiveness provides key advantages. It absorbs impacts and <b>secures</b> <b>grip</b> when interacting with the environment. However, the human foot design potentially increases the energetic cost, because it features actuators and provides less power transfer than a rigid plate does. Here we use neuromuscular models with different foot designs and show that human feet incur about 20 % more energetic cost than rigid ones for walking speeds up to 1. 2 ms − 1, which {{is close to the}} preferred walking speed. Above this speed, human feet do not show an energetic disadvantage. In addition we propose a foot design for prosthetic or humanoid feet which preserves key features of adaptive feet but does not require actuation, and show that it reduces the energetic cost by 15 % or more independent of the walking speed. We conclude that human evolution may have traded the advantages of adaptive feet for energy efficiency, and that robotic systems could gain the former without compromising on the latter. I...|$|R
