40|$|Miniaturisation {{has been}} an ongoing {{objective}} of the research community {{with the promise of}} low cost, small sample consumption, potential for mass production, and good portability. The development of the materials industry is important to the establishment of MEMS. Presently, increasingly more types of polymeric materials are being used {{to take advantage of the}} suitability of their different mechanical, chemical and optical properties. The most critical step in the manufacturing process of polymeric MEMS is the bonding or packaging step. The bond should be strong, durable and non-destructive on the micro-patterns. Among the various bonding technologies available for polymer bonding, <b>solvent</b> <b>bonding</b> has been shown to be the most robust, durable and simplest method. The solvent/solvents is/are applied to the polymer layers to assist in the bonding. Variables such as the solubility parameter, time, and temperature, as well as process techniques, influence the bond strength. However, current <b>solvent</b> <b>bonding</b> techniques are ad hoc and there is no well-defined guideline for the selection of an appropriate solvent-polymer pair. The available research on <b>solvent</b> <b>bonding</b> relies on empirical selections of the solvents to make a workable bond. There is a lack of a systematic study or reliable statistical analysis of the relationship between the processing conditions and the final bond strength, which would guide the formation of a robust <b>solvent</b> <b>bonding.</b> This thesis details the statistical methods that were used to design <b>solvent</b> <b>bonding</b> experiments. Process parameters, such as sealing methods, bonding area, shape of bonded wafers, temperature, time, solubility and molecular volume were studied and related to variations in the measured bond strengths. The bond strengths were measured through tensile tests where the data were obtained from stressdisplacements curves. The experimental results were statistically analysed and existing theories for <b>solvent</b> <b>bonding</b> were applied. The experimental results based on Latin squares and Factorial designs showed that the solvent type was the most significant variable affecting the bond strength. The effects of time and temperature were not as significant as the effect of solvent type, but high temperatures were found to increase the bond strength. The Hildebrands solubility parameters were found not to represent the solvent bond strength correctly, as it had only one parameter. The Hansen solubility parameter was used in conjunction with the relative energy difference, which related the solubility differences between solvents and polymers. The bond strengths from the experiments of <b>solvent</b> <b>bonding</b> at 25 °C showed that the bond strength is influenced not only by the relative energy difference (RED) but also by the solvent Molar Volume. An empirical model was developed from these experiments to provide a guideline for the solvent selection. The solvent bond strength was also affected by the bonding techniques, such as the type of sealant, shape of bonded wafers, and ratio of perimeter to bonding area. These factors were studied and their effects on optimal <b>solvent</b> <b>bonding</b> outcomes are discussed in the thesis. The strain-stress curves obtained from the tensile test results have been compared with a standard tensile stress-strain curve of Type I PMMA dog bones to illustrate the physical change of polymer structure during the <b>solvent</b> <b>bonding.</b> The interfacial polymer chains were re-oriented into a side-to-side configuration and slightly entangled, so the bonded samples broke at a relatively low tensile strength without the polymer-chain stretching stage occurring. A promising method to improve the solvent bond strength is to cross-link the polymer chains; this is achieved by in situ polymerisation bonding. Several batches of experiments were performed to establish the relationship between its bonding strength and time, temperature, monomer concentration and initiator...|$|E

In order to analyze the solvent effect on the obtained absorption spectra, the ultraviolet absorption frequencies of the electronic transitions in the carboxylic group of the examined acids were correlated using a total solvatochromic equation of the form max = v 0 + sπ + aα+ bβ, where υmax is the absorption frequency (1 /λmax), p {{is a measure of}} the solvent polarity, β represents the scale of <b>solvent</b> hydrogen <b>bond</b> acceptor basicities and α represent the scale of <b>solvent</b> hydrogen <b>bond</b> donor acidities. The correlation of the spectroscopic data was carried out by means of multiple linear regression analysis.

The effects of four processing parameters on the deformation and the bond strength of the micro channel have been investigated using the response surface methodology (RSM). High bond strengths (3. 5 ± 0. 8 MPa) at low deformations (1. 6 ± 0. 3 %) have been achieved at the center point of the design of experiment...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} solvent-solute {{interactions}} were studied {{with emphasis on}} measuring their dynamics. Using the solute ANF (2 -amino, 7 -nitroflourene), the relaxation process caused by {{the interaction of the}} solute dipole and the solvent dielectric was investigated. Studies of the solute acridine were performed to demonstrate how hydrogen <b>bond</b> formation between <b>solvent</b> and solute can cause inversion of solute energy levels. Both types of processes were monitored by time resolving solute fluorescence in a variety of solvents and solvent mixtures. A new method for picosecond time resolution of flourescence was developed, called frequency conversion gating, which surpasses the commonly used Kerr cell in sensitivity and versatility. ^ To study ANF, time resolved measurements were made of the temperature dependent Stokes shift of the fluorescence spectrum. Fluorescence time profiles were measured at both the high and low frequency edges of the spectrum at several temperatures and found to vary by more than an order of magnitude. A model was proposed that relates the measured decay times at high frequencies and the corresponding risetimes at low frequencies to the rate of solvent dielectric relaxation. Using a binary solvent, the measured decay times reflected not only the relaxation of the polar solvent molecules {{in the vicinity of the}} ANF, but also the diffusion of the polar solvent component to the solute. ^ Flourescence decay times and radiative lifetimes were measured for acridine in a variety of hydrogen bonding and non-hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>solvents.</b> The temperature dependence of the quantum yields and decay times were also measured. A new method was described for measuring radiative lifetimes based on absolute flourescence intensity. For the hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>solvents,</b> the radiative lifetimes were constant while the florescence decay times varied with <b>solvent</b> hydrogen <b>bonding</b> strength and temperature. The radiative lifetimes of the non-hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>solvents</b> were seen to vary with solvent polarizability and polarity, while the decay times were temperature independent and varied little with solvent. This data is discussed in terms of a model where hydrogen <b>bond</b> formation between <b>solvent</b> and solute causes the singlet energy levels to invert. ...|$|R
