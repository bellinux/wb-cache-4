5|$|In May 1798, Bonaparte {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the French Academy of Sciences. His Egyptian {{expedition}} included a group of 167 <b>scientists,</b> <b>with</b> mathematicians, naturalists, chemists, and geodesists among them.

5|$|Since {{the first}} {{discovery}} in 1884, fossils {{of more than}} 30 individuals have been recovered, providing <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> a more detailed knowledge of Albertosaurus anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of pack behaviour and allows studies of ontogeny and population biology, which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, the New York Zoological Society held {{a celebration}} {{to commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of Beebe's work for them. He was by this point the only {{remaining}} member of the zoo's original staff, and had produced more scholarly papers and publicity than any other employee. Letters and testimonials poured in from other <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> whom Beebe had worked, attesting to their admiration {{of him and his}} influence on them. One letter from the Harvard biologist Ernst Mayr wrote that Beebe's work had been an inspiration to his own, particularly A Monograph of the Pheasants and Beebe's books about jungle wildlife.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev founded several {{academic}} towns, such as Akademgorodok. The premier {{believed that}} Western science flourished because many scientists lived in university {{towns such as}} Oxford, isolated from big city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. He sought to duplicate those conditions in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centers tended to attract younger <b>scientists,</b> <b>with</b> older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} {{about the impact of}} spaceflight on living creatures at the time of Laika's mission, and the {{technology}} to de-orbit had not yet been developed, so Laika's survival was never expected. Some scientists believed humans would be unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space, so engineers viewed flights by animals as a necessary precursor to human missions. The experiment aimed to prove that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and endure a Micro-g environment, paving the way for human spaceflight and providing <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> some of the first data on how living organisms react to spaceflight environments.|$|E
5|$|Most of the book's {{scientific}} chapters {{were reviewed}} by <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the White House Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of Silent Spring {{to many of}} the delegates, and promoted the upcoming New Yorker serialization. Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, a long-time environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).|$|E

5|$|NuScale {{was founded}} based on {{research}} funded by the Department of Energy from 2000 to 2003. After funding was cut, <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> the program obtained related patents in 2007 and started NuScale to commercialize the technology. In 2011, the company's largest investor had its assets frozen due to {{an investigation by the}} Securities Exchange Commission. The company experienced financial hardship until new funding was obtained from Fluor Corporation and later from the Department of Energy. NuScale is currently planning the first NuScale power plant in Idaho.|$|E
5|$|Objections to {{evolution}} {{have been}} raised since evolutionary ideas came to prominence in the 19th century. When Charles Darwin published his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, his theory of evolution (the idea that species arose through descent with modification from a single common ancestor in a process driven by natural selection) initially met opposition from <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> different theories, but eventually came to receive overwhelming acceptance in the scientific community. The observation of evolutionary processes occurring (as well as the modern evolutionary synthesis explaining that evidence) has been uncontroversial among mainstream biologists since the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} Japan was undergoing a transformation into a more industrial nation and while advancing its scientific understanding in many fields. Damage from the event was widespread and the loss of life was significant. The many kilometers of visible fault breaks {{on the surface of the}} earth presented <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> opportunities for field investigations that ultimately led to an improved understanding of the fault scarps that earthquakes often generate.|$|E

5|$|The vulcanoids, {{should they}} be found, may provide <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> {{material}} from the first period of planet formation, as well as insights into the conditions prevalent in the early Solar System. Although every other gravitationally stable region in the Solar System {{has been found to}} contain objects, non-gravitational forces (such as the Yarkovsky effect) or the influence of a migrating planet {{in the early stages of}} the Solar System's development may have depleted this area of any asteroids that may have been there.|$|E
5|$|Venus transits are {{historically}} {{of great}} scientific importance {{as they were}} used to gain the first realistic estimates {{of the size of the}} Solar System. Observations of the 1639 transit, combined with the principle of parallax, provided an estimate of the distance between the Sun and the Earth that was more accurate than any other up to that time. The 2012 transit provided <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> a number of other research opportunities, particularly in the refinement of techniques to be used in the search for exoplanets.|$|E
5|$|Although Callisto is {{very similar}} in bulk {{properties}} to Ganymede, it apparently had a much simpler geological history. The surface {{appears to have been}} shaped mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of tectonic activity. Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the more numerous and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The relatively simple geological history of Callisto provides planetary <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> a reference point for comparison with other more active and complex worlds.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> the U.S. Public Health Service {{published}} reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. Two of six plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{earthquake}} swarms can be dangerous, {{scientists are}} able to model such events to analyze their structure. During the earthquake swarm in 2007, {{a group of scientists}} investigated the possibility that a volcanic eruption would occur. Five additional seismographs were placed in the earthquake zone, and scientists closely monitored the seismic activity. After additional data were gathered, <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> the United States Geological Survey, the University of Washington, and other organizations, agreed that the Nazko earthquakes probably originated from movement of magma beneath the surface near Nazko Cone. However, because of the number and small size of the Nazko earthquakes, no volcanic eruption is likely. Other recent earthquakes in North America that have been attributed to magma but did not result in a volcanic eruption include the 2003 earthquakes under Lake Tahoe in the U.S. state of California and a 2004 earthquake swarm at Jordan Craters in the U.S. state of Oregon.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, {{along with}} his brother, William, and a mutual friend from law school, he became a {{founding}} partner of the Cincinnati law firm Keating, Muething & Keating. Beginning in the late 1950s they took on Carl Lindner, Jr. as a client. Lindner was rapidly accumulating ice cream stores, supermarkets, real estate, and savings and loans, and soon essentially became Keating's sole client. In 1956, he filed requests for Q clearances {{on behalf of a}} small company of former Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> an office in Newtown, Ohio; unknown to Keating, the FBI suspected the application was fraudulent and launched an investigation of him, but no charges were made. Keating was admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court bar in 1958.|$|E

5|$|The {{area where}} Armenia lies is of {{interest}} to seismologists and geologists because of the relatively early stage of continental collision occurring there and because the earthquake's strong aftershock sequence and significant surface faulting presented <b>scientists</b> <b>with</b> an environment to study reverse faulting. Twelve days after the mainshock a French-Soviet team installed a temporary seismic network in the epicentral area to record aftershock activity (a separate expedition from the United States also visited the site). The initial portion of work included nearly a full week setting up the seismometers and optimizing their operation and, with that complete, two full weeks of continuous operation was then completed with twenty six seismometers covering an area over 1500 square kilometers. The final stage concluded with seven weeks (through the end of February 1989) of continued monitoring with a reduced capacity of twenty units.|$|E
