5|$|Getzlaf {{made his}} first {{appearance}} with the senior team at the 2008 World Championship. He led the tournament with 11 assists and his 14 points was second overall to teammate Dany Heatley's 20. Canada reached the championship game, but were forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> silver medal after Russia overcame a two-goal third period deficit and won the championship 5–4 in overtime. Getzlaf {{was named to the}} Canadian roster for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, however a sprained ankle suffered during the NHL season left his participation in doubt until just before Canada was required to confirm its roster. He had recovered enough to play and recorded seven points in seven games, including the game-winning goal in Canada's 3–2 semi-final victory over Slovakia. Canada won the gold medal with a 3–2 overtime victory over the United States.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{up to the}} {{national}} junior team, Getzlaf made his first of two appearances at the World Junior Hockey Championship in 2004. He recorded six points in six games for a Canadian squad that scored 25 goals in its four round-robin games and surrendered only four {{en route to a}} gold medal showdown with the United States. With Canada leading 3–1 early in the third period of the final, both Getzlaf and Sidney Crosby failed to capitalize on opportunities to add an extra goal that may have sealed a victory. Instead, Canada surrendered the lead, and Getzlaf and his teammates were forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> silver medal after goaltender Marc-André Fleury accidentally sent a clearing pass off a teammate and into his own net for the game-winning goal.|$|E

Parise scored both of Team USA's goals in 2–0 quarter-final win over Switzerland. In the final against Canada, Parise scored a game-tying goal with 24 seconds left in the third period to send the game into overtime, although Parise and his teammates had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> silver medal after a Sidney Crosby goal during overtime. For the tournament, Parise finished third in the tournament in scoring, and he {{was named to}} the Olympic All-Star team with countrymen Ryan Miller and Brian Rafalski. In 2014, Parise was again selected to represent his country at the Olympics, and was given the added responsibility of serving as team captain. Parise and the United States capped off their 2014 Olympic campaign with a 5–0 loss to Finland in the bronze medal game.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{intended}} {{to arrive in}} Antarctica in January 1908, which meant leaving England during the 1907 summer. He therefore had six months to secure the financing, acquire and fit out a ship, buy all the equipment and supplies, and recruit the personnel. In April, believing that he had got the backing of Scottish businessman Donald Steuart, Shackleton travelled to Norway intending to buy a 700-ton polar vessel, Bjorn, that would have served ideally as an expedition ship. When Steuart withdrew his support, however, Bjorn was beyond Shackleton's means. Bjorn was eventually acquired by German explorer Wilhelm Filchner and, renamed Deutschland, was used in his 1911–13 voyage to the Weddell Sea. Shackleton had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly, much smaller Nimrod, a 40-year-old wooden sealer of 334 gross register tons, which {{he was able to}} acquire for £5,000 (updated value £).|$|E

Canada reached the final, but were forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> silver medal after a 5–4 overtime loss to Russia. Returning for the 2009 World Championship in Switzerland, St. Louis led the tournament in scoring with 15 points. Canada met Russia in a rematch of the 2008 final, however St. Louis and his teammates were again relegated to the silver medal, dropping a 2–1 decision. St. Louis {{was named to the}} tournament's all-star team at forward. He was selected as a reserve by Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics. On February 6, 2014, he was selected to replace injured former Lightning teammate Steven Stamkos for representation at the 2014 Winter Olympics and played in five of Canada's six games. St. Louis won an Olympic Gold Medal with Team Canada in a 3-0 victory over Sweden in the gold medal game.|$|E
5|$|When the 2014 Setanta Sports Cup was {{confirmed}} in December 2013, the club {{opted not to}} enter the competition, citing inconvenient fixture scheduling, reduced prize money, and the difficulty faced by Linfield supporters attending away games as the reasons behind their withdrawal. However, the club did not rule out future participation. League champions Cliftonville also withdrew from the competition for similar reasons, with the next two highest placed sides from the previous season's league table (Ballinamallard United and Coleraine) being drafted in as replacements. In February 2014, Jeffrey {{announced that he would}} be stepping {{down at the end of}} the 2013–14 season, bringing an end to his trophy-laden reign after 17 years. In March 2014, the Blues lifted the County Antrim Shield for a record 43rd time by defeating Crusaders 4–1 on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra time in the final. This was a significant milestone for Jeffrey – his 31st and last trophy as Linfield manager, equalling Roy Coyle's record. Jeffrey still had the opportunity to win a record-breaking 32nd trophy as manager in the form of the 2013–14 league title. However, despite topping the league table for much of the season, the Blues had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> runners-up spot, six points behind champions Cliftonville. Jeffrey's reign came to a winning end with a 5–2 victory over Glenavon on the final day of the 2013–14 league season.|$|E

With this gesture, the city council hoped that the squatters would abandon the other squatted houses and <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new building on Jagtvej 69. This did not happen. As a result, the city council and the mayor launched a wave of evictions against the squatters.|$|E
