25|$|Smith Enterprise {{manufactures}} a <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor</b> {{that is made}} {{to install}} over Vortex flash hiders in what the company refers to as a direct-connect method. The current production model is called the Wind Talker <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor</b> {{and it is the}} current evolution of the M14 Direct Connect Suppressor.|$|E

25|$|The P7M13 is the P7’s {{counterpart}} with a double-column {{magazine and}} a 13-round capacity. This pistol was offered (unsuccessfully) to the US Army. A variant {{known as the}} P7M13SD was produced in limited numbers exclusively for German special forces, featuring a longer (compared to the P7M13) threaded barrel and a <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor.</b>|$|E

2500|$|He {{was found}} to be in {{possession}} of an SKS rifle, a Mossberg International 702 rifle with scope and laser sight, a [...]22 caliber handgun, a Lorcin L-380 semi-automatic handgun, 562 rounds of ammunition loaded in magazines, homemade <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors,</b> binoculars, a [...] "suspicious" [...] package, and two military books. A police search of his apartment turned up Molotov cocktails, homemade <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors,</b> and compact discs labeled in Arabic script.|$|R
5000|$|The {{threaded}} barrel allows <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors</b> {{with the same}} thread pattern to be installed directly to the barrel; however this can result in complications such as being unable to remove the suppressor from the barrel due to repeated firing on full auto or three-round burst. A number of suppressor manufacturers have designed [...] "direct-connect" [...] <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors</b> which can be installed over an existing M16's flash suppressor as opposed to using the barrel's threads.|$|R
25|$|The {{precision}} rifle is a semi-automatic-only rifle with {{a similar}} operating system to other Galil variants, but optimised for accuracy. The rifle is fed from a 25-round box magazine. It uses a heavy-profile match barrel that is heavier than that used on other variants. It is fitted with a multi-functional muzzle device, which acts as both a flash suppressor and a muzzle brake. It can be replaced with a <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor,</b> which {{requires the use of}} subsonic ammunition for maximum effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|The chamber is hand cut using chamber reamers {{specially}} {{designed for the}} M118LR round. Smith Enterprise Inc. is the only civilian rifle builder who uses these reamers. The gas system is unitized and hardened via Melonite. The gas piston is hard chromed to tolerances to ensure a precision fit within the hardened gas cylinder. Unlike traditional M14 rifles, the front sight is mounted on the gas lock {{as opposed to the}} muzzle to allow use of a direct-connect <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor</b> that mounts to the Vortex Flash Hider.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon is}} {{fitted with a}} high-impact plastic {{handguard}} and pistol grip and a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular steel skeleton stock. The rifle {{can be used with}} a <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor.</b> The weapon features a bottle opener in the front handguard and wire cutter built into the bipod. The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with Uzi submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.|$|E
50|$|Combined with firearm <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors,</b> subsonic {{ammunition}} may {{significantly reduce}} sound levels compared to normal ammunition. Specific reductions {{depend on the}} ammunition and suppressor.|$|R
50|$|Flash <b>suppressors</b> and <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors</b> are {{the most}} obvious devices that operate in the {{transitional}} ballistics realm. These both alter {{the flow of the}} escaping gas to reduce the effects of the muzzle blast. Flash suppressors introduce turbulence into the mixing of fuel-laden hot gases escaping from the muzzle and the surrounding oxygen-rich air, reducing combustion efficiency and thus reducing the size and brightness of the flash. <b>Sound</b> <b>suppressors</b> slow the expansion of gases, allowing it to cool and reducing the rate at which it escapes to prevent a shockwave from forming.|$|R
2500|$|Smith Enterprise Inc. (SEI) is {{a firearm}} and {{accessory}} manufacturing facility based in Tempe, Arizona {{that is known}} for making flash <b>suppressors,</b> muzzle brakes, <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors,</b> M14 rifles and accessories for M14 rifles.|$|R

2500|$|Fitted with a quick-attachable/detachable Advanced Armament Corporation <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor</b> with {{muzzle brake}} to reduce recoil and jump and audible and visible {{signature}} with an available thermal sleeve that reduces mirage effect on heated suppressors. The [...] Titan-QD Fast-Attach suppressor eliminates 98 percent of muzzle flash, 60 percent of recoil, and reduces sound by 32 decibels.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a general}} rule, revolvers cannot be {{effective}} with a <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor</b> ("silencer"), {{as there is}} usually a small gap between the revolving cylinder and the barrel which a bullet must traverse or jump when fired. From this opening, a rather loud report is produced. [...] A suppressor can only suppress noise coming from the muzzle.|$|E
25|$|Other {{accessories}} such as scope mounts, Kobra optics and PBS1 <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors</b> {{were available}} due to it being largely {{derived from the}} AK-74/47 family, thus having the correct thread and AK optics side mount.|$|R
5000|$|... the {{secondary}} chambers and baffle systems in firearm <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors</b> (primarily pistol suppressors for reduced weight and improved mechanical functionality), while the primary expansion chambers usually require 17-4PH or 303 stainless steel or titanium.|$|R
50|$|Improvements {{were made}} to the {{internal}} operating system and miscellaneous component parts to improve reliability in best and worse case scenarios, with all types of ammunition, with all barrel lengths and with and without <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors</b> attached.|$|R
2500|$|Created in late 2004, the Night Fighting Weapon System (NFWS) {{was made}} {{for the purpose of}} {{fighting}} in forested areas in low-light conditions. [...] Night vision and regular daytime scopes can be mounted on the rifle via a Picatinny rail on top of the upper receiver. [...] The rifle is equipped with an integral <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor</b> fitted on a bull barrel (1 inch in diameter) with a 1 in 9" [...] twist.|$|E
2500|$|The Bizon {{has been}} {{continuously}} modified over its production {{life and the}} current model is the Bizon-2, which has AK-style iron sights (an open U-notch rear sight on a tangent with three settings: 50, 100 and 150 m and a semi-shrouded front post), a receiver-mounted side rail adapter for optics and a new slotted flash hider designed to accept a quick-detachable <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor.</b> The Bizon-2 is made in several variants to increase the product's commercial appeal and demonstrate its versatility; it is offered in 8 different configurations: ...|$|E
2500|$|Some purpose-designed {{insurgency}} {{weapons were}} designed for a dual use–that is for use by both insurgents and conventional soldiers. The Welrod pistol was a simple, bolt-action pistol developed by the SOE for use in World War II. It was designed [...] for supplying to foreign British-aligned insurgents and for use by covert British forces. The pistol was designed with an integral <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor,</b> and was ideal for killing sentries and other covert work; the bolt-operated action meant that cocking the gun produced almost no noise, and the bulky but efficient suppressor eliminated {{nearly all of the}} muzzle blast. Welrod pistols included a magazine that doubled as a hand-grip, and were originally produced with no markings save a serial number.|$|E
50|$|As a {{manufacturer}} of firearm <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors,</b> Brügger & Thomet also offers quick-detachable suppressors for the APR series. The APR308 GRS suppressor reduces the acoustical report of the weapon by 36 dB(A) and also reduces the optical muzzle signature.|$|R
5000|$|The NRA {{supported}} the 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA), which regulated what were considered {{at the time}} [...] "gangster weapons" [...] such as machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, and <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors.</b> However, the organization's position on suppressors has since changed.|$|R
50|$|When law {{enforcement}} agencies are using machine pistols in non-concealed settings, this makes it feasible to add accessories such as optical sights, laser sights, flashlights, forward handgrips, rear stocks, or <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors.</b> Many 2000s-era machine pistols have mounting rails to facilitate the addition of accessories. Agencies sometimes use <b>sound</b> <b>suppressors</b> for maneuvers {{in which it is}} anticipated that shots may be fired indoors, because the sound pressure from indoor firing can be deafening. Some machine pistols offer the option of using translucent plastic magazines which allows the officer to quickly verify the level of ammunition left in the magazine. Another option that {{law enforcement}} officers may use on occasion is high-capacity magazines such as single or double drum magazines.|$|R
2500|$|Colt AR-15 rifles {{most often}} have a barrel {{threaded}} in 1⁄2"-28 threads to incorporate {{the use of a}} muzzle device such as a flash suppressor, <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor</b> or muzzle brake. The initial design, the [...] "duckbill," [...] had three tines or prongs and was prone to breakage and getting entangled in vegetation. The design was later changed to close the end to avoid this problem. Eventually, on the A2 version of the rifle, the bottom port was closed to reduce muzzle climb and prevent dust from rising when the rifle was fired in the prone position. For these reasons, the US military declared this muzzle device a compensator, but it is more commonly known as the [...] "GI", [...] "A2", or [...] "Birdcage" [...] muzzle device. The standard AR15 muzzle device conforms to the STANAG dimensional requirements for firing 22mm rifle grenades.|$|E
2500|$|Around one {{thousand}} M3 submachine guns in caliber 9mm Parabellum were built by Guide Lamp. [...] These original 9mm guns, {{identified by the}} markings [...] "U.S. 9 mm S.M.G." [...] {{on the left side}} of the magazine well (without any model designation, such as M3), were delivered to the OSS in 1944. [...] Additionally, Rock Island Arsenal and Buffalo Arms Corporation manufactured parts for a limited number of 9mm conversion kits for the M3. [...] Though 25,000 kits were originally requested for procurement, this was changed to a recommendation by the Ordnance Committee in December 1943 that only 500 9mm conversion kits be obtained. [...] Procurement was authorized in February 1944, but it is believed that only a limited number of kits were actually produced. [...] These conversion kits included a new 9mm barrel, replacement bolt and recoil springs, a magazine well adapter for use with British Sten gun 32-round magazines, and a replacement 9mm Sten magazine of British manufacture. [...] As the M3's sights were not altered for the new cartridge, the 9mm M3 shot high at 100 yards, but the sighting error was deemed inconsequential. [...] The OSS also requested approximately 1,000 [...]45-caliber M3 submachine guns with an integral <b>sound</b> <b>suppressor</b> (designed by Bell Laboratories). [...] Specially drilled barrels and barrel nuts were manufactured by Guide Lamp, while the High Standard Firearms Company produced the internal components and assembled the weapon. [...] The Bell Laboratories suppressor was estimated to be only 80% as efficient as the British suppressed STEN Mk IIS.|$|E
