40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe push in the {{industry}} towards increasing the weather window for marine operations offshore leads to a focus on new technology. When performing workover operations in a subsea well, the workover riser is a physical connection between the well and the floating workover vessel. A floating vessel will experience wave induced motion and is therefore equipped with a heave compensator to allow for this relative motion without increasing the load to the riser. If the heave compensator fails or if the heave of the vessel exceeds the stroke length of the heave compensator, the workover riser can be subjected to an excessive axial force that could rupture the riser and damage subsea well barriers. A <b>safety</b> <b>joint</b> {{that is to be}} installed in the riser can improve the window for safe operation while reducing consequences if an accident were to occur. It is called the Telescopic <b>Safety</b> <b>Joint</b> (TSJ) and has been developed by FMC Technologies. The joint is designed to telescope when subjected to a predetermined axial force. The telescoping function of the joint will ensure that there is sufficient time for personnel onboard the vessel to activate the emergency disconnect function so that the riser can safely be disconnected from the well. The <b>safety</b> <b>joint</b> is a weak link. During installation of the workover system, the riser experiences loading conditions exceeding that of normal operation. There is a concern that the <b>safety</b> <b>joint</b> may take plastic damage during this installation. Hence the TSJ is equipped with an over-ride function that temporarily can increase the strength of the joint. The over-ride function works by pumping hydraulic pressure into external cylinders. The increase in the strength of the joint from the over-ride function depends upon the hydraulic pressure. This thesis studies the effect the over-ride function has on the weather window for installation of a workover system, comparing a fully pressurized over-ride function to a semi-pressurized over-ride function. Simulations in Orcaflex for various environmental conditions found the loads that the TSJ must be able to withstand for installation to be possible. A model of the joint was created in AUTODESK Inventor. Using ANSYS workbench, the model was tested to find out which loads that are acceptable and which loads leads to plastic damage of the joint both for the fully pressurized and semi-pressurized over-ride function. Combining the results for the fully- and semi-pressurized over-ride function test, with the results from the dynamic simulations performed in Orcaflex revealed an increase in installation window when using the fully pressurized over-ride function. The joint using the full capacity of the over-ride function was able to withstand 620 kNm before plastic damage took place. The joint using a semi-pressurized over-ride function began taking plastic damage at 400 kNm. The over-ride function increases the bending moment capacity of the joint by 55 %. Using the scatter diagram for the Draugen field to see how many observations has been made of the different sea states, the increased availability for installation when using the full capacity of the over-ride function, as opposed to the semi-pressurized joint was calculated. When installing the TSJ as the 2 nd riser joint, the availability increased by 21, 7 %. Installing the TSJ as the 3 rd joint increases the availability by 16, 7 %. Installation of the TSJ on the 4 th and 5 th joint gives an increase of respectively 2, 8 % and 0, 3 % when the full over-ride capacity is used. The over-ride functions proved to be so effective that the joint became stronger than the actual workover riser. Hand calculations showed that the riser would yield before the <b>safety</b> <b>joint</b> and thus the <b>safety</b> <b>joint</b> would not be a limiting factor for the workover installation activity if the over-ride function is active...|$|E

The implementation is composed of 2 controllers- a head gaze control and a hand position control. The main application is precise manipulation tasks using the hand. For this, the hand controller takes top priority. The head controller is designed to keep both the hand and object in the eye field of view. For robustness, a secondary task of joint limit avoidance is implemented using the redundancy framework and a large projection operator proposed recently.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{fatalities}} from automotive traffic accidents in Japan is on a downward trend. However, {{the number of}} injuries is tending to increase. Consequently, {{there is a need}} for further safety measures to reduce the number of casualties. In order to achieve progress on vehicle safety measures, it is essential to develop human body models for use as tools to quantify injury parameters. The crash test dummies and impactors in common use, however, require consideration of durability and reusability. This gives rise to structural differences from the human body, and makes it difficult to evaluate any but preexisting injury parameters. Recent years, therefore, have seen the use of simulated models of the human body generated by computer. These models take advantage of the ability to model the structure of the human body and mechanical properties in minute detail, and are applied to explain the injury mechanisms and to evaluate vehicle collision <b>safety.</b> <b>Joint</b> cooperative projects have been initiated by automobile manufacturers, related research institutes, and other such organizations, particularly in the United States and Europe, bringing advances in development of models that more closely resemble the human body.

Researchers from private industry and government agencies {{around the world have}} studied mechanisms of violent failure and have identified individual factors that contribute to coal bumps. To develop predictive tools for assessing coal bump potential, the authors initiated a comprehensive study using information from 25 case studies undertaken in U. S. mines. Multiple linear regression and numerical modeling analyses of geological and mining conditions were used to identify the most significant factors contributing to stress bumps in coal mines. Twenty-five factors were considered initially, including mechanical properties of strata, stress fields, face and pillar factors of <b>safety,</b> <b>joint</b> spacings, mining methods, and stress gradients. In situ strength was estimated in 12 coal seams where uniaxial compressive strength exceeded 2, 000 psi.

40|$|Un modèle d’analyse a été {{construit}} pour rendre compte de l’influence du contexte de l’établissement sur l’issue d’interventions de prévention en santé et en sécurité du travail. Il a été constitué à partir d’une étude de cas en profondeur de sept interventions réalisées par des conseillers externes. L’étude examine l’influence du degré de développement des activités en prévention avant l’intervention, qui apparaît lui-même fortement lié aux caractéristiques structurelles des établissements. Une typologie des modes de régulation sociale de la santé et de la sécurité observés au sein des milieux de travail est présentée ; ces régulations jouent également un rôle dans la mise en oeuvre des mesures préventives. L’étude met en évidence l’apport des interventions externes à la prévention en santé et en sécurité du travail, et de leur collaboration soutenue avec les milieux de travail, au cours d’interventions successives. Various {{studies have}} shown that worker health and safety are related, among other things, to the characteristics of the organization to which workers belong, and the social interactions taking place within the organization. Our study centres on understanding what influence the context has on creating positive change, in terms of occupational health and safety prevention, resulting from external interventions. Our theoretical framework is based on three complementary sources: the work of Dawson et al. (1988) for whom the organization’s “capacity” and “willingness” play a role in explaining the scope and limits of a regime based on the principle of self-regulation; the theory of labour market segmentation, where the influence of the structural characteristics of organizations is examined, and the research undertaken by Reynaud (1988, 1991, 1997) which focuses on the relationships between the actors in the workplace. Seven case studies were carried out during the same number of interventions by joint occupational health and safety sector-based association advisors, in six workplaces. These workplaces varied greatly in terms of size, worker qualification levels, gender and ethnic origin, wage levels and staff turnover. The first case study began in September 1999, and the last ended in the spring of 2000. The data consisted of (non participatory) observations carried out during visits the advisors made at the workplaces (43), semi-structured interviews (50) and telephone conversations (8) with the advisors’ contacts and with those actors in a position to influence the intervention and the outcome of the proposed changes. Twenty-six interviews and 41 telephone conversations with the advisors were also analyzed, as were ten other interviews and height telephone conversations for validation purposes. In total, 186 data sources were thus analyzed. Each proposed change was recorded and its outcome documented (accepted or not, implemented or not). Observations support the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of the workplace influence the degree to which prevention activities had been developed {{at the outset of the}} intervention, these activities being more developed in cases where the structural characteristics of the workplace match the characteristics of the primary segment of the labour market. However, in the cases studied, this relation does not seem to be determinative. Furthermore, similarity with the characteristics of the primary segment does not necessarily “guarantee” a high level of organization in prevention. Sustained cooperation between the workplace and the sector-based associations, in setting up an Occupational Health and <b>Safety</b> <b>Joint</b> Committee and establishing a structured set of prevention activities, also helped to further develop these activities. This external support appears to have a moderating effect on the trend defined by the structural characteristics. Observations suggest that prevention activities can be classified in accordance with three large structural stages of prevention. Moving from one level to the next involves a significant qualitative leap in prevention. The outcome of the change proposals was partly contingent on the magnitude of the gap between the activities already in place (and the assets available to sustain them), on the one hand, and the capacities required to put the new activities in place, on the other. The spontaneous structuring of prevention does not follow a logic based on the preventive efficiency of each measure taken, but rather that of the assets that are required. This stresses the relevance of external advice and statutory provisions aiming to organize prevention and ensure worker representation. In order to understand the context in which the interventions take place, our study also examines how, within the framework in the context defined by the structural characteristics of the workplace, the actors regulate the risks associated with the workplace, through their own actions and interactions. Social regulations observed around OHS matters in the different workplaces can be compared with each other and situated in a continuum where, at one end, they can be qualified as being “unorganized” (due to the “exit” associated with high employee turnover), and at the other end, “organized” with workers forming a collective body allowing for an expression of their “voice” in discussions with their employer on the subject of occupational health and safety. This can either be informal, between employees and supervisors, or formal, through a joint health and safety committee, negotiations between a trade union and an employer, etc. This interaction, however, does not guarantee action in the field of prevention, although the formation of a collective body by workers does seem to be an essential step. Results point to the contribution of external advice in structuring the prevention measures. Government intervention is also seen as necessary in order to ensure the organization of prevention and workers representation.

40|$|Dans la première partie de cet article, l'auteur tente de dégager les grandes lignes de l'évolution en matière de {{compensation}} et de prévention des accidents. Ensuite, l'auteur s'efforce de circonscrire la conception présente quant aux objectifs à poursuivre et aux principaux moyens à utiliser. Work {{accident and}} job safety will first {{be looked at}} from an historical viewpoint, in relation to changing management theories. In a second part, the nature of accident prevention will be considered, {{as well as the}} respective responsibilities of the various economic agents involved. HISTORICAL TRENDSDuring the XIXth century, in conformity with the current individualistic approach and the prevailing economic liberalism, no special provision existed concerning work accident compensation. An injured workman had no other recourse than those under the civil law, in the province of Québec, or under the common law in the rest of Canada and the United States. The injured employee had to face three powerful legal defenses from his employer: the assumption of normal risk in any kind of work, the fellow-servarit rule by which the responsibility could be shifted to a fellow-workman and the doctrine of contributory negligence from the part of the injured himself. The first major change came with the reversal of the burden of proof. Under the Employers' Liability Acts, in the States, the court would assume that the employer and not the employee was responsible for the accident. At the same time, these Acts outlawed "the contracting out of liability" by which some employers required an employee to waive in advance any legal claim for injuries sustained on the job. An equivalent law was enacted in Québec in 1909  ; the Act established the right of an injured employee to a compensation, even determining the amount or proportion of his salary to which he was entitled; the court could increase or reduce this amount in relation to the degree of responsibility of the employer or the employee. This was about the time when Frederick Taylor published hisPrinciples of Scientific Management. This work has become the symbol of time and motion studies ; it included nevertheless a certain amount of consideration to the employee's welfare, at least in relation to his productive capacities. The development of large industries in the early XXth century brought into ever greater evidence the difficulty of establishing the various responsibilities of a work accident; the work accident appeared more and more as the consequence of a network of circumstances of which the injured employee was more the victim than the responsible agent. The number of accidents even served as further proof; it is said that in the year 1907, in two industries alone, railroading and bituminous coal mining, there were 7, 000 dead in the United States. The idea of a no-fault insurance system was introduced in the State of Wisconsin in 1911; {{it was the beginning of}} our modem workmen's compensation laws. The first such law in Canada was enacted by the province of Ontario in 1914; Québec followed suit, after a few unsuccessful trials, with the adoption, in 1931, of its Workmen's Compensation Act. Compensation for a work accident thus became almost automatic, under a kind of obligatory mutual insurance System, with contributions adapted to the various industries accident record. In the meantime, management theories had moved from the original Taylorism to a new approach called human relations. It had a fairly rapid impact on the study of industrial accidents. The main preoccupation had been, right from the very first safety associations in the late XIXth century in Europe, to design and promote safe machines and tools. The next step was to look into the attitudes and characteristics of the worker to explain some of the work accidents. The idea of an accident-prone employee emerged from these studies, and an easy way to reduce accident rate was not to hire such an employee. The human relations approach brought another element into the picture : the social pressure stemming from the immediate superiors of the worker and even more from his fellow-workmen. A new approach, called psychosociological, bound together technical, human and environmental elements. Authors started to investigate less the accident it-self and more the unsafe behavior immediately preceding the accident: how and why an employee decides to take a risk instead of following the safe procedure ?This global approach was in keeping with the new contemporary management theories, which stemmed from organizational behavior studies: management by objectives and participative management. In the same line, responsibilities for safety were considered to rest not only with management and the State, but also with the employees them-selves and their organizations. From the legal viewpoint, basic principles for workmen's compensation remained the same, but rehabilitation and prevention were stressed much more heavily through special statutes and bylaws. CURRENT APPROACH TO INDUSTRIAL SAFETYA National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws, established in the United States in 1971, stated five objectives for a modem workmen's compensation program : 1. Broad coverage 2. Substantial protection against interruption of income 3. Provisions for sufficient medical care and rehabilitation services 4. Encouragement of safety 5. An effective System for delivery of the benefits and servicesThe fifth objective is simply a means to ensure the attainment of the previous four. The first expresses an important characteristic of an industrial safety system, that it should cover inasmuch as possible every employee in a country. This leaves three basic objectives: protection of income by adequate compensation, protection of the health and integrity of the body after an accident by proper rehabilitation services, and, finally, advance protection of health and body integrity by an adequate system of accident prevention. Accident prevention can be defined as the sum total of all measures to reduce or eliminate all risks or dangers of accident. These measures should be at the same time technical, human and environmental. Because of the number of factors that may cause an accident and of the corresponding elements that must make up an effective prevention program, safety at work has been defined as a state of mind, without which even the best program on paper would be totally ineffective. One author has expressed graphically the respective importance of various accident causes. (See the diagram in the French text.) Human and technical factors are considered to represent the most immediate explanation of an accident. Perhaps because it is easier to study these two aspects and to propose there from seemingly adequate measures, these two types of causes have been abundantly dealt with. But the accidents are still with us. The critical incident, which changes the normal operation of a machine or a normal work process has become the center of current accident research. It has been found, for instance, that risks are always taken because of a compromise between a safe measure (which is always cumbersome), and other goals such as reduced effort, increased productivity or social approval. Finally, the one single most important set of causes lies with the organization itself or, in other words, with the importance — or lack of importance — given by each company to the safety factor: the rules it will set to ensure safe operations and the attention its representatives, from the board of directors right down to the foremen, will give to the implementation of these rules. A long list of means for accident prevention is often presented. They can be summarized under the following headings : 1. Rules and norms 2. Inspection 3. Education and motivation 4. OrganizationAll economic agents — the State, the employer, the employee and his union — have their responsibility towards each of these four points. But, in a sense, the State could be held more directly responsible for the first two and the employer for the last two, with the employee and his union more concerned with number 3. The responsibility of the State, especially in terms of setting up the rules and norms and of organizing a proper inspection service, is commonly recognized and will not be dealt with here longer. The responsibility of the employer is absolutely fundamental. The diagram mentioned earlier underlined this fact by the importance granted to cause number one. This is so because the attitude of management towards safety will be reflected in all relevant aspects. Safe machines and tools, for instance, depend essentially on the employer. Even from the viewpoint of risk-taking by the employee, the weight of company attitudes is predominant: it productivity is stressed at the expense of safety, employees will take more risks to meet the production standards and obtain the social and for monetary approval they look for. This observation is often expressed by the slogan: "Safety comes from up above downward". The necessity of employee cooperation in any safety program is self-evident. If the employee does not accept to work the safe way, efforts will be fruitless It is the responsibility of the company to show the employee the safe way of doing things, especially to new employees and to all employees when new tools or machinery are introduced. This education program, together with a publicity program to motivate the employee, should be an important part of the safety program of any company. Participation of management at all levels is a must: the program will not work if the highest and the lowest levels do not fully cooperate. Mutual cooperation between management and the employees, whether directly represented or through their union, can be properly channelled through <b>safety</b> <b>joint</b> commitees. These are now mandatory, in Québec, in any establishment with more than twenty workers and a rate of more than twenty-five accidents per million working hours. They are difficult to operate, but with a minimum of good faith and loyal effort, they can be effective for, as it has often been remarked, the workers themselves and their representatives have part of the necessary knowledge for any modification, correction and betterment of job safety. Because of the complexity of preventive measures, organization is necessary for all the agents involved: the State, the employer and the employee through his union. The State and the employer face a kind of dilemma: unification or coordination? In other words, is it better to have one body or even one person, in the factory or on site, with proper authority to deal with all aspects of the safety program, or to make safety one of the basic responsibilities of all levels of management? The two Systems have their ad-vantages and shortcomings. At the State level, so many different Departments and Commissions have to do in workmen's compensation and job safety that the Riverin Report has recommended to regroup them in only oneRégie with all the necessary powers. At the company level, the problem is not that easy: the one-man approach ensures competence but not effective authority; the line-management approach ensures authority but not necessarily competence and commitment. But this problem of structure may not be that important: whether the System is a unified or a coordinated one, much more determinant is the state of mind of all those involved. One could develop this state of mind by the mere consideration of the number of fatal accidents that occur every year in this province. In 1974, there were no less than 200 fatalities and over 5, 000 permanent disability cases from work accidents or injuries. Any sensible person with some responsibility in safety should have no rest until these figures are brought down to zero...|$|E

30|$|Economies of scale: {{firms can}} enjoy lower average costs when {{operating}} at a combined size that {{is larger than}} when operating separately. These cost economies arise typically from sharing common inputs and spreading fixed costs over a larger output. Economies of scale in production are the most obvious motivation {{and are more likely}} to be achieved following horizontal integrations (Table  2). In a logistics context, horizontal integration increases the company’s productivity for core activities (e.g. optimising vehicle capacity utilization, reducing empty mileage, better usage of storage facilities, etc.); it reduces the costs of non-core activities (e.g. organizing <b>safety</b> trainings, <b>joint</b> fuel facilities, etc.); and it cuts purchasing, marketing and R&D costs (e.g. vehicles, onboard computers, fuel, etc.) [9, 34].|$|R
40|$|The {{shift towards}} the {{internal}} responsibility {{system and the}} mandating of <b>Joint</b> Health and <b>Safety</b> Committees in the early 1980 s represented a radical departure {{in terms of how}} health and safety were regulated in the workplace. This paper examines the effectiveness of this institutional change using firm level data provided by the Worker's Compensation Board on lost time accidents from 1976 to 1989. It finds that where management and labour had some sympathy for the co-management of health and <b>safety</b> through <b>joint</b> committees, the new system significantly reduced lost-time accident rates. At workplaces where either labour or management resisted the spread of co-management the mandating of committees appears to have little effect on lost-time accident rates. ...|$|R

The Safety Management System is designed to standardize health and safety programmes throughout the member golf courses of both organizations.|$|R
40|$|Safety {{standardization}} for machinery {{focuses on}} the definition of recommendations to assure that no human is harmed {{at any time during}} a machine's life cycle. When it comes to human-robot-cooperation, standardization bodies face the need for recommendations, at a time where the technology is just on its way to emerge to applications. Until now robot standards only dealt with recommendations on the safeguarding of the robot's workspace, separating humans from the machinery, whenever parts of the robot system were in motion. New paradigms in robotics, fostered by new technological achievements in the area of robot control, are to be answered by new robot <b>safety</b> standards. <b>Joint</b> international activities are ongoing to come up with adequate safety standards, answering the need for comprehensive and safe, but still applicable recommendations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the activities of}} the US-Japan exchange in the area of personnel safety at magnetic and laser fusion experiments. A near-miss event with a visiting scientist to the US in 1992 was the impetus for forming the Joint Working Group on Fusion Safety. This exchange has been under way for over ten years and has provided many safety insights for both US and Japanese facility personnel at national institutes and at universities. The background and activities of the Joint Working Group are described, including the facilities that have been visited for safety walkthroughs, the participants from both countries, and the main safety issues examined during visits. Based on these visits, some operational safety ideas to enhance experiment safety are given. The near-term future plans of the <b>Safety</b> Monitor <b>Joint</b> Working Group are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|SummaryDespite {{promising}} results, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{put on hold}} trials assessing anti-nerve {{growth factor}} (a-NGF) compounds due to concerns over accelerated rates of OA progression. The mechanism of these events is unclear but joint adverse events were observed particularly in patients using a-NGFs in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), suggesting that the significantly greater analgesic effect of these separate classes of drugs prompted patients to permit increased joint load without experiencing the usual pain that would limit joint stress. Development of a-NGF drugs is continuing with stringent safety criteria included in future trials as a-NGF therapies offer potential as the first new class of analgesics in many years. Potential imaging <b>joint</b> <b>safety</b> findings and exclusionary criteria for eligibility for the large weight bearing joints were presented in parts I and II of this atlas. The shoulder as a non-weight bearing joint {{is likely to be}} less affected by increased loading due to efficacious pain reduction. However, it remains prone to degeneration especially due to concomitant rotator cuff pathology and previous trauma and inflammatory disorders. This third part of the atlas illustrates imaging findings relevant for eligibility and potential <b>joint</b> <b>safety</b> findings such as osteonecrosis, incidental findings such as large cystic lesions, inflammatory disorders, bone marrow disorders and metastases...|$|R
40|$|Safe {{care for}} mothers and babies during labor and birth {{is the goal}} of all health care {{professionals}} and is an expectation of childbearing women and their families. Fetal assessment is a key aspect of perinatal patient <b>safety.</b> The <b>Joint</b> Commission Sentinel Event Alert, Preventing Infant Death and Injury During Delivery, issued on July 21, 2004, highlighted a need to develop clear guidelines for fetal monitoring of potential high-risk patients including protocols for the interpretation of fetal heart rate tracings and to edu-cate nurses, resident physicians, nurse midwives and attending physicians to use standard terminology to communicate abnormal fetal heart rate tracings. 1 The need to develop processes to address this important safety issue resonated among the professional medi-cal and nursing organizations and individual hospitals and health care systems.

While fault-tolerance properties of time-triggered protocols have been very well studied, research on security aspects for time-triggered systems have hardly been covered. Therefore, we explore system design principles which efficiently realize security mechanisms for time-triggered architectures. A particular focus is on synergistic effects of security and safety-related functions, thereby supporting the roll-out of safety-critical embedded systems even in ‘untrusted’ environments. Asamain contribution, we present the Secure COmmunication in Time-Triggered sYstems (SCOTTY) approach to build secure time-triggered systems...|$|R
