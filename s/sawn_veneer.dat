That is that the items be, functional, durable, aesthetically pleasing, of reasonable cost and quality. I would like to develop a related range of furniture, which accords with the way in which I would like these items to be made for myself. As I do not feel that I have particularly unusual needs I hope that some of these pieces will have commercial potential. In addition I will work on drawings and ideas for the work I would like to do in the second year. During the second year I will work on some larger pieces which address some of the concerns of theory and practice with which I am grappling. I would hope to develop these pieces as expressive both of the technical and resource problems in which I am interested (use of minor species timbers, the possibilities of <b>sawn</b> <b>veneer,</b> the aesthetics of combinations of materials) and that the works should be expressive emotively. I am interested in developing work which has a distinct emotional quality, not that it would be particularly disturbing, but that it provokes a response. To a certain extent furniture is regarded like air conditioning in that if you don't notice it then it must be working. Whilst I do not want to simply do the opposite; there are certain characteristics of furniture which have strong emotional connotations, drawers and secrecy, chairs and comfort, desks and efficiency, shelves and order, I would like to play around with some of these qualities to produce a different response to the typical...|$|E

30|$|A major {{obstacle}} to using eucalypts for veneers and LVL is {{the high level of}} growth-stresses present in the logs. These growth-stresses are generated by the newly formed wood cells. The exact molecular mechanism by which the cell walls generate such large stresses is unknown (Alméras and Clair 2016; Okuyama et al. 1994; Toba et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2005). However, the newly formed cells tend to contract longitudinally and expand transversely during cell wall maturation. As a consequence, the centre of the stem is under axial compression while the outside is under axial tension (Kubler 1987). These growth-stresses are released when cutting into the stem i.e. during felling, <b>sawing</b> or <b>veneer</b> peeling. The release of growth-stresses can lead to severe end-splitting following a crosscut, board distortion during sawing and breakage of veneers in the peeling process (Archer 1987; Jacobs 1945; Yang and Waugh 2001). These defects are more prominent in smaller diameter logs, i.e. a plantation resource. Splitting of veneers caused by growth-stress lowers veneer quality and reduces yield. For example, only 20 % usable veneers were recovered from E. grandis W.Hill due to severe end-splitting (Margadant 1981). To date, no technological solution to reduce the effects of growth-stresses has been implemented successfully.|$|R

The process may be applied to <b>veneer,</b> <b>sawn</b> wood, or strand composites. The VTC lamina is then bonded to other lamina to produce the final product. The strength and stiffness of this VTC composite exceeds any wood-based composite that is currently on the market.

30|$|From a {{management}} perspective, a great advantage of selection silviculture is {{the production of}} large logs for <b>saw</b> timber or <b>veneer,</b> products of high commercial value, while in the same time, logs of smaller dimensions are harvested {{that can be used}} for firewood or charcoal production (Moorman et al. 2013; Puettmann et al. 2015).

Operationally, harvesting requires skilled workers and marked stands after determining adequate marking guides according to the BDq or a similar technique. In addition, Donoso (2002) proposed 10 -year cutting cycles for evergreen forests on productive low-elevation sites. Single-tree selection would thus especially offer landholders with small properties a variety of wood products at regular intervals (Puettmann et al. 2015).|$|R

The objectives of this paper were to evaluate the rooting and the productive capacity of Australian cedar mini-strains, managed in lifted seedbeds and 180 cm 3 plastic tubes systems. So, two mini-clone                                                                      gardens were set up. The mini-strains of both gardens were grown from cut-off seedlings originated from seeds.

During this period, six collections from the lifted seedbed and four from the plastic tubes were carried out. The mini-strains in the two systems showed 100 % of survival rate. At the end of this seven-month period, an increasing tendency of the average number of mini-cutting was found out in both systems.

40|$|In Tasmania, {{plantation}} grown Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus nitens {{are managed}} to produce high quality sawlogs for <b>sawn</b> timber and <b>veneer</b> products. In contrast to dedicated pulp regimes, sawlog production requires a more intensive approach.

50|$|Techniques of wood {{marquetry}} {{were developed in}} Antwerp and other Flemish centers of luxury cabinet-making during the early 16th century. The craft was imported full-blown to France after the mid-seventeenth century, to create furniture of unprecedented luxury being made at the royal manufactory of the Gobelins, charged with providing furnishings to decorate Versailles and the other royal residences of Louis XIV. Early masters of French marquetry were the Fleming Pierre Golle and his son-in-law, André-Charles Boulle, who founded a dynasty of royal and Parisian cabinet-makers (ébénistes) and gave his name to a technique of marquetry employing tortoiseshell and brass with pewter in arabesque or intricately foliate designs. Boulle marquetry dropped out of favor in the 1720s, but was revived in the 1780s. In the decades between, carefully matched quarter-sawn <b>veneers</b> <b>sawn</b> from the same piece of timber were arranged symmetrically on case pieces and contrasted with gilt-bronze mounts. Floral marquetry came into favor in Parisian furniture in the 1750s, employed by cabinet-makers like Bernard van Risenbergh, Jean-Pierre Latz and Simon-François Oeben. The most famous royal French furniture veneered with marquetry are the pieces delivered by Jean Henri Riesener in the 1770s and 1780s. The Bureau du Roi was the most famous amongst these famous masterpieces.|$|R

40|$|Eucalyptus nitens {{is widely}} planted for pulpwood, and {{increasingly}} also for solid-wood timber products, in cool-temperate climates. This thesis investigated {{the potential of}} tree breeding to improve the properties of E. nitens grown for sawn boards, pulpwood and veneer products. Two studies were undertaken using a 14 - 15 year old E. nitens provenanceprogeny trial established in Tasmania and comprising 420 open-pollinated families collected from three native races. In the first study, methods were developed to track the identities of 560 pedigreed trees through harvesting, transportation and sawmill processing. A second study tracked 548 trees from the same trial through a rotary peeled veneer production system. Genetic parameters were estimated {{for a total of}} 20 tree, log and wood traits relevant to <b>sawn</b> board, <b>veneer</b> and pulpwood products. Genetic differences among races of E. nitens were significant in wood stiffness, growth, stem form and pulpwood traits, but not significant for log end-splitting and sawn board checking traits. The Southern race had the most favourable mean values. Significant additive genetic variation within races was observed in all traits except log-taper, demonstrating that the quality of plantation-grown E. nitens wood products could be improved through breeding. Strongly positive genetic correlations among diameter at breast height (DBH) at ages 4, 9 and 14 years and between DBH all ages and the traits survival, log volume and stem straightness, demonstrated that early-age selection for DBH would not compromise stem straightness and would improve product volume recovery. Log end-splitting was under moderate genetic control but there was a negative genetic correlation between end-splitting and solidwood product volume. Sawn board and veneer sheet stiffness was highly heritable, and strongly correlated with acoustic wave velocity (AWV), measured in standing trees and logs. Consistent with previous studies in E. nitens, wood basic density, near infra red-(NIR) predicted kraft pulp yield (KPY) and cellulose content (CC) had moderate-to-high heritabilities, although coefficients of additive genetic variation for these traits were small. Estimated genetic correlations between standing tree AWV and each of the traits veneer sheet modulus of elasticity (MOE), sawn-board MOE, KPY, CC and basic density were highly significant and strongly positive, suggesting that standing tree AWV could be adopted as an indirect non-destructive selection criterion for improving solid-wood product stiffness, while simultaneously improving wood chemical traits favoured by the pulpwood industry. Basic density had no significant genetic relationship with KPY and CC, although other studies have reported moderate to strong significant values. Surface and internal checking in sawn boards, which are important defects leading to value downgrade, were shown to be under moderate levels of additive genetic control. Internal checking in wedges cut from log disks and in wafer sections cross-cut from processed boards were strongly and positively genetically correlated. However, the genetic correlation of checking traits with density and AWV were generally not significant. Work presented in this thesis clearly demonstrates the potential for genetic improvement of E. nitens for pulpwood, sawn-boards and veneer production. A new method of tracking trees in processing studies has been established. Methods for assessing checking have been developed, and the utility of nondestructive AWV and NIR techniques has been confirmed for use in E. nitens breeding programs, aiming to simultaneously improve the quality and recovered volume of pulpwood and solid-wood products...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Astronium graveolens Jacq., also {{commonly}} known as "Gateado" or "Gateado Galán," is a timber tree often used for making fine furniture, decorative sliced <b>veneer,</b> <b>sawn,</b> keels and long structures such as beams and trusses posts (1 - 2). The species are used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat allergies, inflammation, diarrhea and ulcers. Previous phytochemical studies report the presence of gallotannins as galloylglucose compounds, trans-ocimene (3) and flavonoids. In this work, we reported the isolation of known compounds as chlorogenic acid, quercitrin, quercetin 3 -O-glucoside (4) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (5). Studies report an interesting anti-angiogenic activity for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (6), we evaluated its ability to bind and inhibit the Human Placental Growth Factor (hPlGF), a key mediator of pathological angiogenesis. Materials and Methods. The leaves of Astronium graveolens collected (July 2010) at the Experimental Station "Caparo,― Barinas State, Venezuela were defatted with n-hexane and successively extracted for 48 h with chloroform and and methanol, to give 8. 5, 8. 0 and 8. 3 g of the respective residues. A portion of methanol extract (2. 5 g), was chromatographed on Sephadex LH- 20 using MeOH as eluent. A total of 106 fractions were collected (8 ml each) and combined by TLC results on silica 60 F 254 gel-coated glass sheets with n-BuOH–AcOH–H 2 O (60 : 15 : 25) and CHCl 3 –MeOH–H 2 O (40 : 9 : 1), to give 11 pooled fractions (A–K). The fractions more interesting were purified by RP-HPLC. The structures of isolated compounds were elucidated by 1 D- and 2 D-NMR Spectroscopy (1 H, 13 C, 13 C DEPT, DQF-COSY, HSQC, HMBC, ROESY) and confirmed by mass spectrometry studies. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) was used to study the interaction of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose and the h-PlGF binding to its receptor (h-VEGF-R 1 or h-Flt- 1); the concentrations are: 0, 5 mg for h-Flt- 1, 10 ng for h-PlGF, 0, 5 mg for the biotinylated antibody and 200, 100, 50, 25, 12, 5, 6, 25, 3, 12 μM for the natural compound. Finally, we measured the binding affinity between 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose and h-PlGF with surface plasmon resonance assays, using Biacore technology. Results and Discussion. The phytochemical study of methanol extract led to isolation of phenolic compounds as chlorogenic acid, quercitrin, quercetin 3 -O-glucoside (4) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (5).
