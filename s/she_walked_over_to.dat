60|$|She {{caught the}} first train after breakfast, and {{in fifteen minutes}} she was at Beverly Farms. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her father's cottage, where she found him smoking his cigar on the veranda.|$|E
60|$|She {{came into}} the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic, for {{easiness}} is one of the qualities mad people most respect. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> him, smiling pleasantly, and held out her hand.|$|E
60|$|Tucked {{under the}} writing-table {{a pair of}} yellow and gold Turkish {{slippers}} of a highly meretricious quality caught her eye. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> them still carrying the trousers in her hands, and stooped to examine them. They were ingenious disguises of gilt paper destructively gummed, it would seem, to Ann Veronicas' best dancing-slippers.|$|E
50|$|Other deleted {{scenes were}} shot {{to wrap up}} many characters' stories after the earthquake. Walt Russell and Dr. Stockle - whose fates are {{undetermined}} after the quake in the theatrical release - were shown alive in the seismology laboratory post-quake. They were shown finding the earthquake's magnitude to be 9.9 on the Richter scale. The film's final scene originally had Denise asking Lew Slade if Stewart had survived; upon hearing of his death, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Corry who has regained consciousness.|$|R
50|$|Max {{pulls into}} a parking garage and {{witnesses}} {{a father and son}} getting into a physical disagreement. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> them, insisting the father back off. The father knocks her out as the son records the scene. The father brings Max to a room where he ties her up by her hands, leaving her dangling from the ceiling. After Ryan gets a copy of the little boy's video on his phone, he brings it to the FBI. Weston returns to assist in finding Max.|$|R
5000|$|Terry is crushed, {{but then}} remembers the pie eating contest. She goes to Duncanty's house and gets {{him to go}} to the contest with her. They go to the contest together. Terry wins and is happy, but then sees Duncanty talking to another girl and gets jealous. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> them and pushes the girl down into the mud and tells Duncanty that she needs him instead of Brett and that Duncanty is the only boy she will ride the Ferris wheel with. They share a kiss.|$|R
60|$|Some {{detached}} instinct {{made her}} {{aware that she}} was gazing at a book which belonged by rights to some {{other part of the}} house. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the shelf, took it down, and returned to her seat, placing the book on the table between them. Ralph opened it and looked at the portrait of a man with a voluminous white shirt-collar, which formed the frontispiece.|$|E
6000|$|... "Give him another," [...] she said, looking Jonathan in the face; {{and when}} that had been done, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the chimney and flung the guilty piece into the reddest of the fire. Its base {{constituents}} began immediately to run; even as she watched it the disc crumbled, and the lineaments of the King became confused. Jonathan, who had followed close behind, beheld these changes from over her shoulder, and his face darkened sorely.|$|E
60|$|As she {{finished}} her work by placing a chair {{on each side of}} the table, a quiet smile, the result of a train of thought in which she had been indulging for the past half-hour, stole over her face. She passed through the kitchen, with a glance at the stove to see if the tea-kettle had begun to boil; and going out of the back door, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the shed where her brother was splitting kindling-wood.|$|E
50|$|The video {{begins with}} Pitbull leaving {{a car and}} {{entering}} a club. The video shows people dancing in black and white, and people firebreathing, along with Marbles, Baker, and Furlan dancing by Pitbull. Pitbull sees a woman (Alejandra Espinoza) coming down stairs and, when she enters the main room, the video turns to color. The woman {{looks very much like}} Jessica Rabbit. Many men (usually with women) stare at her. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Pitbull; they go to a dressing room and passionately make out. The video then ends with Pitbull and the girl leaving the club in his car.|$|R
5000|$|They {{free the}} imprisoned cats, {{set fire to}} the lighthouse, and leave with the prisoners for home. The mood {{immediately}} becomes lighthearted again, as the city regains its artistic merit. The poet is sure to point out that he is no more famous or revered as he was before the incident - just an [...] "anonymity". He is just glad to be able to listen to the sounds of music coming from the streets. As he finishes his typing, just before the story ends, the singer he was enamored with is seen in his room. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> him and affectionately strokes his chin, implying a happy ending for the poet.|$|R
50|$|Carter visits Earth Regina's grave. Earth Morrow informs {{him that}} she died after an unnaturally violent storm. Carter reckons that was when they came into orbit and his Regina died, too. Morrow does not feel this is a coincidence. During this, the two Helenas meet. They reflect on how they were once one person, but are now two {{separate}} individuals existing at the same time. Earth Helena knows her life here is at an end. 'Death' {{is a means of}} returning to herself and to those she loves—especially her husband, John Koenig. She leaves the living unit <b>to</b> find him. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Koenig and, without a word, they share one tender kiss before she dies in his arms.|$|R
6000|$|All {{this set}} her {{thinking}} to some purpose. One day <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{the farm and}} made her way quietly to the back door. By good fortune she found blind Nora hemming napkins and in a mood to converse. Nora was an especially neat seamstress, but required some one to thread her needles. Mary the cook had been doing this, but now Mrs. Clark sat down beside Nora to [...] "hev a little talk" [...] and keep the needles supplied with thread.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; Mark must bid him not come. He {{will not}} wish to pain me when it can do no good. Look here, Mark;" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her brother, and put both her hands upon his arm. [...] "I do love Lord Lufton. I had no such meaning or thought when I first knew him. But I do love him--I love him dearly;--almost as well as Fanny loves you, I suppose. You may tell him so if you think proper--nay, you must tell him so, or he will not {{understand}} me. But tell him this, as coming from me: that I will never marry him, unless his mother asks me." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{traversing}} {{the front}} lawn and having Kasabian search for an open window to the main house, Watson cut the screen of a window. Watson told Kasabian to keep watch down by the gate; <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Steven Parent's AMC Ambassador and waited. He then removed the screen, entered through the window, and let Atkins and Krenwinkel in through the front door.|$|E
6000|$|The youth {{sank back}} again baffled by this all-inclosing acceptance. [...] "What {{do you intend}} to do to-day?" [...] he asked, as <b>she</b> rose and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the little walnut table.|$|R
5000|$|Birdlace is then shown {{getting off}} of a Greyhound bus in San Francisco. Discharged from the Marines, he is walking with a limp (presumably from his {{injuries}} from the explosion), and {{it is suggested that}} his three friends were all killed. He is taken by how much things have changed in the three years since he was last there, with hippies and flower children everywhere. He walks to the neighborhood where Rose's coffee shop is, and goes to a bar across the street to have a drink. The bartender tells him that Rose's mother has turned the coffee shop <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Rose. He then makes his way across the street and into the coffee shop. Rose, not having heard from him in three years, is surprised to see him, and can only say [...] "hi". <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> him, and they fall into an ambiguous embrace, as the film ends.|$|R
5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|R
50|$|During their {{set apart}} time of prayer, on February 26, 1879, Carrie {{engaged in a}} spiritual battle. Finally, she felt {{it was time to}} act in faith and get up out of bed. Unassisted, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the nearby chair. Her healing process was ignited from that day forward. By April of that same year, she was well enough to use the stairs and go outside to visit the neighbors. In the years that followed, she corresponded with Mrs. Mix. At one point Mrs. Mix even came to visit and they went out into the city to pray for healing of those who were sick.|$|E
5000|$|Sammy Keyes {{also has}} lots of problems. On Sammy’s {{first day of school}} she gets {{confused}} about where to go so she ask’s a girl named Heather Acosta [...]When Heather replied she yelled at her and walked away like was a princess.

Once Sammy got the pin out of her but <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> heather and punched her nose, and it started to gush blood. Sammy got suspended for doing that.|$|E
5000|$|Wheel of Fortune {{made her}} first {{appearance}} in July when she was sent to Goodwood for the Richmond Stakes over six furlongs. In this race she competed against colts as she was to do in all her starts in 1878. Ridden by Archer she led from the start and soon had her eleven opponents struggling as she won [...] "very easily" [...] from Peter Flat and the Woodcote Stakes winner Cadogan. The beaten horses included Peter, {{who went on to}} win the Middle Park Stakes. In August she won the Prince of Wales's Stakes at York by half a length from Falmouth 'leading to her being described as [...] "the premier two-year-old of the day". In September she added another prize without having to race as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> win the Wentworth Produce Stakes at Doncaster.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the episode, the four housewives are reading {{different}} parts of the daily papers. Susan scans the front page and sees something. On her calendar she sees a Post-it note on that day's date which reads [...] "Mary Alice's Dinner". <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Lynette's house and there is a flashback of Susan walking into Lynette's house for their weekly poker game. Mary Alice tells the girls that she wants to host a dinner party, for the housewives and their husbands. The girls all agree that {{it is a good idea}} and Mary Alice is excited. When it returns to the present time, Susan shows Lynette the note and the girls soon gather to discuss it. They decided to throw it anyway, as a way to honor Mary Alice. Bree decides to host it at her house, Susan seems rather disappointed that she will be the only housewife without a partner. Mike Delfino passes them jogging and waves to Susan and Susan subtly hints that she has found her date.|$|R
5000|$|The film opens {{somewhere in}} Spain. A lady is {{carrying}} a mug of beer above her head, walking rhythmically {{to the music of}} [...] "Carmen". <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a man in a white suit. The man gives her a coin, and she modestly puts it in her shirt. Then the lady does a quick dance in front of the man in the suit. The man tips her, and the money falls into a container on the floor. The lady just ignores him. Outside the building, a toreador is standing. When he sees the lady, with the man in the suit, he is fuming mad. So, the man in the suit grabs the lady, and soon the two fight over her. This ends with the lady walking away. Then another scene opens with a bullfighting ring and the bull (strangely reminiscent of Clarabelle Cow) and the toreador walk into there. Followed by a few gags and music performances, the toreador finishes up the scene by pulling out the bull's insides.|$|R
60|$|She was by {{no means}} easy in her mind. She loved Nostromo. She turned her eyes upon Giselle, sitting at a distance, with {{something}} of maternal tenderness, and the jealous anguish of a rival outraged in her defeat. Then <b>she</b> rose and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
50|$|Like in 1804, Parasol {{started the}} 1805 {{season in the}} Second Class of the Oatlands Stakes. She started the race as the favourite, but could only finish third, behind winner Giles and runner-up Duxbury. On 30 April at the Newmarket First Spring meeting she {{finished}} last of the three runners, behind winner Walton, in a £50 Subscription race over one mile. Later in the day she walked over for the King's Plate for five-year-old mares. On 1 May she won a £50 Subscription, where Hippocampus finished second and Houghton Lass third. At the Second Spring meeting she faced Walton and Petruchio in the Jockey-Club Plate. Walton started the race as the 4/6 favourite, with Parasol second in the betting at 7/4. Parasol won the race from Walton, with Petruchio finishing last. After a few months off, Parasol returned to the track for the First October meeting. On {{the first day of}} the meeting she walked over for a Subscription of 5 guineas each, before collecting a forfeit from Pipylin. Two days later she walked over for a race work 50 guineas over the four-mile Beacon course. Another day later <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> win the King's Plate for the second year running. At the Second October meeting she beat Sir Harry Dimsdale to win a race for One-third Subscription of 25 guineas each over the Beacon course. This turned out to be her last race of the season, as she was withdrawn from the October Oatlands Stakes.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Hilson {{lounging}} in her bed. Upset by her partner, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{the closet and}} rips down all of his clothes. The video then cuts to Hilson {{sitting in a chair}} at a beauty salon, where she gets a new haircut and dyes her hair from black to blonde. She later begins a choreographed routine with her girlfriends, who appear to also have been mistreated by their men. The women then march down Auburn Avenue before they head home to throw their men's clothes off the balcony. The video received mixed to positive reviews. Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy was positive and called it a [...] "beautifully shot portrait of a woman {{on the edge of a}} nervous breakdown", and The Fader writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd regarded it as an accurate representation of how women act when they are [...] "wronged by dudes". On the other hand, Robbie Daw of Idolator deemed it tiresome, calling it a [...] "visual snoozefest". He wrote, [...] " [...] goes to a salon, orders up Rihanna's Rated R haircut and sasses men who are wrongin' the ladies. Hey, girls—her love has a limit!

5000|$|For {{the first}} round, the {{questioner}} invites the first contestant to begin. He or <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a black chair and sits down. The contestant is then given a set period of time, usually two minutes (one {{minute and a}} half in semi-finals, similarly hereinafter), to answer questions on a specialised subject which he or she has chosen (see examples below). The questioner announces the start of the time period, and then reads out a question. If the contestant gives the correct answer, he or she scores one point, and the questioner then reads out the next question. The contestant may pass (by simply saying [...] "pass") if he or she doesn't know the answer, or prefers not to spend time trying to remember the answer: the questioner does not begin to read the next question until the contestant has given an answer or said [...] "pass". If a question is answered incorrectly, the questioner will give the correct answer before reading out the next question; this uses some of the contestant's remaining time. However, if the contestant passes, the questioner moves straight on to the next question: the answer is not read out {{until the end of the}} round.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} view of Ciara's face which is quickly {{followed}} with a silhouette of Ciara dancing the two scene's switch multiple times. As the video progresses the video moves to Ciara walking into a party which is followed by Ciara mingling with people at the party. She is then joined by two dancers and they begin to perform a short routine. After the routine <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Future and the music stops at a [...] "manor house". The song by Future, [...] "Karate Chop" [...] can also be heard in the background. There is small dialogue between the two where Ciara is [...] "flirting with Future" [...] saying [...] "Oh, so you been watching me," [...] with Future responding saying [...] "You're not hard to miss," [...] and thereafter the music resumes.The scene then changes to Ciara and Future in a bedroom where Future is sat smoking a cigar while Ciara is giving him a private striptease, dancing on the floor and around him in black lace lingerie and black heels. Once again the music stops and Ciara and Future share another scene where they share a dialogue, the music continues again. The video finally ends with Ciara and Future at the party dancing together.|$|R

2500|$|Zsa Zsa {{arrives in}} the show's setting of Albert Square, jumping the {{barriers}} at the tube station. She sees Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) selling T-shirts and makes up a story about her boyfriend dying {{in a car crash}} in order to distract Whitney so she can shoplift. She then heads to the café where she overhears Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan) breaking up with Peter Beale (Thomas Law), and she talks to Peter outside. Peter's sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield) decides to hold a party at 89b George Street, and Peter invites Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa asks Peter who lives there, and he says nobody does.

Soon back at the house, Selima walks in, unaware that John is there. John begs to see his son and soon Selima walks away not before John can stop them. Here, John meets his son Manda for the first time. When Belansai hears news that John is spending time with his wife, he sneaks in to try to kill John but only manages to hurt him with a razor. The next morning, Henry reveals to John his past about his own 'sleeping dictionary', which resulted in the birth of another child: Selima. When Belansai is caught for trying to kill an officer, he is sentenced to be hanged. Selima is not happy that Belansai will be killed as he's been a good father to Manda.

Later that night, Selima tries to break Belansai out, not knowing John is already there. When <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the jail cell, she sees John breaking Belansai out and handing him a gun.

5000|$|The video {{opens with}} a scene of lead singer Nina Persson, {{at the side of}} a desert road, trying to find a {{suitable}} rock. Meanwhile, the radio DJ, who is heard from the car radio, warns drivers that desert temperatures are very hot that day so they must remember to drive safely. When Persson finds a rock, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her car, a dark blue 1974 Cadillac Eldorado convertible, places it on the accelerator to keep the pedal down and drives off as the song begins. During the video, she weaves back and forth onto {{the wrong side of the}} road, forcing many other drivers off the road and causing some to crash in the process. At one point in the video, she throws the Felix the Cat stuffed toy out of the car which was then run over by another car. In some versions of the video, the Felix the Cat doll is blurred out. At various stages of the video, she is also depicted using her feet to steer the steering wheel. There is a large and colourful tattoo on Persson's arm that was added for the video. She also drives at pedestrians causing them to jump out of the way while driving through a small town. At the beginning of the last chorus, she turns the car around and drives back down the road where she caused so much destruction. Towards the end of the song, she stands up in the car seat, keeping the car in control with her foot on the steering wheel. She steers into a collision course with an oncoming van, containing the other members of The Cardigans, with drummer Bengt Lagerberg as the driver. While the van's occupants react in horror, she calmly stretches out her arms and makes a cruciform for a moment before the two vehicles collide as the song ends. The DJ sounds the State Patrol's warning [...] "on a high-speed out-of-control vehicle on Route 666" [...] and passes on to commercial.|$|R

Wilder later remarked that she was at the front lines more than Eisenhower. Her revue, with Danny Thomas as her opening act, included songs from her films, performances on her musical saw (a skill she had originally acquired for stage appearances in Berlin in the 1920s) and a pretend [...] "mindreading" [...] act. Dietrich would inform the audience that she could read minds and ask them to concentrate on whatever came into their minds. Then <b>she</b> would <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a soldier and earnestly tell him, [...] "Oh, think of something else. I can't possibly talk about that!"

He felt a certain excitement, and the {{movement}} of his thoughts kept pace with that of his brush. It was very true that she posed admirably; she was a fine creature to paint. Her prettiness inspired him, and also her audacity, as he was content to regard it for the moment. He wondered about her--who she was, and what she was--perceiving that the so-called audacity was not vulgar boldness, but the play of an original and probably interesting character. It was obvious that she was a perfect lady, but it was equally obvious that she was irregularly clever. Longueville's little figure was a success--a charming success, he thought, as he put on the last touches. While he was doing this, his model's companion came into view. She came out of the church, pausing a moment as she looked from her daughter to the young man {{in the corner of the}} terrace; then <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> straight <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the young girl. She was a delicate little gentlewoman, with a light, quick step.|$|R
