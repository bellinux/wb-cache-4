5|$|Although {{thunderstorm}} {{activity was}} initially minimal around {{the center of}} circulation, convective band associated with the depression was becoming more organized. Late on September10, convection began to increase slightly near the center, though because Dvorak intensity T-numbers were between 2.0 and 2.5, the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm. However, dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease later that day. Initially, it headed just north of due west around the southern periphery of a large subtropical ridge. However, by September11, the depression re-curved northwestward. Later that day, the depression began to regain deep convection. Geostationary satellite imagery and <b>scatterometer</b> data indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000UTC on September12.|$|E
5|$|Early on August28, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{an unusually}} vigorous tropical wavean elongated area of low air pressureinland over West Africa. Trailed by widespread cloudiness, the wave tracked {{toward the open}} Atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within the lower atmosphere near Guinea's coastline. The disturbance veered toward the northwest and entered the ocean off Conakry around 18:00UTC, August29. By that time, the NHC was predicting a favorable environment for tropical cyclone development within the next 48hours; heavy thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure center. Around midnight August30, satellite images and <b>scatterometer</b> data confirmed that a tropical depression had formed about 300miles (480km) west-northwest of Conakry, with wind speeds of 35mph (55km/h).|$|E
5|$|Marked {{structural}} improvements {{took place}} on October17 and the NHC assessed a high probability of the system becoming a tropical cyclone within 48hours. That evening, corroborating data from ships, satellite imagery, and <b>scatterometer</b> estimates indicated {{the formation of a}} tropical depression by 12:00UTC. With the cyclone located over warm waters of 86°F (30°C) and within a very moist region with low wind shear, intensification was a certainty as the depression approached Mexico. Uncertainties existed as to how fast the system would move. Some forecast models depicting the system as stalling just offshore for several days, though forecasters indicated that a steady northward movement would lead to dissipation within 48hours.|$|E

5|$|In late July2014, {{computer}} models began {{to indicate the}} possible formation of a low-pressure area {{off the coast of}} southwestern Mexico, prompting the National Hurricane Center(NHC) to assess the region with a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis on July24. These forecasts began to come to fruition on July28 when an area of thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave developed off the Mexican coast. Tracking westward in favorable conditions, the system organized over the following days. A tropical depression formed by 12:00UTC on July31. 6 hours later, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Iselle due to the system's organization and the detection of tropical storm-force winds by the MetOp-B <b>scatterometer.</b> At the time, Iselle was located roughly 1,075mi (1,730km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. Steady intensification continued after formation, with the NHC indicating the possibility of rapid intensification. on August1, Iselle began to develop an eye, and this progressive pattern of organization prompted the NHC to upgrade the storm to hurricane status at 00:00UTC the following day.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Hurricane Ophelia is attributed {{in part to}} a low-latitude tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa in mid-September. As the wave tracked westward, it began to interact with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and was subsequently introduced with a low chance of tropical development in the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) 48-hour Tropical Weather Outlook. Though atmospheric wind shear was only marginally favorable, the cloud pattern organized, and a surface low-pressure area developed in association with the disturbance. Deep shower and thunderstorm activity continued to fire as the disturbance moved in a general westward motion, and it was assessed with a high chance of development by early on September19. Following satellite trends and data from the Advanced <b>Scatterometer,</b> the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression at 1800UTC the following day, while positioned roughly 1300mi (2090km) east of the Lesser Antilles, and to a tropical storm six hours later.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} {{becoming}} a depression on September20, strong wind shear caused convection to diminish. However, data from an ASCAT <b>scatterometer</b> pass revealed that the system attained gale-force winds, resulting in the depression being upgraded to a tropical storm on 0000 UTC September21. Operationally, the first advisory on storm was not issued until 1200 UTC, where it was named Georgette. Meanwhile, thunderstorm activity increased {{near the center of}} the storm. Little change took place throughout the day as the storm approached Baja California Sur. Around 1800UTC, Georgette made landfall near San Jose del Cabo with winds of 40mph (65km/h). Additionally, a barometric pressure of 999mbar (hPa; 29.5inHg) was measured. Shortly before entering the Gulf of California, Georgette weakened to a tropical depression. Maintaining winds of 35mph (55km/h), the storm later made a second landfall near San Carlos in Sonora. Shortly after moving inland, the low-level circulation dissipated over the mountains of western Mexico.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Colin {{can be traced}} back to an {{elongated}} tropical wave that moved westward from Nigeria to Senegal on July28. A nearly stationary trough separated from the wave as it continued westward. A larger tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa a few days later. A broad area of low pressure resulted from the consolidation of the two waves on August1, when it was situated about 750mi (1210km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. Over the course of the next 24 hours, shower and thunderstorm activity became increasingly consolidated with the low, but the system lacked a well-defined circulation to be considered a tropical cyclone at the time. However, on the next day, an Advanced <b>Scatterometer</b> (ASCAT) pass revealed that the circulation center had become sufficiently defined, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Four at 1200UTC on August2. Further organization occurred as the depression moved around the southern periphery of a strong subtropical ridge. Thunderstorm activity became increasingly defined, and it is estimated that the depression became Tropical Storm Colin at 0600UTC on August3 while centered 840mi (1350km) east of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Hurricane Celia was first identified on June5, 2010 by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as a disorganized area of disturbed weather {{associated with a}} tropical wave off the western coast of Africa in the Atlantic Ocean. Tracking westward, little development took place and the system eventually crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on June17. Situated several hundred miles south-southeast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, the disturbance moved slowly towards the west-northwest and little development was expected to occur. By June18, <b>scatterometer</b> data of the system indicated that a surface circulation had developed and the system's overall structure had become increasingly organized. Later that day, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued for the system as it was now anticipated to become a tropical cyclone within 48hours. At this time, convective banding features had begun wrapping around the system; however, it lacked deep, central cloud cover. Further development {{was expected to be}} slow due to moderate wind shear in the region of the low. Around 1800UTC, the system had become sufficiently organized for the NHC to designate it as a tropical depression. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 370mi (595km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not warned upon until early the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Upon being classified, the {{disturbance}} had a broad circulation that {{was difficult to}} locate, with moderate convection in its eastern periphery. The thunderstorms organized further, and MFR upgraded {{the disturbance}} to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on February19. Three hours later, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 16S, and at 0600UTC that day, MFR upgraded the depression to a moderate tropical storm after an advanced <b>scatterometer</b> indicated winds of over 65km/h (40mph); as a result, the National Weather Service of Madagascar gave it the name Haruna. By that time, the circulation had become better organized with increased rainbands, and with an anticyclone aloft, the storm developed well-defined outflow. The structure of Haruna continued to become more symmetrical with a large radius of maximum winds, developing a ragged eye early on February20. Based on the improved appearance, MFR upgraded Haruna to a severe tropical storm at 0000UTC that day. About 12hours later, the agency upgraded Haruna further to tropical cyclone status, with 10minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). That day, an approaching trough weakened the ridge to the south, causing the cyclone to slow and move erratically. While Haruna was approaching the southwestern coast of Madagascar, it developed a 120km (75mi) wide eye, and the eyewall passed over Europa Island. Initially, MFR estimated that the storm would intensify to intense tropical cyclone status, and the agency assessed that Haruna reached 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph) on February20. The next day, JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). In contrast, MFR estimated {{at that time that}} the cyclone had peaked when the eyewall thunderstorms warmed, followed by the eye becoming less organized and the winds decreasing.|$|E

25|$|The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) {{indicated}} that a tropical depression had formed northwest of Guam at noon on August 17. A few hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) quickly issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert and also upgraded the system to a tropical depression with the designation 10W on the same day, based on increased symmetric convection associated with a defined but partially exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC) that was embedded within the southwest monsoon surge. One day later, the JTWC upgraded 10W to a tropical storm via the Dvorak technique, with the winds proved by a recent <b>scatterometer</b> pass. The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Mindulle early on August 19, when central convection had become more organized. However, an upper-level low {{to the north and}} the predecessor of Tropical Storm Kompasu to the northeast were stifling the development of any poleward outflow.|$|E
25|$|On July 25, 2016, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} wave over the eastern Atlantic {{along the coast}} of West Africa. The wave's emergence over water was accompanied by a surge in moisture, leading to the development of scattered convection. Early on July 26, a 1010mbar (hPa; 29.83inHg) surface low developed along the wave axis (confirmed by <b>scatterometer</b> data and nearby observations); however, this feature was transient and soon dissipated. Moving quickly westward, the system was expected to encounter more favorable conditions for development within three days. The rapid motion prevented initial development, resulting in poor organization of the associated convection. The thunderstorms increased on July 30 as the wave began moving through the Lesser Antilles, assisted by above-normal water temperatures and light wind shear. Despite more convective organization and the presence of strong winds, the lack of a surface circulation prevented the system from being classified as a tropical cyclone. On July 31, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea while continuing its fast forward motion.|$|E
25|$|Early on November9, an Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit pass of {{the system}} {{revealed}} a mid-level eye feature, indicative of an intensifying system. However, shallow convection along with <b>scatterometer</b> data showed no strengthening. The IMD assessed the system to have become a deep depression around this time and attained its peak intensity, with three-minute sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph) and a barometric pressure of 1002mbar (hPa; 29.59inHg). The JTWC estimated the system to have been slightly stronger at its peak, with one-minute sustained winds of 75km/h (45mph). Continued moderate wind shear displaced most convection to the northwest {{of the center of}} circulation, counteracting the favorable poleward outflow which was enhanced by the mid-latitude westerlies. The wind shear took its toll by November10, leaving the storm's center devoid of showers and thunderstorms. More pronounced decay took place later in the day as the storm neared the coastline, with land interaction disrupting the circulation. Between 2300UTC on November10 and 0000UTC on November11, the deep depression made landfall along the border of the Nugal and Bari regions. Based on estimates from the JTWC, the system became only the fifth known tropical storm to strike the country since 1966, when accurate satellite measurements were started. Retaining some organized convection, the system gradually weakened as it moved inland; it was last noted by the IMD later on November11 as it neared Ethiopia.|$|E

500|$|A {{tropical}} wave, {{which was}} accompanied by a broad surface low pressure area, emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa late on August26.

By August29, the system became increasingly organized as showers and thunderstorms concentrated toward the center. Based on Dvorak satellite classifications and <b>scatterometer</b> surface wind data, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Twelve developed at 0000UTC on August30, while located about [...] east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands. Situated to the south of a subtropical ridge, the system tracked west-northwestward over warm waters. As a result, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Leslie by 1200UTC on August30.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the storm}} was disorganized, a <b>scatterometer</b> pass {{indicated}} tropical storm force winds extended outward up to [...] The satellite appearance of Nadine became more ragged by September14.

Nadine turned northward on September14 as it tracked along the periphery of a subtropical ridge. Shortly thereafter, a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass indicated that core convection began re-organizing. However, because wind shear displaced the mid-level circulation {{to the north of the}} low-level circulation, Nadine was not upgraded to a hurricane. Because Nadine would approach colder sea surface temperatures, significant strengthening was considered unlikely. Due to an increase in satellite intensity estimates and re-organization, Nadine was upgraded to a hurricane at 1800UTC on September14.

500|$|Hurricane Cosme can {{be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that formed on the west coast of Africa on or around June8. That westward moving wave, which was also responsible for the formation of Tropical Storm Barry in the Caribbean Sea, eventually reached the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The progress of the wave was slowed by a southwesterly movement within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. During the morning hours of June20, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a broad area of disturbed weather several hundred miles southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Assessed with a low chance of tropical cyclone formation within a two-day interval, conditions at the time were unfavorable but expected to become more conducive for development over subsequent days. As the disturbance tracked generally west-northwestward, a broad area of low pressure developed; the NHC increased the chances of formation accordingly. Convection – shower and thunderstorm activity – became steadily concentrated around the low-level center and spiral banding became evident. Following organizational improvement on satellite and microwave images, the system became Tropical Depression Three-E at 12:00UTC on June23 while located about [...] south of Manzanillo, Colima. Several hours later, the NHC stated that, [...] "the largest negative factor is probably the size of the depression...which could keep it from rapidly intensifying." [...] The depression did not become better organized initially, with meager central convection and a lack of well-defined cloud features; by early on June24, however, shower and thunderstorm activity began forming over the center.

A pulse in the Madden–Julian oscillation, coupled with a convective Kelvin wave allowed the system, along with its Southern Hemisphere counterpart Tropical Storm Jamala, to further develop. Following additional organization, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the low on May10. Despite an increase in wind shear, causing the low to become dislocated from the deepest convection, the system further intensified and a <b>scatterometer</b> pass from the Oceansat-2 satellite indicated winds up to [...] In light of this data, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 01B while it was situated roughly [...] south of Chittagong, Bangladesh. At the time, the agency anticipated significant strengthening of the cyclone, forecasting it to attain winds in excess of 155km/h (100mph).
