40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} titanium carbide {{in the form}} of <b>sintered</b> <b>rod</b> and thin film was investigated, in relation to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in acidic and alkaline medium. The exchange current. density, io, and the charge transfer coefficient, oc, were measured for the two types of cathode. In the case of sintered TiC, the io values vary from (2. 7 +/- 0. 4) x 10 (- 6) (as measured in alkaline medium) to (3. 5 +/- 0. 2) x 10 (- 3) A m(- 2) (as measured in acidic medium). This latter value (together with the a value) reveals that TiC cathodes are even more efficient than Pd in acid medium. Both types of TiC cathode are very stable in acid medium, also for prolonged electrolysis times. The study of the role played by the electroactive species concentration (i. e., [H 3 O+] or [OH-]), reveals that the sintered TiC cathode efficiency is higher at low acid concentration or {{in the presence of a}} supporting electrolyte. The minimum electric power necessary to drive the HER at a given rate is here evaluated. (c) 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|When {{we use the}} {{traditional}} composition of the batch mixture {{in the production of}} cinder, the proportion of Mo in the granules is reduced to 4 % (Table 1). In addition, it is known that the presence of kaolin in cinder makes difficult sublimating rhenium oxide and impairs its commodity indices such as the fullness of ammonia leaching, Au and Ag extraction from a cake. To improve these technical and economic indicators was an idea to replace, completely or partially, kaolin with organic binder to be burned at a sintering of Mo-concentrate and causing no dilution of the product. The purpose of our study is to develop such a binder for JSC "Almalyk GMK" with the specific requirements. It should not contain any "technological poisons" (such as phosphates) adversely affecting the redistribution of cinder: leaching, sorption of Mo (VI) ions, hydrogen reduction to metal, <b>sintering</b> <b>rods...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} different properties of synthesized perovskite Sm 0. 9 Sr 0. 1 CoO 3 -δ {{and its potential}} for application in potentiometric oxygen sensors. Design/methodology/approach – The powder was obtained through solid-state reaction method and characterized by thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyzer and X-ray diffraction. It was used for both making a paste and pressing into <b>rods</b> for <b>sintering.</b> The prepared paste was deposited on alumina and yttria-stabilized zirconia substrates, by screen printing. Thick film conductivity, bulk conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of <b>sintered</b> <b>rods</b> were measured {{as a function of}} temperature. An oxygen concentration cell was fabricated with the screen-printed perovskite material as electrodes. Findings – Electrical conductivity of the bulk sample and thick film increases with the increase in temperature, showing semiconductor-like behavior, which is also indicated by relatively high values of the measured Seebeck coefficient. Estimated values of the activation energy for conduction are found to be of the same magnitude as those reported in the literature for similar composition. An investigation of Nernstian behavior of the fabricated cell confirmed that Sm 0. 9 Sr 0. 1 CoO 3 -δ is a promising material for application in oxygen potentiometric sensors. Originality/value – Gas sensor research is focused on the development of new sensitive materials. Although there is scarce information on SmCoO 3 -δ in the literature, it is mostly investigated for fuel cell applications.

40|$|The {{influence}} of pitch (vertical yaw) angle on the penetration reduction of rod projectiles into oblique targets {{has been investigated}} for tungsten <b>sinter</b> alloy <b>rods</b> with a blunt nose and L/D = 20. Semi-infinite RHA targets with an obliquity of 30 deg, 45 deg, and 60 deg were impacted at 1650 m/s. The pitch angles were varied between ± 90 deg. The strong asymmetric behavior of the target crater is dependent on whether the pitch is positive or negative relative to the obliquity of the target. The experiments provide a good overview of the penetration characteristics of long rods for the whole pitch angle range.

40|$|The use of {{non-metallic}} {{materials in}} armor {{has become more}} and more of interest during the last years. The optimal application of such materials supposes the understanding of the interaction process between projectile and target. To achieve this goal, the depth of penetration method, the time-resolved observation method and the laminated target test are applied to obtain information on the interaction process, the protection ranking of the non-metallic materials and the optimal construction of real targets. These three methods are discussed and applied to a series of ceramics and composites. The projectiles are tungsten <b>sinter</b> alloy <b>rods</b> with length-to-diameter ratio L/D = 12. 5; the impact velocities are 1500, 1700 and 1800 km/s. It is shown that the three methods look at special aspects of the problem and complement each other. The depth of penetration method mainly delivers the protection ranking of the non-metallic materials. The time-resolved observation with the flash X-ray techni que makes it possible to obtain pictures of the projectile inside the non-metallic material. Applying the fluid-jet model, the protection performance can be characterized by the dynamic strength parameter R. The laminated target test provides information on the non-metallic material ranking and the optimal construction of real laminated targets...|$|R
40|$|Extremely {{high quality}} ceramic powders have been {{synthesized}} from SiH 4, NH 3 and CH 4 reactant gasses that are heated by absorbing energy emitted from a CO 2 laser. Resulting Si, Si 3 N 4 and SiC powders have been characterized {{in terms of}} parameters which are important for densification processes. The powders are virtually ideal. The fully dispersible powders have mean diameters ranging from 0. 1 - 0. 3 pm {{with a standard deviation}} that is typically 25 - 45 %. As-synthesized powders are extremely high purity because the synthesis equipment is hermetic and cold-walled. The synthesis process has been modeled on a macro scale with respect to heat- transfer, fluid-flow and stability criteria. These results have permitted the process to be scaled safely to production rates up to 8 - 40 tons/year/nozzle. The particle formation and growth processes have also been analyzed experimentally and analytically in terms of a collision-coalescence model. Application of these models permitted particle sizes to be increased to useful dimensions while retaining complete dispersibility. Compound particles form by a 2 -step reaction sequence between molten silicon particles and a reactive atmosphere only after the Si particles have grown to desired dimensions. The process is extremely efficient; > 95 % of the SiH 4 is reacted in a single pass through the laser beam and approximately 2 kwhr of energy are required per kilo of powder. Manufacturing costs are projected to be $ 1. 50 - 5. 00 /kg plus the cost of the reactants. Resulting powders have been dispersed and shaped into flaw-free, maximum density green parts; colloidal pressing and centrifugal sedimentation techniques have been used successfully. Reaction bonded silicon nitride (RBSN) forms from the Si powders in unusually rapid, low temperature (e. g. 1150 C, 1 hr and 1250 °C, 10 min) exposures. The SiC powders sinter to virtually full density in 1 hr at 2050 0 C. The properties of both RBSN and sintered SiC (SSC) parts made from the lasersynthesized powders are excellent. RBSN strengths (up to 690 MPa) are 3 - 5 times values normally observed at the same densities and are in the range normally associated with fully dense alpha-Si 3 N 4. The strengths of the SSC parts are also much higher than are normally observed (up to 714 MPa). The oxidation resistance of the RBSN is approximately 10 times better than conventional RBSN and 5 - 10 times better than commercial hot pressed Si 3 N 4 (HPSN) for 1000 and 14000 C air exposures. The superior properties and consolidation kinetics result directly from the high quality of the green parts and the purity levels maintained in the powders through the firing stage, As a separate topic, the surface tensions and densities of A 1203 melts with MgO, TiO 2 and ZrO 2 additions were measured in air, He and He-H 2 atmospheres using the pendant-drop technique. Melts on the bottom ends of <b>sintered</b> <b>rods</b> were formed by CO 2 laser heating. A curve fitting technique was developed that improved the experimental accuracy of analyzing the short pendant drops that are characteristic of these materials.

40|$|Spherical, rod and fibrous {{morphology}} of Hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles {{were considered}} to understand the densification behaviour at high temperature. Thermal analysis of as-received HA nanoparticles confirmed the phase transformation temperature for different morphologies.

Spherical, <b>rod</b> and fibrous nano-HA morphology were stable up to 1200 oC, 700 oC and 1000 oC, respectively, which were decomposed to beta tricalcium phosphate ( – TCP) beyond these critical temperatures. Dilatometric study of all green specimens prepared from such nanoparticles was conducted up to 1250 oC to synchronize the sintering temperature. The densification behaviour was dramatically changed with respect to morphology when sintered at different temperatures; such as 700 oC, 900 oC, 1000 oC, 1250 oC, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, nanocomposites of {{hydroxyapatite}} and Pluronic F 127 {{were prepared}} by a wet chemical method, using acid-basic reaction with Ca/P ratio of 1. 67 in 10 % (m/V) Pluronic F 127 at 0, 37 and 90 oC. The final concentration of Pluronic F 127 was adjusted to 37 % (m/V) at 4 oC. Afterwards, {{the samples were}} lyophilized. Characterization was performed in purified samples (after Pluronic F 127 removal), samples with 10 % (m/V) of Pluronic F 127 and calcined samples at 1000 oC by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Analyses by XRD of non-calcined samples showed that hydroxyapatite was obtained, in which the samples prepared at 0 oC exhibited larger peaks attributed to lower crystallite sizes. For the calcined samples, both Raman spectroscopy and XRD exhibited hydroxyapatite for the syntheses at 37 and 90 oC whereas the one prepared 90 oC were identified as β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP). Morphological analysis by SEM indicated that the hydroxyapatite was sphere or rod agglomerates in mesoporous morphology for the nanocomposites prepared at 0 and 37 oC, while the sample prepared at 90 oC was nanospheres agglomerated into a smother matrix. After Pluronic F 127 removal, samples fabricated at 0 and 37 oC exhibited coalescence of the nanostructures, whereas the sample synthesized at 90 oC kept mesoporous.

40|$|The {{fracture}} {{of the target}} and projectile during normal penetration is described using a model of chaotic disintegration modifying the theory of chaotic disintegration of liquids. The radius of the locally smallest fragment is calculated equating its kinetic energy of deformation with its surface energy of fracture. The probability of lacunae opening in the target and projectile materials increases near the target/projectile interface. The percolation threshold for this probability determines the boundary of the fractured zone. When this fractured zone reaches the rear surface of the target the fragments can leave it. Mass distribution of the fragments was calculated {{with the help of}} percolation theory. Then, the shape of the debris cloud and the direction, velocity and range of its propagation are calculated to estimate vulnerability behind the perforated target. The calculations were compared with results of normal impact experiments performed with tungsten <b>sinter</b> all oy <b>rods</b> (D = 20 mm, L/D = 6) against 40 and 70 mm rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) at an impact velocity of 1700 m/s. For observation of the bulging, breakup and fragmentation of the bulge as well as debris cloud formation and expansion, flash X-ray and laser stroboscope techniques have been applied. From the X-ray photographs and soft recovery tests the shape of the debris cloud and velocity field of the fragments as well as the fragment number and mass distributions have been determined, respectively.

40|$|A new {{procedure}} for preparing {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) /poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) 1 - 3 composites with both phases piezoelectrically active is described. <b>Sintered</b> PZT <b>rods</b> are inserted into a prepoled copolymer matrix, and the composite is repoled under a lower electric field. Using this new procedure, the dipoles in the two phases are aligned in either the same or opposite directions. Composite disks, of 12. 7 -cm diameter and 0. 33 - to 0. 60 -mm thicknesses, have been fabricated with PZT rods of 0. 8 or 1 mm diameter distributed in a square pattern with 3 mm center-to-center separation. The ceramic volume contents of the composite disks are 3. 6 and 5. 6 %, respectively. The resonance characteristics of the composite disks consist of the resonance modes of the two constituent phases, but they are dominated by the coupled longitudinal thickness mode (H-mode) of the PZT rods. The coupled radial mode (L-mode) resonance of the PZT rods is significant only for thin disks. The observed resonance frequencies of the H- and L-modes agree well with the values calculated from the coupling theory. The thickness mode resonance of the copolymer matrix (T-mode) is present but hardly observable in thick disks. The composite disks have been fabricated into transducers with air-backing and with no front face matching layer, and their performance characteristics have been evaluated in water. The transmitting and receiving voltage responses of a PZT/P(VDF-TrFE) composite transducer are better than those of a PZT/epoxy composite transducer. The transmitting and receiving voltage responses are improved when the PZT rods and copolymer matrix are poled in opposite directions, especially when the resonance frequencies of the H- and T-modes are approximately equal. When the phases are poled {{in the same direction}} and the resonance peaks associated with the H- and T-modes just overlap, the bandwidth is improved. Using 0. 33 -mm thick composite disks, a transducer can be produced with three operating frequencies by poling the constituent phases in the same direction, or with two operating frequencies at equal efficiency by poling the constituent phases in opposite directions. The PZT/P(VDFTrFE) 1 - 3 composite transducer, especially the one with multiple operating frequencies, should be very promising in the applications of medical ultrasonic imaging.

40|$|Preform is an {{intermediate}} {{product in the}} optical fiber manufacturing process. There are three major processes used in the manufacturing of preform. These are MCVD (Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) process, ACVD (Atmospheric Chemical Vapor Deposition) process and VAD (Vapor Axial Deposition) process. In the ACVD process {{it is difficult to}} predict the outer preform diameter as it depends on many in-process parameters like density of soot glass deposited, cross sectional area (CSA) of glass to be deposited on the target core <b>rod,</b> <b>sintering</b> speed, furnace temperature and helium flow in the sinter tube during consolidation process. Diameter of preform must be within the limits according to the set up of drawing furnace.

We report here a linear relationship between density of soot glass, cross sectional area (CSA) of glass to be deposited on the core rod and final preform diameter after sintering process using a multiple regression technique.

5000|$|The first Zetec-branded {{engine was}} the Zeta family, {{introduced}} for the 1992 model year powering the fifth {{generation of the}} European Ford Escort, the third generation Orion and the Mk.3 Fiesta. The engine was originally available in 1.6 and 1.8 liter versions with a 2.0 liter version appearing in 1993 in the all-new Mondeo. The [...] "Zeta" [...] name was dropped in favour of [...] "Zetec" [...] when Italian car maker Lancia threatened to sue Ford for trademark infringement.The codename [...] "Zeta" [...] was originally used {{for the design of}} the cylinder head. A number of different systems were evaluated, and each one had a different codename using the Greek alphabet. The Zeta concept was the winner and the 4-valve-per-cylinder, DOHC design was used for the head of the replacement for the CVH in Europe and the US. The original manufacturing plan involved replacing the Dearborn manufactured CVH with Zeta. This resulted in the need to retain much of the architecture of the US CVH block. However, later in the development process, the plan was changed and the Chihuahua engine plant in Mexico was rebuilt to allow manufacture of the US engines. For Europe the decision was taken to build Zetas in Bridgend (Replacing CVH) and in Cologne.The US (2.0L) and European base engines were almost identical. However, crucially, the US management insisted that the US engines had to be [...] "freewheeling", or a non-interference engine design. The fuel economy penalty with the freewheeling system (around 1-2%) was considered to be too great for European engines. The result was that the engines used different pistons.

40|$|Fuel {{performance}} {{models have}} been developed to assess the performance of internally and externally cooled LWR annular fuel. Such fuel may be operated at 30 - 50 % higher core power density than the current operating LWRs, and to a burnup of 80 - 100 MWd/kgU. The models are used to optimize the fuel design so that it is able to achieve high power density and high burnup, and to identify the features of this fuel that will impact its operation limits. The annular fuel performance codes have been developed based on the NRC licensed FRAPCON- 3 code with major modifications to the code structure and with implementation of new fuel performance models. A heat split calculation was enabled by adding a heat flux iteration loop. The radial power peaking and the rim effects at both the inner and outer fuel surfaces have been modeled by a modified radial power/burnup fit to the neutronic calculations. The temperature profile calculation method was updated with new boundary conditions and meshing scheme to capture the internal cooling and the double power peaking at the rims. The annular fuel performance codes are able to simulate both sintered annular fuel and Vibration- Packing (VIPAC) fuel with internal and external cooling. (cont.) For the sintered annular fuel, the anchor ring location of fuel thermal expansion is determined to be the innermost ring, and the fuel dimensions are calculated considering the effects of thermal expansion, swelling and densification. Fuel relocation is assessed via a new empirical model that has been implemented in the code. A fuel cladding mechanical interaction model has been developed with three regimes: the free standing cladding regime, the single closure regime and the fuel cladding full contact regime. The interaction mechanisms for each regime are analyzed and solutions are provided. A low temperature fission gas release model is implemented for sintered annular fuel by taking into account the double surface effects. It is found that the <b>sintered</b> annular fuel <b>rod</b> has lower fission gas release than that of a solid IPWR rod at the same power density. The cladding hydrogen concentration and the oxide accumulation of the annular fuel are comparable to those of the solid fuel due to comparable cladding heat flux and irradiation. Fuel gap conductance asymmetry caused by outward thermal expansion has been identified as a major concern due to its potential effects on NMDNBR. (cont.) A sensitivity study has been performed to evaluate the impact of fuel parameters on fuel performance. The gap asymmetry problem can be circumvented by combining several approaches including: (1) allowing a larger outer gap and a smaller inner gap, (2) enlarging the fuel and cladding surface roughness, and (3) spattering the fuel surface with ZrO₂ particles. The optimized sintered annular fuel shows great potential for achieving high burnup (up to 86 MWd/kgU rod average) and operating at 150 % power density without compromising fuel safety. A VIPAC annular fuel performance model has also been developed and implemented. An empirical VIPAC fuel thermal conductivity formula has been developed as a function of temperature, burnup, porosity and gas pressure. A fuel-clad interface thermal conductance model has been developed incorporating the effects of fuel particle size, gas pressure and interfacial pressure. The VIPAC fuel bulk dimensional changes have been calculated assuming the same bulk thermal expansion and densification coefficient as the sintered fuel, but the fission product swelling is assumed to be accommodated by porosity. (cont.) The VIPAC fuel- cladding mechanical interaction model applies the full gap closure regime of the pelletized annular fuel model except that fuel cladding "slippage" is assumed. An athermal fission gas release model for VIPAC is developed incorporating the surface and resolution effects of the fuel particles. Compared with the sintered fuel, the gap conductance imbalance problem is completely eliminated for VIPAC fuel but the fission gas release fuel is higher. The VIPAC annular fuel EOL cladding oxide thicknesses and hydrogen concentrations are comparable with those of the sintered annular fuel but the VIPAC annular rod cladding strains are significantly reduced. A sensitivity study of the important parameters of the VIPAC fuel identified that the optimum initial helium gas pressure is within 1. 4 - 2. 0 MPa and the optimum particle size is within 300 - 600 [mu] m. The optimum smear density is in the range of 85 %- 90 %. A preliminary study of Reactivity Initiated Accidents behavior involving the annular fuel has been made. During a RIA, the annular fuel peak enthalpy is found to be comparable to the solid fuel. However the permanent hoops strain of the sintered annular fuel is lower, and of the VIPAC annular fuel is higher, than that of the solid fuel. (cont.) Analyses of the annular fuel testing at the MIT reactor and planning of the annular fuel post irradiation examination are also presented. by Yi Yuan. Thesis (Ph. D.)
