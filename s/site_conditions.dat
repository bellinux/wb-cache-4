Three such multi-metrics – Habitat Hectares, BioCondition, and BioMetric – are prominent in Australia. They all measure similar attributes, convert primary data into attribute condition scores (metrics), then weight and aggregate attribute condition scores {{into a single}} <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> score (multi-metric). We compared these multi-metrics and tested whether <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> scores were correlated with the species richness {{of a range of}} plant, vertebrate and invertebrate taxa recorded from Poplar Box (Eucalyptus populnea) woodland remnants in eastern Australia in a range of <b>condition</b> states. <b>Site</b> <b>condition</b> scores (n= 43) ranged from 17 to 88 / 100, and the summed richness of all taxa recorded from sites ranged from 93 to 192 species. The multi-metrics ranked sites similarly (rs≥ 0. 79), but BioMetric scored sites significantly lower. <b>Site</b> <b>condition</b> scores were significantly correlated with the total species richness at sites (Habitat Hectares r= 0. 51, BioCondition r= 0. 49, BioMetric r= 0. 43), however, 75 % or more of the variation was left unexplained. Linear modelling of attribute condition scores (metrics) showed that nearly 50 % of the variation in total richness could be explained by a parsimonious model containing only nine condition attributes drawn from the three multi-metrics. This finding revealed that the independent explanatory power available within attribute condition scores (metrics) was not fully utilised by the <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> scores (multi-metrics). To refocus attention on the importance of careful selection, weighting and aggregation of condition attribute scores, and to improve communication and interpretation of the derived <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> multi-metrics, we introduce the weighted wedge diagram, a schematic that conveys visually and quantitatively: (i) the condition status of all attributes; (ii) the relative weightings applied to all attributes; and (iii) whether sites are degraded in terms of composition, structure and/or functional components...|$|R

We define reference rock by its shear (S) and compression (P) -wave velocities, as well as a site attenuation parameter (kappa(0)), which is used in stochastic ground-motion simulation methods. Prior definitions of reference rock conditions in CENA were based mostly on indirect large-scale crustal velocity inversions and judgment. We compile and interpret a unique database of direct velocity measurements to develop criteria for assessing the presence of reference rock <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> based on measured seismic velocities and their gradient with respect to depth. We apply the criteria to available profiles and perform rigorous statistical analysis from which we recommend S-and P-wave velocities of 3000 and 5500 m/s, respectively, for the reference rock condition. We recommend that, for practical applications, use ranges of reference S-and P-wave velocities of 2700 - 3300 m/s and 5000 - 6100 m/s, respectively. The ranges are based on a +/- 5 % change in amplification using quarterwavelength theory. We do not find evidence for regional dependence of the reference velocities, which are derived principally from three general geographic regions: (1) Atlantic coast, (2) continental interior, and (3) Appalachian Mountains.

2500|$|In 2003 the Government of Western Australia {{commissioned}} a review {{to examine the}} future of major sporting venues in Western Australia. To conduct the review, a taskforce was appointed, chaired by John Langoulant, Chief Executive of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA, and it released its final report in May 2007. The report recommended {{the construction of a}} new 60,000 seat stadium at either Kitchener Park (which adjoins Subiaco Oval) or in East Perth, which would be suitable for Australian rules football, cricket and also rectangular-field sports such as soccer, rugby union and rugby league. The taskforce recommended against the further development of Subiaco Oval, which would be demolished.

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of any {{construction}} project, the work scope may change. Change is a normal and expected part of the construction process. Changes can {{be the result of}} necessary design modifications, differing <b>site</b> <b>conditions,</b> material availability, contractor-requested changes, value engineering and impacts from third parties, to name a few. Beyond executing the change in the field, the change normally needs to be documented to show what was actually constructed. This is referred to as change management. Hence, the owner usually requires a final record to show all changes or, more specifically, any change that modifies the tangible portions of the finished work. The record is made on the contract documents – usually, but not necessarily limited to, the design drawings. The end product of this effort is what the industry terms as-built drawings, or more simply, [...] "as built." [...] The requirement for providing them is a norm in construction contracts. Construction document management is a highly important task undertaken with the aid an online or desktop software system, or maintained through physical documentation.
