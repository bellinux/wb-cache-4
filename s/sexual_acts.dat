5|$|In 15–16th-century French and English {{depictions of}} {{relationships}} between women (Lives of Gallant Ladies by Brantôme in 1665, John Cleland's 1749 erotica Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, L'Espion Anglais by various authors in 1778), writers' attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal, whereupon a male character would participate to complete the act. Physical relationships between women were often encouraged; men felt no threat as they viewed <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> between women to be accepted when men were not available, and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> between men and women. At worst, if a woman became enamored of another woman, she became a tragic figure. Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus. Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges.|$|E
5|$|Born in Beirut, Khalifa {{moved to}} the United States in 2000. She began acting in {{pornography}} in October 2014, and by December was ranked the number 1 performer on the website Pornhub. Her career choice was met with controversy in the Middle East, especially for a video in which she performed <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> while wearing the Islamic hijab. She was nevertheless disillusioned with the pornographic industry and left it after three months.|$|E
5|$|A {{week before}} the start of the Grand Prix weekend, the News of the World alleged that Max Mosley, the {{president}} of Formula One's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), had engaged in <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> with five prostitutes. While Mosley denied the allegations, he cancelled his scheduled appearance at the Bahrain Grand Prix. Several teams condemned Mosley's alleged actions and asked for his resignation, and while for a time the controversy threatened to overshadow the race, Mosley eventually retained his position and successfully sued the News of the World for the report.|$|E

5|$|Afterwards, {{the man and}} {{one woman}} walk into the woods {{together}} and masturbate each other while standing. The other woman, left at the car, becomes curious and follows them into the woods. Upon seeing them, she becomes sexually aroused and stimulates herself.

Later, they have a threesome, and one of the women subsequently gives the man fellatio. After finishing the <b>sexual</b> <b>acts,</b> they return to the car.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto III was {{initially}} released in Australia with an MA15+ classification. After re-reviewing the game, the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) banned it, {{due to its}} depiction of sexual content and violence to prostitutes. This prompted distributor Take-Two Interactive {{to appeal to the}} OFLC, who reaffirmed the banned status on 11 December 2001, after reanalysing the game and seeking the professional opinion of a forensic psychologist. This prompted Take-Two to recall the game in Australia, and Rockstar to make appropriate changes to the game; a modified version was re-released with an MA15+ classification in January 2002, removing all instances of <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> with prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s Adkins again {{found himself}} {{in trouble with the}} law. In 1983 he was living with his girlfriend who was still a minor. Her mother {{reported}} to police that she had been raped, and Adkins was subsequently charged with third-degree sexual assault, although the girl insisted the <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> were consensual. In October the same year, another relationship ended with jail time, when a shootout occurred between Adkins and a jealous husband. No one was hurt, but Adkins was charged with felony illegal possession of a shotgun and spent five months in jail.|$|E
25|$|Sexual abuse, {{is defined}} by World Health Organization as any <b>sexual</b> <b>act,</b> attempt to obtain a <b>sexual</b> <b>act,</b> {{unwanted}} <b>sexual</b> comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person’s sexuality using coercion. It also includes obligatory inspections for virginity and female genital mutilation. Aside from initiation of the <b>sexual</b> <b>act</b> through physical force, sexual abuse occurs {{if a person is}} unable to understand the nature or condition of the act, unable to decline participation, or unable to communicate unwillingness to engage in the <b>sexual</b> <b>act.</b> This could be because of underage immaturity, illness, disability, or the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or due to intimidation or pressure.|$|R

5|$|In the United States, the 1920s was {{a decade}} of social experimentation, {{particularly}} with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish to ignore it. Freud's theories were much more pervasive in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> {{were a part of}} lesbianism and their relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|John Brownlee, who had {{previously}} been offered the job, succeeded Greenfield. Brownlee's reign as government leader was troubled by {{the onset of the}} Great Depression. He resigned in scandal after he was accused of <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> with a minor in the Attorney General's office. This and another scandalous divorce by UFA MLA Oran McPherson, speaker of the Legislative Assembly, gave the United Farmers an image of moral decay. In 1934 Richard Reid replaced Brownlee but served as premier for less than two years, leading the United Farmers government into total defeat {{at the hands of the}} new Social Credit party.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy's first group, pornographic parodies, {{includes}} 1976's Tintin en Suisse ("Tintin in Switzerland") and Jan Bucquoy's 1992 work La Vie Sexuelle de Tintin ("Tintin's Sex Life"), featuring Tintin and {{the other}} characters engaged in <b>sexual</b> <b>acts.</b> Another such example was Tintin in Thailand, in which Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus travel to the East Asian country for a sex holiday. The book began circulating in December 1999, but in 2001, Belgian police arrested those responsible and confiscated 650 copies for copyright violation.|$|E

5|$|The next {{largest group}} of victims were non-Jewish Poles, who {{accounted}} for 70,000 to 75,000 deaths. Twenty-one thousand Roma and Sinti were killed, along with 15,000 Soviet POWs and 10,000 to 15,000 peoples of other nations. Around 400 Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned at Auschwitz, at least 152 of whom died. An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men prosecuted under German Penal Code Section 175 (proscribing <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> between men) were detained in concentration camps of which an unknown number were sent to Auschwitz; of those sent to Auschwitz 80 percent died.|$|E
5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his young female victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes {{for hours at a}} time, grooming and performing <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment {{for a period of time}} as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.|$|E
5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from <b>sexual</b> <b>acts.</b> The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E

5|$|Rape was a {{widespread}} {{phenomenon in the}} East as German soldiers regularly committed violent <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> against Soviet women. Whole units were occasionally involved in the crime with upwards of one-third of the instances being gang-rape. Frequently {{in the case of}} Jewish women, they were immediately murdered following acts of sexual violence. Historian Birgit Beck emphasizes that military decrees, which served to authorize wholesale brutality on many levels, essentially destroyed the basis for any prosecution of sexual offenses committed by German soldiers in the East. She also contends that detection of such instances was limited by the fact that sexual violence was often inflicted in the context of billets in civilian housing.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Street scandal {{occurred}} in 1889, when a homosexual male brothel in Cleveland Street, Fitzrovia, London, {{was discovered by}} police. The government was accused of covering up the scandal to protect the names of aristocratic and other prominent patrons. At the time, <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> between men were illegal in Britain, and the brothel's clients faced possible prosecution and certain social ostracism if discovered. It was rumoured that Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and second-in-line to the British throne had visited, though this has never been substantiated. Unlike overseas newspapers, the English press never named the Prince, but the allegation influenced {{the handling of the}} case by the authorities, and has coloured biographers' perceptions of him since.|$|E
5|$|The first Japanese {{mainstream}} {{film with}} nudity was Seijun Suzuki's Gate of Flesh, (1964), and Takechi {{made the first}} big-budget, mainstream pink film, Daydream(白日夢), the same year. Like Women... Oh, Women!, Daydream was produced independently but Shochiku studios distributed the film. This time, the studio gave Takechi's film a major publicity campaign. Based on a 1926 short story by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, the film was a black comedy involving a series of sex scenes imagined by an artist under anesthesia in a dentist's office. After being drugged, the artist watches helplessly {{from the other side}} of a window as the dentist tortures and performs a series of <b>sexual</b> <b>acts</b> on a female patient.|$|E

5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of <b>sexual</b> <b>acts.</b> Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E
