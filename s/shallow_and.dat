5|$|After {{the arrival}} of white {{settlers}} to the baytown of Hynesville in the 19th century, the Karankawa began to commit offenses against the settlers, including the unsanctioned slaughter of their livestock. As a result, the settlers engaged the Indians at the 1852 Battle of Hynes Bay, near the San Antonio Bay extension of Hynes Bay. The Karankawa were swiftly defeated, and the survivors agreed to never return; finding refuge across the Rio Grande in Tamaulipas. A few years later, the Hynes extension began to fill with mud, leaving it <b>shallow</b> <b>and</b> hard to navigate. Reports from Hynesville suggest that alligators infested the bay, killing a few residents.|$|E
5|$|Benign conditions, {{sometimes}} {{also referred}} to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some <b>shallow</b> <b>and</b> protected shoreline areas.|$|E
5|$|Corals {{that grow}} on reefs are called hermatypic, with those growing {{elsewhere}} {{are known as}} ahermatypic. Most of the latter are azooxanthellate and live in both <b>shallow</b> <b>and</b> deep sea habitats. In the deep sea they share the ecosystem with soft corals, polychaete worms, other worms, crustaceans, molluscs and sponges. In the Atlantic Ocean, the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa forms extensive deep-water reefs which support many other species.|$|E

50|$|The Staffordshire Wildlife Trust have {{undertaken}} {{a number of}} projects to restore the site as a wildlife haven. These works include excavation of scrapes for wading birds {{and the creation of}} <b>shallows</b> <b>and</b> reedbeds on the two main lakes providing cover and nesting areas for breeding birds. Parts of the banks have been re-profiled and the resulting soil deposited into the lake to make more <b>shallows</b> <b>and</b> larger reedbeds. The process is known as 'river braiding' and creates a diversity of river features with still pools, <b>shallow</b> riffles <b>and</b> gravel islands which helps to restore natural river processes and better wildlife habitat.|$|R

5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and {{therefore}} a herbivore. Benson et al. (2012) realized that the beak of Corythosaurus was <b>shallow</b> <b>and</b> delicate, and concluded {{that it must have}} been used to feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E

Daisy once had a romantic relationship with Gatsby, before she married Tom. Her choice between Gatsby and Tom is one of the central conflicts in the novel.|$|E
5|$|Mysids {{are found}} {{throughout}} the world in both <b>shallow</b> <b>and</b> deep marine waters {{where they can be}} benthic or pelagic, but they are also important in some fresh water and brackish ecosystems. Many benthic species make daily vertical migrations into higher parts of the water column. Mysids are filter feeders, omnivores that feed on algae, detritus and zooplankton. Some mysids are cultured in the laboratory for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They are sensitive to water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality.|$|E

5|$|The central {{mass of the}} Raft River Mountains {{consists}} of Precambrian metamorphic rocks with Elba quartzite and interlayered schist on the southern slopes and Cambrian quartzite outcrops on {{the western part of}} the range. Below the Sublett Mountains the Phosphoria Formation, a basal phosphorite overlain by a thick sequence of chert and cherty sandstone, reaches its greatest thickness. Soils in the northern part of the forest are generally deep and highly fertile in lowlands but <b>shallow</b> <b>and</b> less so on steep slopes. In the Minidoka Ranger District, soils are generally productive, derived from volcanic and sedimentary material, shallow on steep slopes, and deep in the lowlands.|$|E
5|$|Three {{hills in}} the region were the Parvati Hill, the Chaturshringi Hill, and the Khadki hill. The Peshwa watched the battle from the Parvati Hill whereas the British East India Company troops {{were based on the}} Khadki hill. The two hills are {{separated}} by a distance of four kilometres. The river Mula is <b>shallow</b> <b>and</b> narrow and could be crossed at several locations. A few canals (nallas in Marathi) joined the river and though these were not obstacles, some of them were obscured due to the vegetation in the area.|$|E
5|$|Although the low {{initially}} exhibited features {{typical of}} a monsoon trough, surface observations suggested that surface pressures {{in the vicinity of}} the low began to fall on September4. Consequently, the TFCA was re-issued at 10:00UTC. Eight hours later, Dvorak intensity estimates for the storm reached T2.0/, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the system into a tropical depression, although post-storm analysis from the agency indicated that the system attained tropical depression status at 00:00UTC on September4 and tropical storm intensity at 18:00UTC that day. At 06:00UTC on September5, the JMA followed suit and classified Gerald as a tropical storm. Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Neneng. The JTWC initially expected Gerald to re-curve east of the Philippines; however, the storm's circulation remained quite <b>shallow</b> <b>and</b> embedded within the monsoon trough, causing Gerald to meander. The JMA upgraded Gerald into severe tropical storm during the evening hours of September5.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} modify wetland habitats, most {{dramatically in}} flat {{areas such as}} the Everglades, by constructing small ponds known as alligator holes. This behavior has qualified the American alligator to be considered a keystone species. Alligator holes retain water during the dry season and provide a refuge for aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms that survive the dry season by seeking refuge in alligator holes are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of alligator holes, as well as a buildup of soils during the excavation process, provide drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are intolerant of inundation to colonize. Alligator holes are an oasis during the Everglades dry season, so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, alligator holes tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and <b>shallow,</b> <b>and</b> those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less than half a centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in <b>shallow,</b> <b>and</b> many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Dating Lindow Man is {{problematic}} as {{samples from the}} body and surrounding peat have produced dates spanning a 900-year period. Although the peat encasing Lindow Man has been radiocarbon dated to about 300BC, Lindow Man himself has a different date. Early tests at different laboratories returned conflicting dates for the body; later tests suggested a date between 2BC and 119AD. There has been a tendency to ascribe the body to the Iron Age period rather than Roman due to the interpretation that Lindow Man's death {{may have been a}} ritual sacrifice or execution. Explanations for why the peat in which he was found is much older have been sought. Archaeologist P.C.Buckland suggests that as the stratigraphy of the peat appears undisturbed, Lindow Man may have been deposited into a pool that was already some 300years old. Geographer K.E.Barber has argued against this hypothesis, saying that pools at Lindow Moss would have been too <b>shallow,</b> <b>and</b> suggests that the peat may have been peeled back to allow the burial and then replaced, leaving the stratigraphy apparently undisturbed.|$|E

5|$|Falstaff, <b>Shallow</b> <b>and</b> Silence sit {{in front}} of a warm fire, {{continuing}} from the first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking that he will become a great and powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken heart. The narrator explains that Hal {{went on to become a}} good and noble king.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{notified}} Fegelein by telegram on 1 August {{that the}} numbers killed were far too low. A few days later, Himmler issued regimental order no. 42, which called for all male Jews {{over the age of}} 14 to be killed. The women and children were to be driven into the swamps and drowned. Thus Fegelein's units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities. As the water in the swamps was too <b>shallow</b> <b>and</b> some areas had no swamps, it proved impractical to drown the women and children, so they were shot. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.|$|E
5|$|Impact crater diameters seen {{range from}} 0.1kma limit {{defined by the}} imaging resolutionto over 100km, not {{counting}} the multi-ring structures. Small craters, with diameters less than 5km, have simple bowl or flat-floored shapes. Those 540km across usually have a central peak. Larger impact features, with diameters in the range 25100km, have central pits instead of peaks, such as Tindr crater. The largest craters with diameters over 60km can have central domes, which are thought to result from central tectonic uplift after an impact; examples include Doh and Hár craters. A small number of very largemore 100km in diameterand bright impact craters show anomalous dome geometry. These are unusually <b>shallow</b> <b>and</b> may be a transitional landform to the multi-ring structures, as with the Lofn impact feature.
