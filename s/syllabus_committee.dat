50|$|It was at Kumbanad that Johnsar and Mariamma teacher, as {{they were}} {{commonly}} known, spent the longest part of their career, from 1935 until retirement. The Noel Memorial school at Kumbanad was a Malayalam high school in those days, with classes from 5 to 9. Johnsar was the senior Malayalam teacher. Most of his students were grown-ups, {{and some of them}} already married with children. Some of the students came from far-away places, walking several kilometers to get there. At St. John’s English High School, Eraviperoor, under Marthoma management, his services were made available by mutual consent between the two managements from 1947 to 49 and then back at N. M. English High School, Kumbanad, from where he retired in 1955. Within a few years of his arrival at Kumbanad, he became an elder of the Kumbanad Brethren Assembly, as well as the headmaster of the Sunday school. Under his leadership, the Brethren Sunday school at Kumbanad became one of the largest Sunday schools in Central Travancore with more than 300 students and over 20 teachers. He convened a <b>syllabus</b> <b>committee</b> that worked out a draft syllabus for Sunday Schools, which was the forerunner of the present day Unified Syllabus. Johnsar was one of the teachers of the Brethren Bible School at Kumbanad in its early days. In this manner, his vision for full-time missionary work was fulfilled to a great extent in spite of the recurring illness that troubled him frequently. He was never reluctant to associate with believers of other denominations in spiritual matters. He was one of the founding members of the movement called the “Aikya Suvisesha Purogamana Prasthanam” formed at Kumbanad during the 40’s. K. E. Abraham, President of the Indian Pentecostal Church (I. P. C), T. M. Varghese, General Secretary of Church of God and Mr. K. E. Kochukoshy, brother of Rev. K. E. Oommen of the Mar Thoma Church were some of his associates. He was also a founder-member and first President of the “Pourasthya Bhasha Birudadhari Sanghadana”, an organization which was formed for the betterment of the Oriental language teachers. It is by the relentless efforts of this organization, that parity was brought about between the Oriental language teachers and other graduate teachers employed under the Kerala Education Department.|$|E

40|$|This {{work is a}} case-study in {{curriculum}} development in secondary school science education, especially senior science, in New South Wales during the decade 1962 - 1972. The situation became exceptionally complex and {{grew out of the}} reorganisation of the secondary school curriculum recommended by the so-called Wyndham Committee in 1957. A completely new concept of science was offered to students of the State when biology was given increased status beside the physical sciences - physics and chemistry. This combination of material was examined in a very special way and Science (in this broad sense) was also tied administratively to mathematics. In 1966 a complicated syllabus was presented to students and teachers with negligible advance preparation of teachers, no period of familiarisation and no in-service support. Almost no explanation of the rationale behind such a novel and untried scheme was offered. The response of teachers and students was initially one of stunned silence. Very quickly this developed into hostility to the content, to its serious overloading and to the restriction of practical work. Teachers, parents and some members of the Universities expressed grave misgivings not only about the suitability of the course as a preparation for tertiary studies, but also about the completely unsatisfactory nature of the texts offered, about the examination method adopted, and about the restrictions on the personal aspirations of students for some degree of specialisation in their senior studies. The Universities became very interested in the discussions then appearing in the newspapers. Academics took sides either attacking or defending the concepts underlying the course; their points of view being based largely on the performance of the students at university level. The campaign for change began with a band of very vocal teachers working through the Teachers' Federation. These were supported by academics in promoting a series of public meetings. Parallel to this a campaign spearheaded by Professor Alexander of Sydney University was initiated in the Press. The defence of the new courses was taken up by Professors Messel and Butler of the same University. To maintain the impetus for the change {{in curriculum}}, the Secondary Schools Science Association was formed by persons interested and very involved in the curriculum. Intricately woven into the pattern of discontent with and strenuous defence of the Wyndham courses, among teachers there was a groundswell of positive aspirations towards the understanding of and clarification of the aims of science teaching in New South Wales. This resulted in the preparation of a document which contained guidelines for both teaching and curriculum development: it was subsequently adopted by the Board of Senior School Studies. This same Board was, by then, very much aware of the discontent with the new courses and various modifications of them were considered. Attempts to accommodate teacher, student and university aspirations resulted in firstly the appointment of Curriculum Development Officers to assist the Science <b>Syllabus</b> <b>Committee</b> and, parallel to this, a willingness to permit trial of science courses which had been developed for use in the United States of America and in other states of Australia. Once the decision was made in December, 1969 to permit the trialling of other courses, a Committee was set up to evaluate these courses as well as the existing Wyndham courses. This Committee reported favourably on the new courses and after some false starts the Board of Senior School Studies not only extended the trials of the new courses, but in 1975 the old Wyndham courses were abolished and superseded. Complications arising from the personalities involved, from people with vested interests in certain educational theories, from the authors of the specially published texts, from the Publishing Houses which were to provide the new texts became very tangled indeed. Similar difficulties were encountered by the Curriculum Development Officers who later directed the adoption of the new courses to a conclusion satisfactory to the Science <b>Syllabus</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Board of Senior School Studies...|$|E
40|$|This model {{developed}} {{from a study}} {{of changes in the}} social education syllabuses in NSW over a 22 year period from 1967 to 1989. The social education or SOSE area was examined from the perspective of how it changed over this period, why it changed and how the changes inform current practice. Although some may argue that the curriculum historian should perhaps be further removed from the study, the main impetus for me with this study was to inform my current practice. As Popkewitz points out: 'Our questions about the present require that we recognise that the present is not just our immediate experiences and practices. Part of our historical consciousness is to recognise that the past is a part of our everyday discourse, structuring what can be said and the possibilities and challenges of our times'. I am the HSIE coordinator at the University of Newcastle and I work in the Early Childhood, Primary and Secondary programs. There is a real need for me to have on overriding view removed from the minutae of day to day SOSE lesson planning in a particular syllabus area. The model evolved from two directions. Firstly, from reading literature in the policy, curriculum, educational history, social science pedagogy, and sociology areas, and examining primary documents such as committee minutes. Secondly it evolved from talking to <b>syllabus</b> <b>committee</b> members from the period and reading their survey replies, and examining the syllabuses produced. There were nineteen interviews held and 61 surveys collected. The model is not wildly different from anything seen before and in fact is similar to Kenway's, for example, suggestion for categorising theories of policy making. She argued that there were macro-theories encompassing an examination of the broader social and political context in which policy develops {{and the role of the}} state in this; middle-range theories which concentrate on the different stages of policy development and implementation; and micro-theories concerning decision making and decision makers within particular institutions. It is also important to examine the text of syllabus documents/policy documents...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the prescribed texts on the NSW Higher School Certificate English syllabi between 1965 and 1995. These and the strategies that inform their reading, are not examined in the manner of literary criticism but as an expression institutional practices and cultural discourses. The selection and study of these texts {{played an important role in}} the construction of literary and cultural 2 ̆ 7 truths 2 ̆ 7 in Australia during the second half of this century. This study traces the origin of the selection of these texts to principally two sources: Cambridge English, as it was first practised in the U. K. by F. R. Leavis and his colleagues from the late 1920 s, and later adopted into some academic circles in Australia; and American New Criticism, derivations of which similarly flourished in the Australian academy from the 1950 s. One implication of this is that those parts of the Australian academy which wielded power within secondary education sources from the 1960 s to the 1990 s were intent on looking overseas — towards the U. K. and the U. S. A. — for literary guidance and direction, rather than being attentive to developments in writing and criticism that were occurring here, one consequence of which was that the formation of the 2 ̆ 7 citizen 2 ̆ 7 within the NSW education system at this time was modelled in large part upon expectations that were foreign to social realities in Australia. Within NSW education a hybrid of Leavisite criticism and American New Criticism developed between 1965 and 1995, which was taken by academics, teachers and students as the 2 ̆ 7 norm 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 truth 2 ̆ 7 in literary interpretation. This hybrid dominated most aspects criticism and reading. The thesis attempts to generate explanations for this domination. Having first sketched in what we consider key theoretic and literary considerations as background to our discussion, it scrutinises, for example, the composition and influence the English <b>Syllabus</b> <b>Committee,</b> which was responsible for text choice, nomination and review. It reveals that this sub-branch of the NSW Board of Studies largely comprised academics from the same sandstone universities where Leavisism and New Criticism were so unswervingly adhered to. The study looks, too, at different Senior English syllabi show that again the reading and critical practices of Cambridge English/American New Criticism are evident, and entrenched in, these official directive documents from the Department of Education. It also examines the texts themselves to disclose that their choice privileges these same literary regimes. Finally, it discusses how the Holy Grail high school education in English, the HSC exam, reinforces these values and practices. The study concludes that the HSC prescribed texts for English from 1965 to 1995 are but a singular expression of broad cultural and institutional phenomena. Their selection and how they are studied conceal an array of power plays and ideological standpoints go to the heart of our understanding of what is 2 ̆ 7 literary 2 ̆ 7 and why it should be so...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) During the {{two decades}} 1962 - 82 the Modern History {{curriculum}} for the senior classes in New South Wales secondary schools changed remarkably. Many factors influenced this. The beginnings of change go back to 1962 {{with the implementation of}} the Wyndham System of education. In 1966 a new Modern History Syllabus was introduced into the penultimate year of secondary school not because of any felt need for reform but because of the general reorganization of secondary schooling. The most deleterious effect of the Wyndham Scheme on Modern History was the introduction in 1962 of Social Studies as a compulsory course in Form 1. This eroded History's position as the most popular social education subject, a matter which disturbed New South Wales History teachers. The new Modern History Syllabus implemented in 1966 was examined at the first Higher School Certificate in 1967. Large proportions of candidates failed to achieve passes at the level at which they entered. This was particularly noticeable at the First Level where students were conceded passes at Second and even Third Levels. Teachers were disquieted because they feared a further {{decline in the number of}} students studying Modern History. During 1970 the challenge of a strong movement to introduce Social Science was the catalyst responsible for great changes in History curriculum throughout the secondary school. History teachers were concerned about two issues: the defence of History's right to be taught as a separate discipline in the secondary school, and ways to improve the teaching of History in the junior classes. As a result a new innovative syllabus was implemented for the junior secondary classes in 1972. Teachers then began to demand that changes be made to senior Modern History. The 1975 Modern History Syllabus for Years 11 and 12 provided teachers with the opportunity to devise courses in European History. It was also possible to concentrate mainly on Asian History but this was not advisable because choice of questions set on the Higher School Certificate paper was restricted. This was a great change from the World History course of the 1960 s with its emphasis on the many diverse topics associated with that course or the broad theme and country focus of the 1964 Syllabus. However, teachers led by small pressure groups demanded more change and in 1979 three Modern History options were examined at the Higher School Certificate and five in 1980. Teachers were concerned about the outcome of the 1979 Higher School Certificate Modern History examination. Candidates presented for Asian History in particular, gained excellent results and those entered for the Revolutions in the Modern World course did exceptionally well. In contract to this situation teachers considered that many very good students who studied Option A, World History Since 1789 and entered for that option did not gain the expected marks. There had to be an explanation. Perhaps the candidates entered for the new options were outstanding. However, the Examiners' Report did not support this assumption. Many other factors made specific contributions. Despite excellent results in 1979 the new options were not popular if popularity is judged by the number of entrants. A survey of a sample of New South Wales senior secondary classes in 1980 considered opinions on the Options being studied in Years 11 and 12. It also highlights other important aspects of the Modern History curriculum: teacher background, strategies and attitudes; students' attitudes and reasons for increasing numbers of students entering the senior classes when they had no intention of proceeding to tertiary study. The options, introduced without any consideration of the practicalities of examining, created problems, In consequence the members of the Modern History <b>Syllabus</b> <b>Committee</b> focused their attention in 1982 on the possibility of devising a single course for all Modern History candidates. However, times had changed. An increasing proportion of less able candidates were entering the senior years and staying on to complete the Higher School Certificate. For these the standard essay response was too difficult and other ways of evaluating student performance were being considered. The evolution of the Modern History curriculum for the senior classes in New South Wales secondary schools reveals the operation of a number of factors. These included the restructuring of secondary education ion the 1960 s, the challenge from Social Science, influences from abroad, changes in junior secondary History. the existence of special interest groups pushing particular studies, education problems (e. g. examining) inherent in the new curricular programme, and changes in the composition of the student body in Years 11 and 12. This study will examine their effect as they impinged upon the curriculum...|$|E
40|$|Proefskrif [...] PU vir CHO 1. AIM: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{ascertain}} to what extent student teachers of Transvaal universities and colleges of education are technologically prepared for their teaching profession. Relevant aspects of teacher training with special reference to the Transvaal were attended to. The importance of this undertaking is partly due to the fact that the modern school is compelled to make greater use of technological aids to prepare the child optimally for the complex world of the future. Some general implications based on the findings of this study are pointed out. 2. METHOD: A study was made of available literature on educational technology. Attention was also given to the historical development of educational aids, present practices of teacher training overseas and in the Republic of South Africa and the compilation of criteria for the training of European student teachers in Transvaal. Additional information about the present practice in Transvaal was gained by visits to the four universities and the four teacher training colleges, interviews with lecturers responsible for audiovisual training and questionnaires to student teachers in their final year. 3. FINDINGS: 3. 1 Problems experienced by the modern school and attempts to overcome these: The task of the modern school is complicated by the great expansion of knowledge, the rapid increase in the pupil population, problems of financing and a shortage of teachers. Curriculum reform, differentiation, psychological approach in education and new approaches such as the systems approach, programmed teaching and improved methodology are a few attempts to overcome the abovementioned problems. The value of method and techniques is best illustrated by a discussion of the Nontessori-method, the Winnetkaplan, the Daltonplan, the Morrison-method, team-teaching, schools of the air and teaching by means of television. In addition attention is given to improved teacher training and guidance, as well as the recruitment of sufficient teachers. In recent years technology and technological innovation, in the form of improved communication media, improved ways of manufacturing, visits to space, etc., has had an increasing influence on society. The new communication media are considered as possible means of solving some of the problems experienced by the modern school. Auditive and visual media can possibly be used to quicken learning and promote understanding. In the modern school we use child-centered education with full consideration of pupil ability and developmental stage. 3. 2 The development of education technology and the present state of affairs: A brief summary of the historical development of technology of education as a relatively recent field of study is given. Early founders of educational technology are the Sophists, Abelard and Comenius, followed by Pestalozzi, Froebel and Herbart. After 1900 Thorndike, Dewey, Montessori, Burke and Lewin played an important part in the founding of the modern educational technology. The empirical approach of children, analysis of learning matter, individualized instruction, progress according to ability, scientific planning of education, better teacher training, thorough educational research, differentiated educational techniques and method, improved communication and the implementation of new educational aids are some of the characteristics of present instructional technology. To elucidate the present state of affairs in the RSA, a brief summary of recent developments in the USA, Britain, Netherlands, Western Germany, USSR, France and Rhodesia was given. Modern instructional technology, based on scientific teaching theory and method, developed after the Second World War. It is characterized by the use of auditive and visual media according to modern instructional techniques such as programmed instruction, mastery learning, and others aimed at giving each child the opportunity of progressing according to ability. To achieve this aim, continued attention is given to innovation of the curricula, improved teacher training, in-service training of teachers and the application of modern technology in all the abovementioned countries. Major problems experienced by educationalists are the lack of knowledge among teachers and others about innovatory measures, a lack of materials, the fact that pupils do not respond to new techniques and the lack of knowledge concerning new techniques among teachers as well as an unwillingness to experiment with or to implement the new. Conservatism can possibly be eliminated by defining educational aims clearly, by introducing new techniques in a well-defined way, by adapting teacher training in accordance with new media and techniques, and by encouraging teachers to make use of these in their teaching practice. 3. 3 Principles and requirements for the choice and use of audiovisual aids: The increased use of audiovisual media to overcome some of the problems experienced by the modern school, is sometimes called the technological teaching revolution. In view of the above it is essential for teachers to take note of the psychological principles of learning and especially the way in which man gains experience by means of perception, how learning matter is retained and how it is recalled. The preschool phase, primary school phase, secondary school phase and tertiary phase were discussed to point out how the child should make use of direct experience - initially to acquire and accumulate knowledge which will make abstract thought possible. In his cognitive approach to media usage Salomon refers to the interaction between media, message, educational task and learner as factors which facilitate the effectiveness of instruction. According to didactic principles. teaching aids can be classified an ascending sequence from direct experience to the spoken or written word as the most abstract. According to communication principles, events in the classroom can be described as psychological interaction between a teacher and a group of pupils. To facilitate efficient communication it is essential that communication media with which the child is familiar, are used in school. 3. 4 Audiovisual aids must comply with the following criteria: The choice of media is affected by criteria such as project variables which include educational aims. availability of time, the number of learners, the cost-effectiveness ratio, reliability and durability; psychological variables such as the senses, sensory limits and the Hernandez-Peon effect; and learner variables such as ability and interest, media experience and preference. In addition the following criteria must also be considered: integrateability, curricular enforceability, manageability, versatality, the ability to stimulate imagination, the ability to motivate pupils, the ability to encourage individualization and selfactivity, it must improve communication, create balance, must encourage efficiency, must be economic and must facilitate experience. 3. 5 Audiovisual media in the didactic educational situation: Attention was given to a classification of media. This was followed by a discussion of media characteristics, requirements for media usage and advantages and limitations of media usage. Lastly an integrated media approach was briefly described. 3. 6 Training of teachers for the use of audiovisual media and educational technology: It is a too formidable task to give a detailed description of the present state of affairs in all countries as far as this subject is concerned. Some of the most relevant, such as the USA, UK, Netherlands, USSR, France and Rhodesia were discussed. Certain universities and teacher training colleges in the USA provide excellent training facilities and programs for the use of audiovisual media and educational technology. In Western European countries such as the United Kingdom, Netherlands, France and Western Germany, audiovisual aids and educational technology form integral parts of the education systems. The training of student teachers, in-service training of teachers, introduction of new media and materials, and the production of software are well attended to. Modern techniques and methods, educational aids and educational technology are emphasized in the training of student teachers and the in-service training of teachers in the USSR. Audiovisual media are used according to technological principles in Rhodesian teacher training. By means of in-service training, teachers in Rhodesian schools are encouraged to make the best possible use of modern educational technology. In the RSA the provinces were discussed separately. It is encouraging to find that educational technology has been accepted throughout the country. In the training courses at the various universities and teacher training colleges in all provinces, thorough attention is given to audiovisual aids in the educational technological program. By in-service training teachers become acquainted with and are encouraged to make use of audiovisual media and technological principles in the schools. Attention is also given to production of software. 3. 7 Criteria for the training of teachers in the use of-audiovisual aids: In view of differences in the training courses in audiovisual media and educational technology at the different universities and teacher training colleges in Transvaal, the following criteria for the training of teachers, were compiled: (i) An intensive knowledge of educational technology is required; (ii) a would-be-teacher should have a thorough knowledge of audiovisual media; (iii) he should know possible uses and shortcomings of the various media; (iv) he should know which media can be used in combination; (v) the training course should not be too theoretical; (vi) the lecturer should set an example in the use of media; (vii) too much technical knowledge should not be included in the course; (viii) audiovisual education should be an integral part of subject methodology; (ix) greater co-operation between media centres and subject methodology should be encouraged; (x) training in the production of audiovisual materials (software) is essential. 4. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS IN TRANSVAAL: A thorough empirical investigation with regard to educational technology in Transvaal followed. In conclusion the teacher training is tested according to the abovementioned criteria. 4. 1 Integration of modern technological principles: It became evident that not all students were properly trained in principles underlying the use of audiovisual media, as some lecturers stated that students were not properly trained in technology. As far as theoretical principles are concerned there are vast differences between die different institutions. Certain universities and colleges emphasize technological training while very little attention is given to training in the practical use of the various media. Micro-teaching and television are used by some institutions only. 4. 2 A thorough knowledge of audiovisual media is essential: It seems that some students did not have the opportunity of handling certain apparatus. This is due to the fact that some of the universities and colleges do not have the amenities or sufficient apparatus to facilitate practical experience. Some students however rer. eived help from teachers at the schools where they were placed for practice teaching. 4. 3 Student teachers should be acquainted with possibilities and limitations of audiovisual aids: Lecturers do not set the example of possible uses of audiovisual aids in their lectures. Students feel that ractical use can only be achieved if uses of these aids can be demonstrated in a practical situation. 4. 4 The use of media in combination should be emphasized: In some cases sillabuses do not facilitate the proper instruction of the use of media in combination such as a slide-sound combination or the language laboratory. 4. 5 The course should not be too theoretical: Enough time should be allocated for the practical handling of apparatus and materials. Because of large classes it is not always possible (classes of 49 to 180 students). 4. 6 Lecturers should set an example to the student: This is not always the case. because some lecturers are not fully acquainted with the use of media themselves. Motivation and preparation in the use of audiovisual aids and materials are essential. 4. 7 Some sillabuses include unnecessary technical knowledge about apparatus or a detailed discussion on electricity, its origin, direct current, alternating current, etc., which is quite unnecessary. If a less detailed description of apparatus or unnecessary subject matter is excluded, more time can be alotted to practical work. 4. 8 Audiovisual training should form an integral part of subject methodology: In audiovisual training the student should be taught how to handle apparatus while the application could be taught in the specializing subject or subject methodology. 4. 9 Greater co-operation between media centres and subject methodology is required: This can facilitate advancement of technological principles. 4. 10 Training in the production of a 4 diovisual materials: Although this is encouraged by the majority of universities and colleges, some students stated that they did not have the opportunity of producing audiovisual materials. Opportunity for the production of transparencies, photostats, slides, taperecordings and transcription are essential. 4. 11 A uniform syllabus for educational technology for all teacher training in Transvaal is essential. A <b>syllabus</b> <b>committee</b> consisting of representatives of the four universities and the four teacher training colleges should be formed. Doctora...|$|E
