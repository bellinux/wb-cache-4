An extensive literature review has been conducted and {{provides an overview of}} variables influencing the <b>acceptance</b> of <b>social</b> robots categorized by utilitarian variables, hedonic variables, user characteristics, social normative beliefs and control beliefs. In a user study, in which 60 participants interacted with a social robot, both the robot itself and the interaction experience the users had with the robot were evaluated. The results indicate that especially the variables of usefulness, adaptability, enjoyment, sociability, companionship and perceived behavioral control are important evaluating the user <b>acceptance</b> of <b>social</b> robots. Hence, the present study contributes to human–robot interaction research by designating the variables that lead to <b>social</b> robot <b>acceptance.</b> Subsequently, this study may serve as a onset in developing an integral model which takes into consideration the relevant determinants of <b>social</b> robot <b>acceptance...</b>|$|R

40|$|Over {{the most}} recent decades, the field of social {{robotics}} has advanced rapidly. There are {{a growing number of}} different types of robots, and their roles within society are expanding. This dissertation has argued that investigating the long-term <b>acceptance</b> of <b>social</b> robots in home environments is necessary for the successful diffusion of these types of robots within society. The findings of this dissertation indicate that usefulness is a requisite for <b>social</b> robot <b>acceptance</b> and that certain additional important acceptance variables may further explain why people continue to use a social robot in their own homes. These additional acceptance variables show that the <b>acceptance</b> of a <b>social</b> robot for domestic use increases when future users believe that they possess the necessary skills to use a social robot, when they perceive that having such a robot enhances their status, and when they expect that such a robot provides more enjoyable interactions, behaves less sociably, and causes fewer privacy concerns. However, when examining the long-term use of social robots in home environments, it appears that the importance of the acceptance variables in explaining <b>social</b> robot <b>acceptance</b> changes over time, shifting from control beliefs to attitudinal beliefs. It is believed that the importance of the acceptance variables depends on the development stage in which the technology is located (Peters, 2011). When people gain experiences with a <b>social</b> robot, other <b>acceptance</b> variables explain people’s intention to continue using it compared to the acceptance variables that explained their initial adoption. Concerning human-robot relationships, the studies presented in this dissertation indicate that people are initially reluctant to build a relationship with a robot and deny the possibility that such a relationship will occur for them. However, after people have adopted a social robot and have begun to use it in their own homes, some people acknowledge that they have established some type of relationship with the robot. However, not all people seem to appreciate a robot’s social behavior, and it seems that people remain unfamiliar with the possibilities of human-robot relationships and that the actual use and interactions with social robots reveal what types of relationships people are willing to establish with these robots. The findings of this dissertation may help both researchers and developers of social robots to further develop an integrated theory or model of <b>social</b> robot <b>acceptance</b> that can describe and explain this acceptance in more real-world contexts, such as the home...|$|R

40|$|Many {{independent}} {{studies in}} social robotics and human–robot interaction have gained knowledge on various {{factors that affect}} people’s perceptions of and behaviors toward robots. However, {{only a few of}} those studies aimed to develop models of <b>social</b> robot <b>acceptance</b> integrating a wider range of such factors. With the rise of robotic technologies for everyday environments, such comprehensive research on relevant acceptance factors is increasingly necessary. This article presents a conceptual model of <b>social</b> robot <b>acceptance</b> with a strong theoretical base, which has been tested among the general Dutch population (n =  1, 168) using structural equation modeling. The results show a strong role of normative believes that both directly and indirectly affect the anticipated <b>acceptance</b> of <b>social</b> robots for domestic purposes. Moreover, the data show that, at least at this stage of diffusion within society, people seem somewhat reluctant to accept social behaviors from robots. The current findings of our study and their implications serve to push the field of acceptable social robotics forward. For the societal <b>acceptance</b> of <b>social</b> robots, it is vital to include the opinions of future users at an early stage of development. This way future designs can be better adapted to the preferences of potential users...|$|R

40|$|Students with {{different}} learning styles approach learning differently. With {{the rise of}} social media technologies, investigating {{the effect of these}} styles on their intentions to use social media for learning has become all the more important. This study explored the factors affecting students' intentions to use social media for learning based on their learning styles (i. e., participatory, collaborative, and independent), using the <b>social</b> media <b>acceptance</b> model. By convenience sampling, 300 Malaysian students were recruited via an online survey (Nparticipatory = 116; Nindependent = 97; and Ncollaborative = 87). The survey was prepared by drawing on the <b>social</b> media <b>acceptance</b> model. It was piloted before the final data collection step was conducted in August 2013. The demographic details of the students were analyzed using Statistical Program for Social Sciences 21, while path modeling and multivariate analyses were conducted using SmartPLS 2. 0. The results revealed the significant effect of Self and Performance on students' intentions to use social media regardless of their learning styles. A pair-wise comparison revealed that Self was more significant in participatory students than in collaborative students. Effort was found to be the least significant factor, indicating the popularity of social media among students. Further insight into the different factors that drive students {{with different}} learning styles to use social media will help educators use this technology to assist learning more effectively...|$|R
