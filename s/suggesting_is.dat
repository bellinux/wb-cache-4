500|$|Sotomayor {{cast her}} first vote as an {{associate}} Supreme Court justice on August 17, 2009, in a stay of execution case. She was given a warm welcome onto the Court and was formally invested in a September 8 ceremony. Sotomayor's inaugural case in which she heard arguments was on September 9 during a special session, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. It involved the controversial aspect of the First Amendment {{and the rights of}} corporations in campaign finance; Sotomayor dissented. In her vigorous examination of Floyd Abrams, representing the First Amendment issues in the case, Sotomayor challenged him, questioning 19th century rulings of the Court and saying, [...] "What you are <b>suggesting</b> <b>is</b> that the courts, who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with ... a creature of State law with human characteristics." ...|$|E

You look for a consensus from the crowd—the answer that most minds are <b>suggesting</b> <b>is</b> the best answer. If it's a numeric question (like guessing the weight of an ox), it's a calculated average or median. If it's an open question (like [...] "what car should I buy?"), it's the most common answer.|$|E

Isolated words are scribbled, sketchy lines and restless black arrows meander across a surface that suggest objects but have no real identity. On occasion Colvin labels his works as [...] "Untitled" [...] and then gives them titles in parentheses, such as [...] "Metamorphosis," [...] "Space Cadet" [...] and [...] "Ambassador," [...] hinting at content but <b>suggesting</b> <b>is</b> content incidental to intent. - James R.

5000|$|Fabrice having {{returned}} to Lake Como, the novel now divides its attention {{between him and}} his aunt Gina (his father's sister). Gina meets and befriends the Prime Minister of Parma, Count Mosca. Count Mosca proposes that Gina marry a wealthy old man, who will be out of the country for many years as an ambassador, so that she and Count Mosca can be lovers while living under the social rules of the time. Gina's responds, [...] "But you realize that what you are <b>suggesting</b> <b>is</b> utterly immoral?" [...] Nevertheless, she agrees, and so a few months later, Gina is the new social eminence in Parma's rather small aristocratic elite.|$|E

[...] In a review of the band's 2003 greatest hits collection Thank You, AllMusic critic Stephen Erlewine wrote that [...] "STP made music that sounded great at the time and even better now," [...] and that [...] "this music has stood the test of the time," [...] calling Thank You [...] "nearly perfect".

5000|$|In September 2002, Albright and his {{organization}} ISIS {{were the first}} to publicly criticize the claims of the Bush administration and the CIA about the infamous Iraqi aluminum tubes. In response to Iraqi aluminum tubes, Albright said it was far from clear that the tubes were intended for a uranium centrifuge. The August/September 2003 American Journalism Review states: On December 8 2002 Bob Simon reported on 60 Minutes that the aluminum tubes story was being challenged. He quoted British intelligence officials and David Albright, a weapons inspector in Iraq for the U.N. in the 1990s. Albright said, [...] "People who understood gas centrifuges almost uniformly felt that these tubes were not specific to gas centrifuge use." [...] Simon said to Albright: [...] "It seems that what you're <b>suggesting</b> <b>is</b> that the administration's leak to the New York Times, regarding aluminum tubes, was misleading?" [...] Albright: [...] "Oh, I think it was. I think—I think it was very misleading."Albright stated: [...] "If the U.S. government puts out bad information it runs a risk of undermining the good information it possesses. In this case, I fear that the information was put out there for a short-term political goal: to convince people that Saddam Hussein is close to acquiring nuclear weapons." ...|$|E

With inspiration from work performed by Checkland and McKay & Marshall the conceptualisation we are <b>suggesting</b> <b>is</b> illustrated in a model consisting of three different practices. Action research means that a research practice and a business practice are interacting. This interaction constitutes a third practice, which is at the same time a business change practice and an intervening empirical research practice. In the paper, we show how the three practices are interlinked to each other. The analysis is based on a work practice theory (ToP) ...|$|E

I am suggesting that the spirit {{is present in the}} ‘sacraments of daily existence’ — the events and connections of everyday life that are hidden in the abstractions and ideologies that are given such importance. In becoming aware of the everyday something else enters — an ‘other history’ as David Malouf calls it, another dimension, an awareness of the permeability of our skins, our membership of the planet and its beauties, our communal life, and our survival as dependant on one another...|$|E

40|$|In {{this piece}} I {{will look at}} three areas of modern Canadian {{constitutional}} life in which one finds the play of these two constitutional logics. I will look to cultural and religious difference, judicial review, and issues of Indigenous rights. My purpose is to illuminate something generally unnoted but essential {{in the culture of}} Canadian constitutionalism and so my focus is on the Canadian case. Nevertheless, I would venture that although Canadian constitutional life might serve as a particularly potent instance of this dynamic, what I am exposing is a general predicament of modern constitutionalism and what I am <b>suggesting</b> <b>is</b> of broader methodological import in the study of constitutional cultures...|$|E
30|$|We {{model the}} {{transportation}} and distribution network with a commodity-specific spoilage rate ξi. We incorporate the normal amount of spoilage into the pre-shock benchmark {{economy in the}} model. That commodity-specific spoilage rate is amplified {{when there is a}} post-harvest labor shortage because there are not enough truck drivers to ship and deliver produce without harmful delays. What we are <b>suggesting</b> <b>is</b> that due to driver shortages (or other laborers en route) the necessary transit time from harvest to market increases, and thus, output loss from spoilage also increases although there is no change in the labor market. A larger value of ξ indicates more significant spoilage and thus less available output for sale relative to the zero-spoilage amount.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} and upgrades taxonomies of strategies and structures for the speech act of suggesting based on existing taxonomies and classifications in the pragmatics research literature. Previous {{studies have focused}} mainly on linguistic structures used to perform the speech act of suggesting. Thus, {{there seems to be}} a need to provide a more comprehensive set of taxonomies for structures as well as strategies that can be used in EFL/ESL classrooms and for research on the speech act of suggesting. To this end, the speech act of <b>suggesting</b> <b>is</b> defined first and the features of this speech act are discussed. Second, the most recent classifications proposed for structures and linguistic realization strategies for suggestions were analysed and contrasted and a more comprehensive taxonomy of structures and linguistic realization strategies is provided, based on previous taxonomies. Finally, taxonomy of politeness strategies i...|$|E
