5|$|The tantra {{practices}} are secretive, subject to speculations and criticism. Scholars variously attribute such criticism to ignorance, misunderstanding or sectarian bias {{on the part}} of some observers, as well as unscrupulous practices by some Shaktas. These are <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> many Hindus question the relevance and historicity of Tantra to their tradition.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics have {{no effect}} against viral infections or against the viruses that cause the common cold. Due to their side effects, {{antibiotics}} cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> that antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E
5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging parents and the business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time and attention to the exclusion of nearly everything else, and are accounted as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the author's declining artistry and her {{lack of interest in}} producing children's books.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} anecdotal reports of dogs, horses and {{dolphins}} killing themselves. There, however, {{has been little}} scientific study of animal suicide. Animal suicide is usually put down to romantic human interpretation and is not generally thought to be intentional. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> animals are thought to unintentionally kill themselves include: psychological stress, infection by certain parasites or fungi, or disruption of a long held social tie, such as the ending of a long association with an owner and thus not accepting food from another individual.|$|E
5|$|Hammond was {{selected}} for the M.C.C. tour of Australia in 1932–33. Known as the Bodyline series, it became notorious for the controversial English tactic of bowling short on the line of leg stump, making the ball rise towards the batsman's body to create deflections that could be caught by leg-side fielders. Hammond, {{one of the first}} players selected, was part of the selection committee on tour, and the M.C.C. captain, Douglas Jardine, may have discussed tactics with him on the outward journey. Hammond disapproved of Bodyline bowling, believing it to be dangerous, although he understood <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for its use. He kept his feelings hidden during the tour, preferring to go along with his captain {{and the rest of the}} team. It was not until 1946 that he openly voiced his opinion.|$|E
5|$|Leicester {{moved into}} the new 32,500-seat Walkers Stadium {{at the start of}} the 2002–03 season, ending 111 years at Filbert Street. Walkers, the Leicestershire-based crisp manufacturers, {{acquired}} the naming rights for a ten-year period. In October 2002, the club went into administration with debts of £30million. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> were the loss of TV money (ITV Digital, itself in administration, had promised money to First Division clubs for TV rights), the large wage bill, lower than expected fees for players transferred to other clubs and the £37million cost of the new stadium. Adams was banned from the transfer market for most of the season, even after the club was rescued with a takeover by a consortium led by Gary Lineker. Adams guided Leicester to the runners-up spot in Division One and automatic promotion back to the Premier League with more than 90 points. However, Leicester lasted only one season in the top flight and were relegated to the newly labelled Championship, previously known as Division One.|$|E

5|$|The {{other main}} {{behavioural}} {{theory is that}} the crest was used for intra-species recognition. This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> crests evolved in Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids. Instead, social and physiological functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication. As a large object, the crest has clear value as a visual signal, and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back, the proposed visual display would have been even showier. As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of Parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus) and sexual identification by shape and size.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, {{there was a}} serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who {{rejected}} the Hasidic movement were dubbed Mitnagdim ("opponents") by the followers of the Baal Shem Tov, who had previously called themselves Freylechn ("happy ones") and now call themselves Hasidim ("pious ones"). <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the overwhelming exuberance of Hasidic worship, their untraditional ascriptions of infallibility and alleged miracle-working to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Since then, all the groups of Hasidic Judaism have been subsumed theologically into mainstream Orthodox Judaism, particularly Haredi Judaism, although cultural differences persist.|$|E
25|$|There are {{important}} exceptions. They break the obviously apparent link between heat and temperature. They {{make it clear}} that empirical definitions of temperature are contingent on the peculiar properties of particular thermometric substances, and are thus precluded from the title 'absolute'. For example, water contracts on being heated near 277K. It cannot be used as a thermometric substance near that temperature. Also, over a certain temperature range, ice contracts on heating. Moreover, many substances can exist in metastable states, such as with negative pressure, that survive only transiently and in very special conditions. Such facts, sometimes called 'anomalous', are <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature.|$|E

25|$|On January 7, 1972, the FCC amended Part 97 {{to allow}} faster RTTY speeds.

Many Amateur Radio operators had equipment that {{was capable of}} being upgraded to 75 and 100 words per minute by changing teleprinter gears. While there was an initial interest in 100 words per minute operation, many Amateur Radio operators moved back to 60 words per minute. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> {{for the failure of}} 100 words per minute HF RTTY included poor operation of improperly maintained mechanical teleprinters, narrow bandwidth terminal units, continued use of 170Hz shift at 100 words per minute and excessive error rates due to multipath distortion and the nature of ionospheric propagation.|$|E
25|$|Victoria {{proportionally}} {{relies on}} manufacturing {{more than any}} other state in Australia, constituting 8.6% of total state product; slightly higher than South Australia at 8.0%. However, this proportion has been declining for three decades; in 1990 {{at the time of the}} early 1990s recession manufacturing constituted 20.3% of total state output. Manufacturing output peaked in absolute terms in 2008, reaching $28.8 billion and has slowly fallen over the decade to $26.8 billion in 2016 (-0.77% per annum). Since 1990, manufacturing employment has also fallen in both aggregate (367,700 to 274,400 workers) and proportional (17.8% to 9.0%) terms. The strong Australian dollar as a result of the 2000s mining boom, small population and isolation, high wage base and the general shift of manufacturing production towards developing countries have been cited as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for this decline.|$|E

25|$|As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural {{children}} between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school.

While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of teachers every day.

25|$|However, other sociologists {{point out}} that {{religious}} factors can explain high Muslim birthrates. Surveys indicate that Muslims in India have been relatively less willing to adopt family planning measures and that Muslim women have a larger fertility period since they get married at a much younger age compared to Hindu women. On the other hand, it is also documented that Muslims tend to adopt family planning measures. A study conducted by K.C. Zacharia in Kerala in 1983 revealed that on average, {{the number of children}} born to a Muslim woman was 4.1 while a Hindu woman gave birth to only 2.9 children. Religious customs and marriage practices were cited as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> behind the high Muslim birth rate. According to Paul Kurtz, Muslims in India are much more resistant to modern contraception than are Hindus and, as a consequence, the decline in fertility rate among Hindu women is much higher compared to that of Muslim women. The National Family and Health survey conducted in 1998–99 highlighted that Indian Muslim couples consider a substantially higher number of children to be ideal for a family as compared to Hindu couples in India. The same survey also pointed out that percentage of couples actively using family planning measures was more than 49% among Hindus against 37% among Muslims.|$|E
25|$|From 1926 to 1941, {{scores on}} the SAT were scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section. In 1941 and 1942, SAT scores were {{standardized}} via test equating, and as a consequence, average verbal and math scores could vary from that time forward. In 1952, mean verbal and math scores were 476 and 494, respectively, and scores were generally stable in the 1950s and early 1960s. However, starting in the mid-1960s and continuing until the early 1980s, SAT scores declined: the average verbal score dropped by about 50 points, and the average math score fell by about 30 points. By the late 1970s, only the upper third of test takers were {{doing as well as}} the upper half of those taking the SAT in 1963. From 1961 to 1977, the number of SATs taken per year doubled, suggesting that the decline could be explained by demographic changes in the group of students taking the SAT. Commissioned by the College Board, an independent study of the decline found that most (up to about 75%) of the test decline in the 1960s could be explained by compositional changes in the group of students taking the test; however, only about 25 percent of the 1970s decrease in test scores could similarly be explained. Later analyses suggested that up to 40 percent of the 1970s decline in scores could be explained by demographic changes, leaving unknown at least <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the decline.|$|E
