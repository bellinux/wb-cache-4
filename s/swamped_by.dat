5|$|Sotomayor's {{first major}} written opinion was a dissent in the Berghuis v. Thompkins case dealing with Miranda rights. As {{her first year}} neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> the {{intensity}} and heavy workload of the job. During the oral arguments for National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor showed her increasing familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.|$|E
5|$|A {{cattle egret}} will weakly defend {{the area around}} a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E
5|$|Representative peers were {{introduced}} in 1707, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united into the Kingdom of Great Britain. At the time, there were 168 English and 154 Scottish peers. The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> the Scottish element, and consequently {{the election of a}} small number of representative peers to represent Scotland was negotiated. A similar arrangement was adopted when the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in January 1801.|$|E

5|$|Returning to {{differential}} equations, Hamming studied {{means of}} numerically integrating them. A popular approach {{at the time}} was Milne's Method, attributed to Arthur Milne. This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions the result could be <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the Adams method. He did extensive research into digital filters, devising a new filter, the Hamming window, and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, Digital Filters (1977).|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling at the speed of light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
5|$|It {{was here}} that Hitler first became exposed to racist rhetoric. Populists such as mayor Karl Lueger {{exploited}} the climate of virulent anti-Semitism and occasionally espoused German nationalist notions for political effect. German nationalism had a particularly widespread following in the Mariahilf district, where Hitler lived. Georg Ritter von Schönerer became {{a major influence on}} Hitler. He also developed an admiration for Martin Luther. Hitler read local newspapers such as Deutsches Volksblatt that fanned prejudice and played on Christian fears of being <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> an influx of Eastern European Jews. He read newspapers and pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Le Bon and Arthur Schopenhauer.|$|E

5|$|From September 2 to September 3, large waves, some {{as high as}} , {{impacted}} beaches throughout southern California, with Los Angeles and Orange Counties experiencing growing breakers, and Cabrillo Beach experiencing riptides for {{two days}} straight. Due to the Labor Day beach turnout, many reports of rescuing swimmers who were swept up by waves caused by the hurricane were received. On September 2, forty-seven swimmers in Zuma Beach had to be rescued despite warnings {{to stay out of}} deep water, and an additional 261 rescues were reported in Newport. More rescues were reported the next day, although no exact total from the second day is known. At the El Morro Beach Trailer Park near Laguna Beach, a group of sundecks estimated at $5,000(1968USD) were ripped from their supports by rough seas. Long Beach, in terms of damage, was particularly hit hard by Liza, with debris and sea foam from the heavy surf clogging storm drains. A group of tidal pools formed along an area of the beach, draining out from a parking lot on 72nd Street onto Ocean Boulevard, resulting in flooding that closed a section of the boulevard between 68th Place and 72nd Place to traffic. Various flower gardens were also reported to have been <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> the flooding, but no damage to housing was reported. The weakened properties in West Newport Beach also sustained no additional damage.|$|E
5|$|The first {{lifeboat}} launched was Lifeboat 7 on {{the starboard}} side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65. It was lowered at around 12:45am as believed by the British Inquiry. Collapsible Boat D was the last lifeboat to be launched, at 2:05. Two more lifeboats, Collapsible Boats A and B, {{were in the process}} of being removed from their location on the roof of the officer's house but could not be properly launched. Collapsible B floated away from the ship upside down, while Collapsible A became half-filled with water after the supports for its canvas sides were broken in the fall from the roof of the officers' quarters. There were arguments in some of the lifeboats about going back to pick up people in the water, but many survivors were afraid of being <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> people trying to climb into the lifeboat or being pulled down by the suction from the sinking Titanic, though it turned out that there had been very little suction. At 2:20am, Titanic herself sank. A small number of passengers and crew were able to make their way to the two unlaunched collapsible boats, surviving for several hours (some still clinging to the overturned Collapsible B) until they were rescued by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe.|$|E

25|$|As the half-filled boats rowed {{away from}} the ship, they were too far for other {{passengers}} to reach, and most lifeboats {{did not return to}} the wreck, due to protests from passengers or crewmen to prevent being <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> drowning victims. Only two lifeboats returned to retrieve survivors from the water, some of whom later died.|$|E

25|$|While Republicans usually {{win more}} counties, by piling up large margins {{in the west}} and east, they are also usually <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> the more densely {{populated}} and heavily Democratic Baltimore-Washington axis. In 2008, for instance, McCain won 17 counties to Obama's six; Obama also carried Baltimore City. While McCain won most of the western and eastern counties by margins of 2-to-1 or more, he was almost completely shut out in the larger counties surrounding Baltimore and Washington; every large county except Anne Arundel went for Obama.|$|E
25|$|Hanson himself became {{active in}} {{political}} matters when, {{in the early}} 1950s, he joined the Australian Cultural Defence Movement which sought to protect Australian culture from being <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> foreign influences, particularly the United States and Americanization.

25|$|How the Ben Seyr met {{her fate}} {{is a matter}} of conjecture. Having been seen at Rosslare, it may be presumed that having sailed for Cardiff on Wednesday {{afternoon}} she soon encountered heavy seas. Her cargo of loose oats may of ran forward in the hold, the weight putting her nose under the water, in which case she could have sunk in a matter of minutes. Conversely, she may have attempted to turn back and run for the shelter of the Irish Coast during the course of which she was <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> the heavy seas - again her sinking would have followed quickly.|$|E
25|$|Philadelphia once {{comprised}} six congressional districts. However, as {{a result}} of the city's declining population, it now has only three: the 1st district, represented by Bob Brady; the 2nd, represented by Dwight Evans; and the 13th, represented by Brendan Boyle. All three are Democrats. Although they are usually <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> Democrats in city, state and national elections, Republicans still have some support in the area, primarily in the northeast. A Republican represented a significant portion of Philadelphia in the House as late as 1983, and Sam Katz ran competitive mayoral races as the Republican nominee in both 1999 and 2003.|$|E
25|$|Asbestos {{production}} {{began in}} the Urals of the Russian Empire in the 1880s, and in the Alpine regions of Northern Italy with the formation in Turin of the Italo-English Pure Asbestos Company in 1876, although this was soon <b>swamped</b> <b>by</b> the greater production levels from the Canadian mines. Mining also took off in South Africa from 1893 {{under the aegis of}} the British businessman Francis Oates, the Director of the De Beers company. It was in South Africa that the production of amosite began in 1910. The U.S. asbestos industry had an early start in 1858, when fibrous anthophyllite was mined for use as asbestos insulation by the Johns Company, a predecessor to the current Johns Manville, at a quarry at Ward's Hill on Staten Island, New York. US production began in earnest in 1899, with the discovery of large deposits in the Belvidere Mountain.|$|E
