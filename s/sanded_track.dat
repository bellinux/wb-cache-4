40|$|Brand, L., 1979. Field and {{laboratory}} {{studies on the}} Coconino Sandstone (Permian) vertebrate footprints and their paleoecological implications. Palaeogeogr., Palaeoclimatol., Palaeoecol., 28 : 25 - 38. The fossil footprints in the Coconino Sandstone have long been considered to be evidence for eolian deposition. I conducted field study of the fossil footprints in Hermit Basin, the Grand Canyon, {{and laboratory}} studies of modern amphibian and reptile foot-prints on dry sand, damp sand, wet sand, and underwater sand. Five species of salamanders all spent {{the majority of their}} locomotion time walking on the bottom, under water, rather than swimming. The experimental animals produced footprints under all test conditions, both up and down the 25 ° slopes of the laboratory "dunes". Toe marks and other details were present in over 80 % of the fossil tracks, underwater <b>tracks,</b> and wet <b>sand</b> <b>tracks,</b> but less than 12 % of the dry sand and damp <b>sand</b> <b>tracks</b> had any toe marks. Dry <b>sand</b> uphill <b>tracks</b> were usually just depressions, with no details. Wet <b>sand</b> <b>tracks</b> were quite different from the fossil tracks in certain features. The fossil tracks were most similar to the underwater tracks. These data suggest that the Coconino Sandstone fossil tracks should not be used as evidence for eolian deposition of dry sand...|$|R

40|$|The {{context of}} these works is in {{relation}} to my work within the world of regulated greyhound racing within the United Kingdom, and represents a progression from my earliest interests in biomechanics and statistical analysis, {{through the development of}} this knowledge and the acquisition of new skills as the research progressed. It details my roles within disease control, research into exercise-associated sudden death, and the links with other research threads that stemmed from the first projects involved with the physics of wet <b>sand</b> <b>tracks.</b> I hope to show that my love of science, not just an acceptance but an enquiring methodology, has resulted in my progression through a variety of issues and as a result made a major contribution to the greyhound world. The links I make stem from my need to keep ideas separate, {{yet at the same time}} use the links so that I can jump from one line of investigation to another. The expansion of knowledge resulting from wet <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> investigations has enabled a much better understanding of the natural and applied processes involved in maintaining wet <b>sand</b> <b>tracks,</b> and also paved the way for a critical analysis of the interaction of greyhounds’ feet with the running surface...|$|R

50|$|Near the port, {{originally}} named Boulevard de Marseille, settlers became {{defensive and}} stole a street sign of a famous street of Marseille renamed the street Canebière, a <b>sand</b> <b>track.</b> This is the legend behind the first Blohorn oil mills, in Cocody and a racetrack {{was built in the}} south of the city.|$|R
50|$|Ponta do Ouro {{is about}} 15 km {{away from the}} South African border and about 130 km South of Maputo. Due {{to the lack of}} tar roads between Maputo and Ponta, {{reaching}} Ponta from Maputo takes about 3-4 hours and a 4x4 vehicle, mainly due to the 20-30 km closer to Ponta, since most of this segment of the road is made up of soft <b>sand</b> <b>tracks,</b> sometimes confusing due to the many parallel paths and the lack of direction signs. Nevertheless, reaching Ponta from Maputo is easy in the dry season, since most of the <b>sand</b> <b>tracks</b> merge together near Ponta, there is always some traffic and to find help if required is not difficult. There is a project planned to build a full tar road between Ponta and Maputo, starting with a huge bridge crossing the Maputo bay.|$|R
25|$|In 1961 the a track {{heating system}} was {{introduced}} with electric cables sewn into the track by the tractor {{and a team}} of workers about eight inches under the turf. They would prove to be useful until the advent of all <b>sand</b> <b>tracks.</b> The track was able to use two hares, an 'Outside McGee' and 'Outside Sumner' and small hurdle races described as chases. Harringay held Bookmakers Afternoon greyhound Service (BAGS) meetings from 1967 after being chosen as one of the tracks to host the service.|$|R
50|$|After the {{completion}} of the South Road Extension, Mavis Hutter Reserve was created at the corner of Carroll Road and Bourke Road. The park contains two workstations of outdoor gym equipment, a playground, and a granitic <b>sand</b> <b>track.</b> The playground comprises a slide, swings, and butterfly sculpture. The granitic sand creates a circuit in the park.|$|R

50|$|In an {{idealised}} coastal psammosere model, at the seaward edge of {{the sand}} dune the pH of the soil is typically alkaline/neutral with a pH of 7.0/8.0 particularly where shell fragments provide a significant component of the <b>sand.</b> <b>Tracking</b> inland across the dunes a podsol develops with a pH of 5.0/ 4.0 followed by mature podsols at the climax with a pH of 3.5 - 4.5.|$|R
40|$|Examining {{edge effects}} is {{imperative}} to developing effective conservation and management strategies in fragmented landscapes as they are {{a key component of}} how landscape change influences habitat quality. Although medium- to large-bodied mammals are recognised as key components of tropical forests, their responses to forest edges remain poorly documented. Here, we describe how five species of medium- to large-bodied terrestrial neotropical mammals respond to forest-pasture edges along 17 forest patches (ranging in size from 5 - 4714 ha) and two continuous areas of Amazonian forest in Alta Floresta, Brazil. Tracks from two rodent (Dasyprocta agouti and Agouti paca) and three ungulate species (Tayassu tajacu, Mazama gouazoubira and Tapirus terrestris) were recorded over 4900 <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> station nights during a 4 -month study period. When species occurrences were compared between patch size classes we found a significant interaction between patch size and distance from the nearest forest edge only for ungulates. We discuss the cost-effectiveness of monitoring protocols for large terrestrial mammals in tropical forests based on <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> stations, and how edge effects and patch size can modulate species abundance and distribution...|$|R

Some degradation has occurred due to uncontrolled vehicular access, clearing for stock grazing, fire and rabbits.|$|R
5000|$|North Beach Road (the {{original}} road name) and {{was built}} to offer access to Osborne Park, which {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century was rural community with established agriculture including market gardens, pig farms, dairy farms, and poultry farms. Whilst it was a formed road from North Perth to the corner of Frobisher Road, there was only a <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> beyond this point to Njookenbooroo, now known as Innaloo. A plank road, completed in 1912, replaced this <b>sand</b> <b>track,</b> and [...] "some years later", a limestone road extension to Brighton Road, near the coast, was built. By 1925 the road had been renamed as Scarborough Beach Road, and was classified as an arterial road by Mr. Arundale, the Perth Road Board engineer in 1925. By 1933, the plank roads in the area had been replaced by regular roads, but these roads were narrow and many accidents occurred due to increase in traffic associated with Scarborough Beach's rising popularity. The increasing traffic meant that the road was continually being upgraded, including a partial reconstruction by the Main Roads Department in 1938. In the 1950s, prior to the development of shopping centres at Karrinyup and Innaloo, the Mount Hawthorn section of the road was a popular shopping area.|$|R

50|$|To support Eighth Army's {{attack on}} Wadi Akarit on 6 April, First Army {{attacked}} towards Kairouan {{to cut off}} the enemy retreat. The approach roads for 128th Infantry Brigade Group were little more than 150 miles of <b>sand</b> <b>tracks,</b> and had to be improved by 586th Field Company, assisted by US engineers from II Corps. On 8 April, 128th Bde captured Pichon in an operation requiring two crossings of the bed of the Oued Marguellil and considerable mine clearance. The Tunisian campaign ended on 12 May with the surrender of Armeegruppe Afrika.|$|R
40|$|International audienceContext: Mediterranean areas offer {{a mosaic}} of {{favourable}} microhabitats to reptiles (e. g. open zones, thorny bushes) and are considered as biodiversity hotspots for these organisms. However, in these dry and hot environments, reptiles remain sheltered most of the time. They generally escape observation, posing difficulties to perform inventories. Trap sampling or rock-turning surveys commonly used to detect reptiles entail important logistical constraints, may perturb fragile microhabitats, and are not appropriate for chelonians. Alternative simple and cost-effective methods are desired. Aims: We tested the efficiency of camera trapping in a dry Mediterranean landscape, notably to detect threatened Hermann’s tortoises. We tested whether small artificial freshwater ponds could attract animals {{in the field of}} view of the cameras to increase detectability. We also tested whether <b>sand</b> <b>tracks</b> survey around ponds could improve the method. Methods: We used a small number of cameras with ponds (5 in 2011, 7 in 2012), thereby maintaining low logistical costs. We randomly filled three ponds and emptied three ponds every 7 days. We set the time-lapse function of each camera with an interval of 5 min and inspected the <b>sand</b> <b>tracks</b> every 2 or 3 days. We used information from 39 radio-tracked tortoises to better estimate the detectability performances of the camera–pond system. Key results: This technique was effective to detect tortoises (n = 348 observations) and five other reptiles (among the 11 species present in the study area). Large numbers of birds and mammals were observed (n = 4232, n = 43 species at least), thereby increasing the biodiversity list of the surveyed area. We detected 28 % of the radio-tracked tortoises present in the monitored area. Filled ponds were more attractive and <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> survey completed camera monitoring. Conclusions: Camera trapping associated with small ponds represent a useful tool to perform rapid inventories of the fauna in Mediterranean habitats, especially to detect the emblematic Hermann’s tortoise and other cryptic reptiles (e. g. snakes). Implications: The low cost–efficiency ratio of this method allows performing multiple counting surveys, and thus may help collect robust data necessary to justify the protection of key habitats that are coveted by property developers...|$|R
