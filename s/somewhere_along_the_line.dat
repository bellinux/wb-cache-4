500|$|Actor Jim Beaver {{described}} Bobby as a [...] "rough but warmhearted" [...] working-class {{man with}} the outlook that [...] "sometimes {{there are things that}} need to be done and they're not fun to do, but they gotta be done anyway". When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead of being able to join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. <b>Somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous things might happen to him.

500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit.

According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him." ...|$|E
500|$|Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming, was cast as Lucius Vorenus, one of the lead characters. McKidd said, [...] "What was different about this show is you get 14 months to really get into {{every nook and cranny}} of the character, in a way you don't get a chance to explore when you do a movie or a theater play. Initially, it was a terrifying prospect. But once you got over that, you realize what a great opportunity it was." [...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E

500|$|Kid A {{received}} a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw Kid A as a [...] "commercial suicide note", labelling it [...] "intentionally difficult" [...] and {{longing for a}} return to the band's earlier style. Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work. Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying: [...] "I was really, really amazed at how badly [...] was being viewed... because the music's not that hard to grasp. We're not trying to be difficult... We're actually trying to communicate but <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> we just seemed to piss off a lot of people... What we're doing isn't that radical." [...] The album has since been ranked one of the best of all time by publications including Time and Rolling Stone; Pitchfork, the Times and Rolling Stone named it the best album of the decade.|$|E
500|$|The {{reworked}} 1996 Broadway production received mixed reviews. Vincent Canby of The New York Times disliked it: [...] "This latest King and I {{might look}} like a million dollars as a regional production; on Broadway... it's a disappointment. The score remains enchanting but, <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> {{there has been a}} serious failure of the theatrical imagination." [...] But Liz Smith enthused: [...] "The King and I is perfect"; and the Houston Chronicle wrote, of the subsequent tour, [...] "The King and I is the essence of musical theater, an occasion when drama, music, dance and decor combine to take the audience on an unforgettable journey." [...] Critic Richard Christiansen in the Chicago Tribune observed, of a 1998 tour stop at the Auditorium Theatre: [...] "Written in a more leisurely and innocent and less politically correct period, [...] cannot escape the 1990s onus of its condescending attitude toward the pidgin English monarch and his people. And its story moves at a pace that's a mite too slow for this more hurried day and age." [...] When the production reached London in 2000, however, it received uniformly positive reviews; the Financial Times called it [...] "a handsome, spectacular, strongly performed introduction to one of the truly great musicals".|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics. Ramsey Isler of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "There {{was a time when}} [...] was one of the funniest shows on TV; it was comedy gold. But <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> the show's shine faded, its image was tarnished, and the magic disappeared", but added, [...] "That's not to say that FG hasn't been good at all lately. Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, [...] "Road to the Multiverse", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline". He listed [...] "Brian's Got a Brand New Bag", [...] "Jerome Is the New Black", [...] "Go Stewie Go", [...] "Peter-assment" [...] and [...] "April in Quahog" [...] as the worst episodes of the season. Isler praised the [...] "tail end of the season", however, citing [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as [...] "one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume eight DVD, Frank Rizzo of DVD Talk said, [...] "The episodes stand on their own, whether you care about the dependence on easy gags and gimmicky concepts or not, because they are simply funny." [...] Rizzo commented on the DVD release: [...] "Fans of Family Guy, or any of MacFarlane's series for that matter, have to be concerned that the very reason the series continues to air, the DVDs the fans buy, are getting diluted and weakened, especially when you're getting less extras, less MacFarlane, and, for the first time, less of the commentaries that give you a peek into the show's creation." ...|$|E

50|$|The first {{hotel in}} Oppdal was Bjerklund Hotell, {{which opened in}} 1913. In 1918, Norsk Hotelkompani bought a 8.7 ha lot at HÃ¸gmo for a hotel, but they {{never got around to}} {{building}} the hotel. By 1919, Spisevognselskapet was considering building a tourist hotel <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Dovre <b>Line,</b> and Hjerkinn and Fokstua were mentioned in the newspapers as probable locations. Oppdal Station opened on 20 September 1921 when <b>the</b> Dovre <b>Line</b> was opened through town. The same day, Norsk Spisevognselskap started operations of a station restaurant in the station building. The facilities were too small, but it would be too costly to expand the station building to make a larger restaurant. It was therefore decided to establish a combined restaurant and tourist hotel next to the station. Plans were made by Architect Gudmund Hoel and District Manager von Krogh. The plans were approved by the company's board on 20 September 1922, and passed by the general meeting on 27 October. The board was given authority to loan-finance the investment.|$|R

2500|$|American Reform, especially, turned {{action for}} social and {{progressive}} causes into {{an important part of}} religious commitment. From {{the second half of the}} 20th Century, it employed the old rabbinic notion of Tikkun Olam, [...] "repairing the world", as a slogan under which constituents were encouraged to partake in various initiatives for the betterment of society. The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism became an important lobby in service of progressive causes such as the rights of women, minorities, LGBT and the like. Tikkun Olam has become the central venue for active participation for many affiliates, even leading critics to negatively describe Reform as little more than a means employed by Jewish liberals to claim that commitment to their political convictions was also a religious activity and demonstrates fealty to Judaism. Dana Evan Kaplan stated that [...] "Tikkun Olam has incorporated only leftist, socialist-like elements. In truth, it is political, basically a mirror of the most radically leftist components of the Democratic Party platform, causing many to say that Reform Judaism is simply 'the Democratic Party with Jewish holidays'." [...] Rabbi Jakob Josef Petuchowski complained that under the influence of secular Jews who constitute most of its congregants since the 1950s, when lack of religious affiliation was particularly frowned upon, [...] "Reform Judaism is today in the forefront of secularism in America... Very often indistinguishable from the ACLU... The fact of the matter is that it has, <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> lost its religious moorings." [...] In Israel, the Religious Action Center is very active in the judicial field, often resorting to litigation both in cases concerning civil rights in general and the official status of Reform within the state, in particular.|$|E
5000|$|The angle {{between the}} sea horizon and the {{celestial}} body is {{measured with a}} sextant and the time noted. The Sextant reading {{is known as the}} 'Sextant Altitude'. This is corrected by use of tables to a 'True Altitude' [...] The actual declination and hour angle of the celestial body are found from astronomical tables for the time of the measurement and together with the 'True Altitude' are put into a formula with the assumed latitude. This formula calculates the 'True Hour Angle' which is compared to the assumed longitude providing a correction to the assumed longitude. This correction is applied to the assumed position so that a position line can be drawn through the assumed latitude at the corrected longitude at 90Â° to the azimuth (bearing) on the celestial body. The observer's position is <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> position <b>line,</b> not necessarily at the found longitude at the assumed latitude. If two or more sights or measurements are taken within a few minutes of each other a 'fix' can be obtained and the observer's position determined as the point where <b>the</b> position <b>lines</b> cross.|$|R
2500|$|Less {{impressed}} was GameSpot's Ron Dulin, {{who scored}} the game 6 out of 10, calling it [...] "an interesting mood piece, built upon some very detailed graphic work and an interesting premise â but <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> production <b>line,</b> someone forgot {{to include a}} game." [...] He was critical of the random nature of the game, especially the multiple endings; [...] "To justify the number of wildly different endings, the designers have tried to keep some elements of the story very vague {{for the bulk of}} the story. But even with these safeguards, there are always a number of confusing contradictions and loose ends no matter how the story winds up." [...] He concluded, [...] "most of what's interesting about the game is exactly what was interesting about the film, and not much was done to extend the concepts or explore them any further. Fans of the film will undoubtedly overlook the game's flaws and enjoy living the life of the Blade Runner, even if it only lasts a few hours. But those who are awaiting the next generation of adventure games are advised to keep waiting." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{two types}} of Directional Couplers. First, magnetic coupling between a transmission line and a secondary circuit is studied. It is then shown that frequency independent samples of voltage and current on <b>the</b> transmission <b>line</b> yield a feasible way of obtaining separate readings of the forward and reflected waves. The second type of coupler {{takes advantage of the}} electrostatic and magnetic coupling existing between two parallel conductors. A simplified model of the cou-pler permits a straightforward analysis of the circuit. Expressions for the forward and reflected voltages are then readily obtained. In both cases, a peak detector circuit gives DC readings of the voltages. 1 Directional Couplers A directional coupler (D. C.) is a device that detects and separates the incident and reflected waves present in a transmission <b>line,</b> for instance, <b>the</b> one that links the radio transmitter with the antenna system.

[...] He sets off in July 1947 with fifty dollars in his pocket. After taking several buses and hitchhiking, he arrives in Denver, where he hooks up with Carlo Marx, Dean, and their friends. There are partiesâamong them an excursion to the ghost town of Central City. Eventually Sal leaves by bus and gets to San Francisco, where he meets Remi Boncoeur and his girlfriend Lee Ann. Remi arranges for Sal to take a job as a night watchman at a boarding camp for merchant sailors waiting for their ship. Not holding this job for long, Sal hits the road again. [...] "Oh, where is the girl I love?" [...] he wonders. Soon he meets Terry, the [...] "cutest little Mexican girl," [...] on the bus to Los Angeles.

40|$|AbstractâPositron {{emission}} particle tracking (PEPT) is {{a technique}} in which a single radioactive tracer particle can be accurately tracked as it moves. A limitation of PET is {{that in order to}} reconstruct a tomographic image it is necessary to acquire a large volume of data (millions of events), so it is difficult to study rapidly changing systems. By considering this fact, PEPT is a very fast process compared with PET. In PEPT detecting both photons defines a <b>line</b> and <b>the</b> annihilation is assumed to have occurred <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> this <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> location of the tracer can be determined to within a few mm from coincident detection of a small number of pairs of back-to-back gamma rays and using triangulation. This can be achieved many times per second and the track of a moving particle can be reliably followed. This technique was invented at the University of Birmingham [1]. The attempt in PEPT is not to form an image of the tracer particle but simply to determine its location with time. If this tracer is followed for a long enough period within a closed, circulating system it explores all possible types of motion. The application of PEPT to industrial process systems carried out at the University of Birmingham is categorized in two subjects: the behaviour of granular materials and viscous fluids. Granular materials are processed in industry for example in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, ceramics, food, polymers and PEPT has been used {{in a number of ways}} to study the behaviour of these systems [2]. PEPT allows the possibility of tracking a single particle within the bed [3]. Also PEPT has been used for studying systems such as: fluid flow, viscous fluids in mixers [4], using a neutrally-buoyant tracer particle [5]...|$|R
