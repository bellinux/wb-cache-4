40|$|The {{contents}} of chlorophyll, soluble sugars, soluble proteins and thiobarbituric acid reaction substance (TBARS), chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, net photosynthetic rate {{as well as}} the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) of flag leaves at the late growth stages were studied by using C Liangyou series of hybrid rice combinitions as material and Shanyou 63 as control. The C Liangyou series of hybrid rice combinations used in the experiment included C Liangyou 396, C Liangyou 87, C Liangyou 755 and C Liangyou 34, which all used C 815 S as male sterile line. The {{contents of}} chlorophyll, soluble sugars and soluble proteins in flag leaves of the C Liangyou <b>series</b> <b>combinations</b> at the late growth stages were higher than those of the control, whereas the TBARS content was lower than that of the control. The activities of SOD and POD were significantly higher than those of the control on the 7 th day after heading, and then decreased slowly. FPSII value and qP value of flag leaves decreased at the late growth stages, and these two parameters in flag leaves of the C Liangyou <b>series</b> <b>combinations</b> were higher than those of the control, while the qN value increased at the late growth stages and was lower than that of the control. The net photosynthetic rate of flag leaves at the late growth stage was higher compared with the control. These results suggest that slow senescence and strong photosynthetic capability in flag leaves at the late growth stages are the physiological basis of the C Liangyou <b>series</b> <b>combinations...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The basic LCC {{configuration}} for HVDC uses a three-phase Graetz {{bridge rectifier}} or six-pulse bridge, containing six electronic switches, each connecting {{one of the}} three phases to one of the two DC terminals. A complete switching element is usually referred to as a valve, irrespective of its construction. [...] Normally, two valves in the bridge are conducting at any time: one on the top row and one (from a different phase) on the bottom row. The two conducting valves connect two of the three AC phase voltages, in series, to the DC terminals. [...] Thus, the DC output voltage at any given instant is given by the <b>series</b> <b>combination</b> of two AC phase voltages. For example, if valves V1 and V2 are conducting, the DC output voltage is given by the voltage of phase 1 minus the voltage of phase 3.|$|E

30|$|We {{test for}} unit root and cointegration. 14 The {{results of the}} ADF test on the levels suggest that the null {{hypothesis}} of unit root presence cannot be rejected at five percent significance level for all series, {{with the exception of}} the weighted average deposit rate. However, as the evidence of stationarity is not compelling, we proceed to test stationarity for first differences. After first-differencing, the null hypothesis of unit root presence is safely rejected for all series. The Engle–Granger test’s null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected for all <b>series</b> <b>combinations</b> except the government bond rates, suggesting that the monetary policy rate shares a long-run relationship only with the retail rates.|$|R
