50|$|Ice core {{samples were}} also made, but with mixed success. On October 29, 1966, the camp {{inhabitants}} experienced a severe <b>snowquake</b> that lowered the altitude by 1 cm. This was apparently caused by hoar frost crystals below the surface.|$|E
40|$|Thermally induced {{fractures}} or thermal cracks, {{and pronounced}} seismic events as snowquakes were studied at Mizuho Station, East Antarctica from June 1976 to January 1977. Fractures due to thermal stress {{were found in}} the uppermost 50 cm of the snow cover as a result of snow temperature decrease at the surface, and fracture under tensile thermal stress occurs when the stress exceeds the tensile strength of snow. Once thermal cracks are initiated, stress concentration occurs at tips of cracks, and fractures occur more easily in the smaller thermal stress than the tensile strength of snow and accompany more easily pronounced seismic events, that is, <b>snowquake.</b> Snowquakes occur during the decrease of temperature and then thermally induced strain rate corresponds to ductile fracture of snow. The individual snowquakes occur in the near surface and the epicenters of snowquakes located by seismic observations are found near thermal cracks, which indicates that <b>snowquake</b> is caused by the formation of cracks. The epicenters are not distributed in a well-ordered sequence, thus the fractures of snow cover occur at random in the near surface which is under the tensile stress during the decrease of snow temperature...|$|E
40|$|The oversnow {{traverse}} {{party of}} the 14 th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (1973 - 1974) conducted researches according to the " Glaciological Research Program in Mizuho Plateau-West Enderby Land" and made, some geophysical observations at Mizuho Plateau, East Antarctica. Four oversnow traverses were made from Syowa Station to Mizuho Camp (70 ° 41. 92 ̆ 7 S, 44 ° 19. 92 ̆ 7 E) in January, April, August and September-October in 1973, and one traverse from Syowa Station to the Yamato Mountains via Mizuho Camp, from 10 November 1973 to 2 February 1974. The traverse party to the Yamato Mountains consisted of two glaciologists, one meteorologist, one geomagnetist, one geodesist, one geologist, one medical doctor, one field assistant and two mechanics. The party carried out the following tasks : 1) Measurement of the ice sheet flow by the resurvey of the triangulation chain which was installed by the JARE- 10, in 1969 along the parallel of 72 ° S; 2) Measurement of the ice thickness by a radio echo sounder; 3) Measurement of net accumulation with snow stakes; 4) Observation of katabatic wind and micrometeorological conditions by radio sondes and a sonic anemometer; 5) Surface meteorological observation, three times a day; 6) Measurement of drifting snow; 7) Continuous observation of geomagnetic field and its pulsations; 8) Observation of VLF emission; 9) Measurement of the inclination and declination of geomagnetism; 10) Measurement of gravity by the LaCoste gravity meter; 11) Measurement of elevation by a barometric altimeter; 12) Terrestrial survey of the Yamato Mountains; 13) Geological survey of the Yamato Mountains; 14) Observation of <b>snowquake</b> by a seismograph; 15) Measurement of 10 m snow temperature; 16) Geomorphological observation of the ice surface; 17) Geomorphological survey of ice mounds at 69 ° 402 ̆ 7 S, 44 ° 122 ̆ 7 E; 18) Traverse survey from Syowa Station to Mizuho Camp; 19) Collection of meteorites {{in the vicinity of}} the Yamato Mountains...|$|E
