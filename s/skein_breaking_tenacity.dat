40|$|High Performance {{polymeric}} materials are {{a subject of}} considerable interest due to their high mechanical performances when combined with their versatility in processing and synthesis. In order to achieve high mechanical properties, scientist focuses on increasing the molecular weight of the polymer produced. A striking example is polyethylene. When having a molar mass of approximately 10 ^ 3 - 10 ^ 4 g/mol, it is soft a material and it is used for films and packaging; when the molecular weight increases over 10 ^ 6 g/mol (also called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene - UHMWPE) it becomes extremely hard and it is used in ballistic and in high modulus/high strength applications. However, on increasing the molecular weight, also the viscosity increases due to {{the large number of}} entanglements in the non-crystalline region of the semi-crystalline material. The current state-of-the-art in processing this material is by partial dissolution of a small amount of polymer (~ 5 - 10 wt. %) in organic solvents {{in order to reduce the}} entanglements [1]. A recent development in the processing of the UHMWPE is achieved by direct synthesis of the polymer having a reduced amount of entanglements. By tailoring the reaction conditions during synthesis and making a meticulous choice of the catalytic system, it is possible to synthesise disentangled-UHMWPE. The disentangled-UHMWPE can be uniaxial as well as biaxial solid-state processing without using any solvent. The resulting solid-state processed tapes have unprecedented <b>breaking</b> <b>tenacity</b> (> 4. 0 GPa) and tensile modulus (> 200 Gpa) [2].

40|$|The {{production}} of fine filaments using the melt spinning process needs considerable effort. A thermoplastic melt is stretched from the spinneret under a constant take-up speed. The high performance thermoplastic PEEK is solidified in the melt spinning {{process in a}} small distance and short time. Therefore, the fine PEEK filaments in the fibre formation zone underwent a high deformation and cooling rate. To make the melt spinning process stable and to produce the fine PEEK filaments, material properties and material behaviour are examined using on-line and off-line measurements. The fibre speed measured using Laser Doppler Anemometry and simultaneous temperature measured using infrared thermography enable both the strain rate and consequently the apparent extensional viscosity to be estimated. This provides the apparent extensional viscosity over the spinning line, which can itself show the structural development of PEEK fibres in the fibre formation zone, i. e. necking and solidification phenomena. The one-dimensional fibre formation model must include both procedural and material parameters. The heat transfer coefficient was estimated using the filament temperature measurement and showed a relatively high contribution of radiation and free convection in comparison to forced convection near the spinneret. The improved model of PEEK fibre formation gave a good agreement to both temperature and speed measurements, and also confirmed the high deformation rate effect on the extensional viscosity, which could be simulated with a properly generalised Newtonian constitutive equation. The end properties of the fibres, such as as-spun filament fineness, orientation (expressed using total birefringence) and total crystallisation (examined using DSC) are investigated in relation to different spinning conditions, i. e. take-up speed, throughput and the draw down ratio. The tensile test diagram results, measuring phenomena such as the elongation at <b>break,</b> <b>tenacity,</b> and the Young modulus of elasticity are also analysed in order to complete the correlation of the above-mentioned spinning conditions to the structural properties of as-spun fine PEEK filaments.

Three counts (30, 40 and 50 tex) were manufactured with various twist levels. It was observed that the strength of yarn was affected with an increase of the twist and count. The yarn manufactured with 230 tpm and 50 tex count shows better yarn strength as compared with other twist levels and yarn counts. Further, it was found that reduction in twist improves the evenness of yarn...|$|R
40|$|The {{currently}} available clinical imaging methods {{do not provide}} highly detailed information about location and severity of axonal injury or the expected recovery time of patients with traumatic brain injury [1]. High-Definition Fiber Tractography (HDFT) is a novel imaging modality that allows visualizing and quantifying, directly, the degree of axons damage, predicting functional deficits due to traumatic axonal injury and loss of cortical projections. This imaging modality is based on diffusion technology [2]. The inexistence of a phantom able to mimic properly the human brain hinders the possibility of testing, calibrating and validating these medical imaging techniques. Most research done in this area fails in key points, such as the size limit reproduced of the brain fibers and the quick and easy reproducibility of phantoms [3]. For that reason, {{it is necessary to}} develop similar structures matching the micron scale of axon tubes. Flexible textiles can play an important role since they allow producing controlled packing densities and crossing structures that match closely the human crossing patterns of the brain. To build a brain phantom, several parameters {{must be taken into account}} in what concerns to the materials selection, like hydrophobicity, density and fiber diameter, since these factors influence directly the values of fractional anisotropy. Fiber cross-section shape is other important parameter. Earlier studies showed that synthetic fibrous materials are a good choice for building a brain phantom [4]. The present work is integrated in a broader project that aims to develop a brain phantom made by fibrous materials to validate and calibrate HDFT. Due to the similarity between thousands of hollow multifilaments in a fibrous arrangement, like a yarn, and the axons, low twist polypropylene multifilament yarns were selected for this development. In this sense, extruded hollow filaments were analysed in scanning electron microscope to characterize their main dimensions and shape. In order to approximate the dimensional scale to human axons, five types of polypropylene yarns with different linear density (denier) were used, aiming to understand the effect of linear density on the filament inner and outer areas. Moreover, in order to achieve the required dimensions, the polypropylene filaments cross-section was diminished in a drawing stage of a filament extrusion line. Subsequently, tensile tests were performed to characterize the mechanical behaviour of hollow filaments and to evaluate the differences between stretched and non-stretched filaments. In general, an increase of the linear density causes the increase in the size of the filament cross section. With the increase of structure orientation of filaments, induced by stretching, <b>breaking</b> <b>tenacity</b> increases and elongation at break decreases. The production of hollow fibers, with the required characteristics, is one of the key steps to create a brain phantom that properly mimics the human brain that may be used for the validation and calibration of HDFT, an imaging approach that is expected to contribute significantly to the areas of brain related research...|$|R
40|$|Ramie yarns {{were treated}} with various {{concentrations}} of NaOH at room temperature and subsequently crosslinked with 1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA). The microstructure and tensile properties of the treated yarns were characterized. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR were used to study the crystalline structure of the resultant ramie yarns. The {{results showed that the}} maximum change {{in the structure of the}} alkali-modified ramie took place at 16 % NaOH, which would completely transform cellulose I to cellulose II. At the same time, the crystallinity index and fiber orientation decreased to the minimum value while the absorption properties were enhanced. The average degree of polymerization (DP̄) of the treated ramie yarns slightly decreased after NaOH treatment. Tensile properties including <b>tenacity,</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation, and modulus of the treated yarns were also investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the breakage of the treated yarns. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, it {{is aimed}} at {{determining}} the equations and models for estimating the sirospun yarn quality characteristics from the yarn production parameters and cotton fibre properties, which are focused on fibre bundle measurements represented by HVI (high volume instrument). For this purpose, a total of 270 sirospun yarn samples were produced on the same ring spinning machine under the same conditions at Ege University, by using 11 different cotton blends and three different strand spacing settings, in four different yarn counts and in three different twist coefficients. The sirospun yarn and cotton fibre property interactions were investigated by correlation analysis. For the prediction of yarn quality characteristics, multivariate linear regression methods were performed. As {{a result of the}} study, equations were generated for the prediction of yarn <b>tenacity,</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation, unevenness and hairiness by using fibre and yarn properties. After the goodness of fit statistics, very large determination coefficients (R 2 and adjusted R 2) were observed...|$|R
