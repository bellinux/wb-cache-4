Humans are the only species known to develop illness after CCHF virus (CCHFV) infection, {{characterized}} by a nonspecific febrile illness that can progress to severe, often fatal, hemorrhagic disease. A variety of animals may serve as asymptomatic reservoirs of CCHFV in an endemic cycle of transmission. <b>Seroepidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> have been instrumental in elucidating CCHFV reservoirs and in determining endemic foci of viral transmission.

40|$|Background: <b>Seroepidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> {{before and}} after the {{epidemic}} wave of H 1 N 1 - 2009 are useful for estimating population attack rates with a potential to validate early estimates of the reproduction number, R, in modeling studies. Methodology/Principal Findings: Since the final epidemic size, the proportion of individuals in a population who become infected during an epidemic, is not the result of a binomial sampling process because infection events are not independent of each other, we propose the use of an asymptotic distribution of the final size to compute approximate 95 % confidence intervals of the observed final size. This allows the comparison of the observed final sizes against predictions based on the modeling study (R = 1. 15, 1. 40 and 1. 90), which also yields simple formulae for determining sample sizes for future <b>seroepidemiological</b> <b>studies.</b> We examine a total of eleven published <b>seroepidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> of H 1 N 1 - 2009 that took place after observing the peak incidence in a number of countries. Observed seropositive proportions in six studies appear to be smaller than that predicted from R = 1. 40; four of the six studies sampled serum less than one month after the reported peak incidence. The comparison of the observed final sizes against R = 1. 15 and 1. 90 reveals that all eleven studies appear not to be significantly deviating from the prediction with R = 1. 15, but final sizes in nine studies indicate overestimation if the value R = 1. 90 is used.

40|$|The {{serological}} {{detection of}} antibodies against human papillomavirus (HPV) antigens {{is a useful}} tool to determine exposure to genital HPV infection and in predicting the risk of infection persistence and associated lesions. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are commonly used for <b>seroepidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> of HPV infection but are not standardized. Intra- and interassay performance variation is difficult to control, especially in cohort studies that require the testing of specimens over extended periods. We propose the use of normalized absorbance ratios (NARs) as a standardization procedure to control for such variations and minimize measurement error. We compared NAR and ELISA optical density (OD) values for {{the strength of the}} correlation between serological results for paired visits 4 months apart and HPV- 16 DNA positivity in cervical specimens from a cohort investigation of 2, 048 women tested with an ELISA using HPV- 16 virus-like particles. NARs were calculated by dividing the mean blank-subtracted (net) ODs by the equivalent values of a control serum pool included in the same plate in triplicate, using different dilutions. Stronger correlations were observed with NAR values than with net ODs at every dilution, with an overall reduction in nonexplained regression variability of 39 %. Using logistic regression, the ranges of odds ratios of HPV- 16 DNA positivity contrasting upper and lower quintiles at different dilutions and their averages were 4. 73 to 5. 47 for NARs and 2. 78 to 3. 28 for net ODs, with corresponding significant improvements in seroreactivity-risk trends across quintiles when NARs were used.

40|$|Background: <b>Seroepidemiological</b> <b>study</b> of {{parvovirus}} B 19 has {{not taken}} place for some 20 years in Japan. To estimate the risk of parvovirus B 19 infection in Japan among blood donors and pregnant women in this century, a seroepidemiological survey and statistical modeling of the force of infection were conducted. Methodology/Principal Findings: The time- and age-specific seroprevalence data were suggestive of strong age-dependency {{in the risk of}} infection. Employing a piecewise constant model, the highest forces of infection of 0. 05 and 0. 12 per year were observed among those aged 0 â€“ 4 and 5 â€“ 9 years, respectively, while estimates among older individuals were less than 0. 01 per year. Analyzing the antigen detection data among blood donors, the age-specific proportion positive was highest among those aged 30 â€“ 39 years, agreeing with the presence of dip in seroprevalence in this age-group. Among pregnant women, up to 107 fetal deaths and 21 hydrops fetalis were estimated to have occurred annually across Japan. Conclusions: Seroepidemiological profiles of PVB 19 infection in Japan was characterized with particular emphasis on the risk of infection in blood donors and the burden of infection among pregnant women.
