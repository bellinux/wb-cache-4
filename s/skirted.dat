In {{the middle of}} the second quarter, up 70, McMillin <b>skirted</b> left end and cut back across the field for a 49-yard touchdown. Herb Covington next had a 39-yard touchdown. In the fourth, a 30-yard pass to Roberts was followed shortly by a 35-yard pass to Hennie Lemon for the touchdown. Bobby Lavin starred for the Wildcats.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of large trim and heel angles of the wrecked submarine, the double spherical shell {{rotating}} docking <b>skirt</b> is studied. According to the working principle of the rotating docking <b>skirt,</b> and the fixed <b>skirt,</b> the directional <b>skirt,</b> the angle <b>skirt</b> are simplified as the connecting rod. Therefore, the posture equation and kinematics model of the docking <b>skirt</b> are deduced, and according to the kinematics model, the angle of rotation of the directional <b>skirt</b> and the angle <b>skirt</b> is obtained when the wrecked submarine is in different trim and heel angles. Through the directional <b>skirt</b> and angle <b>skirt</b> with the matching rotation can make docking <b>skirt</b> interface in the 0 °~ 2 γ range within the rotation, to complete the docking <b>skirt</b> and the wrecked submarine docking. The MATLAB software is used to visualize the rotation angle of fixed <b>skirt</b> and directional <b>skirt,</b> which lays a good foundation for the development of the control of the double spherical shell rotating docking <b>skirt</b> in future...|$|R

5|$|A modern {{repeat of}} the 1858 storm is {{estimated}} to cause damages of {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars. A {{repeat of the}} 1939 tropical storm would cause around 200million dollars in damage. The most serious damage would be due to rains rather than winds or storm surge, although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf, possibly injuring or killing people. Nora caused millions in damage and <b>skirted</b> extreme southeastern California.|$|E

5|$|After peak intensity, Chapala <b>skirted</b> the Yemeni {{island of}} Socotra on 1November. Drier air and {{increased}} wind shear weakened the cyclone, although it maintained {{much of its}} intensity upon entering the Gulf of Aden on 2November, becoming the strongest known cyclone in that body of water. After bypassing northern Somalia, Chapala weakened further {{and turned to the}} west-northwest. Early on 3November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, as a very severe cyclonic storm, making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. The storm dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} threat of strong {{thunderstorms}} and gusts, Florida was spared {{a direct hit}} from Nicole. The storm <b>skirted</b> the state with only showers; 12.71inches (323mm) of rain were recorded at North Key Largo, though the mainland received much smaller quantities. The storm flooded streets in Miami Beach and the northern Florida Keys, {{as well as one}} home. Similarly, inclement weather spread over the northwestern Bahamas without significant consequences.|$|E
5|$|Light showers {{from the}} {{precursor}} front <b>skirted</b> Bermuda prior to tropical development, with 24-hour precipitation totals {{of no more}} than 0.87 in (22mm) recorded on the territory. Moisture brought on by the storm from afar enhanced rainfall that ended months of dry conditions in Bermuda; 1.75 in (45mm) of precipitation fell at L.F. Wade International Airport on July 18, with an additional 1.6 in (40mm) recorded the next day. Although the rains proved to be mostly beneficial, minor flooding affected some local businesses in poor-drainage areas.|$|E
40|$|Shape {{factors of}} a tight <b>skirt</b> and 3 kinds of flared <b>skirts</b> were {{investigated}} precisely. Shape factors of circular fabrics were calculated from mechanical parameters obtained by KES system, however, those of <b>skirts</b> were obtained experimentally. Those results {{were compared with}} drape parameters of circular fabrics such as node number (n), static (Ds) and dynamic drape coefficients as revolving drape increase coefficient (Dr), saturated drape coefficient (D 200) and turning-around drape coefficient (Dd). They were also compared with node number and static drape coefficient of skits at hem line. Following conclusions were obtained. In the case of tight <b>skirt,</b> flare- 1 <b>skirt</b> and flare- 2 <b>skirt,</b> the shape factor showed high correlation with drape parameters of the <b>skirts</b> and circular fabrics. The shape factor of <b>skirts</b> has high positive correlation with node number and negative correlation with static drape coefficient of circular fabrics. In the case of flare- 3 <b>skirt,</b> there is no correlation between the shape factor and the drape parameters of circular fabrics and <b>skirts,</b> hence shape factor becomes an important parameter which can evaluate the appearance of flared <b>skirt</b> objectively...|$|R

5|$|Pioneers {{traveling}} in wagon trains on the Oregon Trail in the 1850s and 1860s followed an alternative route {{in the area}} that used old Indian trails that <b>skirted</b> the lava flows. This alternative route was later named Goodale's Cutoff and part of it is {{in the northern part of}} the monument. The cutoff was created to reduce the possibility of ambush by Shoshone warriors along the Snake River such as the one that occurred at Massacre Rocks, which today is memorialized in Idaho's Massacre Rocks State Park.|$|E

50|$|Fender <b>skirts</b> {{were often}} paired with whitewall tires. The {{extent of the}} <b>skirt</b> also varied, before the 1950s it was common {{for all but the}} very bottom of the rear tire to be covered, while by the 1960s fender <b>skirts</b> only covered some of the top of the tire, and were largely absent on cars other than top line models. For example, up until 1976, the Chevrolet Caprice, Oldsmobile 98, Buick Electra, Pontiac Bonneville and the Cadillac Fleetwood, DeVille and Calais models used fender <b>skirts.</b> The Cadillac Eldorado models sported fender <b>skirts</b> from 1971 thru 1974. Starting in 1977 only the Pontiac Bonneville {{retained}} the use of fender <b>skirts</b> on General Motors downsized cars. In 1980 the Oldsmobile returned the fender <b>skirts</b> to the 98 model. By 1985 fender <b>skirts</b> would disappear from all standard General Motors cars. In 1989, fender <b>skirts</b> were used again on the Cadillac front wheel drive Fleetwood models until 1993. In 1993, Cadillac again incorporated fender <b>skirts</b> into the design of the re-styled rear drive Fleetwood, this design would last until 1996. The General Motors EV1 had fender <b>skirts</b> later.|$|R
5|$|Two {{additional}} realignments {{occurred at}} the north end of the Green Line, but with less acrimony. North of Fort Totten, the line was to have surfaced in the median of the planned North Central Freeway, I-95, and proceeded to a point just west of Prince George's Plaza, with an intermediate station at Chillum. I-95 and Metro would have run through the Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park; the cancellation of I-95 through the District and out to the Beltway in 1974 meant that it was no longer necessary or appropriate to condemn an I-95-sized swath of parkland just for Metro (as well as a Metro station and its parking lot). WMATA eventually selected a new route that <b>skirted</b> most of the park, and it was federally approved by the mid-1980s. The planned Chillum station was relocated and named West Hyattsville. The other alignment dispute occurred in the Petworth section of Washington, and involved whether the tunnel would go under or skirt Rock Creek Cemetery and how to go through this soft-soil burial ground (it was <b>skirted</b> using the New Austrian Tunnelling method), and the least disruptive way under New Hampshire Avenue from Georgia Avenue – Petworth to Columbia Heights (the tunnels were stacked).|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Gerald, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Neneng, {{affected}} the Philippines, Taiwan, and China during September 1987. A tropical depression developed on September4, and within 24hours, intensified into a tropical storm. After initially moving erratically within the Philippine Sea, Gerald moved west-northwest and then northwest while steadily deepening. Gerald obtained typhoon intensity on September8, and the following day, attained maximum intensity. Shortly thereafter, the typhoon <b>skirted</b> southwestern Taiwan, {{which resulted in a}} steady weakening trend. On September10, Gerald moved ashore north of Hong Kong near Amoy. Gerald dissipated the next day.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} ridge {{over the}} central Atlantic steered the nascent storm westward toward the Lesser Antilles. Thunderstorm activity was strong near the center, although initially somewhat disorganized and asymmetric. However, a tight inner core soon took shape, and Gonzalo began to quickly intensify {{throughout the day}} on October 12. Following the appearance of an eye feature early the next day, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane while located near Antigua in the eastern Caribbean. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed directly over the island. The hurricane later struck Saint Martin and Anguilla, and <b>skirted</b> {{just north of the}} British Virgin Islands while continuing to intensify. By that time, it was headed toward the northwest around the periphery of the aforementioned ridge.|$|E
