The results are as follows. Since increasing returns continuously allow consumers to afford higher-quality versions of the good, a quality-based product cycle is generally required for the two initial market shares to persist over time; however, with dynamic learning the conditions for such a cycle to take place are severe. Then, {{in spite of the}} self-reinforcing nature of the pattern <b>of</b> <b>spezialization,</b> one <b>of</b> the two countries' market segments (the lower-quality one) is likely to shrink endogenously over time.

This book describes the trends in work organization in the case of CAD use by collecting representative information from 164 German enterprises. The major findings are the following: There is no <b>spezialization</b> <b>of</b> work places evident as a consequence of CAD use. On the contrary, the job profiles of design ingeneers and especially draughtsmen have become broader. The latter have additional tasks in the specification of designs and the compliation of bill of materials. Despite of these slight changes in work organization the analyses showed no fundamental new organizational concepts in CAD installing firms. Nearly all enterprises keep their old type of work organization. The degreee of division of labour persists whether it is high or low. The new options which the CAD technology offers are con current with an organizational conservatism. The survey shows that, more than the CAD technology, some aspects of the frame conditions in the enterprises are influencing the work organization. Wholistic {{job structures}} can be found especially in small firms, in firms with many CAD stations in relation to the design employees, infirms with "low-cost" CAD-systems, in firms without computer integrated manufacturing concepts and in those with elaborated training concepts for all employees. other aspects like branches, batch size etc. are not significantly interrelated with the type of work organization...|$|R

40|$|The Marxist notion <b>of</b> mode <b>of</b> <b>production</b> {{has served}} as a {{building}} block for the comparison of social systems. Each mode <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is defined by a specific form of control over the means <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> This paper argues that control over the means <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is an emerging feature of social systems. Without control over the means <b>of</b> <b>production</b> there cannot be a mode <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Therefore, many societies cannot be said to have a mode <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> and the notions of primitive, lineage, domestic, Asiatic, and ancient modes <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are unsatisfactory and unnecessary. In my work on the Kayan of central Borneo, I found that I could not meaningfully delineate a mode <b>of</b> <b>production</b> among them, although the notions of surplus appropriation and class were immediately relevant (Rousseau 1979 a, 1979 b, 1990).

Marx's main concern was to understand capitalist societies in order to transform them, but the evolutionary nature of his project required that he placed the capitalist mode <b>of</b> <b>production</b> within a broader framework (Marx 1964).

50|$|No {{capitalist}} ever voluntarily {{introduces a}} new method <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> {{no matter how}} much more productive it may be, and how much it may increase the rate of surplus-value, so long as it reduces the rate of profit. Yet every such new method <b>of</b> <b>production</b> cheapens the commodities. Hence, the capitalist sells them originally above their prices <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> or, perhaps, above their value. He pockets the difference between their costs <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and the market-prices of the same commodities produced at higher costs <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> He can do this, because the average labour-time required socially for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> these latter commodities is higher than the labour-time required for the new methods <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> His method <b>of</b> <b>production</b> stands above the social average. But competition makes it general and subject to the general law. There follows a fall in the rate of profit — perhaps first in this sphere <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> and eventually it achieves a balance with the rest — which is, therefore, wholly independent of the will of the capitalist.
