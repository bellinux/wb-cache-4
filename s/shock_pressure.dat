25|$|The stomach twists {{around the}} {{longitudinal}} {{axis of the}} digestive tract, also known as volvulus. Gas distension may occur prior to or after the stomach twists. The most common direction for rotation is clockwise, viewing the animal from behind. The stomach can rotate up to 360° in this direction and 90° counterclockwise. If the volvulus is greater than 180°, the esophagus is closed off, thereby preventing the animal from relieving the condition by belching or vomiting. The results of this distortion of normal anatomy and gas distension include hypotension (low blood pressure), decreased return of blood to the heart, ischemia (loss of blood supply) of the stomach, and <b>shock.</b> <b>Pressure</b> on the portal vein decreases blood flow to liver and decreases the ability of that organ to remove toxins and absorbed bacteria from the blood. At {{the other end of}} the stomach, the spleen may be damaged if the twisting interrupts its blood supply. If not quickly treated, bloat can lead to blood poisoning, peritonitis and death by toxic shock.|$|E
25|$|Most {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} silica {{are made of}} infinite arrangements of {SiO4} tetrahedra connected at their corners, with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms. In the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form, α-quartz, these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different Si–O distances (159.7 and 161.7pm) with a Si–O–Si angle of 144°. These helices can be either left- or right-handed, so that individual α-quartz crystals are optically active. At 537°C, this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar β-quartz, with a change of the Si–O–Si angle to 155° but a retention of handedness. Further heating to 867°C results in another reversible phase transition to β-tridymite, in which some Si–O bonds are broken {{to allow for the}} arrangement of the {SiO4} tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure. This transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature; when cooled to about 120°C it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to α-tridymite, similarly to the transition from α-quartz to β-quartz. β-tridymite slowly transforms to cubic β-cristobalite at about 1470°C, which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200–280°C to α-cristobalite via small atomic displacements. β-cristobalite melts at 1713°C; the freezing of silica from themelt is quite slow and vitrification, or the formation of a glass, is likely to occur instead. In vitreous silica, the {SiO4} tetrahedra remain corner-connected, but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost. Because of the slow conversions between these three forms, it is possible upon rapid heating to melt β-quartz (1550°C) or β-tridymite (1703°C). Silica boils at approximately 2800°C. Other high-pressure forms of silica are known, such as coesite and stishovite: these are known in nature, formed under the <b>shock</b> <b>pressure</b> of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure. Similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following lightning strikes, forming glassy lechatelierite. W-silica is an unstable low-density form involving {SiO4} tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners, forming parallel chains similarly to silicon disulfide (SiS2) and silicon diselenide (SiSe2): it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water.|$|E

We find that 98 % of impacts of terrestrial ejecta on the Moon would have experienced peak pressures less than 20 GPa if the ejecta were a soft rock (sandstone). This falls to 82 % of meteorites if the ejecta were a hard rock (granite). This assumes impacts on a solid lunar surface. If we approximate the surface as a loose regolith, over 99 % of the impacts involve peak <b>shock</b> <b>pressures</b> below 20 GPa.

Two workers were injured in the initial explosion, three responding fire-fighters were injured by the fumes from the spill of a highly volatile chemical mixture, and 50 others were exposed to fumes and required treatment at local hospitals. The driver was transporting waste from a temporary storage drum to a processing center when he stopped to take a meal break.

The tires of the first fire truck on the scene and the boots of three firefighters sparked small explosions when they drove and walked over the substance as they went to help the injured workers.

Modelling of interplanetary transfer times (Mars-Earth) and calculations of {{the survival of}} cells and spores in the radiation environment of space show {{that this is not}} an insurmountable obstacle to the successful delivery of life from one planetary surface to another via these rocks. However, the initial launch into space and the subsequent arrival at a new planet involve short-duration extreme accelerations, and <b>shock</b> <b>pressures</b> in the 1 - 100 GPa range. Recently {{it has been shown that}} survival of such accelerations and at such <b>shock</b> <b>pressures</b> is possible. Here we show that in hypervelocity impacts (which involve extreme short-duration accelerations), as <b>shock</b> <b>pressures</b> vary from 1 to 78 GPa, the survival rate (N/N- 0) for Rhodococcus erythropolis cells falls from 10 (- 4) to 10 (- 7). Whilst survival rates are low at 78 GPa, they are still finite. For a different organism, Bacillis subtilis, the survival rate at 78 GPa was found to be of the order of 10 (- 5), i. e. significantly greater than for the R. erythropolis, indicating that survival rates may vary greatly with different organisms. By contrast, the variation between the survival rate in impacts on agar at 78 GPa for B. subtilis spores versus active B. subtilis was found only to be a factor of 2, well within the experimental uncertainties and not significant. Overall, whilst extreme <b>shock</b> <b>pressures</b> clearly have a deleterious effect on survival rates, it is shown that, even at extreme <b>shock</b> <b>pressures</b> of near to 100 GPa, there is still a finite and sufficient survival rate for this not to be an insurmountable obstacle to successful natural transfer of life through space...|$|R

In the single shock experiments, the run distances to detonation at three shock pressures showed agreement with previously published data above 3 GPa. Even longer run distances to detonation were measured using 80 mm long by 145 mm diameter LX- 04 charges impacted by low velocity projectiles from a 155 mm diameter gun. The minimum <b>shock</b> <b>pressure</b> required to cause low levels of exothermic reaction were determined for these large LX- 04 charge dimensions. Multiple shocks were generated as double shocks by using a flyer plate with two materials and as reflected shocks by placing a high impedance material {{at the rear of}} the explosive charge. In both cases, the first <b>shock</b> <b>pressure</b> was not high enough to cause detonation of LX- 04, and the second <b>shock</b> <b>pressure,</b> which would have been sufficient to cause detonation if generated by a single shock, failed to cause detonation.

The literature has reported {{on a variety of}} property changes from laser peening aluminium alloys, which varied with the initial metallurgical state and laser generated <b>shock</b> wave <b>pressures.</b> This paper analyses the effect of laser peening repetitions (one and five repetitions) on hardness and elastic modulus versus depth on a 6061 -T 6 specimen for two laser generated <b>shock</b> wave <b>pressures</b> of 3 · 5 and 6 GPa. The higher <b>shock</b> wave <b>pressure</b> increased the hardness with both one and five repetitions, however, the lower <b>shock</b> wave <b>pressure</b> only increased the hardness with one repetition and not with five. The two mechanisms responsible for the self-limiting hardness changes are increases in the metal's Hugoniot elastic limit and changes in the metal's dynamic yield strength. These mechanisms limit further shock processing and surface hardness changes in the metal unless the laser generated <b>shock</b> wave <b>pressure</b> remains significantly greater than the increased Hugoniot elastic limit and dynamic yield strength...|$|R
50|$|Lechatelierite also {{forms as}} the result of high <b>pressure</b> <b>shock</b> {{metamorphism}} during meteorite impact cratering and is a common component of a type of glassy ejecta called tektites. Most tektites are blobs of impure glassy material, but tektites from the Sahara Desert in Libya and Egypt, known as Libyan desert glass, are composed of almost pure silica, that is almost pure lechatelierite. High pressure experiments have shown that <b>shock</b> <b>pressures</b> of 85 GPa are needed to produce lechatelierite in quartz grains embedded in granite.|$|R
40|$|Ultra-high molecular-weight {{polyethylene}} (UHMWPE) composites {{are commonly}} used in ballistic protection systems. In {{order to understand the}} behavior under shock conditions, dynamic material properties were recently measured by inverse planar plate impact tests providing US–uP-data for particle velocities from 170 [*]m/s up to 900 [*]m/s. In this paper the previously known data range is extended at both ends. On the one hand, inverse flyer plate tests were performed at impact velocities less than 200 [*]m/s in order to assess potential effects of porosity. On the other hand, the mechanical response under extremely high pressures was determined using the shock reverberation technique. For low <b>shock</b> <b>pressures</b> no effect of porosity was identified. For high <b>shock</b> <b>pressures,</b> the available data range was extended by a factor of 3. For the whole range of velocities and pressures, the slope of the US–uP relationship indicates a slight concave curvature...|$|R
