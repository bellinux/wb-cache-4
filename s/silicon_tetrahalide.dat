40|$|Closed-loop process {{produces}} semiconductor-grade silicon. Metallurgical-grade silicon {{converted to}} ultrapure silicon by reacting with hydrogen and <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrahalide</b> to form trihalosilane, purifying this intermediate and again decomposing to high purity silicon in third stage.

2500|$|Redistribution {{reactions}} {{occur between}} two different <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrahalides</b> (as well as halogenated polysilanes) when heated to 100 ˚C, {{resulting in various}} mixed halosilanes. [...] The melting points and boiling points of these mixed halosilanes generally increase as their molecular weights increase. (Can occur with X= H, F, Cl, Br, and I) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Silicon</b> <b>tetrahalides,</b> SiX 4 (X=F, Cl, Br) and the {{fluorosilicates}} {{of sodium}} and potassium react with phosphorus pentoxide above 300 °C. The tetrahalides {{give rise to}} the corresponding phosphoryl halides and silica, while the fluorosilicates form the corresponding metal fluorophosphates and silicon tetrafluoride. The reaction of the fluorosilicates of sodium and potassium with sulphur trioxide occurs at room temperature to give rise to the corresponding metal fluorosulphates and silicon tetrafluoride...|$|R
25|$|It {{reacts with}} the sulfides of sodium, magnesium, aluminium, and iron to form metal thiosilicates: {{reaction}} with ethanol results in ethylsilicate Si(OEt)4 and hydrogen sulfide. Ethylsilicate is useful as its controlled hydrolysis produces adhesive or film-like forms of silica. Reacting hydrogen sulfide with <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrahalides</b> yields <b>silicon</b> thiohalides such as S(SiCl)3, cyclic Cl2Si(μ-S)2SiCl2, and crystalline (SiSCl2)4. Despite the double bond rule, stable organosilanethiones RR'Si=S {{have been made}} thanks to the stabilising mechanism of intermolecular coordination via an amine group.|$|R
2500|$|Covalently {{saturated}} silicon complexes like SiBr4, {{along with}} tetrahalides of germanium (Ge) and tin (Sn), are Lewis acids. Although <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrahalides</b> obey the octet rule, they add Lewis basic ligands to give adducts with the formula SiBr4L and SiBr4L2 (where L is a Lewis base). [...] The Lewis acidic {{properties of the}} tetrahalides tend to increase as follows: SiI4 < SiBr4 < SiCl4 < SiF4. [...] This trend is attributed to the relative electronegativities of the halogens.|$|R
2500|$|Silicon and {{silicon carbide}} readily react with all four stable halogens, forming the colourless, {{reactive}} and volatile <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrahalides.</b> <b>Silicon</b> tetrafluoride {{may also be}} made by fluorinating the other silicon halides, and is produced by the attack of hydrofluoric acid on glass. Heating two different tetrahalides together also produce a random mixture of mixed halides, which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions. The melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight, though there are many exceptions: for example, the melting and boiling points drop as one passes from SiFBr3 through SiFClBr2 to SiFCl2Br. The shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group 13 and earlier to the group 14 elements {{is illustrated by the}} change from an infinite ionic structure in aluminium fluoride to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules, as dictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon, the stoichiometry (the +4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity), and the smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom. Silicon tetrachloride is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure silicon, silicon dioxide, and some silicon esters. The <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrahalides</b> hydrolyse readily in water, unlike the carbon tetrahalides, again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks. The reaction of silicon fluoride with excess hydrofluoric acid produces the octahedral hexafluorosilicate anion [...]|$|R
50|$|Silicon forms two hydrides: SiH4 and Si2H6. <b>Silicon</b> forms <b>tetrahalides</b> with fluorine, chlorine, and iodine. Silicon also forms a {{dioxide and}} a disulfide. Silicon nitride has the formula Si3N4.|$|R
40|$|The extractability {{of ammonia}} halides (including {{ammonium}} thiocyanate) formed as byproducts from {{the synthesis of}} Si(NH) 2 via ammonolysis of the corresponding <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrahalides</b> using supercritical NH 3 as the extraction medium was investigated. It {{was found that the}} NH 4 SCN byproduct of ammonolysis of Si(SCN) 4 can be almost completely extracted from the insoluble Si(NH) 2 forming a promising system for the synthesis of pure Si(NH) 2, one of the best precursors for Si 3 N 4. In addition it was found that Si 3 N 4, AlN, BN, and Si(NH) 2 are insoluble in SC ammonia. Also discussed are design considerations for a supercritical ammonia extraction unit...|$|R
25|$|Analogous to the silanes, halopolysilanes SinX2n+2 {{are also}} known. While {{catenation}} in carbon compounds is maximised in the hydrogen compounds {{rather than the}} halides, {{the opposite is true}} for silicon, so that the halopolysilanes are known up to at least Si14F30, Si6Cl14, and Si4Br10. A suggested explanation for this phenomenon is the compensation for the electron loss of silicon to the more electronegative halogen atoms by pi backbonding from the filled pπ orbitals on the halogen atoms to the empty dπ orbitals on silicon: this is similar to the situation of carbon monoxide in metal carbonyl complexes and explains their stability. These halopolysilanes may be produced by comproportionation of <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrahalides</b> with elemental <b>silicon,</b> or by condensation of lighter halopolysilanes (trimethylammonium being a useful catalyst for this reaction).|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the {{heterogeneous reaction}} Si + SIC 14 = 2 SiCt 2 {{have been studied}} in a flow system with helium as the carrier gas. For this reaction the postulated rate expression d (0 00 o) (0 o 00) S i [...] 1. 0 X 106 exp P 41 / 2 + 9 exp P 2 dt RT RT g Si cm- 2 sec- 1 was shown to describe the experimental results. The flow system data has been analyzed in terms of quantitatively measurable system parameters. Con-sequently true rather than apparent constants are found. The reduction of <b>silicon</b> and germanium <b>tetrahalides</b> in a hydrogen atmosphere is widely used as a method for preparing epitaxial films of these materials. The type reaction is written usually as MX 4 + 2 II 2 = M- 5 4 HX [I] where M is the group-IV element and X is the halogen. This form is not even an accurate indication of the material balance. For example, {{a variety of other}} products occurs in the silicon-chlorine process includ-ing SiHCI 3 and miscellaneous polymeric forms. In spite of the large amount of experimental work in this field, a high level of uncertainty remains as to the mechanism by which hydrogen is involved in the over-all process. However, there is a general consensus in the literature [silicon (I- 5) and germanium (6 - 7) ] that the type disproportionation iV [~- 1 V;. X 4 [...] - ~ 2 MX 2 [2] is one of the reactions in the over-all process. The equil ibrium for the Si-SiCI ~ reaction following Eq. [2] has been studied quantitatively by Sch~ifer and Nickl (8 - 9). They concluded that no other molecular species were present o any significant degree. Bylander (2) and 1 V[onchamp, McAleer, and Pollack (5) have studied the disproportionation reaction in a flow sys-tem, but no quantitative kinetic data were obtained in either case. Monchamp et al. then used a low-pressure closed system, somewhat similar to that used by Heinecke and Ing (10) in germanium studies, for the investigation of the kinetics of the disproportionation reaction. They found tha...|$|R
