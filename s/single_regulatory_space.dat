Here we generate a comprehensive set of epigenome reference maps, which we use to determine the extent to which maternal factors shape chromatin state in Xenopus embryos. Using a-amanitin to inhibit zygotic transcription, we find that the majority of H 3 K 4 me 3 - and H 3 K 27 me 3 -enriched regions form a maternally defined epigenetic <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> with an underlying logic of hypomethylated islands. This maternal <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> extends to a substantial proportion of neurula stage-activated promoters.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} how institutional factors {{impact on}} processes of isomorphism {{in the design}} of regulatory regimes. It does so through a comparative examination of regulatory reform in the railway domain in Britain and Germany in three time periods, the post-First World War and the post-Second World War periods as well as the 1990 s. It is argued that pressures for isomorphism, defined as the increasing homogenisation of a unit with other units in its policy environment, are exerted by several policy environments. These pressures can be distinguished in their degree of domain- and paradigm-orientation. Domain-orientation consists of regulatory change which is based on sector-specific sources, whereas paradigm-orientation involves the application of supposedly universal 'policy recipes' across policy domains. The study questions whether three institutional factors - the insulation of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> from coercive pressures, the insulation of the political-administrative nexus in the <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> and the insulation of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> from societal forces - can explain why in some cases reforms are domain-oriented, but, in other cases, reforms are paradigm-oriented. The comparative analysis of reform in British and German railway regulation provides three conclusions. First, in all cases, pressures for isomorphism emerging from different policy environments provided competing 'templates' for regulatory design ideas. Second, among the institutional factors, the insulation of the political-administrative nexus in the <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> was identified as the most important factor for explaining the orientation of the selected regulatory instruments. Third, {{in the light of the}} study's historical and institutional perspective, this thesis critically evaluates arguments proclaiming the emergence of a 'regulatory state' in contemporary Europe...|$|R
40|$|Conflicting {{interests}} among private actors {{constitute an}} important factor to explain why and how transnational private regulation has grown {{and the proliferation of}} standards and standard setting organizations that has followed. This essay provides a map of transnational <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> suggesting that the different levels are related to various governance responses to conflicts within the private sphere and between private and public actors. Three levels of the global <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> are considered: (1) the <b>single</b> global <b>regulatory</b> body, where interests are integrated into one organization, (2) the regime, in which multiple organizations operate, regulating within the same policy field, (3) multiple regimes often associated with different, often conflicting, policies that interplay cooperatively or competitively. In the last instance the conflict of interests translates into a conflict of norms. Unlike in the traditional multilevel governance literature, where ‘levels’ are primarily defined {{on the basis of a}} territorial metric, here the notion of <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> is functional and independent from the administrative boundaries of nation states. For the three levels, the choice of the key governance features are driven by the different forms of the relationship between regulators, regulatees and beneficiaries and how their conflicting interests are balanced at the organizational and/or regime level. Depending on how the interests of regulatees and beneficiaries are combined, different governance options will emerge: creating single or multiple regulators, defining the architecture of the whole regime, in particular the alternative between monopoly and plurality of private regulators, or creating independent regimes, each one representing the interests of a constituency with potentially policies’ interdependencies. The selection of the legal instruments, in particular the choice between contract and organization to coordinate conflicting interests is correlated to the level: organization law is more important in the first level while contract law becomes increasingly important moving up to the regime or inter-regime level. Two forms of governance are distinguished: micro-governance, operating primarily through organizations where judicial intervention by domestic courts is very limited; macrogovernance, using transactional rather than organizational tools, deploying coordination mechanisms between organizations or regimes representing different interests (trade and environment, e-commerce and data protection, labour and consumer). In the latter case the role of domestic Courts increases to regulate conflicts and allocate ex post the <b>regulatory</b> <b>space.</b> The paper concludes arguing that the future of TPR and its effectiveness will depend on the choice among these different levels which will be partly driven by endogenous factors, and partly by exogenous legal and non legal factors, among which competition law is likely to play an important role...|$|R

40|$|Purpose This paper {{strengthens}} our theoretical {{understanding of}} the processes through which a new regulator seeks to gain legitimacy within an existing <b>regulatory</b> <b>space.</b> We do this by investigating {{the case of the}} Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission (ACNC). Design/methodology/approach Synthesising legitimacy theory with the concept of <b>regulatory</b> <b>space,</b> we analyse formal public discourse surrounding the establishment and operations of the ACNC. Findings Regulation is essentially a context-bound political process in which a new regulator needs to establish legitimacy to ensure its survival. It must convince its constituents that it has developed processes to operate effectively and professionally in addressing constituents’ needs, to bargain authoritatively with other regulators in establishing its operational boundaries, and to engage politically with government and constituents. Over a relatively short time, the ACNC built legitimacy, despite the political threats to its formal regulatory authority. Research limitations/implications Our conclusions are based on our analysis of one case. There is scope for further investigations of the processes by which new regulators establish their legitimacy in different contexts. Practical implications The potential for a political threat to the authority of a new regulator, and the difficulty of achieving regulatory reform, particularly in a federated system such as Australia, highlight the necessity for a new regulator to develop a compelling discourse of legitimacy. Originality/value We synthesise <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> and legitimacy perspectives, contributing to an {{understanding of the}} processes of regulation...|$|R

The approach was validated through action research, integrating the components of context, people, process, information, and IT. The design of the ORS is usually performed by distinct teams, with unconnected viewpoints, using different vocabularies and tools. Similarly to information systems, there are business experts that define the regulatory goals and rules. The ORS modeling is problematic, and is fragmented. We have adopted the O 2 framework to provide a common level of abstraction for the design. The result is a comprehensive and layered map of the ORS. This approach has proved to offer an effective representation of the ORS for external auditors and business associations.

The basic aim of the paper is to explore the difference and convergence between regulation and governance and develop multilevel governance and multilevel regulation as two individual heuristic concepts. We {{suggest that it is}} useful to frame multilevel governance in the context of <b>regulatory</b> <b>spaces.</b> As an example, we undertake an exploratory investigation of multilevelness of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> of marketing authorisation of medical devices. This allows us to help focus on certain aspects of the regulatory process by acknowledging that it is no longer located in the hand of a single (governmental) actor and highlighting the necessity of considering interventions beyond the state in addressing regulatory effectiveness problems that may crop up in this context. Ultimately, we assess whether multilevel regulation is a legal translation of the concept of multilevel governance...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} European institutions for implementing EU regulation. It assesses their development using seven different models {{that have been}} introduced or discussed for organising implementation. It argues {{that the development of}} European <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> has followed an evolutionary pattern involving gradual reshaping through a series of steps, with previous stages influencing later stages and institutions being built on existing structures. Despite pressures and frequent discussions of comprehensive change, existing organisations have managed to limit and shape reforms. The result has been institutional ‘layering’ and ‘conversion’ instead of streamlining, and a gradual strengthening of networks of national independent regulatory agencies. The analysis therefore suggests that evolutionary analysis based on historical institutionalist approaches seems highly appropriate to the EU. Equally, it shows how even if there are strong demand-side pressures for centralisation of regulation, existing institutional arrangements and organisations limit and shape the supply of new institutions, so that debates about radical change coexist with a fragmented, cluttered and complex European <b>regulatory</b> <b>space...</b>|$|R

40|$|The term {{integrated}} {{reporting is}} becoming an increasingly ubiquitous and powerful idea in corporate reporting. Although there is no generally agreed upon definition, conceptual framework or standard, the term integrated reporting emerged through various initiatives and reporting practices in the reporting field. In 2010, the International Integrated Reporting Committee was set up with the purpose to internationalize a framework and oversee {{the creation of a}} generally accepted international integrated reporting framework (IIRF). The aim {{of this study is to}} further our understanding of how expert knowledge could translate into power in a field where multiple institutional logics are present. The study focuses on (i) why and how the IIRC has emerged and (ii) explores the relationship between the emerging and prevailing logics in the corporate reporting <b>regulatory</b> <b>space.</b> The analytical framework draws from the concept of epistemic communities, collective institutional entrepreneurship and collective action to analyse the sustained collaboration among diverse actors in the <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> to work towards a new corporate reporting model. The analysis is derived from a review of official reports, consultation documents, comment letters and press releases available on website of IIRC and its founding members. This is further supported by in-depth interviews with key persons in the <b>regulatory</b> <b>space.</b> Preliminary evidence shows that the IIRC has navigated through a densely organised yet fragmented <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> to gain significant leverage while the definition, episteme and conceptual framework of integrated reporting are still “in the making”. The skilful convening of powerful actors to break the mode of inertia and engage in collective action provided IIRC with legitimacy and a wide platform within which extensive individual and collective networking efforts could be orchestrated. This emerging episteme is legitimised not only through expertise and representation by leaders of participating organisations but IIRC’s mediating role in the pilot programme bringing together the investor network and leading reporters to the “innovation hub”. This provided a catalyst for institutional change and the convergence of logics. In its quest for efficiency and effectiveness, the proposed IIRF guides corporations to communicate their value creation through their business model for providers of financial capital to make financial capital allocation decision. This places the potential shifts in reporting logic in the hands of corporations, mediating organisations and organisations in the financial sphere. Though tensions had been eased through framing the process as a journey and aligning long term investor needs with other stakeholders, it is the loss of decision usefulness of sustainability reports and the lack of evidence of other stakeholders using the report to engage in dialogue with companies and policy makers that have diminished their standing in the corporate reporting <b>regulatory</b> <b>space.</b> In the search for a new reporting model the information needs of other stakeholders have been legitimately subordinated and constructed out of the corporate reporting space, temporarily – at least...|$|R

40|$|The Mapping the Faultlines {{project is}} based on the {{assumption}} that the mechanisms that allow illicit financial flows to occur result from the synergistic relationship between the world’s tax havens and offshore financial centres. At the time the project was proposed these were defined as follows: 1. Tax havens are the legislative, judicial, fiscal and <b>regulatory</b> <b>spaces</b> provided by jurisdictions that encourage the relocation of economic transactions to that domain; 2. An offshore finance centre (OFC) is the commercial response to the provision of those legislative, judicial, fiscal and <b>regulatory</b> <b>spaces</b> by those seeking to profit from the opportunities they provide. The project also set out to identify the characteristics that identify a location as having tax haven status. It soon became apparent that this would be difficult using prevailing language to describe the offshore sector since there was little agreement on what that language actually meant. We therefore decided to reappraise the language of offshore and offer more accurate, and precisely defined terms for use in the Mapping the Faultlines project...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{functions}} of law {{is to ensure that}} the legal structure governing all social relations is predictable, coherent, consistent and applicable. All these characteristics of law taken together are referred to as legal certainty. In traditional approaches to legal certainty, law is regarded as a hierarchic system of rules characterised by stability, clarity, uniformity, calculable enforcement, publicity and predictability. However, the current reality is that national legal systems no longer operate in isolation, but within a multilevel legal order, wherein norms created both at the international and regional level are directly applicable to national legal systems. Also norm creation is no longer the exclusive prerogative of public officials of the state: private actors have an increasing influence on norm creation as well. Social scientists have referred to this phenomenon of interacting and overlapping competences as multilevel governance. Only recently have legal scholars focused attention on the increasing interconnectedness (and therefore the concomitant loss of primacy of national legal orders) between the global, European and national regulatory spheres through the concept of multilevel regulation. In this project I use multilevel regulation as a term to characterise a <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> in which the process of rule making, rule enforcement and rule adjudication (regulatory life cycle) is dispersed across more than one administrative or territorial level amongst several different actors, both public and private. I draw on the concept of a <b>regulatory</b> <b>space,</b> using it as a framing device to differentiate between specific aspects of policy fields. The relationship between actors in such a space is nonhierarchical. Lack of central ordering of the regulatory life cycle within this <b>regulatory</b> <b>space</b> is the most important feature of such a space. The implications of multilevel regulation for legal certainty have attracted limited attention from scholars. The demand for legal certainty in regulatory practice is still a puzzle. I explore the idea of legal certainty in terms of perception and expectations of regulatees in the context of medical products. By medical products I mean pharmaceuticals and medical devices which can be differentiated as two <b>regulatory</b> <b>spaces</b> and therefore form two case studies. As an exploratory project, this thesis is necessarily stepping into new territory in terms of investigating legal certainty first in terms of regulatee perceptions and expectations and second, because it studies this in the context of multilevel regulation...|$|R
40|$|Striated muscle thin {{filaments}} contain {{hundreds of}} actin monomers {{and scores of}} troponins and tropomyosins. To study the cooperative mechanism of thin filaments, “mini-thin filaments” were generated by isolating particles nearly matching the minimal structural repeat of thin filaments: a double helix of actin subunits with each strand approximately seven actins long and spanned by a troponin–tropomyosin complex. One end of the particles was capped by a gelsolin (segment 1 – 3) –TnT fusion protein (substituting for normal TnT), and the other end was capped by tropomodulin. EM showed that the particles were 46 ± 9 nm long, with a knob-like mass attributable to gelsolin at one end. Average actin, tropomyosin, and gelsolin–troponin composition indicated one troponin–tropomyosin attached to each strand of the two-stranded actin filament. The minifilaments thus nearly represent <b>single</b> <b>regulatory</b> units of thin filaments. The myosin S 1 MgATPase rate stimulated by the minifilaments was Ca 2 +-sensitive, indicating that <b>single</b> <b>regulatory</b> length particles are sufficient for regulation. Ca 2 + bound cooperatively to cardiac TnC in conventional thin filaments but noncooperatively to cardiac TnC in minifilaments {{in the absence of}} myosin. This suggests that thin filament Ca 2 +-binding cooperativity reflects indirect troponin–troponin interactions along the long axis of conventional filaments, which do not occur in minifilaments. Despite noncooperative Ca 2 + binding to minifilaments in the absence of myosin, Ca 2 + cooperatively activated the myosin S 1 -particle ATPase rate. Two-stranded <b>single</b> <b>regulatory</b> units therefore may be sufficient for myosin-mediated Ca 2 +-binding cooperativity. Functional mini-thin filaments are well suited for biochemical and structural analysis of thin-filament regulation...|$|R
