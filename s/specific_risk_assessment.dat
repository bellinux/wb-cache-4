50|$|In {{the railway}} industry, there are risk factors {{involved}} with the prolonged usage of maintenance of way vehicles by vehicle operators during day-to-day track maintenance and construction. A common risk factor is prolonged exposure to excessive whole body vibration and shock exposure to the vertical and horizontal axes of the lumbar spine and vertebral endplate {{which can lead to}} spinal injury and or long-term damage to the vertebral bone structure. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists has in the past proposed threshold limit values for whole-body vibration with certain guidelines also being based on ISO-2631 standards, but no official exposure threshold limits for maintenance of way vehicles have seen widespread publication or enforcement. The ACGIH-TLV limits worker whole-body vibration exposure to no more than 8 hours in duration. In the European Union a new <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> model (VibRisk model) for structural failure of the lumbar spine in the lower back was proposed as a result of vibration risk research. The VibRisk model provides more <b>specific</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> of vertebral endplate failure on individual lumbar levels taking into account driver posture. When compared the <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> proposed using the VibRisk Model posed a higher risk of vertebral endplate failure at different lumbar levels than ISO-2631 Part 5 standards suggested. The main contributing factor that VibRisk incorporates that the ISO-2631 Part 5 standards are lacking is the recognition of operator posture as an additional stress factor when exposed to vibration and multiple shocks.|$|R

40|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>assessment</b> {{guidelines}} utilize conservative values when {{estimating the}} exposure to humans from contaminated soil. The conservative guidelines include a default bioavailability of 100 % and {{it is assumed that}} soil inhalation exposure is insignificant compared to the combined exposure from ingestion and dermal absorption. Due to the conservative guidelines, Site <b>Specific</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>Assessments</b> often attempt to determine the relative bioavailability of contaminants, however due to the high cost of in vivo models, in vitro models for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bioaccessibility are being developed. One such development for in vitro models is the addition of a lipophilic phase which acts as a sink for organic contaminants such as PAHs. The primary objective of this research project is to determine if exposure to contaminants in soil presents excessive risk to human health specifically to the residents of Iqaluit. I hypothesize that exposure from soil inhalation is a relevant exposure pathway for human health. Furthermore, I hypothesize that in-vitro PAH bioaccessibility models require a lipid sink to accurately represent in-vivo bioavailability of PAHs. In this thesis, soil inhalation was a relevant exposure pathway for both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk for residents in Iqaluit, NU. Using enrichment factors {{it was found that the}} soil was the primary source for many airborne contaminants. Vehicle traffic on unpaved roads led to a large amount of soil re-suspended into the atmosphere, leading to an airborne particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 µm (PM 10) average concentration of 35 ± 17 µg m- 3. Once roads were paved the average PM 10 concentration was significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced to 6. 5 ± 6 µg m- 3 and as a result both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk from soil inhalation was reduced. The results demonstrate that soil inhalation is likely a relevant exposure pathway under particular environmental conditions and that paving roads is an effective method of reducing this risk. To better characterize the correlation between in vivo bioavailability and in vitro bioaccessibility models a case study using eight PAH contaminated soils is performed to determine if the addition of a lipid sink improves this correlation. The addition of a lipid sink significantly increases PAH release for in vitro models (P < 0. 05). In the presence of a lipid sink, results of the In Vitro Digestion model (IVD) closely corresponded with a slope of 0. 85 (r 2 = 0. 45, P< 0. 07) to the in vivo results, whereas there was no correspondence in the absence of a lipid sink (r 2 = 0. 03). The results from the other in vitro digestion model, the Relative Bioaccessibility Leaching Procedure (RBALP), did not correspond to the in vivo results, with or without the addition of lipid sink, but did tightly reflect total soil PAH concentration. The in vivo release and uptake of PAHs is correlated to fugacity capacity, indicating that PAH release and uptake is a function of both matrix and PAH properties. Environmental conditions play a major role in <b>risk</b> <b>assessment,</b> hence the importance of site <b>specific</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessments.</b> In Iqaluit, vehicle traffic on unpaved roads is the major source of airborne particulate matter and as a result the soil ingestion pathway is relevant in terms of <b>risk</b> <b>assessment.</b> The correlation between in vivo PAH uptake and release to soil fugacity capacity demonstrates environmental conditions, such as soil properties, influencing bioavailability and subsequently <b>risk</b> <b>assessment...</b>|$|R

40|$|Mechanistic effect models (MEMs) {{are useful}} tools for {{ecological}} risk assessment of chemicals to complement experimentation. However, currently no recommendations exist {{for how to}} use them in risk assessments. Therefore, the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) MODELINK workshop aimed at providing guidance for when and how to apply MEMs in regulatory risk assessments. The workshop focused on risk assessment of plant protection products under Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 using MEMs at the organism and population levels. Realistic applications of MEMs were demonstrated in 6 case studies covering assessments for plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates in aquatic and terrestrial habitats. From the case studies and their evaluation, 12 recommendations on the future use of MEMs were formulated, addressing the issues of how to translate specific protection goals into workable questions, how to select species and scenarios to be modeled, and where and how to fit MEMs into current and future risk assessment schemes. The most important recommendations are that protection goals should be made more quantitative; the species to be modeled must be vulnerable not only regarding toxic effects but also regarding their life history and dispersal traits; the models should be as realistic as possible for a <b>specific</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> question, and the level of conservatism required for a <b>specific</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> should be reached by designing appropriately conservative environmental and exposure scenarios; scenarios should include different regions of the European Union (EU) and different crops; in the long run, generic MEMs covering relevant species based on representative scenarios should be developed, which will require EU-level joint initiatives of all stakeholders involved. The main conclusion from the MODELINK workshop is that the considerable effort required for making MEMs an integral part of environmental risk assessment of pesticides is worthwhile, because it will make risk assessments not only more ecologically relevant and less uncertain but also more comprehensive, coherent, and cost effective.
