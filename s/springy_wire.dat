50|$|A {{wire brush}} {{is a tool}} {{consisting}} of a brush whose bristles are made of wire, most often steel wire. The steel used is generally a medium- to high-carbon variety and very hard and <b>springy.</b> Other <b>wire</b> brushes feature bristles made from brass or stainless steel, depending on application. Wires in a wire brush can be held together by epoxy, staples, or other binding. Wire brushes usually either have a handle of wood or plastic (for handheld use) or are formed into a wheel for use on angle grinders, bench grinders, pistol-grip drill motors, or other power tools.|$|R
5000|$|High tensile (H-T or HT) fencing is {{a special}} hard, <b>springy</b> steel <b>wire</b> that was {{introduced}} in the 1970s and has slowly gained acceptance. The wire may be a single strand plain or barbed wire, or woven mesh, and is capable of much higher tension than mild steel. It permits the use of wider post spacings and is neither stretched easily by animals, nor by fallen trees or branches. It can be insulated and electrified. Because of the wide spacing of the posts, thin metal or wood spacers (or [...] "droppers") may be attached to the wires between posts to maintain their spacing.|$|R
5000|$|Crystal {{detector}} (cat's whisker detector) - invented around 1904-1906 by Henry H. C. Dunwoody and Greenleaf Whittier Pickard, {{based on}} Karl Ferdinand Braun's 1874 discovery of [...] "asymmetrical conduction" [...] in crystals, {{these were the}} most successful and widely used detectors before the vacuum tube era and gave their name to the crystal radio receiver (below). [...] One of the first semiconductor electronic devices, a crystal detector consisted of a pea-sized pebble of a crystalline semiconductor mineral such as galena (lead sulfide) whose surface was touched by a fine <b>springy</b> metal <b>wire</b> mounted on an adjustable arm. This functioned as a primitive diode which conducted electric current in only one direction. In addition to their use in crystal radios, carborundum crystal detectors were also used in some early vacuum tube radios because they were more sensitive than the vacuum tube grid-leak detector.|$|R

5000|$|The rubber ducky is an {{electrically}} short {{quarter-wave antenna}} {{in which the}} inductor, instead {{of being in the}} base, is built into the antenna itself. The antenna is made of a narrow helix of wire like a spring, which functions as the needed inductor. The <b>springy</b> <b>wire</b> is flexible, making it less prone to damage than a stiff antenna. The spring antenna is further enclosed in a plastic or rubber-like covering to prevent it from catching on things. The technical name for this type of antenna is a normal-mode helix. [...] Rubber ducky antennas are typically 4% to 15% of a wavelength long; that is, 16% to 60% of the length of a standard quarter-wave whip.|$|E
5000|$|To {{reduce the}} length of a whip antenna to make it less cumbersome, an {{inductor}} (loading coil) is often added in series with it. This allows the antenna to be made much shorter than the normal length of a quarter-wavelength, and still be resonant, by cancelling out the capacitive reactance of the short antenna. The coil is added {{at the base of the}} whip (called a base-loaded whip) or occasionally in the middle (center-loaded whip). In the most widely used form, the rubber ducky antenna, the loading coil is integrated with the antenna itself by making the whip out of a narrow helix of <b>springy</b> <b>wire.</b> The helix distributes the inductance along the antenna's length, improving the radiation pattern, and also makes it more flexible. Another alternative occasionally used to shorten the antenna is to add a [...] "capacity hat", a metal screen or radiating wires, at the end. However all these electrically short whips have lower gain than a full length quarter-wave whip.|$|E
5000|$|The crystal radio used a cat's whisker detector, {{invented by}} Harrison H. C. Dunwoody and Greenleaf Whittier Pickard in 1904, {{to extract the}} audio from the radio {{frequency}} signal. [...] It consisted of a mineral crystal, usually galena, which was lightly touched by a fine <b>springy</b> <b>wire</b> (the [...] "cat whisker") on an adjustable arm. [...] The resulting crude semiconductor junction functioned as a Schottky barrier diode, conducting in only one direction. Only particular sites on the crystal surface worked as detector junctions, and the junction could be disrupted by the slightest vibration. So a usable site was found {{by trial and error}} before each use; the operator would drag the cat's whisker across the crystal until the radio began functioning. Frederick Seitz, a later semiconductor researcher, wrote:Such variability, bordering on what seemed the mystical, plagued the early history of crystal detectors and caused many of the vacuum tube experts of a later generation to regard the art of crystal rectification as being close to disreputable.The crystal radio was unamplified and ran off the power of the radio waves received from the radio station, so it had to be listened to with earphones; it could not drive a loudspeaker. [...] It required a long wire antenna, and its sensitivity depended on how large the antenna was. During the wireless era it was used in commercial and military longwave stations with huge antennas to receive long distance radiotelegraphy traffic, even including transatlantic traffic. [...] However, when used to receive broadcast stations a typical home crystal set had a more limited range of about 25 miles. [...] In sophisticated crystal radios the [...] "loose coupler" [...] inductively coupled tuned circuit was used to increase the Q. However it still had poor selectivity compared to modern receivers.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the elastic behavior of knotted loops of <b>springy</b> <b>wire.</b> To this end we minimize the classic bending energy E_bend=∫κ^ 2 {{together with a}} small multiple of ropelength R=length/thickness in order to penalize selfintersection. Our main objective is to characterize elastic knots, i. e., all limit configurations of energy minimizers of the total energy E_ϑ:=E_bend+ϑ R as ϑ tends to zero. The elastic unknot {{turns out to be}} the round circle with bending energy (2 π) ^ 2. For all (non-trivial) knot classes for which the natural lower bound (4 π) ^ 2 for the bending energy is sharp, the respective elastic knot is the twice covered circle. The knot classes for which (4 π) ^ 2 is sharp are precisely the (2,b) -torus knots for odd b with |b|> 3 (containing the trefoil). In particular, the elastic trefoil is the twice covered circle.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} minimizing the bending energy Eb = R 2 ds on isotopy classes of closed curves in IR 3 to model the elastic behaviour of knotted loops of <b>springy</b> <b>wire.</b> A potential of Coulomb type with a small factor ` as a measure for {{the thickness of the}} wire is added to the elastic energy in order to preserve the isotopy class. With a direct method we show existence of minimizers x ` under a given topological knot type for each ` ? 0. Moreover, allowing smaller and smaller thickness (` & 0) and looking at a subsequence of the corresponding minimizers x `, we obtain a generalized minimizer x of the bending energy Eb as a limit. It turns out that x is the once covered circle, if one considers the class of unknotted loops in IR 3. In nontrivial knot classes, however, x must have double points, whose multiplicity and position on the curve is controlled by the value of the bending energy Eb(x).
