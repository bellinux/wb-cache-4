50|$|Psychological {{research}} has explored camera perspective bias with African American and Chinese American <b>suspects.</b> African Americans are victims to strong stereotypes linking them with criminal behavior, but these stereotypes are not prevalent towards Chinese Americans, making the two ethnicities ideal for comparison. Participants {{were randomly assigned}} to view mock police interrogations developed using a male Caucasian detective questioning a Caucasian, Chinese American, or African American male <b>suspect</b> regarding his whereabouts at a given time and date. All interrogations were taped in an equal-focus perspective. Voluntariness judgments varied {{as a function of the}} race of the <b>suspect.</b> More participants viewing the Chinese American <b>suspect</b> and the African American <b>suspect</b> versions of the interrogation judged the <b>suspect's</b> statements to be voluntary than did those viewing the Caucasian <b>suspect</b> version. Both the African American <b>suspect</b> and the Chinese American <b>suspect</b> were judged to have a higher likelihood of guilt than the Caucasian <b>suspect.</b> Racial salience bias in videotaped interrogations is a genuine phenomenon that has been proven through empirical data.|$|R

Two hundred thirty six children aged 6 to 12 years with CDR ≥ 0. 6 were enrolled in this study. Subjects were classified into two groups based on parental CDR: disc <b>suspect</b> children with disc <b>suspect</b> (CDR ≥ 0. 6) parents and disc <b>suspect</b> children without disc <b>suspect</b> parents. Ocular variables were compared between the two groups. Of the 236 disc <b>suspect</b> children, 100 (42. 4 %) {{had at least one}} disc <b>suspect</b> parent. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was higher in disc <b>suspect</b> children with disc <b>suspect</b> parents (16. 52 ± 2. 66 mmHg) than in disc <b>suspect</b> children without disc <b>suspect</b> parents (14. 38 ± 2. 30 mmHg, p = 0. 023). In the group with disc <b>suspect</b> parents, vertical CDR significantly correlated with IOP (R = - 0. 325, p = 0. 001), average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (R = - 0. 319, p = 0. 001), rim area (R = - 0. 740, p = 0. 001), and cup volume (R = 0. 499, p = 0. 001). However, spherical equivalent (R = 0. 333, p = 0. 001), AL (R = - 0. 223, p = 0. 009), and disc area (R = 0. 325, p = 0. 001) significantly correlated with vertical CDR in disc <b>suspect</b> children without disc <b>suspect</b> parents, in contrast to those with disc <b>suspect</b> parents. Larger vertical CDR was associated with the presence of disc <b>suspect</b> parents (p = 0. 001), larger disc area (p = 0. 001), thinner rim area (p = 0. 001), larger average CDR (p = 0. 001), and larger cup volume (p = 0. 021). Family history of large CDR was a significant factor associated with large vertical CDR in children.
