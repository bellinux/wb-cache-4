40|$|Capital {{accession}} to a company, without <b>subscription</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares,</b> is exercised {{when a company}} is facing a forced liquidation, or when the company wants to obtain capital by a less regulated process than conventional methods of raising capital. The main reason for raising capital {{in this way is}} that the accession does not add to a company’s liability in the balance sheet, therefore creating a surplus in the balance sheet. Thus, avoiding a forced liquidation caused by a share capital deficit below the required amount for going concern. However, the contributor of a capital accession of this kind, almost certainly wants reimbursement for his deed when not receiving shares. This can be achieved by a range of agreements between the contributor and the shareholders. The question is what arrangements can be done to constitute a sufficient security for the contributor. And further, in which way can these be combined? The answer depends on many factors, amongst others, whether there is a possibility to alter the Articles of Association, the shareholders’ financial solidity, and if the risk with pledging <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> is accepted. Ultimately, the decision is an agreement between the contributor and the shareholders, upon the conditions in the given situation.
