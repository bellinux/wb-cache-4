5|$|The {{deliberate}} {{planting of}} fake documents {{to be found}} by the enemy was not new; known as the Haversack Ruse, it had been practised by the British {{and others in the}} First and Second World Wars. In August 1942, before the Battle of Alam el Halfa, a corpse was placed in a blown-up scout car, in a minefield facing the German 90th Light Division. On the corpse was a map purportedly showing the locations of British minefields; the Germans used the map and their tanks were routed to areas of <b>soft</b> <b>sand</b> where they bogged down.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} morning {{of the first day}} of battle, small parties of Indians dashed up to the sand bar on horseback several times, but they did little damage to the scouts. The scouts killed their horses for breastworks and dug pits into the <b>soft</b> <b>sand</b> behind them. When the scouts opened fire, the Indians {{attacked}} the island on both sides. Later they crawled through the grass and shot through the grass. Several scouts who were killed or wounded were hit by the Indian snipers hidden in the grass. The Indians surrounded the island and repeatedly attacked the Scouts. Three scouts hidden in hole on the riverbank shot several Indians from the shore.|$|E
25|$|Before the Madras harbour was built, {{the beach}} was just a strip of mud, teeming with mudskippers. The beach washed up close {{to the present day}} road for a long time until the harbour was built in 1881. Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff, the {{governor}} of Madras from 1881 to 1886, who was captivated by the beach on an earlier visit to the city in the late 1870s, conceived and built the promenade along the beach in 1884 by extensively modifying and layering with <b>soft</b> <b>sand.</b> He also gave it the name Madras Marina in the same year. Since the early 19th century, a number of public buildings were constructed fronting the beach.|$|E

25|$|Corydoras panda inhabits clear river {{waters that}} are {{relatively}} fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise <b>soft</b> <b>sand</b> or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The {{proximity of the}} home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes—the temperature range of the fish is 16°C to 28°C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for limited periods, survive temperatures as low as 12°C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance.|$|E
25|$|At 05:40, British {{artillery}} for the Halfaya Group {{was scheduled}} to open fire on the German and Italian forces stationed in Halfaya to provide cover for the tanks and infantry, but the battery had become bogged down by <b>soft</b> <b>sand.</b> After waiting until 06:00, 15 minutes after the fighting began to the west below the escarpment, the commander of C Squadron, ordered his tanks to attack {{at the top of}} the pass; soon after, though, the anti-tank guns of the German and Italian defenders opened fire and within a few hours all but one light tank and one of the Matildas had been destroyed, including Miles' own. The Cameron Highlanders initially continued their advance but were soon driven back by a detachment of German armoured cars and motorised infantry. The British forces below the escarpment did not fare much better, as four of the Matildas were disabled by anti-tank mines which were supposed to have been cleared; this blocked the path of the remaining two and reduced the small tank force to acting in a pillbox capacity. The Rajputana Rifles and Mahrattas made several attempts to reach the pass, but were repelled each time; the former lost their commanding officer in the final attack.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, 2004, {{the nose}} landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, struck a bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The {{incident}} was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating {{to the left of}} the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the nose wheel steering tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of <b>soft</b> <b>sand.</b> The {{nose landing gear}} leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the nose wheel steering system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application of grease during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable.|$|E

500|$|The 5th Cavalry Division {{consisted}} of the 13th, 14th and 15th Cavalry Brigades, Essex and Nottinghamshire Batteries, Royal Horse Artillery, 5th Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, 5th Cavalry Division Signal Squadron, the 12th Light Armoured Motor Battery and the 7th Light Car Patrol. The division was to lead the advance north riding along the beach {{under the cover of}} some cliffs, past the Nahr el Falik on their way through Mukhalid and up the Plain of Sharon. Their advance guard, the 13th Cavalry Brigade and the 12th Light Armoured Motor Battery, were on the beach just south of Arsuf when Major General H. J. Macandrew the divisional commander, was informed at 07:00 by the 60th Division that Ottoman shelling had ceased south of the Nahr el Faliq, clearing the way for the cavalry. An hour later the 9th Hodson's Horse leading its brigade, reached Nahr el Faliq, but the horses were [...] "somewhat blown" [...] by their quick journey across the <b>soft</b> <b>sand.</b> Macandrew had seen the speed the 13th Cavalry Brigade set and galloped after them, hoping to slow them down, but could not catch them.|$|E
500|$|Chauvel had {{relied on}} the {{steadiness}} of the 1st Light Horse Brigade, which he had commanded during the Gallipoli campaign, {{to hold the line}} against greatly superior numbers for four hours until dawn, when the general situation could be assessed. Daylight revealed the weakness of the light horse defenders in their second position on Wellington Ridge and that their right was outflanked by strong German and Ottoman forces. At 04:30, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, commanded by Colonel J. R. Royston, was ordered up by Chauvel from Etmaler and went into action in front of Mount Royston to support and prolong the 1st Light Horse Brigade's right flank by moving up the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments into the front line. German, Austrian or Ottoman artillery now opened fire on the infantry defences and camps in the rear; shrapnel inflicted some losses, but the high explosive shells were smothered by the <b>soft</b> <b>sand.</b> The attackers succeeded in forcing the light horse off Wellington Ridge, which placed them within [...] of the Romani camp. However, they were unable to press further, as they now became exposed to machine gun and rifle fire from the entrenched infantry of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, and shelling from the horse artillery supporting the light horsemen's determined defence.|$|E
