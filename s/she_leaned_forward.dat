60|$|Laverick hesitating, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{and looked}} into his face.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{a little}} and {{buried her face in}} her hands.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> as she spoke, {{until her}} breath fanned his face.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{suddenly}} <b>forward,</b> {{and struck}} {{him across the}} cheek.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{suddenly}} <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> {{took his}} head between {{her hands and}} kissed his forehead.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "No, no! The window! A little faint--it's so close-- There, it's {{all right}} now. Or it will be--when--I've had--another cigarette." [...] <b>She</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> to take one; Ashley gravely watches her, but says nothing. She lights her cigarette, but, without smoking, throws it away. [...] "Go on." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward.</b> I {{think that}} she was trying to look into my face.|$|E
60|$|She {{was silent}} for a moment. Then <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> and touched the window.|$|E
60|$|Slowly <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> and traced {{on the rug}} {{the figure}} of the Egg itself.|$|E
60|$|She {{threw away}} {{the end of}} her cigarette. Without turning or looking in his {{direction}} <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forwards,</b> her head supported upon her fingers, her elbows upon her knees. She gazed steadily out of the window at that arc of glittering lights. He made a quick movement towards her, but she did not flinch. His arm fell to his side. The effort of self-repression cost him a sob.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{a little}} <b>forward</b> and looked {{steadily}} into his eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{seemed on}} the point of departure. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> a little <b>forward.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> too: {{but again}} there was silence. The words were {{struggling}} in vain.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward.</b> There was {{a look in}} {{her face}} which he knew very well.|$|E
60|$|Though {{she frowned}} at these last words of his, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> eagerly to him.|$|E
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "I won't let you say that, Nettie Spaulding. I DIDN'T like him. I {{respected}} and admired him; but I didn't LIKE him. He will come near me; {{but if he}} does he has to begin by--by--Let me see, what shall I make him begin by doing?" [...] She casts up her eyes for inspiration while <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> over the register. [...] "Yes, I will! He has got to begin by taking that money!" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin was silent. Perhaps he was {{measuring}} {{his strength}} in some imagined encounter with this man. Something {{in his face}} alarmed Helene. <b>She</b> suddenly <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{and looked at him}} more closely.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{a little}} <b>forward</b> in her chair. Even {{then she did}} not understand.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{and looked}} at him. Unwillingly {{he turned his head}} to meet her gaze.|$|E
60|$|Louise, for a moment, was startled. Then <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{and kissed}} the eager, upturned face.|$|E
60|$|The Princess {{was only}} obeying a faint sign from Forrest. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> and {{addressed}} her host.|$|E
60|$|Pamela laughed. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{a little}} <b>forward.</b> The buzz of {{conversation}} now was insistent all around them.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> has <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{to say it}} in his ear, {{with her}} {{forefinger}} shaking before his eyes, and now huddles herself together, and with another ‘Bless ye, and thank’ee!’ goes away {{in the direction of}} the Travellers’ Lodging House.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> {{a little}} <b>forward,</b> with her fawn-colored lashes dropped over her eyes, which were bent upon {{the ground and}} the point of the parasol she was holding with her little gloved hands between her knees. He {{wondered}} why she did not look up; he did not know that it was partly because there were tears in her eyes and partly for another reason. As <b>she</b> had <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> his arm had quite unconsciously moved along the back of the bench where her shoulders had rested, and she could not have resumed her position except in his half embrace.|$|R
60|$|But as {{he moved}} she saw {{something}} else. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> pointing to the empty sheath at his girdle.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> so {{that one}} of those dyed {{feathers}} to which he objected so strongly brushed his cheek.|$|E
60|$|The smile maddened her. She {{had meant}} to be subtle. She became flamboyant. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> in her chair.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{a little}} <b>forward</b> in her chair. Her hands were clasped together. Her {{eyes were fixed}} on vacancy.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forwards</b> and upwards {{to pierce}} the darkness; he, also {{straining}} to look, felt her breath on his cheek, and turning, saw the pallor {{of her face}} close to his, and felt the dark glow of her eyes. He caught her in his arms, and held her mouth in a kiss. Then, when he released her, he turned away, saying something incoherent about going to fetch the lantern to look. She remained with her back towards me, and pretended to be feeling among the mistletoe for the berries. Soon I saw the swing of the hurricane lamp below.|$|R
60|$|She obeyed {{him after}} only a moment's hesitation, yet {{in the first few}} bars her song came to an abrupt end, her voice choked. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{suddenly}} <b>forward</b> in her place, her face was hidden between her hands. They all gazed at her curiously.|$|R
60|$|Her {{words were}} so softly spoken {{that they seemed}} to melt away. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> to look in his face.|$|E
60|$|Agatha {{looked at}} her quietly and searchingly, {{but there was only}} sympathy in her face, and <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> impulsively.|$|E
60|$|Then {{what was}} surely a miracle happened. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{and took his}} hand. Her eyes were soft with sympathy.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{a little}} <b>forward</b> {{so as to}} look into his face. The impassivity of his {{features}} was like a wall before her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{a little}} <b>forward.</b> Her {{hair was a}} little dishevelled, her face was almost haggard. Her under lip was quivering like a child's.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{a little}} <b>forward.</b> The car had swung round a corner now and was {{making its way}} up an avenue as dark as pitch.|$|R
