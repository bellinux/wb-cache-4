40|$|Abstract: An {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a pendulum}} {{which has its}} mass above its pivot point. Inverted Pendulum is a classical problem in dynamics and control theory and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms (PID controllers, neural networks, fuzzy control, genetic algorithms etc.). Variations on this problem include multiple links allowing {{the motion of the}} cart to be commanded while maintaining the pendulum and balancing the cart- pendulum system on see- saw. The inverted pendulum is related to rocket or missile guidance, where the centre of gravity is located behind the canter of drag causing aerodynamic instability. The understanding of similar problem can be shown by balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one’s finger is a simple demonstration and the problem is solved in the technology of the seaway Position, <b>self</b> <b>balancing</b> transportation <b>device.</b> So, here the entire above problem can be solved by using levitation system. In this levitation system three magnets are used in equilateral triangle for giving the force to inverted pendulum in 3 -dimension for balancing the pendulum.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the results on the modelling and control of a two wheeled robotic mobility platform that achieves automatic <b>self</b> <b>balance</b> detecting the weight shift of the operator. This vehicle is principally a <b>self</b> <b>balancing</b> machine whose wheels share a common axis. <b>Self</b> <b>balance</b> is achieved by accelerating the body enabling pseudo forces to act upon it thus bringing the body to its mean position. We have employed Newton‟s laws of motion to determine the acceleration required to achieve <b>self</b> <b>balance.</b> This condition of achieving <b>self</b> <b>balance</b> has been put to use by us to achieve locomotion. For oscillation-free motion a new concept called cut-off angle has also been introduced. This machine has numerous advantages which make it an asset considering the problems faced by present day commuters especially on crowded Indian roads where pollution, fuel crisis and traffic congestion are the major hitches. Being a battery operated vehicle there is zero emission. Moreover, as both wheels share a common axis, the turning radius can be easily minimised to zero. Apart from this a new method to calculate the net moment of inertia of vehicles has also been discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{idea of an}} {{autonomous}} bicycle originates from Jens G. Balchen who wanted to make an unmanned autonomous bicycle. The idea {{was picked up by}} Amund Skavhaug who extended the idea with the concept of using an inverted pendulum to simulate a leaning rider.
