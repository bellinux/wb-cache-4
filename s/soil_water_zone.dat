A deterministic model developed by Haan (1972) was used to determine the amount of water yield from watersheds. The model consists offour parameters, namely: (0 maximum rate of seepage from the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>zone</b> in mm per day (S), (ii) maximum soil moisture less readily available for evapotranspiration in mm (C), (iii) fraction ofseepage from the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>zone</b> that becomes runoff(F), and (iv) maximum infiltration rate in mm per hour (f.). The inputs required by the model were the daily rainfall and the estimated potential evapotranspiration which was computed using Penman method. Streamflow records for 10 years of Pogung-Code sub watershed (2, 801. 77 ha) and Pulo-Opak sub watershed (4, 856. 37 ha) were used to test the validity of the model. The parameters obtained for Pogung-Code sub watershed were: S = 0. 70 mm per day, C = 112. 32 mm, F = 0. 63, and - 5. 38 mm per hour, meanwhile for Pulo-Opak sub watershed were: S = 2. 33 mm per day, C = 86. 72 mm, F [...] - 0. 26 and f = 5. 68 mm per hour. The final test of the adequacy of the model lay in a comparison of observed and simulated runoff The comparison showed that the observed and simulated runoff values are not significantly different. This was based on the results obtained from statistical measures to test the model. The model did a better simulation in the smaller watershed (Pogung-Code sub watershed) than in the larger one (Pulo-Opak sub watershed) ...|$|E

For studying the upper boundary, an evaporation experiment at the representative elementary volume (REV) scale was considered and modelled numerically. A model with a diffusive boundary layer and a 1 D Richards' description including vapour transport fitted well to experimental data. It showed a boundary layer dominated regime in the wet range and a regime where dynamics is controlled by soil hydraulic properties in the dry range. The model could successfully {{be used to determine}} soil hydraulic properties from the corresponding evaporation experiment by inverse modelling using a Monte-Carlo Levenberg-Marquardt approach. For the lower boundary, light transmission and NIR imaging spectroscopy methods were developed and employed to measure the micro- and macroscopic water distribution in response to transient boundary conditions in a semi- 2 D sand medium in a Hele-Shaw cell with high temporal and spacial resolution. The analysis showed that coupled multi-phase and dynamic non-equillibrium effects are essential to understand water movement in dynamic capillary fringes, and sub-REV processes {{play an important role in}} the dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Long-term {{investigations}} of soil moisture at different precipitation {{patterns in the}} black soil in Hailun county, Northeast China were made. This area is an important base for marketable grains production due to a short cultivation history, high soil organic matter content, and high yield potential. In this region, precipitation is the principal water source during the cropping season, hence <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> storage {{is very important for}} agricultural production. Estimation of the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> retention characteristics of the black soil is necessary to assess the risk of drought, <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> potential to meet crop water requirements, and irrigation scheduling. The <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> conditions are influenced by meteorology, soil physical properties, vegetation and other related factors. Ten years of field research were the basis for our definition of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> characteristics of the black soils at Hailun Agri-ecology Experimental Station, Songnen plain, Northeast China. This paper identifies three different kinds of precipitation which affect <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> movement and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> characteristics in different seasons. Investigations were performed during the normal rainfall year of 1995, the above normal rainfall year of 1997 and the drought year of 2001.

Therefore, the objectives of this study were to understand the relative value of various putative traits that confer yield advantages under terminal drought stress in chickpea, and the traits that are amenable for high throughput and their association with molecular markers. Twelve chickpea genotypes, selected for contrast in root and shoot strength, field-based drought tolerance and canopy temperature differences were grown in terminal drought stressed and optimally irrigated environments. Root, shoot, <b>soil</b> <b>water,</b> physiological and analytical yield components were measured at periodical intervals and these related traits were associated with grain yield through correlations, regressions and path analysis.

40|$|Water {{transport}} in the vadose zone greatly {{depends on}} the hydric properties of soils which exhibit high variability whatever the spatial scale analysed. The determination of those properties in the field or in the laboratory involves considerable uncertainty. Recently, inverse modelling has been introduced to obtain hydric properties in situ by deducing from a measured time series of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content. Anyhow, the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content is commonly obtained by gravimetric measurements on soil samples, TDR measurements or neutron probes measurements. At the field scale, these methods give only punctual information on <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content, with a low spatial resolution. Financial and time constraints limit the numbers of measurements locations and thus {{the description of the}} <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content. Since recently, geophysical methods enable the monitoring of some soil characteristics on a continuous space with a high resolution. One of them, the electrical resistivity (ohm. m) -or DC method- is well adapted to characterise the soil subsurface and to describe soil properties, even if they are time-dependent. However the electrical resistivity depends on several chemical and physical soil variables that can interact. The influence of one soil parameter like the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content on the electrical resistivity is then hard to estimate. Our objective was then to use spatial measurements of electrical resistivity, to define zones of homogeneous electrical resistivity with time, to interpret them in terms of evolution of water content, and to compare them with a soil map. Our assumption was then that the time variation of electrical resistivity at the field scale was only due to the evolution of the soil moisture in our studied field. A time monitoring of the soil electrical resistivity and the soil moisture was realized during the year 2006, at four dates, both by the MUCEP device (MultiContinous Electrical Profiling), that gives measurements on a whole field area, and by local gravimetric measurements of the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content. Homogeneous <b>zones</b> were defined directly from measurements for the electrical resistivity, and after ordinary kriging for the water content. Our analysis of the spatial and temporal variability has permitted to discriminate three temporal homogeneous zones, both for electrical resistivity and the water content, that were mainly related to the soil map. We show that the use of electrical measurements enables (1) to directly describe the spatial and temporal evolution of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content at the field scale and (2) to extrapolate the temporal evolution of the water content in unknown zones.

Robust algorithms are needed to estimate <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> storage before planting to aid crop management decisions. The main objectives of this paper are to investigate <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> recharge during the non-growing season (October 20 to May 1) in a semi-arid, temperate ecosystem in south-central Nebraska (USA) and to evaluate empirical models to estimate <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content {{at the beginning}} of the summer-crop growing season. A database of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content measurements collected over 5 years at nine locations in south-central Nebraska was used to estimate available water-holding limits in the soil profile and to determine the change in available <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> during the non-growing season. Regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship among <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> recharge, residual <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> (i. e., <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content at the end of the previous growing season), total precipitation, and available water-holding capacity (AWHC) in the root zone to 1. 5 m. Precipitation storage efficiency (PSE) was calculated as the quotient of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> recharge and total non-growing season precipitation. Predictive models to estimate <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content {{at the beginning of}} summer-crop growing season were derived from these analyses. A large portion of the variation in <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> recharge was explained by residual <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> and precipitation.

Potential {{effects of climate change}} combined with land and water management on surface waters have been studied in some detail. Equivalent studies of groundwater systems have lagged behind these advances, but research and broader interest in projected climate effects on groundwater have been accelerating in recent years. In this paper, we provide an overview and synthesis of the key aspects of subsurface hydrology, including water quantity and quality, related to global change. Adaptation to global change must include prudent management of groundwater as a renewable, but slow-feedback resource in most cases. Groundwater storage is already over-tapped in many regions, yet available subsurface storage may be a key to meeting the combined demands of agriculture, industry, municipal and domestic water supply, and ecosystems during times of shortage. The future intensity and frequency of dry periods combined with warming trends need to be addressed in the context of groundwater resources, even though projections in space and time are fraught with uncertainty. Finally, potential impacts of groundwater on the global climate system are largely unknown.

We developed site-specific empirical models topredict spring <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content for two Montana ranches. Calibration data sample sizeswere based on the estimated variability of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> and the desired level of precision forthe <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> estimates.

Our objectives were to see whether <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> could bepredicted accurately with easily obtainable calibration data and predictor variables and toconsider the relative influence of the three sources of predictor variables. Independentvalidation showed that multiple regression models predicted <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> with average error(RMSD) within 0. 04 mass water content. This was similar to the accuracy expected basedon a statistical power test based on our sample size (n = 41 and n = 50). Improvedprediction precision could be achieved with additional calibration samples, and rangemanagers can readily balance the desired level of precision with the amount of effort tocollect calibration data. Spring <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> prediction effectively utilized a combination ofland surface imagery, terrain data, and subsurface soil characterization data.

40|$|National Natural Sciences Foundation of China 40671034;National Natural Science Foundation of China 40830636 Vegetation cover {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the process of evaporation and infiltration. To explore the relationships between precipitation, <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> and groundwater in Taihang mountainous region, China, precipitation, <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> and water table were observed from 2004 to 2006, and precipitation, <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> and groundwater were sampled in 2004 and 2005 for oxygen- 18 and deuterium analysis at Chongling catchment. The <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> was sampled at three sites covered by grass (Carex humilis and Carex lanceolata), acacia and arborvitae respectively. Precipitation is mainly concentrated in rainy seasons and has no significant spatial variance in study area. The stable isotopic compositions are enriched in precipitation and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> due to the evaporation. The analysis of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> potential and isotopic profiles shows that evaporation of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> under arborvitae cover is weaker than under grass and acacia, while <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> evaporation under grass and acacia showed no significant difference. Both delta O- 18 profiles and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> potential dynamics reveal that the soil under acacia allows the most rapid infiltration rate, which may be related to preferential flow. In the process of infiltration after a rainstorm, antecedent water still takes up over 30 % of water in the topsoil. The <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> between depths of 0 - 115 cm under grass has a residence time of about 20 days in the rainy season.

The great-est water conductivity at the 0 - 5 cm depth {{for the higher}} values of water potentials (>- 7 kJ m- 3) was shown by tundra polygons (Brunic-Turbic Cryosol, Arenic) – 904 - 0. 09 cm day- 1, whereas the lowest were exhibited by Turbic Cryosols – 95 - 0. 05 cm day- 1. Between- 16 and- 100 kJ m- 3, the water conductivity for tundra polygons rapidly decreased to 0. 0001 cm day- 1, whereas their decrease for the other forms was much lower and in consequence the values were 0. 007, 0. 04, and 0. 01 cm day- 1 for the mud boils (Turbic Cryosol (Siltic, Skeletic)), cell forms (Turbic Cryosol (Siltic, Skeletic)), and sorted circles (Turbic Cryosol (Skeletic)), respectively. In the 10 - 15 cm layer, the shape of water conducti-vity curves for the higher values of water potentials is nearly {{the same as for}} the upper layer. Similarly, the water conductivity is the highest – 0. 2 cm day- 1 for tundra polygons. For the lower water potentials, the differences in water conductivity increase to the decrease of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> potential.
