Quasi-static tensile tests were performed on Type 304 stainless steel flat plate specimens with two dissimilar through-wall offset flaws at ambient temperature.

30|$|Section  3 {{deals with}} the {{stochastic}} differential equations; by using suitable Lyapunov functions we show that {{the solution of the}} stochastic model is positive and global, and this solution oscillates around the equilibria of the deterministic model under certain conditions. That is to say, if the effects of environmental stochastic perturbations are <b>smaller</b> <b>enough</b> than the natural death rate, then the solution of the stochastic model (1.4) oscillates around the disease-free equilibrium when R_ 0 < 1; however, the solution of the stochastic model (1.4) oscillates around the endemic equilibrium when R_ 0 > 1. Moreover, the numerical results also suggest that the fluctuations reduce as the noise level decreases.|$|R

However, Senter did not test whether the strong curvature of dromaeosaurid claws was also conducive to such activities.|$|E
5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory.

Phosphorus substitutes carbon in the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus has one more electron than carbon and thus acts as a donor; however, the ionization energy of phosphorus (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and is <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> for room-temperature thermal ionization.

After war broke out, the RAAF began to decentralise its command structure, commensurate with expected increases in manpower and units. Between March 1940 and May 1941, it divided Australia and Papua into four geographically based command-and-control zones: Central Area, Southern Area, Western Area, and Northern Area. The roles of these area commands were air defence, protection of adjacent sea lanes, and aerial reconnaissance. Each was led by an Air Officer Commanding (AOC) responsible for the administration and operations of air bases and units within his boundary.|$|E

Some snake species may prey on the least weasel, including the black rat snake and copperhead. Aside from its smaller size, the least weasel is more vulnerable to predation than the stoat because it lacks a black predator deflection mark on the tail.|$|E
