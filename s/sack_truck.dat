The wooden timetable board has been preserved and {{can be seen at}} Winchcombe Railway Museum. One of the platform oil lamps, a signal lamp and a wheel off the <b>sack</b> <b>truck</b> have been privately preserved. The Sarsden Halt nameboard and signal box nameplate are not thought to have survived.|$|E
50|$|A hand truck, {{also known}} as a dolly, two wheeler, stack truck, trolley, trundler, box cart, trolley truck, sack barrow, <b>sack</b> <b>truck,</b> or bag barrow, is an L-shaped box-moving {{handcart}} with handles at one end, wheels at the base, with a small ledge to set objects on, flat against the floor when the hand-truck is upright. The objects to be moved are tilted forward, the ledge is inserted underneath them, and the objects allowed to tilt back and rest on the ledge. The truck and object are then tilted backward until the weight is balanced over the large wheels, making otherwise bulky and heavy objects easier to move. It is a first-class lever.|$|E
5000|$|The Harvey {{flamethrower}} {{was introduced}} in August 1940, it was made mostly made from readily available parts such as wheels from agricultural equipment manufacturers and commercially available compressed air cylinders. It comprised a welded steel cylinder containing 22 gallons (100 l) of creosote and a standard bottle of compressed nitrogen at [...] mounted on a <b>sack</b> <b>truck</b> of the type that a railway station porter might use. 25 ft of armoured hose provided the connection to a 4 ft lance with a nozzle and some paraffin soaked cotton waste that was set alight to provide a source of ignition. In operation, the pressure in the fuel container was raised to about [...] causing a cork in the nozzle to be ejected followed by a jet of fuel lasting about 10 seconds at a range of up to 60 ft. Like the Home Guard Flame Thrower, it was intended as an ambush weapon, {{but in this case}} the operator was able to direct the flames by moving the lance which would be pushed through a hole in otherwise bullet proof cover such as a brick wall.|$|E
50|$|Haemmerlin is a French company, {{founded in}} 1867 and based in Alsace. Haemmerlin {{manufactures}} {{in excess of}} one million products a year. The full range includes wheelbarrows, <b>sack</b> <b>trucks,</b> hose reels, hoists, winches, roofing platforms, rubbish chutes, safety barriers, specialist trays for concrete and mortar, trestles, concrete mixers and various equipment used on construction sites.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sack</b> <b>trucks</b> were {{originally}} {{used in the}} 18th century to move large sacks of spices on docks by young boys, {{from the age of}} 11, who were unable to lift the large sacks by hand. By using this method they were able to work as well as grown men in moving items around. Later, such trucks were amended for use in many different industries, such as brewing, where hops were moved in sacks.|$|R
50|$|Stairclimber wheels can {{be fitted}} to hand <b>trucks</b> (<b>sack</b> <b>trucks)</b> {{and as the}} name implies, are {{designed}} to aid the moving of goods up or down stairs. This type of stairclimber relies on a wheel configuration known as tri-star, three wheels set into a triangle configuration replacing the standard wheel on either side. Stairclimber wheels can sometimes be problematic when trying to turn on flat ground as four wheels in a fixed position will be {{in contact with the}} ground at all times unless a locking mechanism is built into the trolley.|$|R
50|$|For the {{alternative}} {{name for a}} <b>sack</b> <b>truck</b> (trolley truck), see Hand truckA trolleytruck (also known as a freight trolley or trolley truck) is a trolleybus-like vehicle used for carrying cargo instead of passengers. A trolleytruck is usually a type of electric truck powered by two overhead wires, from which it draws electricity using two trolley poles or two pantographs. Two current collectors are {{required in order to}} supply and return current, because the return current cannot pass to the ground (as is done by streetcars on rails) since trolleytrucks use tires that are insulators. Lower powered trucks, such as might be seen on the streets of a city, tend to use trolley poles for current collection. Higher powered trucks, such as those used for large construction or mining projects, may exceed the power capacity of trolley poles and have to use pantographs instead. Trolleytrucks have been used in various places around the world and are still in use in cities in Russia and Ukraine, as well as at mines in North America and Africa. Because they draw power from the mains, trolleytrucks can use renewable energy sources - modern trolleytrucks systems are under test in Sweden and Germany along highways using diesel-electric hybrids to reduce emissions.|$|E
50|$|Ford {{sought to}} provide {{large-scale}} stone grinding of grain {{and to maintain}} natural soil nutrition. He took the view that all farming should first maintain and then improve the soil. He {{served as chairman of}} the trade association, the National Nutritional Food Association. During the formative years of Arrowhead Mills, Ford personally did most of the growing, grinding, <b>sacking,</b> <b>trucking,</b> warehousing, shipping, and bookkeeping. Slowly, the investment of time, money, and energy began to pay dividends from the increased national awareness of organic foods and sound nutrition. Ford also was an advertising spokesman for the natural food industry during the 1960s and 1970s.|$|R

My Uncle Leigh Martineau drove the truck which was an army surplus truck from World War I. It traveled so slow that they would trail a wagon behind it loaded with wheat, about one hundred <b>sacks</b> on the <b>truck</b> and trailer. He would wait {{in a long time}} to get unloaded." [...] - J. Leigh Chantrill, story took place approximately 1918 - 1922.|$|R

50|$|According to the Indian Army {{white paper}} on Operation Blue Star, {{the library was}} {{destroyed}} {{on the night of}} June 5, 1984 {{in the midst of a}} firefight. However, according to V. M. Tarkunde, the library was still intact on June 6 when the Army had gained control of the Golden Temple, and was in fact burned down by the army at some point between June 6 and June 14. Although the Indian Army has maintained that the library's contents were completely destroyed on June 5, the SGPC has contradicted their version of events. By using witness accounts, the SGPC has alleged that material from the library was taken in gunny <b>sacks</b> on military <b>truck</b> to Amritsar's Youth Club, a temporary office of the CBI , and the empty library was burned by the army afterwards. At that location, the CBI catalogued the materials until September 1984, when in light of a Sikh convention being held in the city, the library's contents were moved to an undisclosed location.|$|R
