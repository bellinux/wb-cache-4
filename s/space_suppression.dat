40|$|Several key {{processes}} at the LHC in {{the standard}} model and beyond that involve b quarks, such as single-top, Higgs, and weak vector boson associated production, {{can be described in}} QCD either in a 4 -flavor or 5 -flavor scheme. In the former, b quarks appear only in the final state and are typically considered massive. In 5 -flavor schemes, calculations include b quarks in the initial state, are simpler and allow the resummation of possibly large initial state logarithms of the type Q^ 2 /m_b^ 2 into the b parton distribution function (PDF), Q being the typical scale of the hard process. In this work we critically reconsider the rationale for using 5 -flavor improved schemes at the LHC. Our motivation stems from the observation that the effects of initial state logs are rarely very large in hadron collisions: 4 -flavor computations are pertubatively well behaved and a substantial agreement between predictions in the two schemes is found. We identify two distinct reasons that explain this behaviour, i. e., the resummation of the initial state logarithms into the b-PDF is relevant only at large Bjorken x and the possibly large ratios Q^ 2 /m_b^ 2 's are always accompanied by universal phase <b>space</b> <b>suppression</b> factors. Our study paves the way to using both schemes for the same process so to exploit their complementary advantages for different observables, such as employing a 5 -flavor scheme to accurately predict the total cross section at NNLO and the corresponding 4 -flavor computation at NLO for fully exclusive studies.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the CMS {{experiment}} at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is to search for physics beyond the Standard Model and to measure Standard Model parameters. For both purposes {{it is essential to}} determine important performance parameters of the CMS detector. The here presented thesis contributes in a twofold way to the physics program of CMS. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, a search for physics beyond the Standard Model is presented. It is motivated by supersymmetric models with nearly mass-degenerate lightest neutralinos and lightest charginos. The small mass gap between chargino and neutralino can lead to long lifetimes of the chargino due to phase <b>space</b> <b>suppression.</b> Thus, the chargino can reach the tracking system before its decay. The here presented search targets chargino lifetimes of cτ≈ 1 - 30 cm where most of the charginos decay in the first layers of the tracker. This search aims at increasing the search sensitivity of existing searches with respect to these models in a twofold way: first, the inclusion of tracks down to three measurements in the tracking system, and second, the discrimination against Standard Model background by the energy loss per path length. The search is performed on 19. 7 fb^- 1 of data recorded at the CMS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. No excess above the Standard Model expectation is found and the supersymmetric parameter space is constrained. The search can exclude supersymmetric models with chargino masses of 100 GeV down to lifetimes of cτ= 2 cm and models with masses of 500 GeV down to lifetimes of cτ= 70 cm. Current limits are confirmed and improvements of the order of 10 - 40 GeV in chargino mass are achieved. In the second part of the thesis, a measurement of the jet transverse-momentum resolution at 8 TeV at the CMS experiment is presented. In order to exploit the good energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS detector, the measurement is performed using γ + jet events. Due to the transverse momentum balance in the absence of further jet activity, the photon momentum can be used as a measure for the true jet transverse momentum. The applied method is based on earlier measurements but is further developed within this thesis in order to consistently account for the influence of additional jet activity on the jet transverse-momentum response.

Effective ways to suppress the space charge injection/accumulation in insulation material is currently a popular research topic. In this study, an aluminium oxide functional film was deposited on a cellulose insulation pressboard surface using reactive radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The sputtered thin film was characterized by the scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM/EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

40|$|We {{present an}} exactly-solvable {{model for the}} {{suppression}} of quantum noise at large scales on expanding <b>space.</b> The <b>suppression</b> arises naturally in the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory, according to which the Born probability rule has a dynamical origin. For a scalar field on a radiation-dominated background we construct the exact solution for the time-evolving wave functional and study properties of the associated field trajectories. It is shown that the time evolution of a field mode on expanding space is mathematically equivalent {{to that of a}} standard harmonic oscillator with a 'retarded time' that depends on the wavelength of the mode. In the far super-Hubble regime the equivalent oscillator evolves over only one Hubble time, yielding a simple mechanism whereby relaxation to the Born rule can be suppressed on very large scales. We present numerical simulations illustrating how the expansion of space can cause a retardation of relaxation in the super-Hubble regime. Given these results it is natural to expect a suppression of quantum noise at super-Hubble wavelengths. Such suppression could have taken place in a pre-inflationary era, resulting in a large-scale power deficit in the cosmic microwave background. Comment: 39 pages, 5 figures.
