The key input values {{to the decision}} tree are the performance indices calculated from the maximum values of unfiltered inverse Stockwell transform (MUNIST) technique. A wide range of techniques including Stockwell transform (ST) {{have been used for}} the identification of power <b>system</b> <b>faults.</b> However, the signatures produced by these techniques are not unique and sometimes lead to misinterpretation of faults. Consequently, a decision tree based on the inverse Stockwell transform method is proposed in the present paper to automatically identify both the symmetrical and unsymmetrical power <b>system</b> <b>faults.</b> The method is able to determine both sudden and gradual changes in the signal caused by different power <b>system</b> <b>faults.</b> The technique is very accurate and produces unique signatures compared to the existing techniques.

40|$|Reactive {{power control}} using the static {{compensator}} (STATCOM) has more advantageous due to outstanding performance of STATCOM. In {{transmission and distribution}} systems, the reactive power control is done by using the STATCOM based on voltage source converter (VSC). STATCOM can supply large amount of VAR’s during <b>system</b> <b>faults</b> for voltage support. The STATCOM effects the VSC over currents and trips, during the power <b>system</b> <b>faults</b> when VAR’s support is more required. In this paper, we propose and develop an “emergency PWM” strategy to prevent over-currents (and trips) in the VSC during and after single line to ground <b>system</b> <b>faults,</b> LLLG faults {{and to ensure that}} the STATCOM supplies required reactive power. System performance during a nonlinear load connected without any fault is also considered.

40|$|The STATCOM (Synchronous Static Compensator) {{based on}} voltage source {{converter}} (VSC) {{is used for}} voltage regulation in transmission and distribution system. The STATCOM can rapidly supply dynamic VARs required during <b>system</b> <b>faults</b> for voltage support.

In this paper, classification of power <b>system</b> <b>faults</b> using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is proposed.
