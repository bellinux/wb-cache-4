50|$|The pitch {{produced}} by an organ pipe is determined in two fundamentally different ways. For a reed pipe it is determined mainly by the mechanical {{properties of the}} reed {{and the length of}} the protruding part. For the flue pipes it is determined by the shape of the air column inside the pipe and whether the column is open at the end.For those pipes the pitch is a function of its length, the wavelength of the sound {{produced by}} an open pipe being approximately twice its length. A pipe half the length of another will sound one octave higher. If the longest pipe, C, is 8 ft in length, the pipe one octave higher will be 4 ft long, and two octaves above (middle C) will be 2 ft long. A closed (<b>stopped)</b> <b>pipe</b> produces a sound one octave lower than an open pipe. For example, the lowest Gedackt / closed C pipe (2 octaves below middle C) will be 4 ft long.|$|E

5000|$|The organ {{dates from}} 1810 when a [...] "finger organ" [...] by J Lincoln was installed.

5000|$|The Bourdon is also {{frequently}} found at 8&prime;, especially in French organs, and {{is equivalent to}} the German Gedackt and English Stopped Diapason, which give a similar sound. Although varying between builders, the Bourdon stop is usually fairly soft and neutral, but colorful in the tenor/alto register. [...] The pipes can be built of wood or metal, but are overwhelmingly constructed of wood in modern organ building (French makers from Cavaillé-coll on prefer metal). They are thick walled, and generally square in cross section, with a high mouth cut-up to produce the fluty tone. Bourdon is a <b>stopped</b> <b>pipe,</b> having an airtight stopper fitted into the top. This makes the tone one octave lower than a pipe of open construction (they are only one half the length of an open pipe of the same pitch), and also eliminates the development of even-numbered harmonics ("squaring off" [...] the timbre), helping to create the characteristic tone quality.|$|E
5000|$|Gedackt pipes {{can be made}} {{of either}} wood or metal, but in modern organ building, and the {{majority}} of historical examples, they are made of wood. They are occasionally square, but much more commonly rectangular in cross-section, the mouth being on the narrow side of the pipe. The mouth has a high cut-up (height to width ratio) to produce the fluty tone. Gedackt is a <b>stopped</b> <b>pipe,</b> as its name implies. Stopped pipes need be only 1/2 of unison length to produce unison pitch, however, it is common for many stopped ranks of pipes to be built as [...] "open" [...] pipes in the highest sounding notes. An open pipe, such as an 8&prime; Diapason, needs to be eight feet long at low [...] "C" [...] on the keyboard, but the capped gedackt of similar pitch need be only four feet long at that point, making the stop very compact and economical to build. As in most wood pipes, the foot, block (which contains the windway), mouthpiece and cap are hardwood. The body of the pipe is usually hardwood, but can also be built of conifer or other woods, especially in large pipes.|$|E
50|$|The {{diameter}} of a cylindrical bore remains constant along its length. The acoustic behavior {{depends on whether}} the instrument is stopped (closed {{at one end and}} open at the other), or open (at both ends). For an open pipe, the wavelength produced by the first normal mode (the fundamental note) is approximately twice the length of the pipe. The wavelength produced by the second normal mode is half that, that is, the length of the pipe, so its pitch is an octave higher; thus an open cylindrical bore instrument overblows at the octave. This corresponds to the second harmonic, and generally the harmonic spectrum of an open cylindrical bore instrument is strong in both even and odd harmonics. For a <b>stopped</b> <b>pipe,</b> the wavelength produced by the first normal mode is approximately four times the length of the pipe. The wavelength produced by the second normal mode is one third that, i.e. the 4/3 length of the pipe, so its pitch is a twelfth higher; a stopped cylindrical bore instrument overblows at the twelfth. This corresponds to the third harmonic; generally the harmonic spectrum of a stopped cylindrical bore instrument, particularly in its bottom register, is strong in the odd harmonics only.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} {{description of}} the construction and acoustic properties of the sordoni will clear up the mystery. The body consisted of a cylinder of wood in which were cut two parallel channels of narrow cylindrical bore, communicating with {{each other at the}} bottom through a bend, but not with ambient air. At the top of the cylinder was fitted a double-reed mouthpiece giving access to the column of air {{at one end of the}} bore, while the other was vented through a small hole in the side, similar to the finger-holes; in the tenor, bass and contra members of the family, the reed was attached to a curved brass crook similar to that of the fagotto. So far the description would almost apply to the dolcian also, but in the latter there is the radical difference that the bore of the channels is conical, so that it has the acoustic properties of the open pipe. The sordun, however, having a cylindrical bore, has the acoustic properties of the <b>stopped</b> <b>pipe,</b> i.e. the sound waves are twice the length of the pipe, so that to produce a sound of any given pitch, for instance for C, the bore need only be half the length, i.e. 4 ft. long. Overblowing, on the sordoni, moreover, produced as first harmonic (the only one required for reed-blown instruments in order to produce the diatonic scale for the second octave) not the octave, but the twelfth, or number 3 of the series. This accounts for the fact that instruments of the fagotto and dolcian type require but six or seven holes to give the diatonic scale throughout the compass, whereas the sordoni require 11 or 12 holes. Praetorius states that those figured by him have 12 open holes, and that some specimens have in addition two keys; a hole is also bored through the bottom of the instrument to allow the moisture condensed from the breath to be shaken out. The 12 holes are stopped by means of fingers and thumbs and by the ball of the hand or the fleshy underpart of the joints of the fingers.|$|E

Runoff retardation lasted two hours after the rain began. Retention reached 98 % of the total rainfall. Runoff lasted for 85 hours...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study the acoustic behavior of chimney organ pipes. The working hypothesis is that its role is to reinforce the fifth harmonic of the tone of a <b>stopped</b> <b>pipe.</b> According to Helmholtz, the chimney should have the length of an open pipe resonating at {{the frequency of the}} fifth harmonic. This design appears to be the least favorable one, except if the chimney is placed half inside and half outside the main pipe, and should therefore be avoided. The ratio of the modulus of the admittance of the different harmonics appears to describe, for the chimney pipe used in this study, the dependency of the ratio of the measured amplitude of the fifth, third, and first harmonic with the geometry of the chimney. The admittance curve can therefore be used {{to determine the effects of}} the geometry of the chimney on the timbre of the organ pipe. This result is used in order to determine the optimal diameter of the chimney as a function of its length...|$|E
