40|$|We {{report a}} rare {{case of an}} 11 -month male infant with cranial {{migration}} of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt assembly. The shunt chamber was lying inside the ventricles. At the time of shunt revision, outsized burr hole and wide dural opening were observed. The ventricular migrated chamber of VP shunt was first retrieved from the ventricle followed by the removal of whole shunt assembly. A new VP shunt {{was placed on the}} other side with the chamber firmly anchored to the pericranium. The diagnosis was timely done and prevented complete shunt migration into the ventricles. We attribute factors such as outsized burr hole, wide dural opening, and poor anchoring of the <b>straight</b> <b>connector</b> of shunt chamber to periosteum because of poor tissue preservation (redo operation). Repeated flushing of the shunt chamber by cranial direction pressing on it by the mother might be a contributing factor for loosening of anchor sutures and cranial migration. Patients undergoing VP shunt procedure must be under regular follow-up for early recognition of this potential complication. Cranial migration of VP shunt is usually not a fatal complication...|$|E
50|$|Solder fittings, {{also known}} as {{capillary}} fittings, are short sections of smooth pipe designed to slide over {{the outside of the}} mating tube, are usually used for copper joints. Commonly used fittings include for <b>straight</b> <b>connectors,</b> reducers, bends, and tees. There are two types of solder fittings: end feed fittings which contain no solder, and solder ring fittings ({{also known as}} Yorkshire fittings), {{in which there is a}} ring of solder in a small circular recess inside the fitting.|$|R
40|$|In planar micropolar {{elasticity}} theory {{the degree}} of micropolarity exhibited by a loaded heterogeneous material is quantified by a dimensionless constitutive parameter, the coupling number. Theoretical predictions of this parameter derived by considering the mechanical behaviour of regular, two dimensional lattices with <b>straight</b> <b>connectors</b> suggest that its value {{is dependent on the}} connectivity or topology of the lattice with the coupling number in a square lattice predicted to be noticeably higher than in its hexagonal counterpart. A second constitutive parameter reflecting the intrinsic lattice size scale, the characteristic length, is also predicted to be topology dependent. In this paper we compare the behaviour of alternative two dimensional heterogeneous materials in the context of micropolar elasticity. These materials consist of periodic arrays of circular voids within a polymeric matrix rather than a lattice of <b>straight</b> <b>connectors.</b> Two material variants that differ only in their matrix topology are investigated in particular. Values of the additional micropolar constitutive parameters are obtained for each material from both experimental tests and finite element analyses. The values determined for these parameters, particularly the coupling number, suggest that their topological dependence differs appreciably from the theoretical predictions of the lattice models...|$|R
5000|$|Interface: Credo {{has both}} FW800 and USB3 interfaces. Aptus II has only FW800 interface. Aptus uses a {{proprietary}} L shaped FW connector, while Credo uses a <b>straight</b> regular <b>connector.</b> Thick head connectors will {{not fit into}} either backs. Credo uses standard USB3 type B connector and standard cables may be used. Officially only 3 meter USB3 cables are supported, but 5 and 7.5 meters were tested and worked with repeaters. FW cables in Credo and Aptus are supported up to 10 meters.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Brandeis Investment Co., {{the real estate}} {{division}} of the local Brandeis department store, obtained a 96-year lease on land at {{the northwest corner of}} 72nd and Dodge streets for a new shopping center. Construction started in September 1959, and the mall opened in September 1960 as [...] "Crossroads Shopping Center", a single-story <b>straight</b> shot <b>connector</b> between the two anchor stores: Sears at the west and Brandeis at the east. Both Sears and Brandeis were 3 stories: the first floor of each is actually the basement level of the mall, but had exterior access for the anchors; the second floor (originally called the [...] "Arcade Level") opens into the mall; there was no mall or exterior access to the third floor of either anchor store.|$|R
5000|$|The IBM DA15 PC game {{connector}} {{has been}} modified {{to add a}} (usually MPU-401 compatible) MIDI interface, and this is often implemented in the game connectors on third-party sound cards, for example the Sound Blaster line from Creative Labs. The [...] "standard" [...] <b>straight</b> game adapter <b>connector</b> (introduced by IBM) has three ground pins and four +5 V power pins, and the MIDI adaptation replaces one of the grounds {{and one of the}} +5 V pins, both on the bottom row of pins, with MIDI In and MIDI Out signal pins. (There is no MIDI Thru provided.) Creative Labs introduced this adaptation.|$|R
40|$|Project {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with}} the U. S. Department of Transportation Improved speed of construction and economy can be achieved through the use of precast bridge substructures. As a step in the advancement of precast bridge substructures, a precast bent cap system is developed for nonseismic regions, including a design methodology, construction guidelines, and example details for connecting a precast bent cap to cast-in-place columns or precast trestle piles. Three categories of connection details are developed: grout pockets, grouted vertical ducts, and bolted connections. Three phases of construction and testing of the three connection types are reported. The first phase examines behavior and failure modes for grout pocket and grouted vertical duct connections through thirty-two large-scale pullout tests. Results of four full-scale bent cap-to-column connection assemblages are presented for the second phase. In addition, results of construction and testing for two full-scale bents at the construction yard of a highway contractor are provided. Based on test results, equations for anchorage of <b>straight</b> or headed <b>connectors</b> in grout pocket or grouted vertical duct connections are established. Design recommendations are presented in code format, and construction guidelines are presented {{in the form of a}} precast connection specification. Example connection details that conform to the design requirements and the precast connection specification are shown for each connection type...|$|R
