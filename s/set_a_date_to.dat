500|$|The last {{section is}} a {{proposed}} [...] section from Lysaker to Skøyen; the latter not being modified {{as part of}} the extension, since it was upgraded in 1999. The government has not <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>to</b> start construction, but it will not be until at least 2020, since other projects will be prioritised over this section. No specific route has been finalised, and the project has been proposed to either run parallel to the current Drammen Line, or by placing all four tracks through a new tunnel. The former has been preferred by the Rail Administration, while the latter—which would cost NOK 1billion more—has been preferred by the municipality. There are no intermediate commuter stations between Skøyen and Lysaker, so there is little regularity or speed potential to gain from the construction, since the Oslo Tunnel from Skøyen to Oslo Central Station will still remain a bottleneck with only two tracks. Advocates have claimed that there is no gain from building this section without building two additional tracks {{all the way to the}} central station.|$|E

40|$|Family {{physicians}} {{are able to}} approach many patients who smoke but are often hesitant to help them quit. Lack of knowledge about effective interventions is {{a major reason for}} this hesitancy. The important components that have been tested in physician-initiated smoking cessation interventions are advice to quit, information about the risks of smoking and techniques for quitting, nicotine gum, <b>setting</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> for quitting and offers of supportive follow-up visits. We describe a cessation program developed for family physicians that incorporates these factors into three types of visits over a 2 -month period: the challenge visit, which occurs during a regular office visit and focuses on advice and <b>setting</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>to</b> quit; the quit-date visit, which involves instructing patients on the proper use of nicotine gum, if applicable, and confirming their desire to quit; and four supportive follow-up visits, which provide continuing encouragement for 2 months and allow physicians to monitor withdrawal symptoms, relapses and other problems. Such a program can be effectively incorporated into a general practice...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain information, using a written questionnaire, on the knowledge, smoking behaviour, and attitudes of Costa Rican {{physicians}} about smoking as a health issue. A random sample of 650 physicians was chosen from a list of active physicians; 287 of them were covered by survey between August 1993 and October 1994, and 217 (76 %) responded with data for the study. While 40 % of the physicians who participated were ex-smokers, 19 % were current smokers; 67 % of these two groups combined reported smoking in the workplace. Only 49 % believed that physicians could be a nonsmoking role model; the majority (87 %) had asked patients about their smoking status. The only cessation technique consistently used (90 %) was counselling about the dangers of smoking. Measures such as <b>setting</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>to</b> quit smoking and nicotine replacement were rarely recommended (< or = 2 %). Nearly all the physicians (99 %) considered smoking to be a major health issue. These results showed a high prevalence of smoking among Costa Rican physicians, with little recognition of the need for them to <b>set</b> <b>an</b> example as a role model. While they were knowledgeable about the health risks of smoking, they did not recommend any of the proven techniques to help their patients to quit smoking. A clear consensus for more strict tobacco regulation exists, but <b>to</b> <b>date</b> little has been done to act on this...|$|R

40|$|Due to low {{attendance}} and poor community support, {{the owner of}} the Westerville Jaycee (WJC) Swimming Pool considered permanently closing this facility two years ago. The goal of this project was to increase awareness for WJC and draw attention to the property itself. By setting objectives to improve the landscaping conditions, and creating a social media presence for WJC, we hoped to achieve these goals. To meet these objectives, the team created a WJC Twitter account, and asked that friends and family like and share their preexisting Facebook page. Our team also contacted several companies to inquire about landscaping donations. We were successful in <b>setting</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>to</b> mulch and plant flowers with The Grounds Guys of Westerville at WJC. An evaluation of our success was determined by an increase in Twitter followers, and also by management’s satisfaction with our work at the property. In regards to our evaluation standards, our results were successful. The legacy we hope to leave behind is a property that WJC can be proud of, as they are an important asset to the Westerville Community. We hope that our creation of a social media presence will help them reach out to new age groups. By the end of our project, WJC was able to strengthen its ties within the community, by forming a relationship The Grounds Guys of Westerville. Our recommendations for the continuation of this project would be to obtain a boulder that WJC can use as a landscaping piece for the front lawn...|$|R

50|$|Firemen {{spraying}} {{water into}} the pool only slows the evaporation, however a disused diesel generator is found and they plan to hook {{it up to the}} electric pumps. They order some diesel fuel for it but the truck driver panics at the idea of driving in the adverse weather. Jake, a former truck driver, intercepts the fleeing truck driver and delivers the diesel to the plant himself. At the plant the heat is starting to prove too much for the firemen and they start to pass out while the water from the hoses is having very little effect. It is mere minutes before the waste pool will be completely exposed. Jake helps the firefighters while Corrine hooks up the fuel and attempts to start the generator. With the generator running the pumps restart and the waste pool starts to refill, and the crisis is averted. The plant is damaged, but stable. Campbell and Corrine are finally reunited as Jake and Ashley <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>to</b> get married and Neville is led away, eventual fate uncertain although he likely dies of radiation poisoning as the characters said anyone who entered the reactor chamber would get a fatal dose.|$|E

Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's disappearance and death, the old woman who burned herself, and the constant din of bombers flying overhead and the imminent threat of war that goes ignored by the masses.
