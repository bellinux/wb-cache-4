5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is, {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation.|$|E
5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E

25|$|We {{must not}} {{confound}} chivalry with the feudal system. The feudal {{system may be}} called the real life of the period {{of which we are}} treating, possessing its advantages and inconveniences, its virtues and its vices. Chivalry, on the contrary, is the ideal world, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> existed in the imaginations of the Romance writers. Its essential character is devotion to woman and to honour.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the general}} celebration over {{the birth of}} the Dauphin, Marie Antoinette's {{political}} influence, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was, did greatly benefit Austria. During the Kettle War, in which her brother Joseph attempted to open the Scheldt River for naval passage, Marie Antoinette succeeded in obliging Vergennes to pay a huge financial compensation to Austria. Finally, the queen was able to obtain her brother's support against Great Britain in the American Revolution and she neutralized French hostility to his alliance with Russia.|$|E
25|$|On {{this point}} of view, paraphilias {{represent}} such as sexual behaviors due to a high impulsivity-compulsivity drive. It is difficult to distinguish impulsivity from compulsivity: sometimes paraphilic behaviors are prone to achieve pleasure (desire or fantasy), in some other cases these attitudes are merely expressions of anxiety, and the behavioral perversion {{is an attempt to}} reduce anxiety. In the last case, the pleasure gained is short in time and is followed by a new increase in anxiety levels, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can be seen in an obsessive patient after he performs his compulsion.|$|E

The festival, held at the New Taipei City Hall, featured the Islamic handicraft, cuisine and other cultural elements. New Taipei itself is home to around 30,000 Muslims, making it one of the biggest city in Taiwan in terms of Muslim population. The secretary-general of the Chinese Muslim Association added that Taiwan could benefit a lot by understanding Islam, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> will make things easier for Taiwan to do export and import trading with the growing Muslim countries, as well as attracting more visitors from various Islamic countries.|$|E

25|$|Bennett {{moved to}} Calgary in 1897. A lifelong {{bachelor}} and teetotaler (although Bennett was known by select associates to occasionally drink alcohol when {{the press was}} not around to observe this), he led a rather lonely life in a hotel and later, in a boarding house. For a while a younger brother roomed with him. He ate his noon meal on workdays at the Alberta Hotel. Social life, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was, centred on church. There was, however, no scandal attached to his personal life. Bennett worked hard and gradually built up his legal practice. In 1908 {{he was one of}} five people appointed to the first Library Board for the city of Calgary and was instrumental in establishing the Calgary Public Library.|$|E
25|$|The {{semifinal}} {{series was}} very {{typical of the}} way D.C United played throughout {{the second half of}} the season. The attack, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was, generated a handful of chances at best, and United became the first team in league history to fail to record a shot on goal as the home team in a playoff match. The passing accuracy was the 3rd worst for any MLS team in any game since 2010. The Red Bulls dominated possession and finally broke through in the second half as one-time United player Dax McCarty headed home the winner in a 1-0 defeat for United. The return match didn't go much better for United. Again, the Red Bulls dominated possession, but thanks to some big saves by Hamid, United still had a chance to try and knot the series as the game drifted into stoppage time. The Red Bulls, however, would finish off United's 2015 season, with a counter-attack goal in stoppage time, scored by Bradley Wright-Phillips, giving NYRB a 2-0 aggregate series win.|$|E
25|$|The British central government's {{policy of}} {{cultural}} suppression against Highland culture culminated in 1747 when the Act of Proscription, which forbade {{the wearing of}} kilts by civilian males, went into effect. The Act was repealed in 1782 {{and in the early}} 19th century, there was something of a romanticisation of Highland culture (or <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was imagined to be). This revival, later boosted greatly by Queen Victoria's enthusiasm for it, included the beginnings of the Highland games as we now know them. Highland dancing {{was an integral part of}} the Games from the very start of their modern revival, but the selection of dances performed at Games was intentionally narrowed down, mostly for the convenience of judges. Therefore, while the tradition of Highland games seemed at first glance to have fostered and preserved Highland dancing, many older dances got lost because nobody considered them worthwhile to practice, as they were not required for competition. The nature of these displays and competitions also affected the style of the dancing itself.|$|E

500|$|Eurogamer's Chris Schilling {{commented that}} {{although}} Ancient Trader {{was not as}} comprehensive and expansive as other Xbox Live titles <b>such</b> <b>as</b> , <b>it</b> deserved [...] "the opportunity {{to do business with}} the big boys rather than risk getting washed away with the shovelware tide". Schilling expressed concern that [...] "a game so elegant and accomplished should have to be dredged up from the depths of Indie Games". Lorenzo Fantoni from Eurogamer Italy awarded Ancient Trader the same score as Schilling, and explained that [...] "the final result is a quite simple title, which will last long enough to make you feel happy of having invested your money in this indie title".|$|E
500|$|DJ Shadow {{began his}} music career in 1989 as a disc jockey for the University of California, Davis campus radio station KDVS.

His KDVS work impressed A representative Dave [...] "Funken" [...] Klein, leading him to sign DJ Shadow to the Hollywood BASIC label to produce music and remixes. DJ Shadow's output during this period – including the 17-minute-long [...] "Entropy" [...] and his work with the Solesides crew – {{brought him to the}} attention of British musician James Lavelle, who then signed DJ Shadow to his Mo' Wax label.|$|E

[...] Writer Kent Osborne said of Fagerbakke, [...] "He is this big guy, and he plays Patrick so well. He's just this big guy, and he lumbers around." [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "I'm clumsy. I'm goofy. I make mistakes all the time" [...] and agreed that [...] "I guess I'm a lot of Patrick." ...|$|E
