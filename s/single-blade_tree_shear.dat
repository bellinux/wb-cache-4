50|$|Other {{machines}} were also introduced during this period. The first feller buncher {{was used by}} the Quebec North Shore Paper Company in 1957. Hydraulic <b>tree</b> <b>shears</b> were first used in 1966 by the Abitibi Pulp and Paper Company Limited (Abitibi-Consolidated). Snowmobiles and tracked machines replaced animals for the hauling of logs. In 1948 several Bombardier {{machines were}} employed to this end by the Ste. Anne Power Company Limited in Quebec. In 1959 Timberland Machines of Woodstock, Ontario developed the Timberbuncher, a self-propelled machine which could move through the forest, cut a whole tree at its base (a process known as full tree harvesting) and, using a hydraulic arm, place it into a pile for hauling. Machines that stripped the branches from felled trees, a process known as delimbing, were also introduced at this time.|$|R

40|$|Cross {{laminated}} timber (CLT) is a versatile engineered timber {{product that is}} increasingly well-known and of global interest in several applications such as full size plane or linear timber elements. The {{aim of this study}} involves investigating the performance of CLT beams loaded in-plane by considering bending and shear stress analysis with a special emphasis on the in-plane shear behavior including the complex internal structure of CLT. Numerical analysis based on 3 D-FE models was used and compared with two existing analytical approaches, namely representative volume sub element (method I) and composite beam theory (method II). The separate verification of bending and <b>shear</b> stresses including <b>tree</b> different <b>shear</b> failure modes was performed, and a good agreement was obtained. The main difference between the results relates to shear failure mode in the crossing areas between the orthogonally bonded lamellas in which the distribution of shear stresses τzx over the crossing areas per height of the CLT beam is not in accordance with the analytical assumptions. The presented analyses constitute the first attempt to contribute to the on-going review process of Eurocode 5 with respect to CLT beams loaded-in plane. Currently, regulations on designing these types of beams do not exist, and thus experimental and numerical investigations are planned in the future...|$|R
50|$|The tornado {{then moved}} into Woodford County, where it {{maintained}} its size but slightly weakened to EF3 intensity {{as it passed}} near the towns of Roanoke, Benson, and Minonk. Despite tracking mostly across open fields, 70 farm buildings and seven homes were destroyed, with major damage sustained to 17 more. One unanchored farmhouse near Benson was swept away at EF3 intensity, and a car {{parked in the driveway}} was thrown into the basement. Roughly 100 vehicles were damaged, including several semis at a truck stop located north of Minonk, where three people were injured. Hundreds of power lines and trees were snapped, and a cell tower collapsed. Damage in Woodford County totaled $25 million. The EF3 tornado weakened further to EF2 status as it briefly tracked over La Salle County, where damage totaled $150,000. Numerous power poles were snapped in this area, and two homes sustained significant damage. Various small outbuildings and a machine shed were also destroyed. Similar damage occurred in Livingston County, where in addition to outbuilding and power pole damage, an extensive swath of <b>trees</b> was <b>sheared</b> off, and a fire engine that was being stored in a garage was blown over as the structure was destroyed. The tornado finally dissipated 2 mi east-northeast of Long Point at 17:47 UTC, after remaining on the ground for 48 minutes.

500|$|Along {{the coast}} about midway between Tampa and Cedar Key, eight {{people on a}} {{sailboat}} died when their vessel was driven aground. In Tampa, the storm flooded low-lying areas, wrecked a bridge over Spanishtown Creek, and crumbled sea walls. As the hurricane proceeded inland, it devastated interior parts of the state. Reports from the hardest-hit localities were slow to reach the outside world because of extensive damage to communications infrastructure, as well as obstructed or washed out railroads. Initial reports indicated that at least 20 communities were [...] "wrecked" [...] by the hurricane. In these areas, almost all stores and houses were demolished, particularly in western Alachua and eastern Lafayette counties. Debris was often carried for miles. Farmers lost livestock, crops, and provisions needed for the winter, and hundreds of families were left homeless {{with little or no}} food. Along the Suwannee River, storm victims sought refuge in a makeshift shelter constructed from stray timbers. Extreme winds razed entire pine forests across numerous counties, initially uprooting weaker <b>trees</b> before <b>shearing</b> the rest off at their trunks {{during the height of the}} storm. By one estimate, the hurricane wiped out [...] of timber across the state. This transformed the landscape and gave it a [...] "prairie-like appearance". The turpentine industry was decimated, as the value of the lost pine timber was estimated at $1.5 million. Additionally, stills used to process turpentine were mangled. Consequently, some 2,500 turpentine workers were left unemployed. Phosphate processing plants east of the Suwanee River also sustained $500,000 in damage.|$|R
40|$|This manual {{summarizes}} the roadside tree and brush control methods used {{by all of}} Iowa's 99 counties. It is based on interviews conducted in Spring 2002 with county engineers, roadside managers and others. The target audience of this manual is the novice county engineer or roadside manager. Iowa law is nearly silent on roadside tree and brush control, so individual counties have been left {{to decide on the}} level of control they want to achieve and maintain. Different solutions have been developed but the goal of every county remains the same: to provide safe roads for the traveling public. Counties in eastern and southern Iowa appear to face the greatest brush control challenge. Most control efforts can be divided into two categories: mechanical and chemical. Mechanical control includes cutting tools and supporting equipment. A chain saw is the most widely used cutting tool. Tractor mounted boom mowers and brush cutters are used to prune miles of brush but have significant safety and aesthetic limitations and boom mowers are easily broken by inexperienced operators. The advent of <b>tree</b> <b>shears</b> and hydraulic thumbs offer unprecedented versatility. Bulldozers are often considered a method of last resort since they reduce large areas to bare ground. Any chipper that violently grabs brush should not be used. Chemical control is the application of herbicide to different parts of a plant: foliar spray is applied to leaves; basal bark spray is applied to the tree trunk; a cut stump treatment is applied to the cambium ring of a cut surface. There is reluctance by many to apply herbicide into the air due to drift concerns. One-third of Iowa counties do not use foliar spray. By contrast, several accepted control methods are directed toward the ground. Freshly cut stumps should be treated to prevent resprouting. Basal bark spray is highly effective in sensitive areas such as near houses. Interest in chemical control is slowly increasing as herbicides and application methods are refined. Fall burning, a third, distinctly separate technique is underused as a brush control method and can be effective if timed correctly. In all, control methods tend to reflect agricultural patterns in a county. The use of chain saws and foliar sprays tends to increase in counties where row crops predominate, and boom mowing tends to increase in counties where grassland predominates. For counties with light to moderate roadside brush, rotational maintenance is the key to effective control. The most comprehensive approach to control is to implement an integrated roadside vegetation management (IRVM) program. An IRVM program is usually directed by a Roadside Manager whose duties may be shared with another position. Funding for control programs comes from the Rural Services Basic portion of a county's budget. The average annual county brush control budget is about 76, 000. That figure is thought not to include shared expenses such as fuel and buildings. Start up costs for an IRVM program are less if an existing control program is converted. In addition, IRVM budgets from three different northeastern Iowa counties are offered for comparison in this manual. The manual also includes a chapter on temporary traffic control in rural work zones, a summary of the Iowa Code as it relates to brush control, and rules on avoiding seasonal disturbance of the endangered Indiana bat. Appendices summarize survey and forest cover data, an equipment inventory, sample forms for record keeping, a sample brush control policy, a few legal opinions, a literature search, and a glossary...|$|R
40|$|Bioengineering {{aspects of}} native {{vegetation}} {{are currently being}} evolved to improve soil stiffness, slope stabalisation, and erosion control. Tree roots provide three stabalising function: (a) reinforcement of the soil, (b) dissipation of excess pore pressures and (c) establishing sufficient matric suction to increase the shear strength. The effects of vegetation on soil matric suction, shrinkage and ground settlement are discussed in this paper. A mathematical model for the rate of root water uptake that considers ground conditions, type of vegetation and climatic parameters has been developed. A conical shape is considered to represent the geometry of the tree root zone. Based on this proposed model, {{the distribution of the}} moisture and the matric suction profile adjacent to the tree are numerically analysed. Field measurements taken from literature published previously are compared with the authors 2 ̆ 7 numerical model. The predicted results, calculated based on soil, plant, and atmospheric parameters contained in the numerical model, compared favourably with the measured results, justifying the assumptions upon which the model has been developed. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} due to significant changes in soil moisture content induced by <b>tree</b> roots, the <b>shear</b> strength of the soil will be enhanced.

40|$|The eastern forefield of Bering Glacier {{encompasses}} a lake and island complex overridden by glacier surge advances in 1965 - 1967 and 1993 - 1995. Multiple "fossil" tree horizons (still in growth position) {{have been identified}} within outwash deposits in proglacial stratigraphic sections. Those at the near surface demonstrate deformation and shearing indirectly linked to the stresses applied by overriding glacier advance. This project aims to assess the suitability of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) {{as a tool for}} detecting continuous till and diamicton surfaces associated with the deformation layer, as well as to identify <b>sheared</b> and deformed <b>trees.</b> In 2006, a grid of six 100 m common offset GPR lines were collected on Bentwood Island using a PulseEKKO Pro 1100 system at a nominal frequency of 200 MHz. A maximum penetration depth of approximately 11 m within materials composed of diamicton, sand, gravel and some silts and clays, has been achieved. Two sub horizontal reflections have been identified at depth that can be traced across the grid. These are interpreted to represent the upper and lower boundaries of sand and gravel units, which are bounded by till and peat at the upper and lower contact, respectively. Between the prominent reflections, a number of stacked hyperbolae or point source reflections can be identified, indicating the presence of <b>sheared</b> <b>trees,</b> which are still upright within the substrate.

40|$|Current pear pruning {{making use}} of {{pneumatic}} shears still is a very labour intensive operation. The Proder project “Avaliação da poda mecânica em pomares de pera” was designed to contribute to solutions that would reduce the present dependence in labour and therefore to promote a reduction in pruning costs. This paper shows {{the results of a}} trial made to evaluate the influence of mechanical topping in manual pruning complement field work and pear yield. Topping was performed using a Reynolds 6 DT 3. 0 m cutting bar with six hydraulic-driven circular disc-saws mounted in the three point tractor linkage system. The field trial was performed in a commercial orchard with 20 years, planted in an array of 4 m x 2 m with tree lines oriented in North-South direction. Trees were trained as the central leader system. In this trial, in a randomised complete block design with four replications, two treatments are being compared leading to 8 plots with one line of 14 trees per plot. The treatments tests were: T 1 - manual pruning performed by workers using pneumatic shears, in each year; T 2 - Topping the canopy parallel to the ground, using a discs-saw pruning machine mounted in a front loader of an agricultural tractor, followed by manual pruning complement performed by workers with pneumatic <b>shears.</b> <b>Tree</b> height and width was measured, before and after pruning. Work was timed and pear yields evaluated. Mechanical topping seems to be effective in the control of tree height, which can contribute to increase 14 % of work rates on manual pruning complement.

40|$|Field studies {{conducted}} along the railway lines in Australia have revealed {{the ability to}} implement the green corridor concept as a soil stabilization method. Native trees grown along rail corridors are capable of increasing the matric suction of the subgrade soil underneath the track substructure via root water uptake, {{in conjunction with the}} tree canopy evapo-transpiration. Moreover, these trees are capable of providing significant mechanical reinforcement through the anchoring effect provided by the root network plus the additional cohesive increment due to hair roots generating osmotic suction. Much of the previous research carried out to quantify the mechanical strength generated by tree roots has been mainly based on empiricism. In many cases, empirical relations have been developed for a given tree species grown under known soil conditions. The extrapolation of such empirical relations from one tree-soil system to another can be misleading. Furthermore, the effect of transpiration by tree canopy and its influence on the sustained suction equilibrium generated at the root zone for stabilising soft subgrade has not been considered rationally. To accommodate the above natural phenomena, a novel computational model has been developed to quantify the overall suction effect provided by the tree roots and its continual link with the rate and magnitude of canopy evapo-transpiration. Root based suction of a <b>tree</b> improves the <b>shear</b> strength; accelerates the pore water pressure dissipation and it may alter the potential failure conditions of the soil-root system from a saturated to an unsaturated domain. Therefore, it is necessary for the root based suction and the mechanical properties of the root network to be analysed within a coupled multiphase framework. Accordingly, this paper will present the requirement of an advanced shear strength model that captures and combines the root reinforcement effect with both osmotic and matric suction components generated in the soil through naturally coupled osmotic evapo-transpiration phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The first clear {{indication}} that unnaturally dense forest conditions existed in ponderosa pine – Douglas-fir {{forests of the}} Colorado Front Range was the Buffalo Creek Fire, a large, catastrophic wildfire that burned in 1996. Ongoing research in the Front Range indicated that the Buffalo Creek Fire likely would have burned very differently under pre-settlement forest conditions; early photographs and written descriptions, as well as fire history and stand reconstruction data, all suggested that historically these forests were characterized by a matrix of low-density forests and shrubland or grassland openings that was created and maintained by a mixed-severity fire regime. As {{a result of the}} Buffalo Creek Fire and several other large and intense wildfires in the Colorado Front Range – Bobcat Gulch and Hi Meadows in 2000, and Schoonover, Snaking, and Hayman in 2002 – managers began to plan forest restoration treatments {{to reduce the risk of}} unnaturally large, stand-replacing fires, and to return ecological sustainability to the landscape through research-guided restoration actions. Managers and others are obviously concerned about how both forest restoration treatments and intense wildfires impact the forest overstory, and these impacts are widely studied. Less studied, though, are how these disturbances impact the forest floor – in terms of both understory species composition and surface fuels that would carry a future fire. As wildfires continue to occur in the Front Range, and as forest restoration treatments continue to expand to much larger land areas, it is becoming critical for forest managers to understand how both restoration actions and wildfire influence forest understories and fuel loadings. Our objective for this project was to conduct a holistic ecosystem evaluation of the changes in forest understory communities, fuel characteristics, and potential fire behavior that result from restoration activities and wildfires. To address this objective, we established one study area within a recently treated forest, one study area within a forest recently burned by wildfire, and three study areas within untreated, unburned reference forests. All study areas were located within the Upper South Platte Watershed of the Pike National Forest, Colorado, USA, approximately 60 km southwest of Denver. Our treated study area was located in an area that was mechanically thinned in late 2002 and early 2003. The primary management objective was to reduce the risk of crown fires and to restore sustainable and ecologically appropriate overstory conditions by decreasing stand density, minimizing fuel ladders, and increasing canopy openings. Small canopy <b>trees</b> were <b>sheared</b> near ground-level using a boom-mounted hot saw on a tracked vehicle. Downed tree tops and limbs were crushed and further broken apart by driving over them with the tracked vehicle. In early 2003, where terrain and financial resources permitted, hand crews used chain saws to create additional openings and further reduce basal areas. The hand-cut trees were subsequently cut-to-length, piled, and burned. Our wildfire study area was located within the Hayman Fire, which burned 55, 800 ha in 2002. Approximately half of the Hayman Fire area burned as a stand-replacing crown fire, much of it in a single day of extreme weather. The other half of the area burned as a mixed-severity fire, creating a mosaic of burn severities on the landscape. Our study area was situated in a transitional zone between these two fire behaviors, and therefore contained components of each. Three reference study areas were established near the treated and wildfire study areas to provide information about the untreated and unburned condition. The reference sites had not been disturbed by fire or other agents in the preceding five years. Each study area contained fifteen 0. 1 -ha plots, which were stratified by aspect (north, south, and east/west) to minimize the potential effects of topography on our findings. In each plot we measured understory species composition and cover, surface fuel loading, and overstory structure. Understory data were measured in all plots in 2004, 2005, and 2006, while surface fuels and overstory data were generally only measured in one of the three years. Prefire understory, surface fuel, and overstory data collected in 1997 were also available for the Hayman Fire plots...|$|R
