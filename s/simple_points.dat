5000|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry, a geometrically regular ring is a Noetherian ring over a {{field that}} remains a regular ring after any finite extension of the base field. Geometrically regular schemes are defined in a similar way.

40|$|Abstract—Simple point {{detection}} is {{an important}} task for several problems in discrete geometry, such as topology preserving thinning in image processing to compute discrete skeletons. In this paper, the approach to <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> detection is based on techniques from cubical homology, a framework ideally suited for problems in image processing. A (-dimensional) unitary cube (for a-dimensional digital image) is associated with every discrete picture element, instead of a point in (the-dimensional Euclidean space) as has been done previously. A <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> in this setting then refers to the removal of a unitary cube without changing the topology of the cubical complex induced by the digital image. The main result is a characterization of a <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> (i. e., <b>simple</b> unitary cube) {{in terms of the}} homology groups of the @Q IA neighborhood of for arbitrary, finite dimensions Index Terms—Cubical homology, digital geometry, <b>simple</b> <b>point,</b> skeleton...|$|R

Furthermore, through the notion of P^x-simple point, we give a methodology which permits to produce an algorithm A' (described by a one-step procedure) from an existent one A, which is "faster" than A, {{in the sense that it}} usually 'deletes more points than A''...|$|E

40|$|<b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> were {{proposed}} as a lightweight alternative to standard Function Points. The {{idea at the}} base of the definition of <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> is that it is possible to get equally effective size measures even without considering fine-grained details of functional specifications. Skipping the analysis and measurement of such details should allow for saving time and effort when measuring the functional size of software. In a previous study, the <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Point</b> method was employed to size software applications included in the ISBSG repository, thus employing data from different companies. In this paper, we aim at getting further evidence of the qualities of <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> via the empirical study of 25 Web applications developed by a single software company. The study highlights the correlation between <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> and standard Function Points measures and the existence of a significant model that guarantees the convertibility between <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> and standard Function Points. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the two measures provide predictions of the effort to develop Web applications that are equally accurate. Thus, our results confirm the empirical evidence provided by the original investigation, highlighting that <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> appear essentially equivalent to Function Points, except that they require a much simpler measurement process...|$|R

40|$|A plane {{algebraic}} {{curve is}} given as the zeros of a bivariate polynomial. However, this implicit representation is badly suited for many applications, {{for instance in}} computer aided geometric design. What we want {{in many of these}} applications is a rational parametrization of an algebraic curve. There are several approaches to deciding whether an algebraic curve is parametrizable and if so computing a parametrization. In all these approaches we ultimately need some <b>simple</b> <b>points</b> on the curve. The field in which we can find such points crucially influences the coefficients in the resulting parametrization. We show how to find such <b>simple</b> <b>points</b> over some practically interesting fields.
