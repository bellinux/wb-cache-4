40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{influence}} of recently-arrived big-box retail stores on the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> residential populations. It aims to further the understanding of challenges posed by big-box retailers to surrounding communities – beyond the narrow economic focus previously dominating the literature. A range of human geographical theories are used to investigate <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> Tempe residents, and whether the 2011 opening of IKEA Tempe has influenced these senses. A mixed-methodology comprising interviews – both sedentary and mobile – and mental mapping was used to capture responses from residents. This method collected spatial and biographical data. Results offer new insights into {{the influence of}} big-box industry on <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> First, <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> were found to be informed by resident’s shared experiences of three phenomena: gentrification-related community transition, post-industrial economic shifts, and place attachment. Despite such shared phenomena, <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> were complex, plural, and often conflicting at the individual level. Second, IKEA’s influence on <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> was overall subtle, though not without complexity. On the one hand, IKEA did not upset local residents or dramatically unsettle their <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> In some cases, IKEA was viewed through a middle-class lens as putting Tempe "on the map " and redressing the suburb’s stigmas as a downtrodden, dirty place. On the other hand, material attachments to the place – an...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the nature of indigenous people's connection to the land, and the implications of this for articulating these connections in legal arenas where questions of Aboriginal title and land claims are at issue. The idea of 'place' is developed, based in a phenomenology of dwelling which takes profound attachments to home places as shaping and being shaped by ontological orientation and social organization. In this theory of the 'senses of place', the author emphasizes the relationships between meaning and power experienced and embodied in place, and the social systems of property and territory that forms indigenous land tenure systems. To explore this theoretical notion <b>of</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> the study develops a detailed ethnography of a Coast Salish Aboriginal community on southeast Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Through this ethnography of dwelling, the ways in which places become richly imbued with meanings and how they shape social organization and generate social action are examined. Narratives with Coast Salish community members, set in a broad context of discussing land claims, provide context for understanding <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> imbued with ancestors, myth, spirit, power, language, history, property, territory and boundaries. The author concludes in arguing that by attending to a theorized understanding <b>of</b> highly local <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> nuanced conceptions <b>of</b> indigenous relationships to land which appreciate indigenous relations to land in their own terms can be articulated...|$|R

25|$|Starting {{off as a}} {{literary}} club in Adelaide, South Australia in 1938, the Jindyworobak movement was supported by many Australian artists, poets, and writers. Many were fascinated by Indigenous Australian culture and the Outback, and desired to improve the white Australian's {{understanding and appreciation of}} them. Other features came into play, among them white Australia's increasing alienation from its European origins; the Depression of the 1930s which recalled the economic troubles {{of the end of the}} 19th century; an increasingly urban or suburban Australian population alienated from the wild Australia of the Outback etc.; the First World War and the coming of World War II and also the coming of early mass market media in the form of the radio, recordings, newspapers and magazines. <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> was particularly important to the Jindyworobak movement.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{intends to}} examine the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>place</b> phenomenon, which {{can be defined as}} a result of {{constant}} interaction between psychophysiological mechanisms of human-beings and physical properties of tangible environment. Shamai's (1991) approach to <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>place</b> will be employed in this research. According to his suggested scale, level <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>place</b> varies from "not having any <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a place" to "sacrifice for a place" (Shamai, 1991). The generic hypothesis of this research is that there are certain factors (historical, social, cultural, physical or temporal) which determine particular level <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>place.</b> The case study of Galata neighbourhood will be carried out in order to gain better understanding <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>place</b> phenomenon and to define the significance of its decisive factors. Galata is a very special historical neighbourhood of Istanbul. It was established as a western,Latin and Catholic colony. Later on, it became a residential area for Greeks and Jews. Thus, this area was a non-Muslim area for quite a long time. Turkish people started to move in here more abundantly only since the middle of the twentieth century. Despite that, Galata neighbourhood has kept its international character even till now. Today Galata is famous worldwide for the richness of architectural, cultural and religious heritage and it attracts millions of tourist every year. Therefore, it is even more interesting to understand how locals feel this place and what factors strengthen their place attachment...|$|R

In addition to the geographical component of Southern literature, certain themes have appeared because of the similar histories of the Southern states in regard to slavery, the American Civil War, and Reconstruction. The conservative culture in the South has also produced a strong focus by novelists from there on the significance of family, religion, community, {{the use of the}} Southern dialect, along with a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> The South's troubled history with racial issues has also continually concerned its novelists.|$|E
