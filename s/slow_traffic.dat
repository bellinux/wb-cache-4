25|$|A {{speed hump}} (also called a road hump, or undulation, and speed ramp) is a rounded traffic calming device {{used to reduce}} vehicle speed and volume on {{residential}} streets. Humps are placed across the road to <b>slow</b> <b>traffic</b> and are often installed {{in a series of}} several humps to prevent cars from speeding before and after the hump. Common speed hump shapes are parabolic, circular, and sinusoidal.|$|E
25|$|The traffic {{forecast}} for the Federal Transport Route Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan) 1992 provided for 24 passenger and 90 freight trains {{each day and}} each way on the new line in 2010. In the middle of 1994, Deutsche Bahn considered {{that there would be}} 24long-distance passenger trains and 55freight trains on the line. The segregation of fast and <b>slow</b> <b>traffic</b> (under the Netz 21 project adopted in 1991) had not yet been considered.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, {{the city}} {{commission}} approved the new Miami 21 zoning policy {{that was considered}} a landmark example of New Urbanism, winning then-Mayor Miami Diaz the 2009 American Architectural Foundation's Keystone Award for taking on Miami 21. As the population grows in the region, especially in the greater downtown Miami area, graded and textured crosswalks are added to <b>slow</b> <b>traffic</b> along busy streets such as Brickell Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard (US 1). New crosswalks installed in the Upper Eastside along Biscayne Boulevard in late 2011 will also be outlined with flashing lights, as well as having islands {{in the center of}} the road and large speed feedback signs to warn automotive traffic. Plans have been floated to close the already walkable Flagler Street in Downtown Miami to traffic altogether or for festivals.|$|E
25|$|As of June 2006, fares {{begin at}} $2.50 ($3.00 after 8:00p.m., and $3.50 {{during the peak}} weekday hours of 4:00–8:00p.m.) and {{increase}} based on the distance traveled and time spent in <b>slow</b> <b>traffic</b> (40 cents for each one-fifth of a mile or 60 seconds of no motion or motion under 12 miles an hour). The passenger also has to pay the toll whenever a cab is driven through a toll booth. The taxi must have an E-ZPass tag, and passengers pay the discounted E-ZPass toll rates. According to an April 2011 study by the Chicago Dispatcher, New York City taxis have a relatively low standard fare, charging an estimated $14.10 for a distance of five miles and five minutes wait time (compared to an estimated $18.48 in West Hollywood, CA and $12.87 in Houston, TX). Taxi drivers {{are not permitted to}} use cell phones while transporting passengers, even if they use a hands-free headset.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Hazard Construction Company added {{a single}} {{westbound}} lane on SR52 from SR163 to I-805, {{a distance of}} , {{at a cost of}} $1.7million (about $ in [...] dollars). In 2006, the Metropolitan Transit System, in cooperation with the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), Caltrans, and the California Highway Patrol, began a pilot program to run transit buses along the shoulders of SR52 between Kearny Villa Road and I-805. During rush hour, buses were able to use these shoulders to bypass <b>slow</b> <b>traffic</b> in the main lanes. The trial was considered successful as more than 99percent of trips arrived on time, customer feedback was favorable and no safety concerns were encountered. On May9, 2007, the San Diego Union-Tribune published a story which raised reader concerns about a dangerous dip in the freeway. The dip had developed in a section of the highway constructed on top of the Miramar Landfill, and had been caused by trash settling; it was repaired by the next day.|$|E

2500|$|... fares {{begin at}} $2.50 ($3.00 between 8:00p.m. and 6:00 am, and $3.50 {{during the peak}} weekday hours of 4:00–8:00p.m.) and {{increase}} based on the distance traveled and time spent in <b>slow</b> <b>traffic</b> (50 cents for each one-fifth of a mile or each 50 seconds stopped or traveling under 12 miles an hour). An additional 50¢ tax is added to all trips within New York City. For trips to Nassau and Westchester counties, fare is the metered rate {{from the point of}} origin to the city limit, then twice the metered rate from the city limit to the destination. All trips between Manhattan and John F. Kennedy International Airport are charged a flat rate of $52. [...] All trips to Newark Airport are charged the metered rate plus $17.50. The passenger also has to pay for any portion of the trip where the cab is driven on a toll road. The taxi must have an E-ZPass tag, and passengers pay the discounted E-ZPass toll rates.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, most police cars are also fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an emergency vehicle before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the car. A later development was the rotating air siren, which made noise when air moved past it. Most modern vehicles are now fitted with electronic sirens, which can produce a range of different noises. Police driving training often includes the use of different noises depending on traffic conditions and maneuver being performed. In North America for instance, on a clear road, approaching a junction, the [...] "wail" [...] setting may be used, which gives a long up and down variation, with an unbroken tone, whereas, in heavy <b>slow</b> <b>traffic,</b> a [...] "yelp" [...] setting may be preferred, which is a sped up version of the [...] "wail". Some vehicles may also be fitted with airhorn audible warnings. Also in some European countries, where a hi-lo two tone siren is the only permitted siren for emergency vehicles, a [...] "stadt" [...] siren will be used in cities where it has loud echo that can be heard from blocks away to warn the traffic an emergency vehicle is coming, or a [...] "land" [...] siren will be used on highways to project its noise to the front to produce more penetration into the vehicles ahead to alert the drivers.|$|E

50|$|Climbing lanes are a roadway lane design {{typically}} used on Interstate highways. They allow slower travel for large vehicles, such as large trucks or Semi-trailer trucks, ascending a steep grade. Since climbing uphill {{is difficult for}} these vehicles, they can travel in the climbing lane without <b>slowing</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Shinkansen is very {{reliable}} {{thanks to}} several factors, including its near-total separation from <b>slower</b> <b>traffic.</b> In 2014, JR Central {{reported that the}} Shinkansen's average delay from schedule per train was 54 seconds. This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes, such as natural disasters. The record, in 1997, was 18 seconds.|$|R
50|$|In some areas, {{such as the}} US {{states of}} Colorado and Kentucky, {{vehicles}} in the left lane are required to yield to faster traffic only if the speed limit is above 65 miles per hour.

40|$|Abstract only availableResident {{membrane}} proteins of {{the yeast}} trans-Golgi network (TGN) frequently cycle between the TGN {{and both the}} early and late (prevacuolar) endosomal compartments. The model yeast TGN protein, A-ALP, which contains the cytosolic domain of the TGN protein, depeptidyl aminopeptidase A (DPAP A), and the transmembrane and lumenal domains of the vacuolar membrane protein, alkaline phosphatase, have been studied. The cytosolic domain of A-ALP {{has been shown to}} be phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro. Of the 25 potentially phosphorylatable residues, only one, Ser 13, was observed to influence trafficking between the TGN and endosomes. It has been suggested that phosphorylation of Ser 13 is required for trafficking of A-ALP from the TGN to the pre-vacuolar compartment, which implies that phosphorylation of Ser 13 may act as a switch for association of A-ALP with vesicular trafficking machinery. It is also important to note that once A-ALP reaches the vacuole by way of the PVC, it is cleaved in the lumenal domain, which allows us to follow the trafficking of the protein. We designed a screen to overexpress negative regulators, such as phosphatase, so that A-ALP will exhibit <b>slower</b> <b>trafficking</b> to the pre-vacuolar compartment. Yeast that seemed to have <b>slower</b> A-ALP <b>trafficking</b> to the PVC were identified by an ALP Overlay Assay. These positives are now being screened by western blot in order to verify that these cells exhibit <b>slower</b> <b>trafficking</b> to the PVC and eventually the vacuole. This can be determined by a western blot by examining the amount of processing of A-ALP in the vacuole. Those that are processed less give the indication of <b>slower</b> <b>trafficking</b> to the PVC, which is possibly the result of high phosphatase activity.
