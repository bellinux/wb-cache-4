5|$|Bush {{took office}} {{during a period}} of {{economic}} recession {{in the wake of the}} bursting of the dot-com bubble. The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. His administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60percent) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14percent, corporate tax revenues by 50percent, customs and duties by 40percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62percent, Medicare spending by 131percent, social <b>security</b> <b>by</b> 51percent, and income security spending by 130percent.

5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort.

5|$|On 14 April 2005 the Singapore Police Force {{announced}} plans to step up rail <b>security</b> <b>by</b> establishing a specialised security unit for public transport, the unit today {{is known as the}} Public Transport Security Command or more commonly known as TRANSCOM. These armed officers began overt patrols on the MRT and LRT systems on 15 August 2005, conducting random patrols in pairs in and around rail stations and within trains. They are trained and authorised to use their firearms at their discretion, including deadly force if deemed necessary. On 8 January 2006, a major civil exercise involving over 2,000 personnel from 22 government agencies, codenamed Exercise Northstar V, simulating bombing and chemical attacks at Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh, Raffles Place and Marina Bay MRT stations was conducted. Thirteen stations were closed and about 3,400 commuters were affected during the three-hour exercise.|$|E
5|$|Paul was {{assigned}} {{to be on the}} Energy and Natural Resources, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and Small Business committees. Paul also formed the Senate Tea Party Caucus with Jim DeMint and Mike Lee as its inaugural members. His first legislative proposal was to cut $500billion from federal spending in one year. This proposal included cutting the Department of Education by 83percent and the United States Department of Homeland <b>Security</b> <b>by</b> 43percent, as well as folding the Department of Energy into the Department of Defense and eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Seven independent agencies would be eliminated and food stamps would be cut by 30percent. Under Paul's proposal, defense spending would be reduced by 6.5percent and international aid would be eliminated. He later proposed a five-year budget plan intended to balance the budget.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesian troops during World War I {{were all}} volunteers. Particularly during the war's early stages, not all male {{settlers}} of fighting age {{were expected to}} abandon their civilian lives for service abroad. Many {{of them were in}} vital industries like mining, and the Company administration did not grant financial allowances to support the families of married soldiers, so at least at first, only bachelors in non-essential positions were generally considered to have any moral obligation to sign up. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment, raised in early 1915, explicitly barred married men from its ranks to preempt the tribulations that might befall their families while they were gone. Men of service age who remained at home were pressured by the national and local press to contribute to local <b>security</b> <b>by</b> joining the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers or the Rhodesian Reserves; editorials told readers that men who failed to do so were not fulfilling their patriotic duty, and warned that conscription might be required if not enough joined up.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the cold winter were {{exacerbated}} by problems in the energy sector which caused coal supplies to become low. The coal and electricity industries had been recently nationalised by Clement Attlee's government and placed {{under the control of}} the Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell. Shinwell oversaw efforts to increase production, but there were concerns that the coal supply was inadequate. At the start of the winter the coal stockpiles contained enough coal to last for just four weeks, compared to the usual supplies of ten to twelve weeks which existed before the war. However, Shinwell allowed himself to be lulled into a false sense of <b>security</b> <b>by</b> over-optimistic productivity reports from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). These reports failed to translate into real production as the government feared to take on the NUM, whose members' absentee rates were 2.5 times those of the pre-war period. The risk of a coal shortage caused the public to buy electric fires to ensure a source of heat for their homes. This, in turn, put a greater strain on the supply of electricity– the monthly demand increase caused by electric fires in 1946 was roughly the same as the annual increase in generating capacity. Shinwell was warned in mid-October that a coal shortage was possible, but gambled on a mild winter to keep consumption low so that he would not have to risk a confrontation with the miners.|$|E
5|$|Warshaw {{and other}} Atari {{executives}} presented this design to Spielberg, {{who did not}} express enthusiasm. Spielberg instead asked him to create a game similar to Namco's Pac-Man. Believing the concept too derivative of a common game design, Warshaw proceeded with his concept, which he believed would capture the sentimentality {{he saw in the}} original film. In retrospect, however, Warshaw stated that Spielberg's idea might have had merit. He spent the remaining time programming the game. Atari anticipated enormous sales based on the popularity of the film, as well as the stability the video game industry was experiencing in 1982. Due to time limitations, Atari decided to skip audience testing for the game. Emanual Gerard, co-chief operating officer of Warner at the time, later suggested that the company had fallen into a false sense of <b>security</b> <b>by</b> the success of its previous releases, particularly its console version of Pac-Man, which was commercially successful despite poor critical reaction.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the act of Union, the Kingdom of Scotland had a {{standing}} army of seven units of infantry, two of horse and one troop of Horse Guards, besides varying levels of fortress artillery in the garrison castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Stirling. Their role was of such importance that the Scots Parliament forced Queen Anne to give royal assent to the controversial 1704 Act of <b>Security</b> <b>by</b> threatening to withdraw Scottish forces back out of the Confederate armies. The new British Army created by the Act of Union in 1707 incorporated existing Scottish regiments, such as the Scots Guards, The Royal Scots 1st of Foot, King's Own Scottish Borderers 25th of Foot, The Cameronians 26th of Foot, Scots Greys and the Royal Scots Fusiliers 21st of Foot. The new armed forces were controlled by the War Office and Admiralty from London. During this period, Scottish soldiers and sailors were instrumental in supporting the expansion of the British Empire and became involved in international conflicts, including the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–13), the Quadruple Alliance (1718–20), wars with Spain (1727–29) and (1738–48) and the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48). The first official Highland regiment to be raised for the British army was the Black Watch, the 43rd (later 42nd) regiment, in 1740. It marked the beginning of a major role for Highlanders within the British military structure, but the growth of Highland regiments was delayed by the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion and would not begin in earnest until the late 1750s.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, 19 October 2011, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean {{explained the}} relevance of the ISA and its powers of preventive detention. He noted that in the 1960s preventive detention was primarily used to counter the subversive Communist threat posed by the Malayan Communist Party which was hiding within legal organizations. For the past two decades, though, preventive detention has helped safeguard Singapore's national <b>security</b> <b>by</b> countering threats posed by espionage and terrorism. Preventive detention allows for a comprehensive assessment of a threat, as opposed to a criminal case tried before a court which requires the court to consider only the specific acts that relate to the charge. Detaining those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution also allows pre-emptive action to be taken to neutralize threats before they materialize into actual harm. In addition, the Minister said that detention without trial is preferable in situations where open prosecutions in court are not practicable due to the confidentiality of certain intelligence. Such intelligence might have been obtained through foreign security agencies on the understanding that the source and details would not be disclosed to an open court. What is more, disclosure of confidential intelligence could compromise ongoing or future operations through the revelation of existing sources and methods of intelligence gathering. However, if confidential information were withheld from the court, a criminal case could be weakened due to evidential requirements, which may result in the acquittal of an otherwise guilty accused. Finally, court proceedings may stall investigations {{as part of a broader}} network, and could exacerbate situations where communal sensitivities are involved.|$|E

5000|$|The {{interpretation}} of these equations is as follows. Given the savings-coefficients and the capital-gains-coefficient, {{there will be}} a certain valuation ratio which will secure just enough savings by the personal sector to take up the new <b>securities</b> issued <b>by</b> corporations. Hence the net savings of the personal sector (available for investment by the business sector) will depend, not only on the savings propensities of individuals, but on the policies of corporations towards new issues. In the absence of new issues the level of security prices will be established at {{the point at which the}} purchases of <b>securities</b> <b>by</b> the savers will be balanced by the sale of securities of the dis-savers, making the net savings of the personal sector zero. The issue of new <b>securities</b> <b>by</b> corporations will depress security prices (i.e. the valuation ratio v) just enough to reduce the sale of <b>securities</b> <b>by</b> the dis-savers sufficiently to induce the net savings required to take up the new issues. If i were negative and the corporations were net purchasers of securities from the personal sector (which they could be through the redemption of past securities, or purchasing shares from the personal sector for the acquisition of subsidiaries) the valuation ratio v would be driven up to the point at which net personal savings would be negative top the extent necessary to match the sale of <b>securities</b> <b>by</b> the personal sector.|$|R
