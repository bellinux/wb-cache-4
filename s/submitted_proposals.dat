5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, unlike the YF-23, weapon firings and high (60°) {{angle of attack}} (AoA, or high-Alpha) flights were carried out on the YF-22. Though not a requirement, the {{aircraft}} fired AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles from internal weapon bays. Flight testing also demonstrated that the YF-22 with its thrust vectoring nozzles achieved pitch rates more than double that of the F-16 at low-speed maneuvering. The first prototype, PAV-1, achieved Mach1.58 in supercruise, while PAV-2 reached a maximum supercruise speed of Mach1.43; maximum speed was in excess of Mach 2.0. Flight testing continued until 28December1990, by which time 74 flights were completed and 91.6 airborne hours were accumulated. Following flight testing, the contractor teams <b>submitted</b> <b>proposals</b> for ATF production.|$|E
5|$|Starting in Western Han was {{a system}} of {{recommendation}} where local officials <b>submitted</b> <b>proposals</b> to the capital on which of their subordinates were worthy candidates for holding office; this created a patron-client relationship between former superiors and successful nominees to higher office. With the enhanced prestige of the consort clan under Empress Dowager Dou (d. 97 CE), a succession of regents from her clan and others amassed {{a large amount of}} clients whose chances of promotion hinged on the political survival of the empress dowager's clan, which was often short-lived. Aside from patron-client relationships, one could use family connections to secure office. Patricia Ebrey writes that in the Western Han, access to public office and promotion through social mobility were open to a larger segment of the populace than in Eastern Han. A third of the two hundred and fifty-two Eastern Han government officials who had biographies in the Book of Later Han were sons or grandsons of officials, while a fifth came from prominent provincial families or had ancestors who had served as officials. For forty-six of the one hundred and ten years between 86 and 196 CE, at least one post of the Three Excellencies was occupied by a member of either the Yuan or Yang clan.|$|E

There are no records that this law was enforced, and the legislature voted down a proposed 1865 law that would authorize sheriffs to deport black residents in their counties.|$|E

25|$|The Canberra had {{its formal}} origins in a 1944 {{requirement}} {{issued by the}} Air Ministry for a successor to the de Havilland Mosquito. This requirement, the initial revision being E.3/45, sought a high altitude, high-speed bomber {{which was to be}} equipped with no defensive armament. According to aviation historians Bull Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, Air Ministry officials are alleged to have had difficulty defining what they sought for the proposed type, which led to several revisions of the requirement. Further specification refinements were issued, including B.3/45 and B.5/47, issued further details such as a three-man crew and other features such as a visual bombing capability. Several British aircraft manufacturers <b>submitted</b> <b>proposals</b> to meet the requirement, including English Electric. The firm was among those companies to be short-listed to proceed with development studies.|$|E

25|$|The {{process for}} {{selecting}} {{an artist to}} design the memorial was somewhat convoluted. Many artists made inquiries with the UDC about designing the memorial in 1909, and some <b>submitted</b> <b>proposals,</b> but the ACMA declined to consider any design because it was still raising funds. The design committee first met on May 16, 1910. Rev. McKim made the motion that the memorial should depict an event in which General Robert E. Lee attempted to ride into the Battle of the Wilderness to rally his troops. Lee was stopped by a private who seized the bridle of Lee's horse and prevented him from going, declaring that the troops would rally themselves. His motion was accepted. Herbert submitted the proposed design to an undisclosed artist to have a model developed and to get an aesthetic opinion about McKim's idea.|$|E
25|$|Although Toledo {{originally}} promised tax cuts, violent protests {{by civil}} servants prompted {{the increase in}} social sector spending that Toledo had also promised, which necessitated tax increases. To tackle tax reform in June 2003, he brought in Peru’s first female prime minister, Beatriz Merino who quickly <b>submitted</b> <b>proposals</b> to the congress. Among the suggestions were pay cuts for higher-paid public-sector officials, including a 30% salary reduction for Toledo himself, a 5% across-the-board cut for all agencies and ministries, tax increases on beer, cigarettes and fuel, and {{an extension of the}} 18% sales and value-added tax to, among other things, long-distance bus journeys and live entertainment. The final package also included the elimination of tax breaks, the introduction of a minimum corporate tax, the closing of tax loopholes for the rich, and the strengthening of local government realestate tax regimes.|$|E
25|$|After {{the arrival}} of Smithson's remains, the Board of Regents asked Congress to fund a memorial. Artists and architects were {{solicited}} to create proposals for the monument. Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Louis Saint-Gaudens, Gutzon Borglum, Totten & Rogers, Henry Bacon, and Hornblower & Marshall {{were some of the}} many artists and architectural firms who <b>submitted</b> <b>proposals.</b> The proposals varied in design, from elaborate monumental tombs that, if built, would have been bigger than the Lincoln Memorial, to smaller monuments just outside the Smithsonian Castle. Congress decided not to fund the memorial. To accommodate the fact that the Smithsonian would have to fund the memorial, they used the design of Gutzon Borglum, which suggested a remodel of the south tower room of the Smithsonian Castle to house the memorial surrounded by four Corinthian columns and a vaulted ceiling. Instead of the tower room, a smaller room (at the time it was the janitor's closet) at the north entrance would house an Italian-style sarcophagus.|$|E
