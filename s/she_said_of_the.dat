500|$|All of {{the musical}} numbers were {{generally}} praised, though not every number was received with the same enthusiasm.

[...] <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Dreams" [...] rendition by Chenoweth with Morrison, [...] "The harmonies and bare-bones arrangement make for one of Glee most faithful covers yet." [...] Most critics welcomed the Chenoweth version.

During the scene in which Nina was tortured to taunt Olivia into using her powers, Brown actually injured herself on the rusty bedsprings used as the prop for the show. Brown referred to the alternative version of her character as [...] "Meana" [...] due to her seemingly [...] "mean" [...] personality, and speculated that Nina may have become this way because without William Bell, [...] "she wasn’t at the party with all of the boys, the science boys" [...] and thus developed an [...] "outsider" [...] perspective. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role, [...] "It’s a really interesting thing to play.

She also was nominated for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, as well as many other nominations and acclaim. The New York Times praised her: [...] "Because Ms. Watts reinvents herself with each performance, it's easy to forget how brilliant she is. She has a boldness that comes from a lack of overemphasis, something actresses sometimes do to keep up with Mr. Penn". The San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Watts is riveting, but she's much better in scenes of extreme emotion than in those requiring subtlety." ...|$|E
500|$|Bannon did not {{outwardly}} advertise {{the fact}} that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the PE majors all waved. My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file, and one of my colleagues told me my file {{was the only one that}} was any fun." [...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life.

500|$|With {{the success}} of albums by Hill, Badu, and Maxwell, D'Angelo's second album Voodoo served as a further {{alternative}} to excesses of late 1990s R and hip hop, as neo soul reached its apex in 2000. A production of the Soulquarians, it was an exemplary creative milestone of neo soul. Ben Ratliff of The New York Times called the album [...] "the succes d'estime that proves the force of this new music: it is a largely unslick, stubbornly idiosyncratic and genuinely great album that has already produced two hit singles". By {{the time of her}} second album Mama's Gun (2000), Erykah Badu had been dubbed by writers as [...] "the queen of neo-soul". <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> honorific title, [...] "I hated that because what if I don’t do that anymore?

[...] Subsequently, other artists attained success in the early 2000s, including Bilal, Musiq Soulchild, India.Arie, and Alicia Keys, who broke through to broader popularity with her debut album Songs in A Minor (2001). Hip hop artists such as The Roots and Common, associated with the Soulquarians, released albums that incorporated neo soul, Phrenology (2002) and Electric Circus (2003).|$|E
