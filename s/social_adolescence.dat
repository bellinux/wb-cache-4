Social relationship will be established with good interpersonal communication when there is in it. Students who have difficulty in interpersonal communication will be difficult to adjust themselves, tend to be overbearing, selfish, and want to win themselves so easily involved in the dispute. The aim of this research is intended to establish the effective interventions to improve students' interpersonal communication. The main of research problem was "Is sociodrama technique effective for enhancing students’ interpersonal communication towards grade X students of Kartika Siliwangi 2 Senior High School in Bandung in academic year 2013 / 2014 ?"

40|$|Adolescence {{has been}} {{described}} as an important period to acquire social competences required for adult life. It has been suggested that early stress experiences could affect the development of the brain at different levels. These changes in the brain during adolescence may be related with the development of psychopathologies such as depression and social anxiety in adulthood. In the first experiment, we examined long-term effects of repeated <b>social</b> stress during <b>adolescence</b> on adult <b>social</b> approach-avoidance behavior. For that purpose, adolescent male Wistar rats were exposed twice at postnatal day (Pnd) 45 and Pnd 48 to the resident-intruder paradigm followed by three times psychosocial threat with the same resident. Three weeks after the last psychosocial threat experience the animals were behaviorally tested in a social approach-avoidance test. Socially stressed animals spent less time in the interaction zone with an unfamiliar male adult rat. These data suggest that animals exposed to <b>social</b> stress during <b>adolescence</b> show a higher level of social anxiety in adulthood. In the second experiment, we investigated whether these long-term effects of <b>social</b> stress during <b>adolescence</b> on behavior draw a parallel with changes in brain monoamine content, biosynthesis and turnover. Using the same experimental design as in the first experiment, HPLC analysis of various brain regions showed that there were no differences in monoamine content, monoamine biosynthesis and monoamines activity in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and striatum in adulthood. These results indicate that long-lasting changes in social behavior following <b>social</b> stress during <b>adolescence</b> are not accompanied by changes in brain monoamine content, biosynthesis and turnover.

Therapy and intervention are attempts to control complex, self-organizing systems, i. e., networks of proximal causes. We have noted that successful therapies and interventions do exactly that: change the network of proximal causes, within the rules and confinements of the contexts in which adolescent social behaviour occurs. Understanding the mechanism of such changes requires a different approach to studying and evaluating therapy and intervention, namely a focus on the various dynamics of individual trajectories...|$|R

40|$|Stressful {{life events}} {{generally}} enhance the vulnerability {{for the development}} of human psychopathologies such as anxiety disorders and depression. The incidence rates of adult mental disorders steeply rises during adolescence in parallel with a structural and functional reorganization of the neural circuitry underlying stress reactivity. However, the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to stress and manifestation of mental disorders during adolescence are little understood. We hypothesized that heightened sensitivity to stress during adolescence reflects age-dependent differences in the expression of activity-dependent genes involved in synaptic plasticity. Therefore, we compared the effect of <b>social</b> stress during <b>adolescence</b> with <b>social</b> stress in adulthood on the expression of a panel of genes linked to induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling. We show that <b>social</b> defeat during <b>adolescence</b> and adulthood differentially regulates expression of the immediate early genes BDNF, Arc, Carp, and Tieg 1, as measured by qPCR in tissue lysates from prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus. In the hippocampus, mRNA levels for all four genes were robustly elevated following <b>social</b> defeat in <b>adolescence,</b> whereas none were induced by defeat in adulthood. The relationship to coping style was also examined using adult reactive and proactive coping rats. Gene expression levels of reactive and proactive animals were similar in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. However, a trend toward a differential expression of BDNF and Arc mRNA in the nucleus accumbens was detected. BDNF mRNA was increased in the nucleus accumbens of proactive defeated animals, whereas the expression level in reactive defeated animals was comparable to control animals. The results demonstrate striking differences in immediate early gene expression in response to social defeat in adolescent and adult rats. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStudies {{in animal}} models {{generate}} and test hypotheses regarding developmental stage-specific vulnerability that might inform research questions about human development. In both rats and humans, peer relationships are qualitatively different in adolescence than at other stages of development, and <b>social</b> experiences in <b>adolescence</b> are considered important determinants of adult social function. This review describes our adolescent rat social instability stress model and the long-lasting effects social instability has on social behaviour in adulthood {{as well as the}} possible neural underpinnings. Effects of other adolescent social stress experiences in rats on social behaviours in adulthood also are reviewed. We discuss the role of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) function and glucocorticoid release in conferring differential susceptibility to social experiences in adolescents compared to adults. We propose that although differential perception of social experiences rather than immature HPA function may underlie the heightened vulnerability of adolescents to social instability, the changes in the trajectory of brain development and resultant social deficits likely are mediated by the heightened glucocorticoid release in response to repeated <b>social</b> stressors in <b>adolescence</b> compared to in adulthood...|$|R

40|$|Adolescence is an {{important}} period {{for the development of}} adult social competences. <b>Social</b> stress during <b>adolescence</b> may contribute not only to an inadequate social development but also to adult vulnerability to social anxiety. There seems to be a clear individual differentiation, however, in the vulnerability to the long-term negative consequences of social stress. The current study further explores this individual vulnerability and is aimed at the influence of <b>social</b> stress during <b>adolescence</b> on adult <b>social</b> anxiety and its context specificity. Rats from different strains (Wistar and Wild-type Groningen rats) were exposed to the resident-intruder paradigm five times during 10 min each in the period between postnatal day 45 and 58. Three and 7 weeks later, the animals were re-exposed to the context in the presence of either a dominant male or an anestrous female behind a wire mesh screen. Wistar rats that were socially defeated spent less time exploring the social stimulus in comparison with socially defeated Wild-type rats and their non-defeated controls. We conclude that the stressed Wistar rat shows signs of generalized social anxiety indicating that the Wistar rat can be considered as a vulnerable phenotype to effects of adolescent social stress. ...|$|R

40|$|Social anxiety {{disorder}} typically begins in adolescence, a sensitive period for brain development, when increased complexity and salience of peer relationships requires novel {{forms of social}} learning. Disordered <b>social</b> learning in <b>adolescence</b> may explain how brain dysfunction promotes social anxiety. Socially anxious adolescents (n =  15) and adults (n =  19) and non-anxious adolescents (n =  24) and adults (n =  32) predicted, then received, social feedback from high and low-value peers while undergoing {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). A surprise recall task assessed memory biases for feedback. Neural correlates of social evaluation prediction errors (PEs) were assessed by comparing engagement to expected and unexpected positive and negative feedback. For socially anxious adolescents, but not adults or healthy participants of either age group, PEs elicited heightened striatal activity and negative fronto-striatal functional connectivity. This occurred selectively to unexpected positive feedback from high-value peers and corresponded with impaired memory for social feedback. While impaired memory also occurred in socially-anxious adults, this impairment was unrelated to brain-based PE activity. Thus, <b>social</b> anxiety in <b>adolescence</b> may relate to altered neural correlates of PEs that contribute to impaired learning about social feedback. Small samples necessitate replication. Nevertheless, results suggest that the relationship between learning and fronto-striatal function may attenuate as development progresses...|$|R

40|$|Emotional {{awareness}} {{has been}} found to be influential for health and wellbeing throughout the lifetime as well as during <b>adolescence.</b> <b>Social</b> functioning, such as social support, friendships, and satisfying relationships with others, is also critical for health and wellbeing during adolescence. Much study has identified the importance of emotional awareness and social functioning, but little has looked at the connection between these two constructs. The aim of this thesis was to clarify the association between emotional awareness and <b>social</b> functioning during <b>adolescence,</b> in particular, their association over time. This thesis is comprised of a systematic review of the current literature on emotional awareness and <b>social</b> functioning over <b>adolescence</b> and two empirical studies. The systematic review identified ten studies meeting search criteria and represented 6, 438 adolescent participants. These studies assessed emotional awareness in relation to six aspects of social functioning: social support, friendship, social adjustment, social problems and social competence. Despite some differences in results across these studies, a relatively reliable small to medium positive correlation between emotional awareness and <b>social</b> functioning during <b>adolescence</b> was found. This review highlighted the many gaps in the research including the small number of studies, mainly crosssectional study designs used, and a lack of longitudinal and intervention research. Study 1 examined the relationship between emotional awareness (Grades 8, 9, 10, 11, 12) and peer-nominated friendship in 468 adolescents in Grade 12. Results indicate that emotional awareness in early adolescence predicted friendship nominations in later adolescence for females but not for males. Females with greater emotional awareness in Grade 8 received more friendship nominations from female peers and fewer friendship nominations from male peers in Grade 12. This suggests that emotional awareness may be particularly important for friendship for females, with their level of awareness in early adolescence being especially influential. Study 2 assessed the longitudinal association between emotional awareness and social support over three years during adolescence (n = 903) from Grade 9 to 12, with 314 participants completing all four waves of the study. Results suggest that there is a reciprocal relationship between emotional awareness and social support, such that they mutually influence one another’s development over time. Together the review and two empirical studies provide evidence for emotional awareness and certain aspects of social functioning being associated during adolescence. Despite the finding that emotional awareness and social support have a reciprocal influence model over time, there is a need for additional longitudinal study and intervention-based study designs to further explore the direction of the relationship between emotional awareness and other aspects of social functioning. A discussion of the clinical and educational implications of this research is included, with particular attention dedicated to school-based curriculums designed to improve socio-emotional wellbeing in adolescents...|$|R

This study were examined {{the influence of}} <b>social</b> support in <b>adolescence</b> (sense of support, amount of support, availability of support) on adolescence and young adult emotional distress (suicide risk {{and depression}}). The potential moderating effects of social support {{on the relationship between}} adolescent emotional distress and young adult emotional distress were explored. Methods: The study sample included 568 participants, recruited by the Reconnecting Youth Program, who were in high school, identified as at-risk for school failure/dropout and followed into young adulthood. Data were collected in adolescence and young adulthood using items adapted from established measures for three psychosocial assessments. Each assessment asked an array of questions pertaining to adolescent/young adult health risks, such as suicide risk, depression, stress and substance abuse. Preliminary analyses included descriptive analysis of study variables and socio-demographics. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to test for the influence of three indicators of adolescent social support on emotional distress outcomes in adolescence and young adulthood, controlling for potential confounders. Moderating effects of adolescent social support on the relationship between adolescent and young adult emotional distress were examined by calculating separate interaction terms for each support variable and indicator of adolescent emotional distress. Results: Results were similar to other research that has evidenced both the direct and moderating effects of social support on emotional distress. In adolescence, lower levels of social support for all measures were associated with greater emotional distress over and above other predictors. Higher amount of support and sense of support in adolescence predicted lower depression in young adulthood and higher sense of support predicted lower suicide risk in young adulthood. High availability of support in adolescence reduced the effect of adolescent depression and suicide risk on emotional distress outcomes in the transition to young adulthood. Conclusions: Not only are low levels of social support associated with higher levels of depression and suicide risk in <b>adolescence,</b> <b>social</b> support in <b>adolescence</b> independently predicted emotional distress outcomes in young adulthood. Given the impact of perceived social support on emotional distress in this transitional period, the design of interventions should focus on increasing adolescent social support...|$|R
