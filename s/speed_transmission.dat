25|$|The advertised February {{introduction}} of a fully synchronized, four-speed transmission RPO 651 was postponed until the 1961 model year. This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> case which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising {{of the potential for}} differential failure due to external leaks {{at the front of the}} transmission's counter gear shaft. The revision of the four <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> designated for 1961 introduction incorporated a cast iron case and a redesign of the differential pinion shaft to interface with a longer transmission output shaft and a concentric pilot for the revised transmission case. These are among many of the course corrections undertaken by Chevrolet by the end of the 1960 model year.|$|E
500|$|Between 1989 and 1993, 150 AMX-30Es were modernised to {{what would}} {{become known as the}} AMX-30EM2. [...] The {{modernisation}} entailed the introduction of a new armour piercing discarding sabot round, the modification of the turret hatch to allow the installation of a larger anti-aircraft machine gun, and a brand new fire control system. Besides these modernisations of the tank's firepower, the mobility of the tank was improved through the exchange of the old engine and transmission for the more reliable MTU 833 Ka-501 diesel engine, producing , coupled with the [...] German ZF LSG-3000. A new smoke machine, linked to the tank's new engine, was also installed. [...] The other 149 AMX-30Es went through a less expensive and extensive modification, known as the AMX-30EM1. These received the American Allison CD-850-6A three <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> (two forward and one reverse); however, the new transmission caused extensive overheating in the engine compartment. [...] These 149 AMX-30EM1s would eventually be replaced by US surplus M60A3 Patton tanks, purchased from the United States, in the early 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|Production of the 103 A0 series {{began in}} August 1955. [...] 103-series Tourists had four <b>speed</b> <b>transmissions</b> and ten inch wheels, {{enlarged}} {{from the three}} <b>speed</b> <b>transmissions</b> and eight inch wheels of earlier models. [...] The result was a larger, heavier, and thirstier scooter on one hand, and a faster, more sophisticated scooter on the other.|$|R

50|$|All models came as {{standard}} with a five <b>speed</b> manual <b>transmission,</b> {{except for the}} Stop & Start model, which came with the SensoDrive gearbox, a five <b>speed</b> semi-automatic <b>transmission</b> with paddle shifters and manual and automatic modes. The top level was the only version that {{had the option of}} a four <b>speed</b> fully automatic <b>transmission.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most Fleetstars {{had five}} <b>speed</b> <b>transmissions,</b> {{often with a}} two speed rear axle, but a six speed {{automatic}} was sometimes an option. Heavy duty diesels had vendor transmissions with up to 13 speeds.|$|R
2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} saw only minor changes that {{included}} new color choices, a softer grain pattern on interior surfaces, {{and a slight}} increase {{in the size of the}} rubber bumper tips. The 340 option was replaced with a 360 4-bbl as the small block performance engine. All other engine options remained the same, including the 360 2-bbl designated by a K in the fifth symbol in the vehicle identification number. Several performance rear end ratios, including a 3.23 [...] "Sure Grip" [...] rear end were still available. A four <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> was still an option except with the 440 engine.|$|E
2500|$|Don Yenko, who {{had been}} racing Corvettes, could not compete {{successfully}} against the Carroll Shelby Mustangs after they arrived on the scene; he therefore decided to race modified Corvairs, beginning with the 1966 model. As the stock Corvair did not fit {{into any of the}} SCCA categories, Yenko had to modify four-carburetor Corsas into [...] "sports cars" [...] by removing the back seat; in the process he introduced various performance improvements. As the SCCA required 100 cars to be manufactured to homologate the model for production racing, Yenko completed 100 Stingers in one month in 1965. Although all were white, as the SCCA required for American cars at the time, [...] {{there was a great deal}} of variety between individual cars; some had exterior modifications including fiberglass engine covers with spoilers, some did not; some received engine upgrades developing 160, 190, 220, or 240hp (119, 142, 164, or 179kW). All were equipped by the Chevrolet factory with heavy duty suspension, four <b>speed</b> <b>transmission,</b> quicker steering ratio, [...] "positraction" [...] limited-slip differentials (50 with 3.89 gears, and 50 with 3.55 when Chevrolet dropped the 3.89) and dual brake master cylinders (the first application of this by Chevrolet, to become stock equipment the next year). Because most of the engine cooling in air-cooled engines is done by circulating oil, an oil cooler was necessary for competition use, this was mounted externally on the rear body section above the left wheel.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting {{a further}} industry-wide {{adoption}} of smaller vehicle designs {{in the interest}} of improved fuel efficiency and emissions compliance, the Thunderbird was redesigned for 1980 on the compact Ford Fox platform, which first appeared only two years prior {{as the basis for the}} Ford Fairmont. Compared to the previous Torino-based Thunderbird and its large [...] wheelbase and [...] overall length, the new Thunderbird lost [...] of wheelbase and [...] in overall length. The squarish styling seen in the previous generation Thunderbird was favored for the new model, but the small car platform resulted in a poor translation with a distinctly upright appearance. Frameless door glass was no longer used; a chrome metal frame was used, making this car more like a two-door sedan. Combined with the poor performing [...] Windsor V8 as a base engine, and a C5 3 <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> with 2.26 rear gears, this Thunderbird generation was not well received by the public. The available 5.0L (302 cid) Windsor V8 with the AOD automatic overdrive transmission, coupled with a 3.45 rear end gear, was a welcome alternative to the 255, but with only [...] performance was moderately enhanced. Significantly, though failing to generate any new interest for the Thunderbird, a six-cylinder engine was made available for the first time in the Thunderbird's history in 1981, the [...] Thriftpower Six. For 1982 this was followed up with the replacement of the straight-six with a more modern V6, the 3.8L Essex, which was also now the Thunderbird's standard engine. It came equipped with a Motorcraft 2150 2V carburator. Hurting the Thunderbird's sales performance further, the 302 V8 did not return for 1982, leaving the 255 Cubic inch V8 as the only alternative engine. At 288,638 examples produced between 1980 and 1982, the eighth generation Thunderbird was barely more successful than the final model year of the previous Thunderbird generation. In order to revive the Thunderbird's success, a redesign was needed and Ford would deliver one for 1983.|$|E
