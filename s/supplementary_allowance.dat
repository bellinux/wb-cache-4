50|$|In {{the field}} of workmen’s compensation, Labour succeeded in getting what Labour saw as an {{unsatisfactory}} bill withdrawn, and a new Bill introduced “to include single persons and to give improved allowances.” The new Workmen’s Compensation (Supplementary Allowances) Act, which came into effect in August 1940), provided a <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowance</b> not exceeding 5s a week to all disabled workers, together with a <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowance</b> of 4s a week each {{for the first and}} second child, and 3s for each other child younger than 15. For a man with 3 children, the improvement represented 16s a week. For agricultural workers, a bill increasing the maximum unemployment benefit for agricultural workers by 3s a week was amended by Ernest Bevin, with a more generous increase of 6s a week introduced.|$|E
5000|$|Ambrose {{was born}} in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, where his father owned a farm {{machinery}} business, and attended the local grammar school. This business entitled his father to a <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowance</b> for fuel, which was rationed during the Second World War. Ambrose learnt to drive by accompanying his father on his visits to farms, initially sitting on his father's lap to steer whilst his father operated the pedals, and learning map-reading skills (signposts having been removed from roads for fear of invasion).|$|E
50|$|After {{attending}} the Institute of Cadets, he initially began a military career that he entered as a lieutenant. He made his unscheduled farewell and {{migrated to the}} Americas. This was because after a publicised argument his father no longer wanted to pay a <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowance.</b> After a brief stay in El Salvador, where {{he was working on}} the coffee farms of his older brother Joachim, he moved in the summer of 1904 finally to Vancouver (British Columbia) - with only four dollars in cash.|$|E

30|$|Minimum income {{recipients}} often receive on top {{of their}} social assistance benefit child cash benefits and <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowances</b> such as housing or heating allowances, one-off emergency payments etc. To the extent that these additional benefits are not included in the means test, measures impacting on these income components do affect the generosity of the minimum income package, in a few cases even quite substantially.|$|R
50|$|The SSRB further {{recommended}} that {{the leader of the}} next largest non-executive party should get a salary of £32,422 over and above the MSP’s salary (recommendation 6). This was not accepted by all the main political parties, with some preferring instead to consider a <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowance</b> to assist all non-executive party leaders (with more than 15 MSPs) in undertaking their duties. The accepted proposal was that leaders of parties with no Scottish Minister or Junior Minister amongst its members should receive a sum additional to their salary (see below). It was also proposed that the leader of the main non-Executive party should receive an additional £32,000. This became the Party Leaders' Allowances Scheme.|$|E
5000|$|Wilson's {{successor}} Callaghan, {{together with}} his ministers, also introduced a number of reforms during their time in office. The Supplementary Benefits Act 1976 gave every person {{over the age of}} 16, whose resources were not enough to meet his or her basic needs, the right to claim a supplementary pension if he or she had reached state-pension age, and a <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowance</b> if he or she was less than this age. The Rent (Agricultural) Act 1976 provided security of tenure for agricultural workers in tied accommodation, while the Bail Act 1976 reformed bail conditions with courts having to explain refusal of bail. The Police Act 1976 set up a Police Complaints Board [...] "to formalise the procedure for dealing with public complaints." [...] The Education Act 1976 limited the taking up of independent and Direct grant school places and required all local authorities who had failed to do so [...] "to submit proposals for comprehensive schools," [...] while the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 extended local council responsibility [...] "to provide accommodation for homeless people in their area," [...] and instituted the right of homeless families to a permanent local council tenancy. In addition, efforts were made under the Environment Secretary Peter Shore to redistribute resources toward deprived urban areas. The Inner Urban Areas Act 1978 allowed local authorities to assist declining industrial areas and central government provided new subsidies to those inner city areas with the most problems, while the 1978 Finance Act introduced profit-sharing schemes. In April 1976, a Child Interim Benefit for single-parent families was introduced, followed by a universal Child Benefit scheme the following year.|$|E
50|$|On 28 February 1949 De Gasperi {{launched}} a seven-year plan for social housing {{to increase the}} stock of economic housing by means of construction or purchase of economic accommodation. The law also established a special housing fund (INA-Casa) within the National Institute for Insurance (Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni, or INA). Moreover, on 29 July 1947 the government established a Fund For Social Solidarity within INPS {{in order to pay}} graduated <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowances</b> to all pensions, compensating for inflation.|$|R

25|$|Wages {{for members}} of the police force were {{significantly}} increased. The introduction of a Miner's Charter in 1946 instituted a five-day work week for miners and a standardised day wage structure, and in 1948 a Colliery Workers Supplementary Scheme was approved, providing <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowances</b> to disabled coal-workers and their dependants. In 1948, a pension scheme was set up to provide pension benefits for employees of the new NHS, as well as their dependents. Under the Coal Industry Nationalisation (Superannuation) Regulations of 1950, a pension scheme for mineworkers was established. Improvements were also made in farmworkers' wages, and the Agricultural Wages Board in 1948 not only safeguarded wage levels, but also ensured that workers were provided with accommodation.|$|R

50|$|In June 1956 a {{national}} solidarity {{fund for the}} elderly was set up, that provided <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowances</b> for elderly people {{to provide them with}} a more adequate income. In addition, a law of December 1956 established an allowance for the mothers of household for non-salaried workers. Sales tax on essential commodities was abolished, while regional differences in minimum wage standards across France were reduced. A decree of November 1956 abolished written homework for children through the sixth grade, thereby lightening the load on French schoolchildren, while official instructions of January 1957 specified that nursery schools should include such facilities as a medical room and a recreational room. An Act was passed in April 1957 allowing people who employed domestic help in their service to form an employers' association, while a law was passed giving the AFP news agency its subsequent legal status. In addition, an Act of July 1957 confirmed a 1955 that created a complementary procedure for mediation.|$|R
5000|$|For {{those in}} aviation, a Decree of December 1936 {{established}} a psycho-physiological service for military aviation “with {{the task of}} centralising {{the study of the}} adaptation of the human system to the optimum utilisation of aeronautical material.” A Decree of the 12th of July 1936 extended compensation to cover diseases contracted in sewers, skin diseases due to the action of cements, dermatitis due to the action of trichloronaphthaline (acne), and cutaneous and nasal ulceration due to potassium bichromate. An Act of August 1936 extended to workers in general <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowances</b> that had previously been confined to workers injured in accidents prior to the 9th of January 1927. An order dealing with rescue equipment in mines was issued on 19 August 1936, followed by two orders concerning packing and caving on 25 February 1937. In relation to maritime transport, a Decree of 3 March 1937 issued instructions concerning safety. A decree of the 18th of June 1937 promulgated the Convention “concerning the marking of the weight on heavy packages transported by vessels which was adopted by the International Labour Conference at Geneva in 1929.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The Workmen's Compensation (Supplementation) Act 1951 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It {{was passed}} during the Labour {{government}} of Clement Attlee. It tackled {{the problem of}} the [...] "pre-1924" [...] compensation cases by enabling <b>supplementary</b> weekly <b>allowances</b> to be paid to workmen who had suffered workplace injuries from before 1924 in order to bring their compensation broadly to the same level as that payable to [...] "post-1923" [...] men.|$|R
5000|$|The Attlee Government {{increased}} {{pensions and}} other benefits, with pensions raised {{to become more}} of a living income than they had ever been. War pensions and allowances (for both World Wars) were increased by an Act of 1946 which gave the wounded man with an allowance for his wife and children if he married after he had been wounded, thereby removing a grievance of more than twenty years standing. Other improvements were made in war pensions during Attlee’s tenure as prime minister. A Constant Attendance Allowance was tripled, an Unemployability Allowance was tripled from 10s to 30s a week, and a special hardship allowance of up to £1 a week was introduced. In addition, the 1951 Budget made further improvements in the <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowances</b> for many war pensioners. From 1945 onwards, three out of every four pension claims had been successful, whilst after the First World War only one pension claim in three was allowed. Under the Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1948, employees of a body representative of local authorities or of the officers of local authorities could be admitted “on suitable terms to the superannuation fund of a local authority.” In 1951, a comforts allowance was introduced that was automatically paid to war pensioners “receiving unemployability supplement and constant attendance allowance.” ...|$|R
50|$|Formally, Jews and Palestinian Arabs both enjoy equal {{citizenship}} rights. However, Arabs are not {{recruited to}} the military, which limits {{their ability to}} exercise their citizenship practice, rendering them less full members of the state. Soldiers are often entitled to certain benefits such as <b>supplementary</b> children <b>allowances,</b> tax credits, assistance in mortgage payments, etc. Since the Arab minority is not called {{to serve in the}} military, they do not become entitled to these benefits as often, exacerbating wealth inequality. However, Arab citizens may volunteer for service in the IDF on the same grounds as non-Arab Israelis.|$|R

40|$|Unsupplemented cattle {{offered a}} high grass {{allowance}} (18 kg (DM) /head/day), achieved 0. 97 of the DM intake {{of a positive}} control offered concentrates ad-libitium. At a low grass allowance (6 kg/DM/head/day), there was no effect of supplementary concentrates on grass intake. At a medium (12 kg/DM/head/day), and high grass <b>allowance,</b> <b>supplementary</b> concentrates reduced grass intake by 0. 43 and 0. 81 kg/DM respectively per kg/DM concentrate offered. * Supplementary concentrates increased complete diet digestibility even though offering supplementary concentrates also increased total DM intake. Complete diet digestibility was higher than the additive values of the grass and concentrates. This would imply that the supplementary concentrates increased the grass DM digestibility. * Increasing the grass allowance increased plasma urea concentration; supplementary concentrates increased total dietary nitrogen intake and reduced plasma urea concentration. These {{findings suggest that the}} concentrate supplement enabled greater utilisation by rumen micro-organisms of the degradable nitrogen supplied by the grass. * Supplementing with concentrates increased carcass growth by 116 g/kg concentrate DM eaten whereas increasing the grass allowance increased carcass growth by 38 g/kg/DM grass eaten. The carcass weight response to concentrates of grazing animals was twice that of animals offered concentrates ad-libitum which gained 57 g carcass per kg concentrate DM eaten. * The relationship between carcass gain (Y) (kg/day) and supplementary concentrates (X) (kg/day) was quadratic (P< 0. 001) and was best described by the equation: Y = - 0. 0099 X 2 + 0. 1364 X + 0. 2459 (R 2 = 0. 60). The relationship between carcass gain (Y) (kg day- 1) and grass intake (X) was also quadratic (P< 0. 01) and was best described by the equation: Y = - 43 X 2 + 275 X + 133 (R 2 = 0. 48). Although there was a much larger (double) carcass growth response to supplementary concentrates than to additional grass DM eaten, increasing grass intake significantly increased carcass fat scores whereas offering supplementary concentrates did not. This would imply that relative to concentrates, autumn grass led to a change in the partitioning of energy from muscle towards subcutaneous fat. * As a strategy for increasing the performance of cattle grazing the type of autumn grass used in this study, offering supplementary concentrates offers more scope to improve animal performance than altering grass allowance. * The carbohydrate source of the three concentrates formulated to differ in rate of degradability did not alter rumen fluid pH, volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration or the rate of grass DM or N degradation when grass supply was considered to be limiting or liberal. The autumn grass was apparently capable of buffering the effects of concentrate DM degradation rate which varied by up to two fold. * The rumen fluid parameters were more influenced by the pat-tern of grass intake than type of concentrate offered. Hence, there was no effect of concentrate type on animal performance. End of Project ReportEuropean Union Structural Funds (EAGGF...|$|R
