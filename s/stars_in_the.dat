5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade {{identified}} two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high-velocity <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> disk Type I and the older, red <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.) Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} named after Spica, a binary star system in the {{constellation}} Virgo {{and one of the}} brightest <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nighttime sky. It appears as one star because of the relatively low center-to-center distance between the two component stars, estimated at an average of 11 million miles (17.7 million km). Astronomical observations also suggest that there may be additional <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Spica system. In the story, Asumi mentions Spica's distance to Earth as 350 light-years. This figure is also cited by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; however, other sources indicate a distance of approximately 260 light-years.|$|E

5|$|By {{matching}} {{up these}} curves on the HR diagram the absolute magnitude of main-sequence <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cluster {{can also be}} determined. This in turn provides a distance estimate to the cluster, based on the visual magnitude of the stars. The difference between the relative and absolute magnitude, the distance modulus, yields this estimate of the distance.|$|E
