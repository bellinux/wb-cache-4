40|$|Asian <b>seabass</b> (barramundi) {{is one of}} {{the ideal}} species for {{diversification}} of Indian brackishwater aquaculture sector which has a good domestic market potential in India. The financial profitability of <b>seabass</b> farming works out to 29. 18 % of Return on Investment (ROI). On comparison with tiger shrimp in a planning horizon of 10 years, with inclusion of 0. 49 estimated probability of risk of crop failures for shrimp, yielded Internal Rate of Return (IRR) values of 29. 18 % and 23. 72 % for <b>seabass</b> and shrimp respectively. Interestingly if a 10 % increase in revenue (either by increase of output quantum/price) or a 10 % decrease in costs would make both <b>seabass</b> and shrimp culture to return IRR values over 40 %. In addition to this long term financial soundness, eco-biological and other risks associated with <b>seabass</b> farming are less compared to shrimp farming. Efforts on marketing of live <b>seabass</b> in domestic as well as middle and south-east Asian countries markets as well as on export of frozen <b>seabass</b> and fillets to northern European countries could help <b>seabass</b> farmers.

50|$|In {{the place}} where the river flows into the sea, there has been formed over the years an {{extended}} Delta of 4.000 hectares, because of the large dam that was constructed and retains much of the brought matters. As a result, silting has benn greatly reduced and during the summer, when there is no much water, the sea enters and largely overwhelms the river bed. Flathead mullets and European <b>seabasses</b> are found in Haliakmon's Delta. In the shallow marine areas formed there, the fry of many Aegean Sea's fish finds a place to reproduce, while about 90% of Greece's mussels are produced in the Haliakmon-Axios(Vardar) Delta. Aliki Kitrous is an area of 254 hectares, where 15-20.000 tons of salt are produced per year.|$|E
40|$|Extract] Asian <b>seabass</b> (Lates calcarifer) is {{commonly}} consumed throughout India, South-east Asia and Australia, {{as well as}} increasingly being marketed into North America and Europe. Paralleling this growing global consumption of Asian <b>seabass,</b> and seafood in general, is the increasing prevalence of human allergic reactions to fish products. Allergic reactions to Asian <b>seabass,</b> and other bony fish, are primarily caused by the small Ca²⁺ binding muscle protein parvalbumin and what we currently know about this protein in Asian <b>seabass</b> and how it differs from other commonly consumed fish species...|$|R

40|$|Aquaculture of Lates calcarifer, {{known as}} <b>seabass,</b> was {{commenced}} in the 1970 s in Thailand, and rapidly spread throughout Southeast Asia. In India also it is a sought after fish in many states. The grow-out phase involves the rearing of the <b>seabass</b> from juvenile to marketable size. Marketable size requirement of <b>seabass</b> vary {{country to country}} e. g. in Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore, the normally accepted marketable size of <b>seabass</b> is between 700 – 1200 g while in the Philippines, marketable size is between 300 – 400 g. The culture period in grow-out phase also vary from 3 – 4 months (to produce 300 – 400) to 8 – 12 months. The success of marine cage culture of <b>seabass</b> and its economical viability have contributed significantly to large scale development of this aquaculture syste...|$|R
40|$|Teleost fishes exhibit an unrivaled {{diversity}} of reproductive patterns {{compared to other}} vertebrates, and the groupers (Epinephelidae) and <b>seabasses</b> (Serranidae) represent an extreme example of this diversity, because significant variations in sexual pattern, mating behavior, and reproductive anatomy occur among species in both families. For this research, I investigate these three aspects of the reproductive biology in five species of groupers from the eastern Pacific. I then combine my data with published results on the reproductive biology of other groupers and <b>seabasses</b> to describe taxonomic differences in these aspects and reconstruct their evolutionary history. Finally, I use a comparative phylogenetic approach to evaluate the evolutionary relationship between mating system characteristics (i. e., mating group structure and sperm competition) and sexual pattern. More specifically, I test whether evolutionary shifts in sexual pattern and, in particular the loss of sex change, were influenced by changes from paired to group spawning and associated increases in sperm competition among males. These analyses allow me to determine whether predictions of sex-allocation theory regarding the influence of mating behavior on sex allocation are congruent with fine-scale, evolutionary patterns of sex change within a resolved phylogeny. My results indicate that characteristics of the sexual pattern, mating behavior, and reproductive anatomy in both families are exceptionally labile. Evolutionary transformations in these features do not strictly follow taxonomic lines and remarkable changes have evolved in closely related species and genera. The most parsimonious phylogenetic reconstructions of the evolutionary history of sexual patterns indicate that protogynous hermaphroditism is the ancestral character state in both the Epinephelidae and the Serranidae, {{and other forms of}} hermaphroditism evolved secondarily from this state. Tests of correlated evolution showed that evolutionary transformations in sexual pattern from protogyny to gonochorism are correlated with transformations in mating group structure from paired to group spawning, and sperm competition is significantly higher in gonochoric species than protogynous species. These results suggest that the loss of sex change was influenced by changes from paired to group spawning and associated increases in sperm competition among males. More importantly, this research provides phylogenetic support for predictions of the size- advantage model and empirical evidence for the influence of sperm competition on sex allocation in animal...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis Mating {{behavior}} in simultaneously hermaphroditic <b>seabasses</b> has been {{often cited as}} an example of cooperation among unrelated conspecifics. The predominant mating {{behavior in}} this group involves egg trading, where individuals reciprocally fertilize parcels of eggs from a partner. Egg trading has been suggested as a good example of a tit-for-tat cooperative mating strategy. Although simultaneous hermaphroditic fishes are often held up as strong examples of coop-eration in mating behavior, a closer examination reveals significant sexual selection and sexual conflict between male and female roles among individuals. In the 7 species where data exist, there is a significant increase in male reproductive success with individual size, and in all but 1 species success through male function increases faster than reproductive success through female function. Despite this male-size advantage in simultaneous hermaphrodites, most species maintain their hermaph-roditism for their entire life, and the increased male allocation while engaging in biased forms of reciprocation appear to increase the evolutionary stability of hermaphroditism in these species. Thus, egg-trading behavior is probably more com-plicated than was initially recognized, with individuals releasing different numbers of eggs in spawns, spawning at different rates as males and females, and partitioning male effort between pair and alternative mating tactics. The departures from equal reciprocity can probably be best understood by including aspects of traditional mating-system theory, with individuals increasing male mating success through a variety of behavioral tactics...|$|E

5000|$|White <b>seabass</b> are fished {{primarily}} with live bait in relatively shallow water, {{but they will}} also take a fast-trolled spoon, artificial squid or bone jig.

At times, large white <b>seabass</b> will bite only on fairly large, live Pacific mackerel. The young of this species are exceptionally vulnerable to sport anglers for two reasons: The first is that as juveniles they inhabit shallow nearshore areas, bays, and estuaries, and the second is that they are not easily recognized as white <b>seabass</b> by the average angler. Commonly, these young fish are mistakenly called [...] "sea trout" [...] because of their sleek profile and vertical bars or [...] "parr marks".

40|$|Contribution No. 167 of the Aquaculture Department, SEAFDEC. This paper {{provides}} basic early life-history {{information on}} milkfish (Chanos chanos), <b>seabass</b> (Lates calcarifer) and rabbitfish (Siganus guttatus) {{which may explain}} in part the observed differences in their survival performance in the hatchery. Egg size, larval size, amount of yolk and oil reserves and mouth size are all greater in milkfish than in <b>seabass,</b> and greater in the latter than in rabbitfish. During the first 24 h after hatching, rabbitfish larvae grow much faster than milkfish and <b>seabass</b> larvae at similar ambient temperatures (range 26 Â°â€“ 30 Â°C, mean about 28 Â°C). The eyes become fully pigmented and the mouths open earlier in <b>seabass</b> and rabbitfish (32 â€“ 36 h from hatching) than in milkfish (54 h). <b>Seabass</b> larvae learn to feed the earliest. Yolk is completely resorbed at 120 h from hatching in milkfish, and yolk plus oil at 120 h in <b>seabass</b> and 72 h in rabbitfish at 26 Â° to 30 Â°C. Milkfish and <b>seabass</b> larvae have more time than rabbitfish to initiate external feeding before the endogenous reserves are completely resorbed. Delayed feeding experiments showed that 50 % of unfed milkfish larvae die at 78 h and all die at 150 h from hatching. Milkfish larvae fed within 54 to 78 h after hatching had improved survival times: 50 % mortality occurred at 96 to 120 h, and 10 to 13 % survived beyond 150 h. Unfed <b>seabass</b> larvae all died at 144 h, while 6 to 13 % of those fed within 32 to 56 h after hatching survived beyond 144 h and well into the subsequent weeks. Unfed rabbitfish larvae all died at 88 h, while 7 to 12 % of those fed within 32 to 56 h after hatching survived beyond 88 h. A delay in initial feeding of more than 24 h after eye pigmentation and opening of the mouth may be fatal for all three species...|$|R
