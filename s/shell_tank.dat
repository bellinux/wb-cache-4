40|$|During {{most of the}} year, it {{is assumed}} that the vapor space in the 177 {{radioactive}} waste tanks on the Hanford Project site contain a uniform mixture of gases. Several of these waste tanks (currently twenty-five, 6 Double <b>Shell</b> <b>Tanks</b> and 19 Single <b>Shell</b> <b>Tanks)</b> were identified as having the potential for the buildup of gasses to a flammable level. An active ventilation system in the Double <b>Shell</b> <b>Tanks</b> and a passive ventilation system in the Single <b>Shell</b> <b>Tanks</b> provides a method of expelling gasses from the tanks. A gas release from a tank causes a temporary rise in the tank pressure, and a potential for increased concentration of hydrogen gas in the vapor space. The gas is released via the ventilation systems until a uniform gas mixture in the vapor space is once again achieved. The Standard Hydrogen Monitoring System (SHMS) is designed to monitor and quantify the percent hydrogen concentration during these potential gas releases. This document describes the design of the Standard-D Hydrogen Monitoring System, (SHMS-D) and its components as it differs from the original SHMS...|$|R
