This project involved {{the investigation and}} development of a master-slave tractor guidance system. The guidance system developed, which operated the slave tractor, was composed of a <b>sterring</b> control unit and a speed control unit. Large and small-signal mathematical models indicated that a relatively simple control system {{would be capable of}} adequately slaving a tractor-implement unit to an operator controlled unit.

40|$|A {{proposed}} {{holographic memory}} {{system would be}} capable of storing data at unprecedentedly high density, and its data transfer performance in both reading and writing would be characterized by exceptionally high bandwidth. The capabilities of the proposed system would greatly exceed even those of a state-of-the art memory system, based on binary holograms (in which each pixel value represents 0 or 1), that can hold. 1 terabyte of data and can support a reading or writing rate as high as 1 Gb/s. The storage capacity of the state-of-theart system cannot be increased without also increasing the volume and mass of the system. However, in principle, the storage capacity could be increased greatly, without significantly increasing the volume and mass, if multilevel holograms were used instead of binary holograms. For example, a 3 -bit (8 -level) hologram could store 8 terabytes, or an 8 -bit (256 -level) hologram could store 256 terabytes, in a system having little or no more size and mass than does the state-of-the-art 1 -terabyte binary holographic memory. The proposed system would utilize multilevel holograms. The system would include lasers, imaging lenses and other beam-forming optics, a block photorefractive crystal wherein the holograms would be formed, and two multilevel spatial light modulators in the form of commercially available deformable-mirror-device spatial light modulators (DMDSLMs) made for use in high speed input conversion of data up to 12 bits. For readout, the system would also include two arrays of complementary metal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) photodetectors matching the spatial light modulators. The system would further include a reference-beam <b>sterring</b> device (equivalent of a scanning mirror), containing no sliding parts, that could be either a liquid-crystal phased-array device or a microscopic mirror actuated by a high-speed microelectromechanical system. Time-multiplexing and the multilevel nature of the DMDSLM would be exploited to enable writing and reading of multilevel holograms. The DMDSLM would also enable transfer of data at a rate of 7. 6 Gb/s or perhaps somewhat higher...|$|E
40|$|Globally, {{continuing}} professional development(CPD) {{is recognized}} as essential for promoting teacher learning and improving school effectiveness (e. g. Boyle, 2004; Cordingly et al., Gusky, 2000; Powell et al., 2003). Broad attention to CPD exists in many countries. CPD in Saudi Arabia {{is very much in}} its infancy and is characterized by an absence of sustained and progessive opportunites. This thesis seeks to invesitgate the development of a CPD programme that was designed by multiple stakeholders (a Steering Group) for newly qualified teachers (NQTs) in Saudi. The study sought a) to gather the perceptions of the Steering Group concerning their experiences {{in the design of the}} programme, and b) to track a sample of NQTs as they completed the CPD programme, seeking their views on the programme (content,delivery and organization etc.) and also the percieved impact of the prgramme on both their classroom practice and wider professional life in school. A qualitative approach was adopted in this thesis. The study undertaken in this thesis was designed in two phases. The first phase focused on the views and experiences of the 'Steering Group' who collectively designed the programme. In the first phase, data were gathered through dorect observationof the Steering Group planning meetings, and semi-structured interviews with the Steering Group members after the programme had been developed. The second phase involved the implementation of the CPD programme. Five NQTs attended the CPD sessions. They were observed in the CPD sessions and in their classrooms and interviewed across the implementation period and after each classroom observation. NQTs were also asked to keep a reflective diary to record their experiences. Data were analysed inductively using a constant comparison process. A number of themes emerged. the collaborative design process enables many voices to be heard. Data indicated that while individual <b>Sterring</b> Group members initially sought to influence the broader direction of the CPD programme, all participants appreciated opportunities to debate CPD provision. Steering Group members offered many examples of 'new learning' which had emerged as a consequence of working alongside other stakeholders. NQTs were also positive regarding the content, activities and the delivery of the programme, in particular 'open discussion' as one delivery strategy. They were also positive concerning their engagement in the programme. Given that there is no mentoring arranagement in Saudi schools the programme became a place for teachers to talk and to share their experience. Many elements of the programme were taken into the classroom by the NQTs. The study conceptualizes CPD as 'collective authorship'. Serving teacher professional development needs the full engagement of all stakeholders to have a positive effect in Saudi. However, there is much to be learned concerning the'collective authorship' of CPD programmes and the need for a coordinated collaboration between a range of stakeholders with a common interest in new teacher induction and professional development. Close attention needs to be paid to time and resources when developing and implementing such CPD programmes in the future. Suggestions for further research into and development of Saudi CPD are provide...|$|E
