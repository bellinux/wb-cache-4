25|$|The city's {{most popular}} team is the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, {{named after the}} {{distribution}} company the Pittsburgh <b>Steeling</b> company established in 1927. News of the team has preempted news of elections and other events, and {{are important to the}} region and its diaspora. The Steelers have been owned by the Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises. The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972. The team won four Super Bowls in a six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record sixth Super Bowl in 2009. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 they have qualified for the most NFL playoff berths (28) and have played in (15) and hosted (11) the most NFL conference championship games.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{praised the}} episode structure, writing [...] "The quick {{transitions}} and constant back-and-forth movement among subplots generated more energy that, {{when combined with}} several characters we either didn't know before or hadn't {{seen in a long}} time, made [...] "The Broken Man" [...] feel livelier." [...] Similarly, Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph also praised the episode, noting, [...] "Once again there was a sense Game of Thrones was <b>steeling</b> itself for battles - and expensive set-pieces - chugging down the track. A storm is brewing - for now, we were invited to enjoy what remains of the calm." [...] Jen Chaney of Vulture also felt the episode was more of a set up episode for storylines to be resolved in the close of the season, writing [...] "Although two bombs get dropped in this week's episode of Game of Thrones, it's an hour focused on putting the narrative chess pieces into place. [...] "The Broken Man" [...] doesn't finish off any of its major moves. Those bold turns are yet to come." ...|$|E
500|$|Eagle Claw Grandmasters Leung Shum and Lily Lau believe [...] "Jow Tong" [...] (the Cantonese {{rendering}} of his name) was a monk who brought young Yue to the Shaolin Monastery and taught him {{a set of}} hand techniques, which Yue later adapted to create his Ying Kuen (Eagle fist). Liang Shouyu states practitioners of Emei Dapeng Qigong believe Yue trained under Zhou {{as a child and}} competed to become China's top fighter at an early age. Their lineage story dictates Zhou also took Yue to a [...] "Buddhist hermit" [...] who taught him said qigong style. Northern Praying Mantis Master Yuen Mankai says Zhou taught Yue the [...] "same school" [...] of martial arts as he did his Water Margin students and that the General was the originator of the praying mantis technique [...] "Black Tiger <b>Steeling</b> Heart". Although Martial arts historian Stanley Henning admits that Yue's biographies do not mention boxing, he says [...] "he [...] almost certainly did practice some form of bare handed fighting" [...] to prepare for his weapons training. But he does not suggest who Yue might have learned it from.|$|E

500|$|The {{cancelled}} {{journey was}} the beginning of the end. A crying, defiant Bosse went off by herself to the seaside resort Hornbæk in Denmark, a much shorter trip, but to her senses, a delightfully refreshing one. [...] There, she was soon followed by Strindberg's letters, full of agonized remorse at having given her pain, and then by Strindberg himself, <b>steeling</b> himself to bear the social life Bosse relished. However, the relationship quickly foundered on jealousy and suspicion, as when Strindberg struck a photographer over the head with his stick, unable to endure any attention to Bosse. In August, when Bosse discovered that she was pregnant, even Strindberg's delight (he was a fond parent of the four children of his previous marriages) could not save a marriage full of distrust and accusation. [...] This was illustrated in Strindberg's increasingly frantic letters to Bosse When their daughter Anne-Marie was born on 25 March 1902, they were already living apart. [...] "For the sake of us both it is best that I do not return", wrote Bosse in a letter to Strindberg. [...] "A continuation of life together with suspicion of every word, every act of mine, would be the end of me." [...] At her insistence, Strindberg began divorce proceedings.|$|E
