5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> diverged {{from the main}} lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been driven by competition for resources but instead {{by the fact that}} each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E

5|$|The pre-273 {{walls were}} narrow and while {{encircling}} the whole city, {{they do not}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> provided real protection against an invasion. No signs of towers or fortified gates exist and it cannot be proven that the walls enclosed the city as many gaps appears to have never been defended. The earlier walls <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{designed to protect the}} city against Bedouins and to provide a costume barrier.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on current}} fossil {{evidence}} from dinosaurs such as Oryctodromeus, some ornithischian species <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> led a partially fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. Many modern birds are arboreal (tree climbing), {{and this was}} also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines. While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including dromaeosaurids such as Microraptor) most non-avialan dinosaurs <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved {{on the ground is}} key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, pioneered by Robert McNeill Alexander, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float.|$|E
5|$|Created and {{expanded}} {{from the core}} troops of the Emperor's personal bodyguards, the central field armies by 295AD <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been too large to be accounted for as simple bodyguard forces, but were still {{too small to be}} able to campaign independently of legionary or vexillation support.|$|E
5|$|Fleshy lobe-fins {{supported}} on bones rather than ray-stiffened fins <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been an ancestral trait of all bony fishes (Osteichthyes). The lobe-finned {{ancestors of the}} tetrapods evolved them further, while the ancestors of the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) evolved their fins in a different direction. The most primitive group of actinopterygians, the bichirs, still have fleshy frontal fins.|$|E

5|$|From 1947 to 1960 {{the country}} {{seems to have}} been divided into three major {{military}} regions: Cluj, Bacău, and Bucharest in the west, east, and south, respectively. In wartime the land forces in each military region would become an army corps with their headquarters in Cluj-Napoca, Iaşi, and Bucharest. Armies <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> succeeded military regions in 1960, and three armies <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> become four in 1980. What is known is that on 01.07.1947 Fourth Army became 3rd Military Region, based in Cluj. The 3rd Military Region became the 3rd Army on 30 April 1960, and the 4th Army on 5 April 1980.|$|E
5|$|From various {{symbolic}} motifs the tapestries <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been made}} to celebrate a marriage, probably that of Anne of Brittany (1477–1514) and Louis XII of France (1462–1515).

30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the four {{analyses}} just outlined differ a lot. Nevertheless, the non-uniqueness theory considers all of them to be legitimate, because each <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> its own advantage. For example, the “finest” analysis <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the best phonemic economy (although it assumes an oversized syllable structure), and the CVX analysis <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the most consistent syllable structure (although it has the largest consonant inventory). There <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be no consistent set of criteria that all approaches can be measured against.|$|R

5|$|On Baldwin's {{death the}} castle was {{inherited}} by his daughter, Adeliza, {{but the family}} appear to have taken {{little interest in the}} property. Okehampton Castle does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> played a part in the civil war from 1139 and 1153 known as the Anarchy.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{although}} Oswald {{was active in}} promoting cults, he does not generally <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> used relic collecting {{as a means of}} gaining control of the assets of secular communities, and Dunstan displayed no interest in relics.|$|E

5|$|Schubert's piano sonatas <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been mostly}} {{neglected}} {{during the entire}} nineteenth century, often dismissed for being too long, lacking in formal coherence, being un-pianistic, etc. However, references to the last sonatas can be found among two nineteenth-century Romantic composers who took serious interest in Schubert's music and were influenced by it: Schumann and Brahms.|$|E
