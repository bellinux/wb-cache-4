5|$|The {{privilege}} of flying the national flag on vehicles {{is restricted to}} the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister, Governors and Lieutenant Governors of states, Chief Ministers, Union Ministers, members of the Parliament of India and state legislatures of the Indian states (Vidhan Sabha and Vidhan Parishad), judges of the Supreme Court of India and High Courts, and flag officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force. The flag has to be flown from a staff affixed firmly either on the middle front or to the front right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> When a foreign dignitary travels in a car provided by government, the flag should be flown on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> while {{the flag of the}} foreign country should be flown on the left side.|$|E
5|$|The Daniel S. Schanck Observatory is {{a former}} astronomical {{observatory}} on the Queens Campus of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States. It is located along George Street near the corner with Hamilton Street at the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park to Kirkpatrick Chapel, to the northwest of Old Queens and Geology Hall.|$|E
5|$|Troop sleepers, {{generally}} {{intended for}} use by enlisted personnel, were equipped with bunks stacked 3-high, and slept 29 servicemen plus the Pullman porter. Every passenger was provided with a separate Pullman bed, complete with sheets and pillowcases that were changed daily. The berths were {{laid out in a}} cross-wise arrangement that placed the aisle along one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> as opposed to down the center. Though the upper berths were fixed, the middle and lower sections could be reconfigured into seating during the daytime. Weapon racks were provided for each group of berths. Four washstands (two mounted {{at each end of the}} car) delivered hot and cold running water. The cars also came outfitted with two enclosed toilets and a drinking water cooler.|$|E
5000|$|Engine {{sizes were}} also on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> towards <b>the</b> front {{just above the}} {{auxiliary}} indicator lights as such: ...|$|R
50|$|Nuna 2 {{was fitted}} with 3000 solar cells {{mounted on the}} top and <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>The</b> solar array was {{covering}} a total area of 9 m2, which is 1 m2 more than on the Nuna 1.|$|R
50|$|Petty co-crew chiefs Robin Pemberton and Larry Pollard {{stated that}} during the last pit stop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race they put softer {{compound}} bias-ply tires designed for <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> on <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Petty's race <b>car.</b> <b>The</b> softer left side tires provided more traction when attached to <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a stock car and worked best when used during cool cloudy weather days which prevents the softer tires from quickly wearing out if mounted on <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{starting}} in 2014, drivers have a winner's decal placed behind the driver's {{name on the}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> for each race victory they earn during the season.|$|E
25|$|Some {{parts are}} also much simpler {{than those of}} its competitors. For example, {{rear-view}} mirrors are symmetrical {{and can be used}} on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> the windshield is flatter than usual, and the dashboard is a single injection-molded piece.|$|E
25|$|A Drawing Room is a {{relatively}} rare accommodation for three people traveling together, again with a washbasin and private toilet, again on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Even rarer are larger rooms accommodating four or more; generally the needs of large parties were better served with multiple rooms, {{with or without the}} ability to combine them into a suite.|$|E
5000|$|Exterior - The {{front panel}} and grille looks similar on both cars, but is different. The {{stainless}} trim along <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> is also different.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> lateral {{location}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roll center is typically at <b>the</b> center-line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle when the suspension {{on the left}} and right <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> are mirror images of each other.|$|R
50|$|In 1910, a 17-year-old girl, Louise Koch {{was killed}} after {{falling from the}} Backety-Back Scenic Railway. The coaster had minimal safety features, and the only {{restraints}} were <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> themselves.|$|R
25|$|Designation of routes was by a {{lettered}} {{destination board}} on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> above the windows, and {{the cars were}} painted various colours denoting the routes on which they worked. The Trent Bridge and Station St services were all over yellow, the Carrington and Forest Rd services were white and red and the Basford service was white and dark blue.|$|E
25|$|Hernández, who {{was also}} {{severely}} wounded, continued firing at the police from under his car. A police officer and a detective from La Fortaleza with submachine guns approached the car and fired upon Hernández, Carlos Hiraldo Resto and Torres Medina. Both Carlos Hiraldo Resto and Torres Medina were killed, and their motionless bodies were by the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
25|$|Compartments and Double Bedrooms {{are private}} rooms for two passengers, with {{upper and lower}} berths, washbasins, and private toilets, placed on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> with the {{corridor}} running {{down the other side}} (thus allowing the accommodation to be slightly over two thirds the width of the car). Frequently, these accommodations have movable partitions allowing adjacent accommodations to be combined into a suite.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> maroon {{sleeping}} <b>cars</b> from 1949 onwards were 16 in number, later 18, {{and were}} given Aboriginal names that were painted on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> <b>The</b> eight roomette <b>cars</b> were Allambi, Chalaki, Juki, Mururi, Nankuri, Purpawi, Tantini, and Tarkinji; <b>the</b> ten twinette <b>cars</b> Dorai, Kuldalai, Malkari, Mokai, Nomuldi, Paiti, Tawarri, Weroni, Yankai, and Yanni.|$|R
50|$|The Flux is also {{featured}} as downloadable content for Project Gotham Racing 4, {{where it can}} be noticed that in <b>the</b> right hand <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> dashboard, there is an Xbox 360 console.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} and exterior of a Flivver Lo-V was similar to <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IRT fleet that predated it. Individual, square rattan seats were arranged in a longitudinal seating pattern along <b>the</b> <b>side</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Three doors on each side - two at the end vestibules {{and one in the}} center - provided for entrance and exit from <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Incandescent lighting was used, and paddle ceiling fans cooled <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Clerestory style vents in the upper roof opened for additional airflow. The carbody was made entirely of steel, with drop sash windows running down <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> used metal signage displayed in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> windows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to indicate destinations and route. Kerosene lamps were displayed on <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> trains as running lights - white for <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train and red for the rear.|$|R
25|$|Technology {{moved forward}} {{in the rest of}} the world. The first halogen lamp for vehicle {{headlamp}} use, the H1, was introduced in 1962 by a European consortium of bulb and headlamp makers. Shortly thereafter, headlamps using the new light source were introduced in Europe. These were effectively prohibited in the US, where standard-size sealed beam headlamps were mandatory and intensity regulations were low. US lawmakers faced pressure to act, both due to lighting effectiveness and vehicle aerodynamics/fuel savings. High beam peak intensity, capped at 140,000 candela per <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in Europe, was limited in the United States to 37,500 candela on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> until 1978, when the limit was raised to 75,000. An increase in high beam intensity to take advantage of the higher allowance could not be achieved without a move to halogen technology, and so sealed beam headlamps with internal halogen burners became available for use on 1979 models in the United States. Halogen sealed beams now dominate the sealed beam market, which has declined steeply since replaceable-bulb headlamps were permitted in 1983.|$|E
25|$|Within {{two minutes}} of crashing, Senna was {{extracted}} from his race car by Watkins and his medical team, including intensive care anaesthetist Giovanni Gordini. Initial treatment took place by the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> with Senna having a weak heartbeat and significant blood loss (around 4.5 liters). Because of Senna's poor neurological condition, Watkins performed an on-site tracheotomy and requested the immediate airlifting of Senna to Bologna's Maggiore Hospital {{under the supervision of}} Gordini.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major problem}} {{has been that the}} safety foam used in the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> has caught fire, engulfing the driver's cockpit with smoke. NASCAR decided to make {{modifications}} before the April 21 Subway Fresh Fit 500 in Avondale, Arizona. An additional side effect of the foam occurred during side-impacts, as Brian Vickers experienced at Watkins Glen, when the foam would be sheared out of the car leaving debris on the racetrack.|$|E
50|$|The 14 {{shared with}} several {{previous}} Renault models a {{rear suspension system}} using two full-width torsion bars positioned one behind the other, along with the resulting wheelbase difference of more than 1 inch (32 mm) between {{the left and right}} <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
50|$|Styling {{also changed}} somewhat. A {{fiberglass}} overlay {{on the hood}} was added, which covered {{a hole in the}} hood that was needed to clear the supercharger, which was mounted high on <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine. The tailfins, now made of metal, were concave and swept out from <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>The</b> fins were outlined in chrome trim and normally were painted a contrasting color, although some solid-color Golden Hawks were built.|$|R
50|$|Distinguishing the Mark VII M {{from its}} predecessor, {{circular}} grilles over the horns were installed below the headlights in place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former integrated auxiliary lamps, which were moved slightly further apart and {{mounted on the}} bumper. Both bumpers now wrapped further around <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
25|$|Compared to the {{previous}} model, stability improved {{through the use of}} wider tracks a longer wheelbase and four-channel ABS disc brakes with traction control. Usable boot space increased to 541 litres. Cornering lights were provided integrated into the front fog light assembly- these cornering lights were illuminated whenever the indicator was operating on that <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> illuminating a turning path for the driver. Electrochromatic rear view mirror sensed headlight glare from vehicles travelling behind, and automatically adjusts mirror glass tint level to reduce driver glare.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, the StVZO (Road Traffic Licensing Regulations) {{calls for}} a {{different}} function also known as parking lamps: With the vehicle's ignition switched off, the operator may activate a low-intensity light at the front (white) and rear (red) on either the left or the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> This function is used when parking in narrow unlit streets to provide parked-vehicle conspicuity to approaching drivers. This function, which is optional under UN and US regulations, is served passively and without power consumption in the United States by the mandatory side marker retroreflectors.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} a pseudovector is angular {{velocity}}. Driving in a car, and looking forward, each of the wheels has an angular velocity vector pointing to the left. If the world is reflected in a mirror which switches {{the left and right}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> the reflection of this angular velocity vector points to the right, but the actual angular velocity vector of the wheel still points to the left, corresponding to the minus sign. Other examples of pseudovectors include magnetic field, torque, or more generally any cross product of two (true) vectors.|$|E
25|$|Originally flatcars {{fitted with}} cabins or {{modified}} box cars, they later became purpose-built with projections above or to <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to allow crew {{to observe the}} train from shelter. The caboose also served as the conductor's office, and on long routes included accommodation and cooking facilities.|$|R
50|$|The Diablo SV SE35 {{introduced}} in 1999 as a limited-production special model, build by Swiss Lamborghini importer Roland Affolter, {{to commemorate the}} company's 35th anniversary. Produced in very limited numbers of just 9 cars. It is recognisable by the bull (from the logo) on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R

25|$|In the extended-vision or wide-vision caboose, {{the sides}} of the cupola project beyond the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> body. Rock Island created some of these by {{rebuilding}} some standard cupola cabooses with windowed extensions applied to {{the sides of}} the cupola itself, but by far, the greatest number have the entire cupola compartment enlarged. This model was introduced by the International Car Company and saw service on most U.S. railroads. The expanded cupola allowed the crew to see past the top of the taller cars that began to appear after World War II, and also increased the roominess of the cupola area.|$|E
25|$|Caltrain has 93 Nippon Sharyo bi-level Gallery-type {{cars and}} 41 Bombardier BiLevel Coaches in revenue service as of 2017. Revenue train {{consists}} {{are made of}} single type of cars; the Bombardier cars are never mixed with the Nippon-Sharyo gallery cars. Of the Gallery cars, 66 are coaches and 27 are bike-accessible cab cars. Caltrans purchased the first 63 gallery cars in 1985 when it began subsidizing the commuter rail service. The other 30 were purchased by Caltrain in 2000, and the older cars were rebuilt by Nippon Sharyo around the same time. Each gallery car has one set of exit doors on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
25|$|At about 10.30 Mr. Alderman Gilpin, {{chairman}} of the company, and several other directors made their appearance, {{and a few minutes}} later the car, drawn by a couple of powerful horses, went sliding along Carrington-street to the Midland and nearly to the Great Northern Railway Stations. Pleased with the sight, the people ran by the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and not a few hailed the conductor to stop and take them up. Having returned to the end of Station-street, the car was run along Arkwright-street to the Trent Bridge. Considering that the metals are new and not so clean as they will be kept in a few days, the car went along very pleasantly indeed.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the late}} 1970s, almost all regular {{passenger}} automobiles had rain gutters. These gutters are {{formed by the}} welded flange (raised rim or lip) {{on the left and}} right <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> metal roof panel. This made attaching an accessory or aftermarket roof rack a relatively simple process.|$|R
5000|$|SP {{rolled out}} Pullman-built [...] "Gallery" [...] cars with two {{passenger}} decks in 1955; {{passengers on the}} upper deck sat on two balconies along <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> and <b>the</b> center aisle was open to allow conductors to check tickets on both levels without having to ascend stairs.|$|R
60|$|Neale {{was about}} to ride his frantic horse {{straight}} into the work-train. Desperately he hauled the horse up and leaped off. Larry was down, waiting, and his mount went plunging away. Bullets were pattering against <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> from which puffed streaks of flame and smoke.|$|R
