LMN received several design awards for their work on the station, including a International Architecture Award from the Chicago Athenaeum, an Award of Merit from the Seattle chapter of the American Institute of Architects, and an Honorable Mention in the Fast Co.Design Innovation By Design Awards. One major component of the station's architecture is the [...] "chamber"-like mezzanine, which contains the station's <b>sole</b> <b>piece</b> of public art: Subterraneum by Leo Saul Berk.

One noted poet of this era, somewhere in the fourth century, was Su Hui, a poet of the Former Qin state (351-394), which unified northern China, in 376.

The TCU was composed of a UHF antenna, transceiver, modem, buffer and control unit. The buffer was designed for a full line length of 80 characters, which allowed handling of both the 40- and 80-character fixed-length packets defined for the system. The typical user terminal in the original system consisted of a Teletype Model 33 or a dumb CRT user terminal connected to the TCU using a standard RS-232C interface. Shortly after the original ALOHA network went into operation, the TCU was redesigned {{with one of the}} first Intel microprocessors, and the resulting upgrade was called a PCU (Programmable Control Unit).|$|E
50|$|After Sadat’s {{release of}} the Islamicist prisoners, old members of the Brotherhood asked for state {{recognition}} of their group, and although Sadat never agreed to their requests he did grant them the privilege to publish a monthly magazine, Al-Da'wa.

Al-Da'wa became a vehicle for the Islamicist movement to reach the general public, and it allowed them to express their intentions and goals on a variety of subjects including social, political, economic, and religious issues. Finally, Al-Da'wa was not the <b>sole</b> <b>piece</b> of Islamicist press, but the magazine was popular enough amongst this community that it could serve as a sounding board to judge reactions of the current activities. Al-Da'wa is just another example where the “desire to distinguish the just struggle against interfactional strift, ”but it also gave “unreserved support” {{to the members of the}} Brotherhood.|$|E

During the Battle of the Nive in December 1813, Ross had his horse shot out from under him, but he was unharmed and in April 1814 he fought at the Battle of Bayonne. Following these military successes, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 4 January 1815. During the Hundred Days, Ross was engaged at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, and although half his guns were disabled, the remainder took part in the pursuit of the French. He was awarded the Russian Order of St. Anna, 2nd Class on 8 October 1815.|$|R

50|$|After his {{resignation}} from the U.S. Army, Julius A. De Lagnel was appointed a captain of artillery in the Regular Army of the Confederate States. In June 1861, {{he was assigned}} as chief of artillery to Brigadier General Robert S. Garnett, commander of the Army of the Northwest. Garnett {{had been sent to}} reorganize the Confederate force in the western counties of Virginia after their rout at the Battle of Philippi and to hold the area for the Confederacy. De Lagnel defended the crest of Rich Mountain with a force of four companies and one gun during the Battle of Rich Mountain, July 11, 1861. The main Confederate force did not immediately know that De Lagnel's men were under attack by a superior force commanded by Brigadier General William S. Rosecrans. De Lagnel's force eventually was overwhelmed. After De Lagnel used the <b>sole</b> artillery <b>piece</b> to fight by himself for a period of time, he was wounded and hid in a thicket in an effort to escape from the Union troops. He first escaped from the battlefield to a mountaineer's cabin. After two days of recuperation, he tried to return to Confederate lines disguised as a herder. Union troops detected, identified and captured him near Laurel Hill, Virginia on July 13, 1861. On December 18, 1861, De Lagnel was exchanged for Union Brigadier General James B. Ricketts.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, Haleʻole began writing Ke Kaao o Laieikawai (later {{translated}} as The Hawaiian Romance of Laieikawai), {{based on a}} traditional kaʻao about the princess Lāʻieikawai, a narrative rehearsed in prose and interspersed with songs handed down orally by ancient Hawaiian storytellers. It was first printed as a serial in the Hawaiian newspaper Ka Nupepa Kuokoa and later published in 1863 as a book. It was the first fictional work of literature produced by a Native Hawaiian. After his death, it was revised in 1885 and translated by Martha Warren Beckwith in 1918. Beckwith stated:The romance of Laieikawai therefore remains the <b>sole</b> <b>piece</b> of Hawaiian imaginative writing to reach book form. Not only this, but it represents the single composition of a Polynesian mind working upon the material of an old legend and eager to create a genuine national literature. As such it claims a kind of classic interest.|$|E
5000|$|For 1977, the [...] "Group 44" [...] racing {{team had}} a very {{successful}} season in Trans Am with a race car based on the actual production XJ-S chassis and running gear. The team won the series' 1977 drivers' championship cup for Bob Tullius but missed winning the manufacturer's title by two points (only one Jaguar was competing in the Trans-Am series compared to many more Porsche entrants). In 1978, a purpose-built tube-frame [...] "silhouette" [...] style XJS race car was constructed which greatly reduced the weight compared to the full production chassis car campaigned in 1977.

50|$|Alpine: One {{problem with}} 1960s release {{bindings}} {{was that the}} boots were not standardized, and a binding that worked well on one boot might be dangerous on another, or might become dangerous over time as the boot shifted about. This led {{to the introduction of}} plate bindings, which used a metal plate firmly clipped to the sole of the boot, and bindings that clamped onto the plate. The plate could be easily removed for walking about. Plate bindings were popular in the US in the 1970s, notably the BURT Retractable Bindings and Spademan binding, but never caught on in any major way in Europe. As {{more and more of the}} alpine skiing market came under control of European companies, the plate bindings disappeared, in spite of their excellent safety records. The disappearance of the plate and alternate systems was due to a combination of factors, notably the introduction of standardized hard plastic boots. Plastic was first introduced by Lange as a way of improving existing leather designs. As the new material spread through the industry, the <b>sole</b> <b>piece</b> was standardized to allow toe-and-heel bindings to clip on. Plastic had the advantages of being much firmer than leather, not changing shape over time, and having predictable friction characteristics wet or dry. Although plate bindings of the era had much better safety records, notably the Spademan design, the new boots and bindings could be easily adapted to any ski for any skier.|$|E
