40|$|Abstract—Knowledge of factors, which {{influence}} {{stress and}} its distribution, is of key {{importance to the}} successful production of durable restorations. One {{of this is the}} marginal geometry. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate, by finite element analysis (FEA), the influence of different marginal designs on the stress distribution in teeth prepared for cast metal crowns. Five margin designs were taken into consideration: shoulderless, chamfer, shoulder, <b>sloped</b> <b>shoulder</b> and shoulder with bevel. For each kind of preparation three dimensional finite element analyses were initiated. Maximal equivalent stresses were calculated and stress patterns were represented in order to compare the marginal designs. Within the limitation of this study, the shoulder and beveled shoulder margin preparations of the teeth are preferred for cast metal crowns from biomechanical point of view.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a computational tool for auto-segmenting {{the distribution of}} brain infusions observed by magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical usage of direct infusion is increasing as physicians recognize the need to attain high drug concentrations in the target structure with minimal off-target exposure. By co-infusing a Gadolinium-based contrast agent and visualizing the distribution using real-time using magnetic resonance imaging, physicians can make informed decisions about when to stop or adjust the infusion. However, manual segmentation of the images is tedious and affected by subjective preferences for window levels, image interpolation and personal biases about where to delineate {{the edge of the}} <b>sloped</b> <b>shoulder</b> of the infusion. This study {{presents a}} computational technique that uses a Gaussian Mixture Model to efficiently classify pixels as belonging to either the high-intensity infusate or low-intensity background. The algorithm was implemented as a distributable plug-in for the widely used imaging platform OsiriX®. Four independent operators segmented fourteen anonymized datasets to validate the tool's performance. The datasets were intra-operative magnetic resonance images of infusions into the thalamus or putamen of non-human primates. The tool effectively reproduced the manual segmentation volumes, while significantly reducing intra-operator variability by 67 ± 18 %. The tool will be used to increase efficiency and reduce variability in upcoming clinical trials in neuro-oncology and gene therapy...|$|E

Although from a non-fashion point of view they are generally for people with narrow or <b>sloping</b> <b>shoulders,</b> there are also quite a few cases in which shoulder pads will be necessary for a suit or blazer in order to compensate for certain fabrics' natural properties, most notably suede blazers, due to the weight of the material.
