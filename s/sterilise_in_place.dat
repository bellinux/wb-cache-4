Although ethylene oxide is recognised as a reproductive toxicant in humans, so far few studies have been carried out to investigate the association between exposure to ethylene oxide and the occurrence of adverse reproductive outcomes (Hemminki et al 1982 and 1983; Rowland et al, 1996; Yakubova et al, 1976). The results of these studies suggested that ethylene oxide is capable of causing reproductive dysfunction and that further research is needed in order to understand its effects on reproductive health. This study investigated the association between exposure to ethylene oxide during pregnancy and adverse reproductive outcome <b>in</b> women <b>sterilising</b> staff working <b>in</b> <b>sterilising</b> units using ethylene oxide in Gauteng province, South Africa. The study had the following objectives: 1) to describe the extent and nature of ethylene oxide use <b>in</b> <b>sterilising</b> units operational <b>in</b> medical facilities in Gauteng; 2) to assess the current exposure to ethylene oxide <b>in</b> <b>sterilising</b> units <b>in</b> Gauteng; 3) to collect information on the last recognised pregnancy using a questionnaire; 4) to assess the validity of the information on the evolution and outcome of the last recognised pregnancy collected by the means of the questionnaire; 5) to assess the association between occupational exposure to ethylene oxide during pregnancy and adverse reproductive outcome. The study population was represented by singleton pregnancies that: 1) occurred in women currently working <b>in</b> <b>sterilising</b> units using ethylene oxide in Gauteng province, South Africa; 2) were the last recognised pregnancy occurring in these women after the 1 st January 1992; 3) occurred while the mother was employed. The adverse reproductive outcome was defined as the occurrence of any the following: spontaneous abortion, still birth, pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortion or still birth), low birth weight and combined adverse reproductive outcome (spontaneous abortion, still birth or low birth weight).

40|$|Aseptic {{processing}} involves sterilising {{the product}} (most meat products being low-acid foods containing particulates) and package separately, and filling under sterile conditions. Advantages include better product quality compared with canned products, lower {{transport and storage}} costs compared with frozen products, and virtually no restriction on package size. Problems include ensuring adequate heat penetration into the particles to ensure sterility, preventing separation of particles from the carrier liquid, and retention of particle structure and shape. Particulate foods can be <b>sterilised</b> <b>in</b> scraped-surface heat exchangers. Other methods involve heating the particles separately, and combining them during filling. The effects of aseptic processing on meat product quality (colour, flavour, texture, and mutrition) are outlined in this paper...|$|R

The pieces of wood were then placed on 2 % malt extract agar (MEA) and incubated at 20 °C in the dark. Mycelial growth {{that emerged from the}} wood sample was subcultured onto fresh MEA and N. fuckeliana was identified visually, based on the morphological characteristics of the Acremonium anamorph.

The product of the ma. ster. waste, the so-called fluff (sterile and fluffy particles), possesses an average LHV of 25. 3 MJ kg- 1. Preliminary lab studies demonstrated the feasibility of transforming the fluff into a syngas with an average LHV of 15 MJ Nm- 3.

50|$|Normally rabbit {{vibrators}} {{are made}} out of a jelly-like substance (polyvinyl chloride), silicone (semi-organic polymer), rubber (elastic hydrocarbon polymer) or latex (natural rubber) materials. Silicone vibrators are easier to clean and care for, since this material is not porous, therefore no bacteria or foreign matter is absorbed by the toy. Silicone retains heat and has no odour. Jelly material is porous and cannot be <b>sterilised</b> <b>in</b> boiling water and has a scent of rubber that some find unappealing. In order to escape this smell some producers aromatise the products with more pleasurable scents. Rabbit vibrators made from vinyl, plastic, metal, and elastomer materials can be also found. They are much less porous than jelly, or entirely non-porous, but the texture is smooth and firm.|$|R

Taking into account the cooling phase, the sterility value was calculated {{as a function of}} position in order to identify the location of the least lethality point. The most important variables affecting the position of this point are the product heating rate and the surface heat transfer coefficients. For low heating rate values this critical point moves towards the surface.

The act of injecting something into the body is a potent symbol of medicine and patients or their mothers, will often demand an injection and go to someone who will give it, for consultations without treatment are not paid. But injections require needles and syringes which are expensive and, like the medicines which are injected, must also be sterile. If they are re-used they must be properly cleaned and <b>sterilised.</b> <b>In</b> one study, needles had been reused twenty five times, but each syringe was reused for over seven hundred patients. As the needle is withdrawn, small amounts of blood are drawn in and if the patient is infected with HIV or hepatitis virus, the next person may be infected. Drug users draw blood into the syringe to rinse out any left over drug before re-injecting. Especially in prisons where syringes are forbidden, this habit leads to epidemics o...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{study of}} the {{complications}} after sterilisation 485 of the 547 women who had been sterilised by a modified Pomeroy procedure in one unit over 10 years were interviewed. They were asked whether they regretted being sterilised and about the quality of their sex lives, mental health, social relationships, and marriages. Most women were pleased to have been sterilised, only 24 regretting it. Regret was more pronounced among women who had been <b>sterilised</b> <b>in</b> association with a third caesarean section, those sterilised for medical reasons, and those whose marriages had ended in divorce. In each case where a woman regretted a sterilisation that had been performed on the recommendation of a psychiatrist, the psychiatrists were still prepared to defent their opinions. On their sex lives, mental health, social relationships, and marriages, more women reported improvement than deterioration, and in most cases the deterioration could not be attributed to the sterilisation. The overall benefits from sterilisation to the women in this series therefore seemed to outweigh substantially the adverse consequences experienced by a few...|$|R
40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is a {{chemical}} used {{primarily as a}} monomer {{in the production of}} polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Polycarbonate plastics are rigid plastics sometimes used for food contact materials, including drink bottles. Epoxy resins are used for lining tin cans. Three major types of resin are used for food cans where the food is <b>sterilised</b> <b>in</b> the can namely; epoxyphenolic, PVC organosol and polyester phenolic. Of these coatings, the epoxyphenolic is the most important and is used where the can is made of two or three pieces, particularly shallow draw, 2 piece cans such as those used for canned fish. BPA is a starting substance used in the manufacture of most types of epoxy resins but is not normally present in PVC organosol coatings.

[...] A gynaecologist doctor who worked KKH recalled sterilisation rates became [...] "sky high" [...] after the disincentives had been implemented; it was common for hospital workers to chide women who were pregnant with third-order or higher births, recommending abortions, while such women talked about their pregnancy [...] "if they committed a crime". The Straits Times also suggested the disincentives had been very effective; one woman cited how sterilisation certification had to be shown to a school for a third child to receive priority, while she and four out of five sisters eventually underwent sterilisation. Expensive delivery fees ("accouchement fees") for third-order and higher births would also be waived with sterilisation.|$|R
