5|$|In {{an attempt}} to imitate the {{conventions}} of silent cinema in its infancy, the staging and acting of the film are exaggerated and artificial. The equipment used by Acevedo had limitations, causing the indoor <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> be underexposed and the outdoor <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> be overexposed. The Pathé camera did not allow camera movement, had imprecise definition, and dark rendering. The Kodak Ektachrome lacked a large depth of field, producing a flat image, and required good lighting to operate effectively. Overhead shots are most commonly used, with some medium shots and {{a small number of}} large shots.|$|E
5|$|The film {{contains}} around fifty {{shots with}} computer-generated imagery. Alfredson {{wanted to make}} them very subtle and almost unnoticeable. The sequence where multiple cats attack Virginia, {{one of the most}} complicated <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> film, required several weeks of drafting and planning. The crew used a combination of real cats, stuffed cats and computer-generated imagery.|$|E
5|$|When she was 13, Ludwick {{played the}} {{character}} Yumi in thirteen, a 2003 autobiographical drama film based on American film actress Nikki Reed's {{experiences as a}} 12 and 13-year-old girl. About a year later, Ludwick appeared on Movie Surfers, a Disney Channel mini-show where four teenagers go behind the <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> report on Walt Disney-related films.|$|E

5|$|Arrow Books also {{released}} a novelisation of the 1979 Quatermass serial, written by Kneale. This was written during production, and contained many additional scenes and extra background detail {{not included in}} the original scripts. Kneale offered many of these new <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> the producers of the television version, but by this stage {{it was too late for}} them to be incorporated.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond said that, {{during the}} time of {{shooting}} for the film, Spielberg got more ideas by watching movies every night which in turn extended the production schedule because he was continually adding new <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> be filmed. Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on Jaws. In her 1991 book You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a cocaine addiction. Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a perfectionist.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to drown out the noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E
50|$|Whereas in a {{pinhole camera}} the hole allows rays {{of light from}} {{different}} parts of the <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> reach different parts of the film, the obstruction in the pinspeck camera causes the shadow of different points in the <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> fall on different points on the film. The result is a negative image.|$|R

5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Ludwick {{appeared}} as the character Yumi in thirteen, an autobiographical drama film based on American film actress Nikki Reed's {{experiences as a}} 12 and 13-year-old girl. In 2004, Ludwick appeared on Movie Surfers, a Disney Channel mini-show where four teenagers go behind the <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> report on Walt Disney-related films. Three years later in June 2007, Ludwick began work on Teen Witch the Musical, a stage musical based on the 1989 fantasy-comedy film Teen Witch.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, The Guardian {{reported}} that British screenwriter Rupert Walters {{was writing a}} movie based on Riefenstahl's life which would star actress Jodie Foster. The project did not receive Riefenstahl's approval prior to her death, as Riefenstahl asked for a veto on any <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> which she did not agree. Riefenstahl also wanted Sharon Stone to play her rather than Foster, which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the project.|$|E

Blacks {{of bright}} personality, not <b>to</b> play in <b>scenes</b> devoted <b>to</b> {{logistic}} support such as handling of Seagull Floater mainly, do the rescue at the forefront, {{but it is}} a <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> report to XIG the survival of Yoneda that crashed in episode 48.|$|R

5|$|It was {{reported}} by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don a fat suit for flashback <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> his fat childhood, though this was unfounded as Will's weight was merely referred to on screen. Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance, {{though he did not}} go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience. When questioned about his appearance in the show, Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game, though added that he liked the series anyway. The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals.|$|E
5|$|Ottman {{said the}} {{challenge}} on Valkyrie {{was to create}} tension from dialogue scenes, and he often reshaped <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> do this: moments rather than whole scenes were cut from the film. Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes, but {{he was able to}} choose what lines and close-ups he could focus on. Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to delete was a scene where von Stauffenberg dances with his wife because he had been looking forward to scoring it.|$|E
5|$|The {{adaptation}} to the screen has continued with the trend of including new <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> flesh out characters that in the book are only superficially seen through {{the point of view}} characters. These include the dialectical confrontation between Littlefinger and Varys, and the conversation between King Robert and Queen Cersei, and the young lovers Renly and Loras. The show's writers used this opportunity to make explicit Loras and Renly's ongoing assignations, which were only hinted at in the books.|$|E

5|$|The {{animation}} {{team for}} The Prince of Egypt, including 350 artists from 34 different nations, was primarily recruited both from Walt Disney Feature Animation, which had fallen under Katzenberg's auspices while at The Walt Disney Company, and from Amblimation, a defunct division of Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. As at Disney's, character animators were grouped into teams by character: for example, Kristof Serrand, as the supervising animator of Older Moses, set the acting {{style of the}} character and assigned <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> his team. Consideration was given to properly depicting the ethnicities of the ancient Egyptians, Hebrews, and Nubians seen in the film.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{antagonistic}} bug {{creature was}} created {{by means of a}} prosthetic suit that was worn by a stuntwoman. The suit was highly ridiculed behind the <b>scenes.</b> <b>To</b> fix the perceived issues with the monster, the production team gave the film to visual effects editor Laurie Kallsen-George, who digitally altered the footage until it was deemed suitable. The episode's title is a reference to Folie à deux, a form of insanity shared by two people. It usually begins with one person who conceives of a delusional belief and then spreads it to another; thus, those two share the same delusion.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tried to}} capture {{the feel of the}} {{original}} game with updated graphics and sounds in the demo. It was to feature ten short interactive scenes from Chrono Trigger. Despite receiving requests from fans, the development team did not intend to create a complete remake of the original game since they would not have the necessary resources, and because they thought the result would not have been on par with Square Enix-developed titles. The story of the game was altered slightly to allow for the ten <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> better flow from one to the other.|$|E

5|$|Tim Roth as General ThadeA {{sinister}} chimpanzee {{military commander}} who wants {{control over the}} ape civilization. Thade also intends to marry Ari, but she dismisses him. Roth turned down the role of Severus Snape in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone because of his commitment to Planet of the Apes. Alan Rickman was eventually cast as Snape. Roth rewrote some <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> give his character a more frightening presence.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, an Islamic group protested {{against the}} film, {{claiming}} that it portrayed Muslims as terrorists and traitors. Murugadoss, S. Thanu and Vijay's father S. A. Chandrasekhar later tendered an open apology to representatives of 23 different Muslim outfits, {{and agreed to}} delete the <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> which objections were raised, after activists had gathered near Vijay's residence at Neelankarai and raised slogans against him and the film in Arabic and Urdu.|$|E
5|$|Welles hired Bernard Herrmann {{to compose}} the film's score. Where most Hollywood film scores were written quickly, in {{as few as}} {{two or three weeks}} after filming was completed, Herrmann was given 12 weeks to write the music. He had {{sufficient}} time to do his own orchestrations and conducting, and worked on the film reel by reel as it was shot and cut. He wrote complete musical pieces for some of the montages, and Welles edited many of the <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> match their length.|$|E
