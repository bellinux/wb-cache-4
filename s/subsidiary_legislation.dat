As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the <b>subsidiary</b> <b>legislation.</b> Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months of the report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E
5|$|Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of Singapore {{respectively}} guarantee {{freedom of}} speech and expression and freedom of assembly to Singapore citizens. However, the PEMA and POA, which require permits to be obtained before public meetings and assemblies can be held, were enacted pursuant to exceptions to these rights. Article 14(2)(a) provides that Parliament may by law restrict the right to free speech to protect, among other things, Singapore's security and public order, and to prevent incitement to any criminal offence. Under Article 14(2)(b), the right of assembly may also be limited for public order reasons. As Speakers' Corner was intended to increase avenues available for the exercise of free speech, the pieces of <b>subsidiary</b> <b>legislation</b> regulating the venue were issued to provide that public speaking and demonstrations there are not subject to the PEMA and POA if the conditions specified in the <b>subsidiary</b> <b>legislation</b> are complied with. Speakers' Corner has been criticized as a token gesture, though others have pointed to its use by civil society activists as evidence that it has widened the political space in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|The UK case of R. (Ghai) v. Newcastle City Council (2009) is {{therefore}} interesting {{for purposes of}} comparison. The claimant, an orthodox Hindu, applied to his local authority for land to be dedicated for traditional open air funeral pyres.

The claimant then applied for judicial review, submitting that the decision infringed his right to manifest his religion or belief which was protected by Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The High Court found that the statutory interference with the claimant's right was justified as {{it was necessary for}} the protection of public morals and of the rights and freedoms of others. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment on grounds unrelated to Article 9, holding that open air pyres were permissible on a proper construction of the legislation.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} and analyses the expropriation laws {{and practices in}} Ethiopia. The objective of the thesis is to analyze and describe the land rights and expropriation laws in Ethiopia and to compare them with the practice {{in order to determine}} the fairness of compensation. The study is made against the Ethiopian Constitution and other <b>subsidiary</b> <b>legislations</b> which provide the basic land rights and the nature and details of expropriation. The basic argument made in this thesis is that even if the Ethiopian Constitution provides and guarantees common ownership of land (together with the state) to the people, this right has not been fully realized whether in terms of land accessibility, enjoyablity, and payment of fair compensation in the event of expropriation. The reasons have to do either with the faulty nature of the laws or with their implementation by public authorities. From the outset, the constitution excludes land as a subject of compensation. For this reason, land is being excluded from the compensation package and hence it has no value for the holder. Urban land holders are denied location value of their property, which they can collect it otherwise during sale, and hence the compensation becomes unfair. Similarly, rural farmers are denied compensation for the complete loss of their farm land. The denial of compensation for the value of the land is categorically in contradiction with the very principle of joint ownership of land by the people and the state. There are also other reasons which are related to the law or its practical applicability, such as valuation process which reduces the amount of compensation. There are also property interests which are not included as compensable interests. Payment of compensation is one factor for secure property right and hence sustainable development. To ensure fair compensation in the event of compensation, a legal and policy level reform is necessary to address and amend the existing problems. Further, to harmonize the laws and practices is imperative to reduce the amount of injustice existed in today’s expropriation procedure in Ethiopia. QC 20131122 </p...|$|R
40|$|European Union (EU) {{recently}} {{went through}} a long and complex process of enlargement and welcomed 10 more new states. Among the 10 new comers, Poland is a crucial accession country due to its size, geographical position, and large population. In addition, it has a problematic industrial restructuring and a large agricultural sector. It is hard for the European Union to digest Poland and therefore {{the outcome of the}} negotiations with Poland had and will have a leverage effect for other countries with similar issues to tackle with the EU. Agriculture is considered {{as one of the most}} complicated issues between Poland and the EU not only due to the large and inefficient agricultural sector in Poland, but also due to the internal problems EU is facing with its policies on agriculture. This thesis will focus on the negotiations between the EU and Poland on the chapter of agriculture, which is one of the 31 chapters of the acquis communataire. Enlargement negotiations are the negotiations on the compliance of the candidate states with the acquis communataire of the European Community. Acquis communataire is the legislation of the European Community. It encompasses the founding treaties of the Community, <b>subsidiary</b> treaties, secondary <b>legislation</b> and decisions, opinions and general principles of European Court of Justice. Acquis is presented in 31 chapters to the candidates. The thesis aims to analyse the negotiation process between EU and Poland on the chapter of agriculture, providing an insight into the context and background of the negotiations. Each negotiation issue stated by Poland as a response to the acquis presented by the EU has been discussed thouroughly based on primary resources from the EU and Poland...|$|R
40|$|LL. M. (Banking and Stock Exchange Law) Abstract: Money {{laundering}} {{and terrorist}} financing {{is a global}} issue. The advent of new technologies such as {{the internet and the}} impact of globalisation have forced businesses including banks to re-evaluate their business models. One of the key strategies currently being employed by South African banks is diversification of business interests through the establishment of subsidiary banks throughout the African continent. It is precisely this strategic shift which has exposed weaknesses in the management of money laundering risks as the South African banks are expected to ensure that the home country anti-money laundering standards are imposed on the subsidiary banks. The South African anti-money laundering regime is considered to be strong within the global context. However, the current Financial Intelligence Centre Act was not developed, and does not cater, for the position where home country anti-money laundering standards are to be imposed on subsidiaries. Even if the Act did cater for this position there would need to be intergovernmental agreements in place to give effect to the South African provisions on the <b>subsidiary</b> banks. Additional <b>legislation</b> such as the Banks Act provides for oversight and attempts to ensure that the standards are met to a degree. However, the Banks Act is applicable to the South African banks, and not to the subsidiaries due to sovereignty of state. It does to a degree require agreement between the various regulators of the countries involved. The countries involved in these cross-border acquisitions are often at different phases of their social, political and economic development and may not have the same resources that South Africa has at its disposal. What occurs when there is a conflict between the <b>legislation</b> of the <b>subsidiary</b> and the home country or if it is simply impractical to impose the standards of the home country to the subsidiary? The risk to South African banks and the South African economy are great as apart from a fine from the South African regulator, there could be a perception that the South African banks’ anti-money laundering framework is not as strong as perceived. The South African banking sector is viewed as a first-world sector. A perception that the banking sector has been weakened through cross-border subsidiary bank acquisitions could lead to a loss of international investments, international business or could even be a determining factor in a ratings downgrade to the South African economy. The dissertation was compiled reviewing all applicable legislation of South Africa as well as that countries where banks were acquired as subsidiaries, the letters of approval from the South African Reserve bank together with conditions and duties imposed on the approval, as [...] ...|$|R

500|$|In Komoco Motors, the Court of Appeal {{held that}} the Registrar of Vehicles had not abdicated to the Customs her {{discretionary}} power. Expressing {{the view of the}} Court, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong {{held that the}} Lines International conditions [...] "although correct in law, [...] inapplicable to the factual context of the appeal". The Court distinguished the factual context in Lines International from the present case on two bases. First, it found that the Registrar had made the decision in the lawful exercise of her power and for practical reasons, which included the Customs' reliability in assessing the OMV of vehicles. In any case, an aggrieved importer had a statutory right to object to and be heard on the Customs' determination of OMVs. Secondly, while Lines International involved a determination of whether a vessel should be given berthing space, the PSA had to exercise its judgment as to how to weigh up various relevant factors. However, in Komoco Motors, once the Registrar had decided to adopt the Customs' OMV of a motor vehicle as its [...] "value" [...] {{for the purposes of the}} ARF Scheme, no further exercise of judgment was required of the Registrar. The Court held that the calculation of the ARF was simply an arithmetical exercise of applying the percentage stated in <b>subsidiary</b> <b>legislation</b> to the Customs' OMVs, and hence did not involve the taking of instructions by the Registrar from another statutory agency.|$|E
