50|$|Microstrip {{consists}} of a <b>strip</b> <b>conductor</b> on the top surface of a dielectric layer and a ground plane on the bottom surface of the dielectric. The electromagnetic wave travels partly in the dielectric and partly {{in the air above}} the conductor resulting in quasi-TEM transmission. Despite the drawbacks of the quasi-TEM mode, microstrip is often favoured for its easy compatibility with printed circuits. In any case, these effects are not so severe in a miniaturised circuit.|$|E
50|$|Stripline is a <b>strip</b> <b>conductor</b> {{embedded}} in a dielectric between two ground planes. It is usually constructed as two sheets of dielectric clamped together with the stripline pattern {{on one side of}} one sheet. The main advantage of stripline over its principal rival, microstrip, is that transmission is purely in the TEM mode and is free of dispersion, at least, over the distances encountered in stripline applications. Stripline is capable of supporting TE and TM modes but these are not generally used. The main disadvantage {{is that it is not}} as easy as microstrip to incorporate discrete components. For any that are incorporated, cutouts have to be provided in the dielectric and they are not accessible once assembled.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two basic}} ways that air {{stripline}} is constructed. In dielectric supported stripline, also called suspended stripline or suspended substrate, the <b>strip</b> <b>conductor</b> is deposited on a thin dielectric substrate, sometimes {{on both sides and}} connected together to form a single conductor. [...] This substrate is then clamped in place between the walls supporting the two ground planes. In this method the strip can be manufactured by printed circuit techniques making it cheap and leading to the further advantage that other components can be printed on the dielectric in the same operation. The purpose of the dielectric is mechanical support for the conductor, but it is made as thin as possible to minimise its electrical effect. The flimsy nature of the substrate means that it can easily be distorted. Because of this, the design needs to take account of thermal stability issues. [...] High end designs may use a crystalline substrate, such as boron nitride or sapphire, as the suspended substrate.|$|E

40|$|In {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI), either on human or animal studies, the main requirements for radiofrequency (RF) coils are to produce a homogeneous RF field while used as a transmitter coil {{and to have the}} best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while used as a receiver. Besides, they need to be easily frequency adjustable and have input impedance matching 50 Omega to several different load conditions. New theoretical and practical concepts are presented here for considerable enhancing of RF coil homogeneity for MRI experiments on small animals. To optimize field homogeneity, we have performed simulations using Blot and Savart law varying the coil`s window angle, achieving the optimum one. However, when the coil`s dimensions are the same order of the wave length and according to transmission line theory, differences in electrical length and effects of mutual inductances between adjacent <b>strip</b> <b>conductors</b> decrease both field homogeneity and SNR. The problematic interactions between <b>strip</b> <b>conductors</b> by means of mutual inductance were eliminated by inserting crossings at half electrical length, avoiding distortion on current density, thus eliminating sources of field inhomogeneity. Experimental results show that measured field maps and simulations are in good agreement. The new coil design, dubbed double-crossed saddle described here have field homogeneity and SNR superior than the linearly driven 8 -rung birdcage coil. One of our major findings was that the effects of mutual inductance are more significant than differences in electrical length for this frequency and coil dimensions. In vitro images of a primate Cebus paela brain were acquired, confirming double-crossed saddle superiority. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
