5|$|Passenger safety {{was a key}} design aspect for the Ford engineers. Anti-lock brakes were {{standard}} on all models; electronic brakeforce distribution was also {{standard on}} most variants. The addition of traction control for higher trim levels helped to prevent loss of traction. On top of this, dual front airbags were a standard fitment across the range; side-impact airbags were equipped on higher luxury levels such as the Fairmont. In a crash <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> conducted by ANCAP, the BA model scored 27.27 {{out of a possible}} 37 points, giving a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E

They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 2006, Biman {{operated}} {{flights to}} John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, from Dhaka via Brussels. New York was Biman's farthest and most prestigious destination, and was kept operational despite heavy financial losses {{to maintain a}} landing slot in the US which, if cancelled, could be difficult to regain. To curb the losses, Biman reduced the service to one flight per week and re-routed it through Manchester Airport, UK, capitalising on travel demands from the expatriate Bangladeshi community {{in the north of}} England. On 8 April 2006, Biman's inaugural flight to Manchester landed at Manchester Airport en route to JFK. However, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had placed the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) into Category 2 (does not meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards) according to its International Aviation <b>Safety</b> <b>Assessment</b> Program, which placed additional restrictions on the country's airlines when flying to the US. A former CAAB assistant director made scathing remarks about the CAAB in an opinion article in the Aviatour, a monthly travel and tourism supplement of Bangladeshi news magazine Weekly Holiday. For Biman, this meant that it could continue flying to the US, but could not expand or make alterations to its routes, such as changing the transit from Brussels to Manchester. The FAA fined Biman for breaching its rules, and flights to New York were again re-routed through Brussels.|$|E

However, when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light even after harvesting, natural ergosterols in mushrooms produce vitamin D2, a process now used to supply fresh vitamin D mushrooms for the functional food grocery market. In a comprehensive <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> of producing vitamin D in fresh mushrooms, researchers showed that artificial UV light technologies were equally effective for vitamin D production as in mushrooms exposed to natural sunlight, and that UV light has a long record of safe use for production of vitamin D in food.|$|E

[...] They were produced by artists from Yunnan and Guangdong provinces, and are modelled after ones situated at a temple in Kunming, the hometown of founder Yuet Kai. [...] The creation and installation of these statues – which commenced in 2001 without prior authorization from the government – led to a minor rift between the monastery and the local authorities.

500|$|Although the Standard Model of {{particle}} physics predicts that LHC energies {{are far too}} low to create black holes, some extensions of the Standard Model posit the existence of extra spatial dimensions, in which {{it would be possible}} to create micro black holes at the LHC at a rate of the order of one per second. According to the standard calculations these are harmless because they would quickly decay by Hawking radiation. Hawking radiation is a thermal radiation predicted to be emitted by black holes due to quantum effects. Because Hawking radiation allows black holes to lose mass, black holes that lose more matter than they gain through other means are expected to dissipate, shrink, and ultimately vanish. Smaller micro black holes (MBHs), which could be produced at the LHC, are currently predicted by theory to be larger net emitters of radiation than larger black holes, and to shrink and dissipate instantly. The LHC <b>Safety</b> <b>Assessment</b> Group (LSAG) indicates that [...] "there is broad consensus among physicists on the reality of Hawking radiation, but so far no experiment has had the sensitivity required to find direct evidence for it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, CERN {{mandated}} a {{group of}} five particle physicists {{not involved in the}} LHC experiments—the LHC <b>Safety</b> <b>Assessment</b> Group (LSAG), consisting of John Ellis, Gian Giudice, Michelangelo Mangano and Urs Wiedemann, of CERN, and Igor Tkachev, of the Institute for Nuclear Research in Moscow—to monitor the latest concerns about the LHC collisions. On , in light of new experimental data and theoretical understanding, the LSAG issued a report updating the 2003 safety review, in which they reaffirmed and extended its conclusions that [...] "LHC collisions present no danger and that there are no reasons for concern". The LSAG report was then reviewed by CERN’s Scientific Policy Committee (SPC), {{a group of}} external scientists that advises CERN’s governing body, its Council. The report was reviewed and endorsed by a panel of five independent scientists, Peter Braun-Munzinger, Matteo Cavalli-Sforza, Gerard 't Hooft, Bryan Webber and Fabio Zwirner, and their conclusions were unanimously approved by the full 20 members of the SPC. On , the LSAG's [...] "Review of the safety of LHC collisions" [...] was published in the [...] by the UK Institute of Physics, which endorsed its conclusions in a press release that announced the publication.|$|E

500|$|On , Rainer Plaga, a German astrophysicist, {{posted a}} {{research}} {{paper on the}} arXiv Web archive concluding that LHC safety studies have not definitely ruled out the potential catastrophic threat from microscopic black holes, including the possible danger from Hawking radiation emitted by black holes.

Giddings and Mangano also referred to the research paper [...] "Exclusion of black hole disaster scenarios at the LHC", which relies on a number of new arguments to conclude that there is no risk due to mini black holes at the LHC. On 19 January 2009 Roberto Casadio, Sergio Fabi and Benjamin Harms posted on the arXiv a paper, later published on Physical Review D, ruling out the catastrophic growth of black holes in the scenario considered by Plaga.
