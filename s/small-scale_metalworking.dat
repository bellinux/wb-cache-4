40|$|A {{study has}} shown lack of link between users of design ideas and design professionals. This has {{resulted}} into amorphous system of production where {{the small and}} medium scale entrepreneurs sweat it out producing a range of products which fetch little in the market because they lack aesthetics, efficiency, certification and documentation. A large number of individuals who excelled in engineering design during their training drop the profession {{as soon as they}} leave colleges because, apparently, “no one requires their inputs ” One ought to learn from simple observation day after day that there are hundreds of cheap imports, mainly from Far-East countries—toys, hand- and power-tools, household utensils, kitchen machines and so forth—that have continued selling in volumes in our very local market. It doesn’t take much effort to figure out the secret of their success. This paper outlines personal experience of the author— design/production engineer—from the days of university as a student to career, also field findings from a survey to <b>small-scale</b> <b>metalworking</b> businesses in Dar-es-Salaam in 2002. At the end are recommendations how to turn the system around, including challenging existing curricular; re-shaping society perception of engineering and importance of multidisciplinary teamwork in solving engineering problems...|$|E
40|$|The {{excavation}} of a Late Bronze Age settlement at Rambodal, {{just outside the}} city of Norrköping, has provided interesting evidence for Bronze Age metalworking, including the third Bronze Age stone casting mould found to date in the county of Östergötland. The settlement consisted of a single farm with dates from Per. V of the Bronze Age to the earliest Iron Age. In addition to high-quality ceramics, the settlement yielded several traces of bronze casting, such as a copper melt {{and part of a}} soapstone mould for a small socketed axe, probably dating to Per. VI. Soapstone moulds are rarely found at settlement sites. The find provides interesting data for discussions of the molds’ use contexts. The evidence for <b>small-scale</b> household <b>metalworking</b> at a minor farmstead like Rambodal holds significant potential for future research on the spread and organisation of this craft...|$|R

It operated from February 5, 1938 to 1960. Main operation was logging and wood processing industries. In addition {{a wide variety of}} other <b>small-scale</b> industries: construction, <b>metalworking,</b> railroad servicing, clothing, footwear, pottery production, etc. The camp had 30 sites (camp site: [...] ) ...|$|R

It was located in the Mordovian ASSR. Its name derives {{from the town of}} Temnikov. It existed during 1931-1948. Major {{industries}} were logging, wood processing industries, and railroad construction. In addition it had a wide variety of other <b>small-scale</b> industries: construction, <b>metalworking,</b> railroad servicing, clothing and footwear production, etc. Upon liquidation its assets were split. The camp system was transferred to Dubravlag, while the industries were reorganized into the Temnikovsky Industrial Combine of Gulag (Темниковский Промкомбинат ГУЛАГа), which itself did not manage any camps, and later it was also merged into Dubravlag.|$|R
