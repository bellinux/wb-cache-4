BLP (Bottom Leaded Plastic) [2] {{which is not a}} type of thin out-line surface mount device(SMD) without the side lead is widely used in manufacturing of new generation memory such as SDRAM RDRAM DDR. For this non-lead SMD, the shape and reliability of solder joint is the focus of the study. In this paper, we select the C-BLP of 28 -pin device as the research object, complete the forming model of solder joint shape based on minimum energy principle and the solder joint shape theory by using Surface Evolver software, and analyze two critical process parameters (solder volume and solder pad width) impacting on the solder joint shape. The study results show that the solder volume and pad width {{have a significant impact on}} the three-dimensional shape of BLP solder joint. The law of which is that: in the case of the other fixed parameters, as the increase of the solder volume, solder joint surface gradually changes from the relatively flat to the convex, solder joint gradually changes from the completely soldered to the partly soldered in the pad connections, and solder joint heights are gradually decreased; in the case of the other fixed parameters, as the increase of the pad in width, the solder joint surface gradually changes from the convex to the flat, solder joint gradually changes from the completely soldered to the partly soldered in the pad connections, and solder joint heights are gradually decreased.

The employee had become accustomed to the Dvorak pattern and brought the necessary parts to the show, installed them in a demo machine, then did his Logo demo. Viewers, curious that he always reached behind the machine before and after allowing other people to type, asked him about the modification.

Sometimes, to prevent movement they are temporarily kept in place with small dabs of adhesive or secured with a fixture, then the assembly is passed over flowing solder in a bulk container.

The brightness of the Amiga's power LED is used to indicate {{the status of the}} Amiga's low-pass filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (or off on older A500 Amigas).

5000|$|A typical pad on {{a printed}} circuit board is only {{connected}} to a few narrow tracks.

A single pin through-hole connector mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB) was simulated using a 3 D model solved by FLUENT.

In addition, an experiment was conducted to measure the temperature difference (Î”T) between the top and the bottom of the pin. Analysis results showed that an increase in temperature increased the structural displacement and the von Mises stress. Filling time exhibited a quadratic relationship to the increment of temperature. The deformation of pin showed a linear correlation to the temperature. The Î”T obtained from the simulation and the experimental method were validated. This study elucidates and clearly illustrates wave soldering for engineers in the PCB assembly industry...|$|R
40|$|<b>Soldering</b> of core <b>pins</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} issues {{limiting}} the productivity of aluminum castings using high pressure die casting process. This issue is associated with the failure of the ceramic coating, chemical reactions between the molten aluminum and the matrix metal and the dissolution of the pin matrix metal. Methods that prevent coating failure, retard dissolution rates of the core pin materials in molten aluminum can be used for reducing soldering tendency of core pins. As a result, a ceramic coating is usually applied to the core pins in order to reduce soldering tendency, because the coating prevents severe reactions between the core pin material and the molten alloy. Therefore, the coating lifetime governs the soldering process and the core pin lifetime. The purpose of this study is 1) the mechanism of soldering formation, 2) the performance of coatings when contacting with molten alloys, 3) the in-depth analysis of the starting up coating failure, and 4) an ultrasonic method that is used for accelerating testing processes. ^ Results show that the soldering process starts from a local coating failure, involves a series of intermetallic phase formations from reactions between molten aluminum alloys and the H 13 steel pin, and accelerates when the aluminum-rich phase is formed between the intermetallic phases. It is the formation of the aluminum-rich phase in the reaction region that joins the core pin with the casting, resulting in the sticking of the casting to the core pin. When undercuts are formed on the core pin, the ejection of castings from the die will either lead to a core pin failure or damages to the casting be ejected. High intensity ultrasonic vibration was applied on H 13 coupons to accelerate the experiments. Results obtained using the accelerated testing method were then validated using in a high pressure die casting machine under production conditions. These results indicate that coating detachment from the steel substrate is the main failure mechanism of the coatings when tested in water, oil, molten salt, or molten zinc at low temperatures. Coating failure accelerates as the temperature of the melt is increased. At high temperatures, coating fragmentation, as well as detachments, occurs on coupons tested in molten salt. Therefore, the coverage percentage and quality of coatings play an important role in retarding coating failure. As soon as coating failure occurs, the dissolution rate of H 13 steel is extremely high. The affinity, between the core pin material and the molten alloy, plays an important role in the later soldering process. The dissolution rate of H 13 steel in molten zinc is much higher than that in molten A 380 at the same experiment conditions. The dissolution rate of niobium in molten aluminum is at least 300 times slower than that of H 13 steels. It is suggested that Nb alloys have good potential to be used as <b>soldering</b> resistant core <b>pin</b> materials. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Spiral {{inductors}} are a {{key component}} of mixed-signal and analog integrated circuits (IC's). Such circuits are often fabricated using silicon-based technology, owing to the inherent low-cost and high volume production aspects. However, semiconducting substrate materials such as silicon can have adverse effects on spiral inductor performance due to the lossy nature of the material. Since the operating requirements of many high performance IC's demand reactive components that have high Quality Factor's (Q's), and are thus low loss devices, the need for accurate modeling of such structures over lossy substrate media is key to successful circuit design. The Q's of commonly available off-chip inductors are in the range of 50 - 100 for frequencies ranging up to a few gigahertz. Since off-chip inductors must be connected through package <b>pins,</b> <b>solder</b> bumps, etc., which all contribute additional loss and thus lower the apparent Q of an external device, the typical on-chip Q requirement for a given RFIC design is generally lower than that for an off-chip spiral solution. However, a spiral inductor that was designed and fabricated originally in a low loss technology such as thin-film alumina may have substantially worse performance in regard to Q if it is used in a silicon-based technology, owing to the conductive substrate. For this reason, it is imperative that semiconducting substrate effects be accurately accounted for by any modeling effort for monolithic spirals in RFICs. This thesis presents a complete modeling solution for both single and multi-level spiral inductors over lossy silicon substrates, along with design considerations and methods for mitigation of the undesirable performance effects of semiconducting substrates. The modeling solution is based on Spectral Domain Approach (SDA) solutions for frequency dependent complex capacitive (i. e. both capacitance and conductance) parasitic elements combined with a quasi-magnetostatic field solution for calculation of the frequency dependent complex inductive (i. e. both inductance and resistance) terms. The effects of geometry and process variations are considered as well as the incorporation of Patterned Ground Shields (PGS) for the purpose of Q enhancement. Proposals for future extensions of this work are discussed in the concluding chapter...|$|R
