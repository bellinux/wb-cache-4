5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> pools, the park featured several other family attractions. In 2010 it added a beach family-fun area, a children's attraction featuring a giant chessboard with movable playing pieces such as knights, rooks and pawns. There {{was also a}} sand-beach area overlooking Geauga Lake. Little Tikes Town, a children's area with playhouses and toys, is located behind Thunder Falls.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E
5|$|More complex {{parts are}} formed using more complex moulds. These may have {{sections}} called slides, that {{move into a}} cavity perpendicular to the draw direction, to form overhanging part features. When the mould is opened, the slides are {{pulled away from the}} plastic part by using stationary “angle pins” on the stationary mould half. These pins enter a slot in the <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> cause the slides to move backward when the moving half of the mould opens. The part is then ejected and the mould closes. The closing action of the mould causes the slides to move forward along the angle pins.|$|E

5|$|This {{park was}} {{constructed}} {{to commemorate the}} official joining of Ikata to her Sister City of Red Wing, Minnesota, after which it is named. Of note is the 21-meter stainless-steel monument located {{at the entrance of}} the park, a twin sister of the one in Bay Point Park, Red Wing. Beneath the monument lies a commemorative stone plaque bearing the signatures of each of the mayors at the time. It is home to Adventure Hill—a playground full of climbing nets, roller <b>slides,</b> <b>and</b> other children's play equipment. The park is free and open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Before the first-section groundbreaking, in 1937 {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} sent workers {{to assess the}} former railroad tunnels. In September of that year, a contract was awarded to drain water from the tunnels. After this, workers cleared rock <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> vegetation from the tunnel portals before evaluating the nine tunnels' condition. It was decided that six of the nine former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels {{could be used for}} the roadway. The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel was in too poor a condition for use, and the Quemahoning and Negro Mountain tunnels would be bypassed with rock cuts through the mountains; The Quemahoning Tunnel had been completed and used by the Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the battle, two of Von der Tanns main turrets were knocked out by British gunfire, while her other two turrets {{suffered}} mechanical failures. The ship was firing so fast that several of the main guns in the amidships turrets became overheated and jammed in their recoil <b>slides,</b> <b>and</b> could not be returned to working order. Von der Tann was without her main battery for 11hours, although three turrets were restored to working order {{before the end of the}} battle; Dturret only after much cutting away of bent metal with oxyacetylene torches—afterwards the guns could be worked only by hand. Her casualties amounted to 11 dead and 35 wounded. During the battle Von der Tann fired 170 heavy shells and 98 secondary caliber shells.|$|E
30|$|The {{transport}} of sand grains in {{water can be}} classified into four modes: <b>sliding,</b> rolling, saltation, <b>and</b> suspension (Allen 1982). <b>Sliding</b> <b>and</b> rolling grains remain in continuous contact with the bed, while suspended particles {{have little or no}} contact with the bed. Saltating grains jump over the bed in a series of low trajectories that are on the order of 10 to 20 particle diameters long and a few diameters high; thus, this is an intermediate mode between <b>sliding</b> <b>and</b> rolling and suspension. Reid and Frostick (1994) defined the bedload as the grains that move along the bed and that are essentially in contact with it at all times (i.e., including only <b>sliding</b> <b>and</b> rolling particles) and independently defined the saltation load; however, others (e.g., Allen 1982; Bridge and Demicco 2008) defined the bedload to include saltating grains in addition to <b>sliding</b> <b>and</b> rolling grains. Regardless of the definition of bedload, all researchers have pointed out that in subaqueous environments, <b>sliding</b> <b>and</b> rolling are most prevalent when the level of transport is low (low transport stage; Allen 1982; Reid and Frostick 1994; Bridge and Demicco 2008).|$|R

5|$|In 1913, Edison {{introduced}} a new cylinder-based synch-sound apparatus known, just like his 1895 system, as the Kinetophone; instead of films being shown to individual viewers in the Kinetoscope cabinet, they were now projected onto a screen. The phonograph was connected by an intricate arrangement of pulleys to the film projector, allowing—under ideal conditions—for synchronization. However, conditions were rarely ideal, and the new, improved Kinetophone was retired after {{little more than a}} year. By the mid-1910s, the groundswell in commercial sound motion picture exhibition had subsided. Beginning in 1914, The Photo-Drama of Creation, promoting Jehovah's Witnesses' conception of mankind's genesis, was screened around the United States: eight hours worth of projected visuals involving both <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> live action were synchronized with separately recorded lectures and musical performances played back on phonograph.|$|E
5|$|India {{experienced}} similar {{development to}} China in the Middle Ages; however, stringed instruments developed differently as they accommodated {{different styles of}} music. While stringed instruments of China were designed to produce precise tones capable of matching the tones of chimes, stringed instruments of India were considerably more flexible. This flexibility suited the <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> tremolos of Hindu music. Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, {{as evidenced by the}} frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages. The emphasis on rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music. Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre-Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{by their}} need for water, trees such as willows, alders, and ponderosa pines are found only near the monument's streams or springs. Serviceberry bushes and shrubs like {{mountain}} mahogany are found in places where moisture collects near rock <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> ledges. Elsewhere long-rooted rabbitbrush has adapted to survive in dry areas. Other shrubs with adaptive properties include greasewood, sagebrush, shadscale, broom snakeweed, antelope bitterbrush, and purple sage. Western junipers, which have extensive root systems, thrive in the dry climate; {{in the absence of}} periodic fires they tend to displace grasses and sagebrush and to create relatively barren landscapes. The Park Service is considering controlled burning to limit the junipers and to create open areas for bunchgrasses that re-sprout from their roots after a fire.|$|E

5|$|Umbrella: In all written records, {{the oldest}} {{reference}} to a collapsible umbrella dates to the year 21 AD, when Wang Mang (r. 9–23) had one designed for a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage. The 2nd-century commentator Fu Qian added that this collapsible umbrella of Wang Mang's carriage had bendable joints which enabled them to be extended or retracted. A 1st century collapsible umbrella has since been recovered from the tomb of Wang Guang at Lelang Commandery in the Korean Peninsula, illustrated in a work by Harada and Komai. However, the Chinese collapsible umbrella is perhaps a concept that is yet centuries older than Wang's tomb. Zhou Dynasty bronze castings of complex bronze socketed hinges with locking <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> bolts—which {{could have been used}} for parasols and umbrellas—were found in an archeological site of Luoyang, dated to the 6th century BC.|$|E
5|$|With {{an area of}} perceptibility {{of around}} 58,500 km2, the shock was felt from Santa Barbara and Bakersfield to San Diego, Palm Springs, and Las Vegas.

The maximum {{intensity}} observed in the urban areas that were affected was VII (Very strong), but the intensity in the epicentral area is unknown because of its remote location in the mountainous Angeles National Forest, though rock <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> landslides occurred there {{as a result of}} strong shaking. Intensity VI (Strong) effects were observed over 1,100 km2, from Altadena and La Verne along the base of the mountains, to East Los Angeles.|$|E
