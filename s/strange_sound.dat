5|$|During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Hoffman {{took over}} closer duties from an injured and {{ineffective}} Gene Harris in mid-April. Hoffman recorded 20 saves and a 2.57 ERA while averaging 10.9 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9). The weekend after the strike began, Hoffman, playing Nerf football at Del Mar Beach near San Diego, dived for a pass and landed awkwardly {{on his right}} shoulder. He later played volleyball and landed on the shoulder again while going for a dig. He heard a <b>strange</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Venturers {{hydrophone}} operator {{noticed a}} <b>strange</b> <b>sound</b> {{which he could}} not identify. [...] He at first thought that it sounded as though some local fisherman had started up a boat's diesel engine. [...] Launders decided to track the strange noise. [...] Then, due to poor adherence to proper periscope usage protocol {{on the part of}} the German crew, the officer of the watch on Venturers periscope noticed another periscope poking up above the surface of the water. [...] Combined with the hydrophone reports of the strange noise, which he determined to be coming from a submerged vessel, Launders surmised that they had found U-864.|$|E

2500|$|What {{he saw was}} a city under siege: [...] "'Lurid flames roared and belched {{and licked}} their forked tongues into the air. Smoke ascended the sky in thick, black volumes and amid it all, the planes—now {{a dozen or more}} in number—still hummed and darted here and there with the agility of natural birds of the air.'" [...] Making his way outside, Franklin found the source of the <b>strange</b> <b>sound</b> that had {{peppered}} his building. [...] "'The side-walks were literally covered with burning turpentine balls. I knew all too well where they came from, and I knew all too well why every burning building first caught fire from the top.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Florence and the Machine {{played at}} Australia's Splendour in the Grass music festival in July 2010. The group drew {{one of the}} biggest crowds of the three-day festival. They {{performed}} in the natural open-air amphitheatre, which had to be closed off by security due to safety concerns as an unprecedented number of festival-goers rushed to see the performance. It is estimated that 28,000 people of the 33,000 people who attended the festival crammed in to see Florence and the Machine. The amphitheatre was reopened shortly after the start, once the safety concerns were allayed. In October 2009, the band's equipment and instruments were caught in a trailer fire during their European tour, forcing the band to use rented instruments to complete their remaining shows. Welch stated, [...] "You could hear the harp's strings ping in the fire. <b>Strange</b> <b>sound.</b> We recorded it and I want to use it in a song." ...|$|E
