40|$|<b>Spiral</b> bevel <b>gears</b> are one {{of basic}} {{mechanical}} units to transmit motion between concurrent axes. The transmission has quite a few merits, such as the big overlap ratio, the high loading capacity, the high transmitting efficiency, the stability and the small noises, and they are widely used in automotive vehicle, planes, machine tools {{and all kinds of}} machines. Mechanical properties of <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gear</b> have significant influence on the whole mechanical structure and {{play an important role in}} the system optimization, strength check, fault diagnosis and fault prediction, and gear tooth meshing-dynamic load is an important issue in the gear research field.

40|$|<b>Spiral</b> bevel <b>gears</b> {{usually are}} {{cut by the}} machine tools which are {{specifically}} made for manufacturing <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gear.</b> For some practical applications, such as repair, prototype, and small batch, there are only several <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears</b> need to be machined. It seems not wise to buy a gear manufacturing machine tool for cutting those several gears. Consequently, some other manufacturing methods are introduced {{to cope with this}} situation. Recent advances in computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine tools make it possible to manufacture good quality <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears.</b> Moreover, CNC milling machine tools are usually cheaper than the specific gear manufacturing machine tools. Even more, they are not only cut gears but also other parts. Therefore, computer numerical control (CNC) milling is introduced in industry to cut <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears.</b> End milling and flank milling are two modes of CNC milling. Compared to end milling, flank milling has been highlighted in quality enhancement, manufacturing time and cost reduction. Theoretically, the result of flank milling a developable ruled surface does not contain geometric deviations. Hence, flank milling has been widely used to machine the parts with ruled surface or the surface close to ruled surface, such as turbines and blades. Due {{to the fact that the}} tooth surfaces of <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears</b> are close to ruled surface (the tooth surface of Format-cut spiral bevel is part of a cone), flank milling can also be used to cut <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears.</b> However, there is no literature about flank milling <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears.</b> Moreover, the current existing tooth surface models (except the tooth surface of Format-cut <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gear)</b> are implicit, which makes further calculation inefficient and difficult. To address these two problems, a new ruled tooth surface design is proposed to <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears</b> design. Subsequently, the design model is used to be machined with five-axis flank milling by introducing a new tool path planning approach. To obtain the simulate machined tooth surface, a new geometric envelope approach is proposed to calculate the cutter envelope surface as a closed-form representation. Then the result of geometric deviations, which are obtained by comparing the design tooth surface and the simulate machined tooth surface, shows the flank milling is appropriate to cut <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears.</b> Furthermore, the conventional face-milled model is also used as the design model for flank milling, and another result of geometric deviations is obtained. Subsequently, both results are compared, and the comparison shows that the proposed design reduces the geometric deviations effectively. Moreover, the closed-form simulate machined tooth surface can only be obtained by using the proposed design...|$|R

Applications such as these need <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears</b> to turn {{the corner from the}} horizontal gas turbine engine to the vertical rotor shaft.

With these difficult operating conditions, an improved analytical capability is paramount to increasing aircraft safety and reliability. Also, literature on the analysis and testing of <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears</b> has been very sparse in comparison to that for parallel axis gears.

Based on <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gear</b> NC {{manufacture}} {{principle and}} generating {{motion of the}} generating gear and the work gear, the NC generation of <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gear</b> cutting is realized {{by means of the}} vector transformation. As sophisticated calculation of the transformation is hard to implement in each interpolation cycle of NC machining, the coordinated motion of NC coordinate axes is expressed as quintic parametric spline functions, which use the rotation angle of the work gear as the parameter. The constrained optimization method of three design variables is established to obtain contacting points of gear tooth surfaces, which are acquired by solving nonlinear equations sets traditionally. The condition of normal coincidence is simplified and the object function of the equal position vectors of mating gears is established. The contacting points of gear tooth surfaces can be used for tooth contact analysis. The parametric curve interpolator is combined with <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gear</b> NC machining, and is applied to the self-developed <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gear</b> NC milling machine to control the gear cutting.

40|$|<b>Spiral</b> bevel <b>gears</b> {{are used}} widely in the {{transmission}} systems of several mechanical applications. The design of <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears</b> is very complicated. This {{is due to}} the complexity of the gear tooth geometry. This research concentrates on a special type of <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears,</b> the Palloid <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears.</b> The design methodology is based on the concepts of the machine kinematics.

40|$|AbstractSimilar to the {{essential}} components of many mechanical systems, the geometrical {{properties of the}} teeth of <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears</b> greatly influence the kinematic and dynamic behaviors of mechanical systems. Logarithmic <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears</b> show a unique advantage in transmission due to their constant spiral angle property. However, a mathematical model suitable for accurate digital modeling, differential geometrical characteristics, and related contact analysis methods for tooth surfaces have not been deeply investigated, since such gears are not convenient in traditional cutting manufacturing in the gear industry. Accurate mathematical modeling of the tooth surface geometry for logarithmic <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears</b> is developed in this study, based on the basic gearing kinematics and spherical involute geometry along with the tangent planes geometry; actually, the tooth surface is a parametric surface defined on a parallelogrammic domain. Equivalence proof of the tooth surface geometry is then given in order to greatly simplify the mathematical model. As major factors affecting the lubrication, surface fatigue, contact stress, wear, and manufacturability of gear teeth, the differential geometrical characteristics of the tooth surface are summarized using classical fundamental forms. By using the geometrical properties mentioned, manufactura-bility (and its limitation in logarithmic <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears)</b> is analyzed using precision forging and multi-axis freeform milling, rather than classical cradle-type machine tool based milling or hobbing. Geometry and manufacturability analysis results show that logarithmic <b>spiral</b> <b>gears</b> have many application advantages, but many urgent issues such as contact tooth analysis for precision plastic forming and multi-axis freeform milling {{also need to be}} solved in a further study...|$|R
