50|$|The {{evolution}} to {{the current}} 20-High Cluster <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>Mill</b> from the early 12-High configuration was pioneered by Tadeusz Sendzimir in the early 1930s. The designs for the <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>Mill</b> were perfected and patented by Tadeusz's company T. Sendzimir, Inc. Significant design improvements were made by T. Sendzimir, Inc. including the flexible shaft backing assemblies and segmented idler rolls, as well as tapered edge intermediate rolls with lateral adjust for superior shape control. With advent of Finite Element Analysis technology T. Sendzimir, Inc. iterated the mono-block housing design to create the Zero Crown Housing solution. This reduced the amount of material required for the housing, while creating uniform elastic deformation across the housing during rolling {{in order to maintain}} a better shape profile of the strip.|$|E
50|$|A Z-Mill or <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>Mill</b> is {{a machine}} for rolling steel. Unlike a {{traditional}} rolling mill this 20-high cluster mill configuration utilizes cascaded supporting rolls to apply {{force on the}} small work rolls in the center. This allows {{the application of a}} higher roll pressure without bending the work rolls, which would result in poor metal quality. Thus very hard and elastic materials can be rolled.|$|E
40|$|The present work {{introduces}} {{a new type}} of numerical analyzing method: the contact element method with two relative coordinates (CEM). The main characteristic of the procedure is elements meshing {{on the basis of the}} contact length between objects and that each element has two relative coordinates. The ordinary expression of this procedure is DX[CXY(i) ]=D Y[CYX(i) ]. Through this method, the CEM function of the 20 -high <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>mill</b> and the deflection function expression of every roll are obtained. A computational software SM 4 SM for the <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>mill</b> has been developed, by which the deflection condition of rolls S, O, I, and A can be obviously seen. The results obtained by CEM have also been compared to that by the finite element method. Copyright © 2008 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|Some form of {{lubrication}} {{is required}} {{at each stage}} in the rolling of strip in copper and its alloys. In the finishing operations the problem {{is complicated by the}} need to produce a clean, stain-free surface, which imposes severe limitations on the types of lubricants and additives that can be used. This paper briefly reviews the reasons for lubrication during rolling and then discusses the qualities required in the lubricants, how near the precise requirements can be achieved in practice, and the limitations which currently available lubricants place on the processes. Hot rolling and cold breaking down give little trouble, but intermediate and finish rolling are more critical; the types of both oil-in-water emulsions and neat oils needed are dealt with in some detail for slow- and high-speed mills. The problem of contamination of the rolling lubricant by the oils and greases used as mill lubricants and in mill hydraulic systems is considered and suggestions are presented for minimizing the trouble by the use of special lubricants and modem methods of lubrication, including the latest practices on cluster-type <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>mills.</b> The design of roll coolant systems for modem high-speed four-high strip m i l l s and cluster-type <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>mills</b> is discussed, in so far as it affects the lubricant and strip finish.

50|$|<b>Sendzimir</b> <b>mills</b> {{are known}} for their ability to roll {{extremely}} hard materials to very thin gauges with few, if any, intermediate anneals. They consistently maintain quality aspects that are difficult, if not impossible, to duplicate on other mills. They are capable of consistently holding extremely close gauge tolerances on very wide strip as well as on metals ranging from soft aluminum alloys to stellite and molybdenum. The bearing-saddle-bearing configuration of the back-up rolls transmits the roll separating force {{along the length of the}} work rolls, through the intermediate rolls, to the back-up assemblies, and finally to the rigid mono-block housing. Since the work rolls are supported throughout their length, any mechanical deflection is minimal, and extremely close gauge tolerances can be maintained across the full width of the material being rolled.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the problem of shape (or flat-ness) control for Sendzimir 20 -roll {{cold-rolling}} steel mills. Such mills, with a variety of shape actuators, offer the control engineer considerable choice in the configuration and design of a shape con-trol system. In addition, the <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>mill</b> is a reversing mill, with shape measurement devices {{at either end of the}} mill, providing a facility for feedforward of incoming shape disturbances. The mul-tivariable problem presented by the mill has a significant singu-larity problem, which is tackled in this paper using a variety of ap-proaches, motivated by both practical (operational) considerations and formal theoretical procedures. A final challenge lies in the de-sire to economize on the number of controllers required to cover the mill over its wide range of operating conditions. The paper compares and contrasts various controller possibilities and is in-tended to provide a “cookbook ” of shape control tools and strate-gies for Sendzimir mills.

40|$|A {{new kind}} of {{numerical}} method, Contact Element Method (CEM) with two relative coordinates, has been proposed. There are two main characteristics in this method. First, meshing {{is based on the}} contact length between the rolls or between the work roll and the strip; second, two relative coordinates are established for every element depending on the contact objects. A matrix for analyzing the rolling process of a <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>mill</b> has been established as well as a software SM 4 SM (Setup Models for <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>Mill)</b> by which the strip edge drop during rolling has been studied using the CEM. The calculated results show that the strip edge drop will decrease when increasing the 1 st intermediate roll (IMR) taper slope and length, reducing the 1 st IMR shifting, increasing the roll J and the work roll crown, or increasing the tension stress; by contraries, the strip edge drop will increase. Meanwhile, three methods (changing the work roll crown, changing the work roll edge rigidity, changing the pressure distribution on the work roll) for controlling the strip edge drop are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{presence}} of several rolls in cluster {{cold rolling mills}} makes on-line vibration monitoring and failure analysis difficult. The dynamic behaviour of rolls strongly depends on the rolling pressure in the roll bite. Strip vibration applies a dynamic component on the rolling force acting on the work roll and may excite the resonance of the mill stand. This problem motivates predicting the cluster mill dynamics by using a numerical model. It may help in planning the maintenance operation of rolls and bearings and in reducing the service costs. A complete dynamic analysis of the cluster mill layout has seldom been proposed in the literature. In this article, the authors investigate the dynamic behaviour of a <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>mill.</b> A numerical simulator developed in the Matlab/Simulink environment is used to distinguish the effects of chattering, rolls unbalance, motor dynamic irregularities, and bearing fault. Analytical approaches proposed to compute the dynamic component of the rolling force are used as an input to excite the rolls vibration in the cluster mill simulator. Numerical results are used to interpret some preliminary experimental measures performed on the operating <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>mill.</b> Some goals were achieved. This investigation allowed the distinguishing of the dynamic effects due to the rolls from those related to the motor and bearings fault. Critical parameters used in the numerical model were identified. To complete this study, a fully instrumented cold rolling mill has {{to be used in}} order to measure all the dynamic signals required to detect the relevant phenomena that have to be prevented...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} improved {{technology for}} attaining high-quality rolled metal strip. The {{new technology is}} based on an innovative method to model both the static and dynamic characteristics of rolling mill deflection, and it applies equally to both cluster-type and non cluster-type rolling mill configurations. By effectively combining numerical Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with analytical solid mechanics, the devised approach delivers a rapid, accurate, flexible, high-fidelity model useful for optimizing many important rolling parameters. The associated static deflection model enables computation of the thickness profile and corresponding flatness of the rolled strip. Accurate methods of predicting the strip thickness profile and strip flatness are important in rolling mill design, rolling schedule set-up, control of mill flatness actuators, and optimization of ground roll profiles. The corresponding dynamic deflection model enables solution of the standard eigenvalue problem to determine natural frequencies and modes of vibration. The presented method for solving the roll-stack deflection problem offers several important advantages over traditional methods. In particular, it includes continuity of elastic foundations, non-iterative solution when using pre-determined elastic foundation moduli, continuous third-order displacement fields, simple stress-field determination, the ability to calculate dynamic characteristics, and a comparatively faster solution time. Consistent with the most advanced existing methods, the presented method accommodates loading conditions that represent roll crowning, roll bending, roll shifting, and roll crossing mechanisms. Validation of the static model is provided by comparing results and solution time with large-scale, commercial finite element simulations. In addition to examples with the common 4 -high vertical stand rolling mill, application of the presented method to the most complex of rolling mill configurations is demonstrated with an optimization example involving the 20 -high <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>mill...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{chatter mark}} {{vibration}} {{generated in the}} rolling process of the twenty-high roll mill not only significantly affects the mill performance, but also reduces surface quality of the strip steel. To identify the excitation source, the online monitor for the real time torsional strain of the main drive shaft is performed for a <b>Sendzimir</b> twenty-high roll <b>mill.</b> A corresponding relationship between the torsion variation of the main drive shaft and the period variation of the working roller is observed. The dynamic rolling skid model is further established and the torsion variation of the main drive shaft is simulated. The calculated results are compared with the measured torsion variation signal of the main drive shaft for without chatter mark vibration. The corresponding characteristics between the chatter mark vibration and the rolling skid is obtained. The results not only support the effective of the established model, but also reveal {{the relationship between the}} chatter mark vibration and the rolling skid, which provides for the development of monitoring method for the chatter mark vibration of the twenty-high roll mill...|$|R
40|$|Shape (or flatness) {{control for}} rolled steel strip is {{becoming}} increasingly important as customer requirements become more stringent. Automatic shape control is now more or less mandatory on all new four-high cold mills, but no comprehensive scheme yet exists on a <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>mill.</b> This {{is due to the}} complexity of the control system design on such a mill, where many more degrees of freedom for control exist than is the case with the four-high mills. The objective of the current work is to develop, from first principles, such a system; including automatic control of the As-U-Roll and first intermediate roll actuators in response to the measured strip shape. This thesis concerns itself primarily with the As-U-Roll control system. The material presented is extremely wide-ranging. Areas covered include the development of original static and dynamic mathematical models of the mill systems, and testing of the plant by data-logging to tune these models. A basic control system philosophy proposed by other workers is modified and developed to suit the practical system requirements and the data provided by the models. The control strategy is tested by comprehensive multivariable simulation studies. Finally, details are given of the practical problems faced when installing the system on the plant. These include problems of manual control inter-action bumpless transfer and integral desaturation. At the time of presentation of the thesis, system commissioning is still in progress and production results are therefore not yet available. Nevertheless, the simulation studies predict a successful outcome, although performance is expected to be limited until the first intermediate roll actuators are eventually included in the scheme also...|$|E
