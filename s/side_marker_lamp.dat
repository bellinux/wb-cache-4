40|$|Abstract-The present {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effect of small amber lamps mounted near {{the front and rear}} on each side of a passenger car-so called <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps-on visual detection and recognition of passenger cars in complex nighttime environments. It was determined whether cars equipped with <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> are detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than cars without <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps.</b> Subjects were presented with slides of natural nighttime scenes in which a car, either with or without <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps,</b> viewed from its side, approaching from a side street, was either present or not. Subjects determined as fast as possible whether a car was present or not. Reaction time measures (speed and accuracy) indicated that both under clear and fog visibility conditions, a car equipped with <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> was detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than a car without <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps.</b> The results indicate that <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> increase both lateral conspicuity and recognizability suggesting that <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> may be effective i...|$|R

40|$|This {{field study}} {{investigated}} the efficiency of color coding for peripheral identification of vehicle signals. Specifically, the study dealt with identification of stimuli as “yellow” or “red” when presented at intensities corresponding to typical turn signal <b>lamps</b> and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps.</b> Turn signal lamps were studied both during bright, sunny conditions and at night, while <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> were studied at night only. We used two different yellow stimuli and two different red stimuli. For each color category, one stimulus was relatively far from the contrasting color category while the other stimulus was relatively near. Four viewing angles were used: 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees from visual fixation. A total of 28 subjects participated, ranging from 21 to 78 years old. Nighttime identification of colors was perfect at all viewing angles for stimuli representing turn signal lamps. On the other hand, there were strong effects of viewing angle for turn signals in the daytime and for <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> at night. Although in these two conditions performance deteriorated for stimuli in both color categories, it did so more for the red stimuli. This {{finding is consistent with}} the previously reported finding that peripherally presented red stimuli often appear yellow. The present findings imply that coding signals yellow and red is not sufficient for their peripheral identification under the two most difficult conditions tested (turn signals during bright daytime and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> during nighttime). To the extent that peripheral discriminability is important in actual driving, efficient signaling should rely on other coding parameters (e. g., intensity, and flashing versus steady burning) ...|$|R

The interior was all new, as well, sharing the Torino/Fairlane's distinctive four-pod instrument cluster.
