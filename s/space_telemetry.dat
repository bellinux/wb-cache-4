As {{the data is}} functional, we consider the coefficients obtained after projecting the observations onto orthonormal bases (wavelet, PCA). A multiple testing procedure based on the two-sample test is defined in order to highlight the levels of the coefficients on which the outliers appear as significantly different to the normal data. The selected coefficients are then called features for the outlier detection, on which we compute the Local Outlier Factor to highlight the outliers.

40|$|The basic {{concatenated}} coding {{system for the}} <b>space</b> <b>telemetry</b> channel consists of a Reed-Solomon (RS) outer code, a symbol interleaver/deinterleaver, and a bandwidth efficient trellis inner code. A block diagram of this configuration is shown. The system may operate {{with or without the}} outer code and interleaver. In this recommendation, the outer code remains the (255, 223) RS code over GF(2 exp 8) with an error correcting capability of t = 16 eight bit symbols. This code's excellent performance and the existence of fast, cost effective, decoders justify its continued use. The purpose of the interleaver/deinterleaver is to distribute burst errors out of the inner decoder over multiple codewords of the outer code. This utilizes the error correcting capability of the outer code more efficiently and reduces the probability of an RS decoder failure. Since the <b>space</b> <b>telemetry</b> channel is not considered bursty, the required interleaving depth is primarily a function of the inner decoding method. A diagram of an interleaver with depth 4 that is compatible with the (255, 223) RS code is shown. Specific interleaver requirements are discussed after the inner code recommendations...|$|E

However, most previous methods for this problem suffer from too many parameter settings which are difficult for users.

In this paper, we propose a Haar wavelet and augmented trie based algorithm to mine the top-K discords from a time series database, which can dynamically determine the word size for compression. Due to the characteristics of Haar wavelet transform, our algorithm has greater pruning power than previous approaches. Through experiments with some annotated datasets, the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm are both attested. ...|$|R
