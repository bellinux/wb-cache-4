5|$|The Catholic Church teaches that, {{immediately}} after death, {{the soul of}} each person will receive a particular judgement from God, based on their <b>sins</b> <b>and</b> their relationship to Christ. This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement, according to the church's teaching, will {{bring an end to}} human history and mark the beginning of both a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness.|$|E
5|$|In late April 2004, Fertig {{was called}} up to the SmackDown! brand with vignettes playing on the show announcing his new character, Mordecai, a {{religious}} Zealot-type character, which was partially based on his previous Seven gimmick. During numerous promos, Mordecai claimed {{to be on a}} crusade to rid the world of sin. He consistently wore white and had blonde hair and a beard as a sign of his purity. Mordecai debuted in ring for the SmackDown! brand on May 16, 2004 during the Judgment Day pay-per-view, defeating Scotty 2 Hotty. In later appearances, Mordecai condemned the audience for their <b>sins,</b> <b>and</b> led them in prayer. Fertig's Mordecai character was originally created to have a feud with The Undertaker.|$|E
5|$|The second plotline {{revolves}} around a Father Coughlin-esque Methodist preacher, Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown), {{who lives with}} his sister Iris in California. He shares Ben's prophetic dreams and slowly discovers {{the extent of his}} own unearthly powers, which include bending human beings to his will and making their <b>sins</b> <b>and</b> greatest evils manifest as terrifying visions. Certain that he is doing God's work, Brother Justin fully devotes himself to his religious duties, not realizing that his ultimate nemesis Ben Hawkins and the carnival are inexorably drawing closer.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of {{original}} sin, according to Catholics, human nature has not been totally corrupted (as opposed {{to the teaching of}} Luther and Calvin); rather, human nature has only been weakened and wounded, subject to ignorance, suffering, the domination of death, and the inclination to <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> evil (CCC 405, 418). This inclination toward <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> evil is called [...] "concupiscence" [...] (CCC 405, 418). Baptism, CCC teaches, erases original <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> turns a man back towards God. [...] The inclination toward <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> evil persists, however, and he must continue to struggle against concupiscence (CCC 2520).|$|R

5|$|On 9th Dhu al-Hijjah before noon, pilgrims {{arrive at}} Arafat, a barren and plain land some 20 {{kilometers}} east of Mecca, {{where they stand}} in contemplative vigil: they offer supplications, repent on and atone for their past <b>sins,</b> <b>and</b> seek mercy of God, and listen to sermon from the Islamic scholars who deliver it from near Jabal al-Rahmah (The Mount of Mercy) from where Muhammad {{is said to have}} delivered his last sermon. Lasting from noon through sunset, this is known as 'standing before God' (wuquf), {{one of the most significant}} rites of Hajj. At Masjid al-Namirah, pilgrims offer noon and afternoon prayers together at noon time. A pilgrim's Hajj is considered invalid if they do not spend the afternoon on Arafat.|$|E

It was believed that Nri's influence and bountiful amount of food was a reward for the ruler's blessings. Above all, Nri was a holy land for those Igbo who followed its edicts. It served as a place where <b>sins</b> <b>and</b> taboos could be absolved just by entering it. Even Igbo living far from the center of power would send abnormal children to Nri for ritual cleansing rather than having them killed, as was sometimes the case for dwarfs or children who cut their top teeth before their lower teeth.|$|E

At {{the start of the}} series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. The character's initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment {{at the start of the}} series, but the challenge of undoing past <b>sins</b> <b>and</b> changing old ways is an enormous one for a being who has been set in his ways for billions of years. In its beginnings, the series is a very dark horror comic. Later, the series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a tragic hero.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to define and analyse the aspects of <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> blame in Unamuno's prosaic work. After brief introduction to Unamuno's intellectual system and the definition of concepts of <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> blame emphasis is put on Unamuno's theoretical demarcation of <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> blame in his essayistic work. From this theoretical basis results the classification of these aspects in each belletristic work, whereas there {{is an effort to}} comment all possible interpretation of these concepts in each work. The analysis of these novels {{from the point of view}} of classification of <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> blame focuses on new possible interpretation and connection in Unamuno's system, which has been till now rather neglected and brings therefore a new point of view on some of it's aspects...|$|R
