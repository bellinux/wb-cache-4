5|$|Cortinarius violaceus {{mushrooms}} are considered edible, {{but they are}} not choice; instead, the primary appeal of the species to mushroom hunters, according to Arora, is its beauty. Its <b>similarity</b> <b>to</b> some other (inedible or toxic) webcaps renders it risky to eat. The taste after cooking is reportedly bitter.|$|E

5|$|Programmer Ed Salvo was {{inspired}} to make Lost Luggage when {{he was waiting for}} his luggage at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and the game took around four weeks to produce.

It is the third most popular language whose grammatical syntax is not predominantly based on C, e.g. C++, Objective-C (note, C# and Java only have partial syntactic <b>similarity</b> <b>to</b> C, {{such as the use of}} curly braces, and are closer in <b>similarity</b> <b>to</b> each other than C).|$|E

5|$|A {{panelled}} stone {{structure in}} the church, carved with processions of bearded and robed figures under arches, seems to reproduce details found in the Book of Cerne, a work associated with Bishop Æthelwold of Lichfield (818–830). The panels, which may originally have been the outer part of a sarcophagus built to hold {{the remains of a}} high status person such as Saint Hardulph, are dated by their <b>similarity</b> <b>to</b> the illustrations in the Book of Cerne to the first third of the ninth century. According to a medieval calendar of saints, the Benedictine monks at Breedon celebrated Hardulph's feast day on 21 August.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bitorquis, also edible, has {{a similar}} appearance, but can be {{distinguished}} by its double ring, {{and the lack of}} a fishy or briny odor. Additionally, A.bitorquis does not stain reddish when cut, and usually does not have a scaly or warty cap. The Hungarian species A.bernardiiformis, named for its <b>similarity</b> <b>to</b> A.bernardii, is distinguished from the latter by its smaller spores (6.2–8.2 by 5.4–6.2μm) and its club-shaped cheilocystidia that measure 17–35 by 7–9.5μm. MycoBank, however, considers the two species to be conspecific.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of mtDNA {{sequences}} {{has confirmed}} morphological and biogeographical studies {{suggesting that the}} razorbill is the closest living relative of the great auk. The great auk also was related closely to the little auk (dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to Pinguinus. Due to its outward <b>similarity</b> <b>to</b> the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the great auk often {{was placed in the}} genus Alca, following Linnaeus.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a <b>similarity</b> <b>to</b> the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and {{there would have been}} a caudal keel present on either side of the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Apeomyoides savagei was {{described}} as a new genus and species by Kent Smith, Richard Cifelli, and Nicholas Czaplewski in 2006. The generic name, Apeomyoides, adds the Greek suffix -ides, indicating <b>similarity,</b> <b>to</b> the name of the related genus Apeomys, while the specific name, savagei, honors Donald E. Savage for his work on fossil mammals and for assistance to Smith. In the same paper, these scientists argued in favor of apeomyine affinities for Arikareeomys.|$|E
