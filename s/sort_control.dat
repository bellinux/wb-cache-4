40|$|Endosomal protein <b>sorting</b> <b>controls</b> the {{localization}} of many physiologically important pro-teins and {{is linked}} to several neurodegenerative diseases. VPS 35 is {{a component of the}} retromer complex, which mediates endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of membrane proteins such as the cation-independent mannose 6 -phosphate receptor. Furthermore, retromer is also required for the endosomal recruitment of the actin nucleation promoting WASH complex. The VPS 35 D 620 N mutation causes a rare form of autosomal-dominant Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we show that this mutant associates poorly with the WASH complex and impairs WASH recruitment to endosomes. Autophagy is impaired in cells expressing PD-mutant VPS 35 or lacking WASH. The autophagy defects can be explained, at least in part, by abnormal trafficking of the autophagy protein ATG 9 A. Thus, the PD-causing D 620 N mutation in VPS 35 restricts WASH complex recruitment to endosomes, and reveals a novel role for the WASH complex in autophagosome formation...|$|R
40|$|SummarySecretion of RNAs in {{extracellular}} vesicles is a newly recognized form of intercellular communication. A potential {{regulatory protein}} for microRNA (miRNA) secretion {{is the critical}} RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) component Argonaute 2 (Ago 2). Here, we use isogenic colon cancer cell lines to show that overactivity of KRAS due to mutation inhibits localization of Ago 2 to multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) and decreases Ago 2 secretion in exosomes. Mechanistically, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEKs) I and II, but not Akt, reverses {{the effect of the}} activating KRAS mutation and leads to increased Ago 2 -MVE association and increased exosomal secretion of Ago 2. Analysis of cells expressing mutant Ago 2 constructs revealed that phosphorylation of Ago 2 on serine 387 prevents Ago 2 -MVE interactions and reduces Ago 2 secretion into exosomes. Furthermore, regulation of Ago 2 exosomal <b>sorting</b> <b>controls</b> the levels of three candidate miRNAs in exosomes. These data identify a key regulatory signaling event that controls Ago 2 secretion in exosomes...|$|R
