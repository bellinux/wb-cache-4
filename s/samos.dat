5|$|In response, the Athenian navy under Xanthippus {{joined with}} the Allied fleet off Delos. They were then {{approached}} by a delegation from <b>Samos,</b> who suggested that the Ionian cities would revolt if the Allied fleet successfully engaged the Persian fleet. They furthermore pointed out the poor morale and reduced seaworthiness of the Persian fleet. Leotychides decided to attempt this, and sailed for <b>Samos.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phrynichus, {{fearing that}} Alcibiades if {{restored}} would avenge himself upon {{him for his}} opposition, sent a secret letter to the Spartan Admiral, Astyochus, {{to tell him that}} Alcibiades was ruining their cause by making Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians, and containing an express revelation {{of the rest of the}} intrigue. Astyochus went up to Alcibiades and Tissaphernes at Magnesia and communicated to them Phrynichus's letter. Alcibiades responded in kind, sending to the authorities at <b>Samos</b> a letter against Phrynichus, stating what he had done, and requiring that he should be put to death. Phrynichus in desperation wrote again to Astyochus, offering him a chance to destroy the Athenian fleet at <b>Samos.</b> This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades who informed the officers at <b>Samos</b> that they had been betrayed by Phrynichus. Alcibiades however gained no credit, because Phrynichus had anticipated Alcibiades's letter and, before the accusations could arrive, told the army that he had received information of an enemy plan to attack the camp and that they should fortify <b>Samos</b> as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|Though {{they were}} influential, Pericles, Aspasia {{and their friends}} were not immune from attack, as preeminence in {{democratic}} Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule. Her relationship with Pericles and her subsequent political influence aroused many reactions. Donald Kagan, a Yale historian, believes that Aspasia was particularly unpopular {{in the years immediately}} following the Samian War. In 440 BC, <b>Samos</b> was at war with Miletus over Priene, an ancient city of Ionia in the foot-hills of Mycale. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians. When the Athenians ordered the two sides to stop fighting and submit the case to arbitration at Athens, the Samians refused. In response, Pericles passed a decree dispatching an expedition to <b>Samos.</b> The campaign proved to be difficult and the Athenians had to endure heavy casualties before <b>Samos</b> was defeated. According to Plutarch, it was thought that Aspasia, who came from Miletus, was responsible for the Samian War, and that Pericles had decided against and attacked <b>Samos</b> to gratify her.|$|E
5|$|Many Samians were {{appalled by}} the actions of their generals at Lade, and {{resolved}} to emigrate before their old tyrant, Aeaces of <b>Samos,</b> returned to rule them. They accepted an invitation from the people of Zancle to settle on the coast of Sicily, and took with them the Milesians who had managed to escape from the Persians. <b>Samos</b> itself was spared from destruction by the Persians because of the Samian defection at Lade. Most of Caria now surrendered to the Persians, although some strongholds had to be captured through force.|$|E
5|$|According to Pausanias {{he was the}} son of Diotimus. Ancient {{commentators}} mention {{an association}} between Milo and the philosopher Pythagoras, who lived at or near Croton for many years. Commentators may have confused the philosopher with an athletic trainer, Pythagoras of <b>Samos,</b> but it is also possible the trainer and the philosopher were the same person.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the failure of the negotiations, the conspirators succeeded in overthrowing the {{democracy}} and imposing the oligarchic government of the Four Hundred, among the leaders of which were Phrynichus and Pisander. At <b>Samos,</b> however, a similar coup instigated by the conspirators did not go forward so smoothly. Samian democrats learned of the conspiracy and notified four prominent Athenians: the generals Leon and Diomedon, the trierarch Thrasybulus, and Thrasyllus, at that time a hoplite in the ranks. With the support of these men and the Athenian soldiers in general, the Samian democrats were able to defeat the 300 Samian oligarchs who attempted to seize power there. Further, the Athenian troops at <b>Samos</b> formed themselves into a political assembly, deposed their generals, and elected new ones, including Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. The army, stating that they had not revolted from the city but that the city had revolted from them, resolved to stand by the democracy while continuing to prosecute the war against Sparta.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory that}} the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first {{proposed}} by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of <b>Samos</b> in the 3rd century BC, and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism). This view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes {{was born}} c. 287BC in the seaport city of Syracuse, Sicily, {{at that time}} a self-governing colony in Magna Graecia, located {{along the coast of}} Southern Italy. The date of birth is based on a {{statement}} by the Byzantine Greek historian John Tzetzes that Archimedes lived for 75 years. In The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an astronomer about whom nothing is known. Plutarch wrote in his Parallel Lives that Archimedes was related to King Hiero II, the ruler of Syracuse. A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure. It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children. During his youth, Archimedes may have studied in Alexandria, Egypt, where Conon of <b>Samos</b> and Eratosthenes of Cyrene were contemporaries. He referred to Conon of <b>Samos</b> as his friend, while two of his works (The Method of Mechanical Theorems and the Cattle Problem) have introductions addressed to Eratosthenes.|$|E
5|$|At Syracuse, he {{repaired}} {{the city}} walls and the temples of the gods. He had new roads built and pushed to keep roads in good condition. He had planned to rebuild the palace of Polycrates at <b>Samos,</b> to finish the temple of Didymaean Apollo at Ephesus and to found a city {{high up in the}} Alps. He planned to dig a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece and sent a chief centurion to survey the work.|$|E
5|$|At this point, several {{conflicts}} {{began to}} develop that threatened {{the future of the}} new government at Athens. First, the planned coup at <b>Samos</b> was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats and a group of Athenians who they entrusted with helping them. When the army at <b>Samos</b> heard the news of the coup at Athens, which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government, they declared their loyalty to democracy and hostility to the new government. At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of Scelias {{as the leader of the}} moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by Phrynicus, containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and Antiphon, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were willing to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although willing to seek peace with Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens' power, were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5,000, presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher.|$|E
5|$|From ca. 1088 on, he {{used his}} base at Smyrna to wage war against the Byzantines. Employing Christian craftsmen, he built a fleet, with which he {{captured}} Phocaea and the eastern Aegean islands of Lesbos (except for the fortress of Methymna), <b>Samos,</b> Chios and Rhodes. A Byzantine fleet under Niketas Kastamonites was sent against him, but Tzachas defeated it in battle. Some modern scholars have speculated that his activities during this time {{may have been in}} conjunction, and perhaps even coordination, with two contemporary Byzantine Greek rebels, Rhapsomates in Cyprus, and Karykes in Crete.|$|E
5|$|In a naval {{battle the}} Athenians led by Pericles and nine other generals {{defeated}} {{the forces of}} <b>Samos</b> and imposed on the island an Athenian administration. When the Samians revolted against Athenian rule, Pericles compelled the rebels to capitulate after a tough siege of eight months, which resulted in substantial discontent among the Athenian sailors. Pericles then quelled a revolt in Byzantium and, {{when he returned to}} Athens, gave a funeral oration to honor the soldiers who died in the expedition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of art, the {{original}} Greek authorities are Duris of <b>Samos,</b> Xenocrates of Sicyon, and Antigonus of Carystus. The anecdotic element has been ascribed to Duris (XXXIV:61); the notices of the successive developments {{of art and the}} list of workers in bronze and painters to Xenocrates; and a large amount of miscellaneous information to Antigonus. Both Xenocrates and Antigonus are named in connection with Parrhasius (XXXV:68), while Antigonus is named in the indexes of XXXIII–XXXIV as a writer on the art of embossing metal, or working it in ornamental relief or intaglio.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 479 BC, the Greeks {{assembled}} a huge army (by contemporary standards), and marched to confront Mardonius at the Battle of Plataea. At the same time, the allied fleet sailed to <b>Samos,</b> where the demoralised remnants of the Persian navy were based. The Persians, seeking to avoid a battle, beached their fleet below the slopes of Mycale, and, {{with the support of}} a Persian army group, built a palisaded camp. The Greek commander Leotychides decided to attack the Persians anyway, landing the fleet's complement of marines to do so.|$|E
5|$|Many Samians were {{appalled by}} the actions of their generals at Lade, and {{resolved}} to emigrate before their old tyrant, Aeaces, returned to rule them. They accepted an invitation from the people of Zancle to settle on the coast of Sicily, and took with them such Milesians as had escaped from the Persians. <b>Samos</b> itself was spared from destruction by the Persians because of the Samian defection at Lade. Meanwhile, Dionysius of Phocaea went to Sicily, and established himself as a pirate, preying on Carthaginian ships.|$|E
5|$|The Samian War {{was one of}} {{the last}} {{significant}} military events before the Peloponnesian War. After Thucydides' ostracism, Pericles was re-elected yearly to the generalship, the only office he ever officially occupied, although his influence was so great as to make him the de facto ruler of the state. In 440 BC <b>Samos</b> went to war against Miletus over control of Priene, an ancient city of Ionia on the foot-hills of Mycale. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{then moved}} {{north along the}} Ionian coast towards <b>Samos,</b> before {{abruptly}} turning west into the Aegean Sea. The fleet sailed next to Naxos, in order to punish the Naxians for their resistance to the failed expedition that the Persians had mounted there a decade earlier. Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains; those that the Persians caught were enslaved. The Persians then burnt the city and temples of the Naxians.|$|E
5|$|The next {{significant}} part {{he would play}} in the war would occur at the Battle of Abydos. Alcibiades had remained behind at <b>Samos</b> with a small force while Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus led {{the greater part of}} the fleet to the Hellespont. During this period, Alcibiades succeeded in raising money from Caria and the neighboring area, with which he was able to pay the rowers and gain their favor. After the Athenian victory at Cynossema, both fleets summoned all their ships from around the Aegean to join them for what might be a decisive next engagement.|$|E
5|$|When the Persians {{heard that}} the Allied fleet was approaching, they set sail from <b>Samos</b> towards the Ionian mainland. According to Herodotus, this was because they had decided in council {{that they could not}} beat the Allies in a naval battle. They sent the Phoenician ships away (Herodotus does not explain why), and then sailed to the shore near Mount Mycale. Xerxes had left an army there, under the command of Tigranes, to guard Ionia. The Persians beached their ships, built a {{palisade}} around them, and prepared to guard the makeshift fort.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades, however, did {{not succeed}} in persuading the satrap to ally with the Athenians, and, to hide this fact, demanded (claiming to be {{speaking}} for Tissaphernes) greater and greater concessions of them until they finally refused to comply. Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander and his companions returned to <b>Samos,</b> where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city's democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination and intimidation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, however, the then megas doux, Michael Stryphnos, was accused by Niketas Choniates of {{enriching}} himself by selling off the equipment {{of the imperial}} fleet, while by the early 13th century {{the authority of the}} central government had weakened {{to such an extent that}} various local potentates began seizing power in the provinces. The general atmosphere was one of lawlessness, which enabled men like Leo Sgouros in southern Greece and the imperial governor of <b>Samos,</b> Pegonites, to use their ships for their own purposes, launching raids of their own. Even Emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195–1203) is said to have licensed one of his commanders, Constantine Phrangopoulos, to launch pirate raids against commerce in the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|Between 8 and 20 May, Napoli was {{involved}} in the seizure of several islands in the Dodecanese between Crete, Rhodes, and <b>Samos.</b> In June, Napoli {{and the rest of the}} 1st Division was stationed at Rhodes. Over the next two months, the ships cruised in the Aegean to prevent the Turks from attempting to launch their own amphibious operations to retake the islands Italy had seized in May. The 1st Division returned to Italy in late August for repairs and refitting, and were replaced by the battleships of the 2nd Squadron. The 1st Division left port on 14 October, but was recalled later that day, when the Ottomans had agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war.|$|E
5|$|In The Acharnians, Aristophanes blames Aspasia for the Peloponnesian War. He {{claims that}} the Megarian decree of Pericles, which {{excluded}} Megara from trade with Athens or its allies, was retaliation for prostitutes being kidnapped from the house of Aspasia by Megarians. Aristophanes' portrayal of Aspasia as responsible, from personal motives, for {{the outbreak of the}} war with Sparta may reflect memory of the earlier episode involving Miletus and <b>Samos.</b> Plutarch reports also the taunting comments of other comic poets, such as Eupolis and Cratinus. According to Podlecki, Douris appears to have propounded the view that Aspasia instigated both the Samian and Peloponnesian Wars.|$|E
5|$|In this treatise, Archimedes {{counts the}} number of grains of sand that will fit inside the universe. This book {{mentions}} the heliocentric theory {{of the solar system}} proposed by Aristarchus of <b>Samos,</b> as well as contemporary ideas {{about the size of the}} Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the myriad, Archimedes concludes that {{the number of}} grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8 in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. The Sand Reckoner or Psammites is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, {{there seems}} to have been some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by the isthmus, but whose fleet were the key to the security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year. When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off <b>Samos,</b> both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.|$|E
5|$|The archaic is {{demonstrated}} by jewellery and pieces such as the limestone Lady of Auxerre, from 640 BC; and the cylindrical Hera of <b>Samos,</b> circa 570–560BC. After the 4thcenturyBC, focus on the human form increased, exemplified by the Borghese Gladiator. The Louvre holds masterpieces from the Hellenistic era, including The Winged Victory of Samothrace (190BC) and the Venus de Milo, symbolic of classical art. The long Galerie Campana displays an outstanding {{collection of more than}} one thousand Greek potteries. In the galleries paralleling the Seine, much of the museum's Roman sculpture is displayed. The Roman portraiture is representative of that genre; examples include the portraits of Agrippa and Annius Verus; among the bronzes is the Greek Apollo of Piombino.|$|E
5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to <b>Samos</b> to {{challenge}} {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged from the camp but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Marcellus in 23BC, Augustus married his {{daughter}} to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Julia, Agrippina the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering {{the eastern half of}} the Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at <b>Samos</b> in the eastern Aegean. This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, {{but it was also a}} measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.|$|E
5|$|At {{his first}} {{speech to the}} {{assembled}} troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about {{the circumstances of his}} exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of his speech were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of him and to increase his credit with the army at <b>Samos.</b> Upon hearing his speech the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused them so much that they proposed to sail at once for Piraeus and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the folly of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led to the immediate defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades's reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, Philip treated Athens very leniently indeed; {{although}} the Second Athenian Confederacy was dissolved, the Athenians {{were allowed to}} keep their colony on <b>Samos,</b> and their prisoners were freed without ransom. Philip's motives are not entirely clear, but one likely explanation is that he hoped to use the Athenian navy in his campaign against Persia, since Macedon did not possess a substantial fleet; he therefore needed to remain on good terms with the Athenians. Philip also made peace with the other combatants, Corinth and Chalcis, which controlled important strategic locations; both received Macedonian garrisons. He then turned to deal with Sparta, which had not taken part in the conflict, but was likely {{to take advantage of}} the weakened state of the other Greek cities to try to attack its neighbours in the Peloponnese. The Spartans refused Philip's invitation to engage in discussions, so Philip ravaged Lacedaemonia, but did not attack Sparta itself.|$|E
5|$|Following the Babylonians, {{significant}} {{advances in}} astronomy {{were made in}} ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena. In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of <b>Samos</b> estimated the size and distance of the Moon and Sun, {{and was the first}} to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system. In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered precession, calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe. Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy. The Antikythera mechanism (c. 150–80 BC) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, Moon, and planets for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe.|$|E
5|$|For most of history, {{humanity}} did {{not recognize}} or {{understand the concept of}} the Solar System. Most people up to the Late Middle Ages–Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of <b>Samos</b> had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system. In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed Earth. The invention of the telescope led to the discovery of further planets and moons. Improvements in the telescope and the use of unmanned spacecraft have enabled the investigation of geological phenomena, such as mountains, craters, seasonal meteorological phenomena, such as clouds, dust storms and ice caps on the other planets.|$|E
5|$|In {{the dark}} age that {{followed}} {{the collapse of the}} Mycenaean civilization, significant numbers of Greeks emigrated to Asia Minor and settled there. These settlers were from three tribal groups: the Aeolians, Dorians and Ionians. The Ionians had settled along the coasts of Lydia and Caria, founding the twelve cities which made up Ionia. These cities were Miletus, Myus and Priene in Caria; Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedos, Teos, Clazomenae, Phocaea and Erythrae in Lydia; and the islands of <b>Samos</b> and Chios. Although the Ionian cities were independent from each other, they acknowledged their shared heritage, and had a common temple and meeting place, the Panionion. They thus formed a 'cultural league', to which they would admit no other cities, or even other tribal Ionians. The cities of Ionia had remained independent until they were conquered by the famous Lydian king Croesus, in around 560 BC. The Ionian cities then remained under Lydian rule until Lydia was in turn conquered by the nascent Achaemenid Empire of Cyrus the Great.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} {{aftermath}} of these successes that Alcibiades resolved to finally return to Athens in the spring of 407 BC. Even {{in the wake of his}} recent victories, Alcibiades was exceedingly careful in his return, mindful of the changes in government, the charges still technically hanging over him, and the great injury he had done to Athens. Thus Alcibiades, instead of going straight home, first went to <b>Samos</b> to pick up 20 ships and proceeded with them to the Ceramic Gulf where he collected 100 talents. He finally sailed to Gytheion to make inquiries, partly about the reported preparations of the Spartans there, and partly about the feelings in Athens about his return. His inquiries assured him that the city was kindly disposed towards him and that his closest friends urged him to return.|$|E
5|$|Martino Zaccaria was a {{scion of}} the Genoese Zaccaria family. Through his father, Nicolino Zaccaria, {{he was a}} nephew to Benedetto I Zaccaria, lord of Chios and of Phocaea on the Anatolian coast. Benedetto I had {{captured}} Chios from the Byzantine Empire in 1304, citing the island's vulnerability to Turkish raids. His occupation was acknowledged by the impotent Byzantine emperor, Andronikos II Palaiologos, initially {{for a period of}} 10 years, but which was then renewed at five-year intervals. Benedetto died in 1307 and was succeeded in Chios by his son, Paleologo Zaccaria. When he died childless in 1314, the island passed to Martino and his brother, Benedetto II. Chios was a small but wealthy domain, with an annual income of 120,000 gold hyperpyra. Over the next few years, Martino made it the core of a small realm encompassing several islands off the shore of Asia Minor, including <b>Samos</b> and Kos.|$|E
