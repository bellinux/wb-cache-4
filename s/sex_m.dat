40|$|In {{this study}} we used a gender {{diagnostic}} (GD) approach to examine the associations between gender-atypical behavior and gender role (masculinity—M and femininity—F), bullying, peer relationships, and psychological well-being in a large community sample of 15 -year-olds. GD showed little relationship with gender role. Irrespective of <b>sex,</b> <b>M</b> was positively, and F negatively associated with being a bully. “Gender atypical” boys reported more victimization, more loneliness, fewer male friends, and greater distress than their “gender typical” peers. After accounting for M and F, “femaleness” (“gender atypical” boys and “extremely gender-typed” girls) was associated with psychological distress.

The draft of a structured interview was administered to five cases. Data were analyzed by open source Rstudio and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results There were no differences between cases and controls as far as the presence of alexithymia and depressive traits are concerned. The QoL cases scored lower in physical activities and general health compared to controls; sex life experiences of the case group significantly differ from controls in terms of sexual monitoring (SAQ subscale). Women in the BEEC group had significantly lower scores in the Sexual History Form compared to controls.

The impairment of EF assessed as flow mediated dilation (FMD) of brachial artery can predict futurecardiovascular disease. To assess the alteration of EF, we longitudinally evaluate FMD in prepubertal patients with geneticallyconfirmed FH. Twelve children (7 M, 5 F; 8. 19 ± 2. 90 yr.) with FH and 20 control subjects entered the study. Subjects withdiabetes, obesity or other metabolic disorders were excluded. In all FH patients lipid values and FMD were determined at thebeginning {{of the study and}} after 32. 8 ± 9. 55 mo. of diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol. FMD function was assessed bymeasurement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the brachial artery using an ultrasound system. FMD was expressed aspercentage change of diameter following reactive hyperemia from baseline. The lower FMD values obtained in our control patientwas 7 % so we considered it as cut-off. The baseline evaluation showed that FMD in FH children was not significantly different thancontrol peers (20. 9 ± 23. 3 vs 12. 5 ± 7. 28 %; p= 0. 143). According to <b>sex,</b> <b>M</b> were significantly older than F and had a longer followup (38. 1 ± 7. 52 vs 25. 5 ± 7. 09 mo.; p = 0. 015).

The impairment was shown in 75 % vs. 25 % of children found at the start. No correlation was demonstrated betweenFMD and lipid levels, age and duration of the follow-up.

40|$|Given meta-analytic {{findings}} showing {{females to}} be generally more fearful than males on multi-dimensional self-report measures of fear, an empirical {{attempt was made}} to examine whether this outcome could be explained by psychological factors such as sex role orientation and masculine sex role stress. In addition, the bearing of dissimulation tendencies on findings relating self-reported fears to biological sex, sex roles, and masculine sex role stress was also addressed. Using a non-clinical sample of volunteers from Britain, it was observed with simple correlational analyses that females were more fearful than males on Social, Agoraphobic, Harmless animals and Sexual and aggressive scenes fears, even after holding constant the combined influences of Masculinity and Masculine sex role stress. The sex difference in Bodily injury, death and illness fears emerged only after adjusting for the joint influences of Masculinity and Masculine sex role stress. Applying hierarchical multiple regression analysis with interaction terms, it was found that (a) Biological sex contributed significantly in increasing the proportion of variance accounted for in scores on Social, Agoraphobic, Harmless animals and Sexual and aggressive scenes fears, after accounting for the joint influences of Masculinity (M), Femininity (F), Masculine sex role stress (MGRS), Dissimulation (Lie) and other potentially confounding factors; (b) following the simultaneous adjustment for the influences of the same set of potentially confounding factors (thus including M, F, MGRS, and Lie scores), Biological sex emerged as a consistent predictor of all five types of fears considered, with, as hypothesized, being female predicting high fear scores; (c) the same applied to the predictive ability of Masculine sex role stress (with Biological sex now included as a covariate), with, as predicted, higher stress being predictive of higher fear levels; (d) again, taking into account potentially confounding factors, Masculinity predicted all types of fears considered, except Fears of sexual and aggressive scenes, with, as anticipated, high Masculinity predicting low levels of fear, whereas, contrary to expectations, Femininity and Dissimulation did not succeed in predicting fear scores of any type; (e) few combinations of independent variables (involving Biological <b>sex,</b> <b>M,</b> F, MGRS and Lie) predicted fear scores significantly following adjustment for potential confounds, the significant predictors being MGRS x Biological sex (in relation to Social fears), Lie x Biological sex (Fears of bodily injury, death and illness) and M x F (Harmless animals fears) with respective betas of -. 14,. 17 and. 22 (. 01 less-than-or-equal-to P less-than-or-equal-to. 05); (f) while Biological sex.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{numerous}} studies performed regarding {{the effectiveness of}} prophylactic knee braces (PKB) preventing knee injuries or the effect of PKB on injured knees, but minimal research {{is available on the}} effect of how PKB affect the functioning capacity of uninjured knees. PURPOSE: To examine the effects of two different types of PKB, hinged (HGB) and non-hinged (NHB), on uninjured preferred knee joint range of motion and dynamic balance in males and females. METHODS: Thirty subjects were recruited (male= 15, female= 15) with ages ranging from 18 - 28 years. Only participants with no history of any knee injuries or current knee problems were allowed to participate. Subjects were blinded to the purpose of the study, but were allowed practice trials for the dynamic balance test (Y-Balance test). Prior to experimental trials subjects were measured for body composition and knee brace size. All subjects underwent three experimental trials [HGB, NHB, and a no PKB control (CON) ] on the same day in balanced cross-over design. During the treatment trials, the subjects wore the braces on their preferred leg. Each experimental trial was comprised of a test for dynamic balance and four tests for knee joint range of motion. Dynamic balance composite score, knee extension/flexion (°), and internal/external knee rotation (°) were compared between <b>sex</b> (<b>M,</b> F) and across PKB (HGB, NHB, CON) using an ANOVA (1 between, 1 within), α= 0. 05. Age and body composition differences between sex were examined using independent t-tests, α= 0. 05. RESULTS: M and F did not differ (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) with regard to age, but did differ significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in body mass, body stature, and percent body fat. For the sex main effect, when pooled across PKB (CON, HGB, NHG) M and F did not differ (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) in knee flexion, internal knee rotation, right/left leg balance, but did differ significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in knee extension (M=+ 0. 8 ± 1. 8 °, F=- 0. 6 ± 2. 4 °) and external knee rotation (M= 29. 7 ± 7. 5 °, F= 35. 9 ± 9. 7 °). For the main effect for PKB, when pooled across sex external knee rotation and right/left leg balance did not differ (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) between HGB, NHB, and CON, but both HGB and NHB differed significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) from CON for internal rotation (HGB= 21. 9 ± 10. 3 °, NHB= 22. 5 ± 9. 8 °, CON= 24. 8 ± 10. 0 °), flexion (HGB= 126. 9 ± 17. 7 °, NHB= 125. 7 ± 15. 9 °, CON= 139. 0 ± 6. 8 °), and extension (HGB=+ 0. 7 ± 1. 4 °, NHB=+= 1. 3 ± 1. 8 °, CON=- 1. 7 ± 2. 2 °). The sex x knee brace interaction was not significant (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). CONCLUSION: PKB have no effect on dynamic balance, but appear to hinder the range of motion for most motions of the knee...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to provide {{information}} on the morphometric evolution of dwarf rabbits from growing age until adult age, according to their gender. A total of 136 “coloured dwarf” rabbits (74 males and 62 females) were used. At 20 and 45 weeks of age, the rabbits were weighed and body measurements were taken from each rabbit at predefined anatomical points using digital Caliper (mm) or measuring tape (cm). The measurements were: three distance measurements (in cm) : body length, BL; ear length, EL; head length, HL; one height measurement (in cm) : head height, HH; seven width measurements (in mm) : shoulders width, SW; rump width, RW; tibia width, TW; ear width, EW; forehead width, FHW; head width, HW, fold width, FW; two circumferences (in cm) : thorax circumference, TC; abdomen circumference, AC. Using these body measurements, a total of 3 body indices were estimated to define the general conformation of the animals: compact index 1 : rump width/body length (RW/BL); compact index 2 : thorax circumference/body length (TC/BL); compact index 3 : abdomen circumference/body length (AC/BL). Data collected were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) studying the effect of age (20 wk, 45 wk), <b>sex</b> (<b>M,</b> F) and their interaction (age x sex). Statistical significance of differences was assessed by the t-test. Considering the main effects, all parameters were affected by age and almost all body measurements by sex with the exception of BL, EL, FHW, HL, TC/BL. At both ages, females showed higher live weights than males (1630 vs 1542 g and 1953 vs 1850 g, at 20 and 45 wk of age, respectively). Significant sex differences were found for AC at 45 wk of age: females presented higher AC value than males (29. 5 vs 27. 8 cm; P< 0. 01). As concerns the head measurements with increasing age the males showed the highest mean value of FHW and HW than females 45 wk old and males and females 20 wk old (4. 25 vs 4. 13 and 3. 86 and 3. 87 mm, P< 0. 05; 4. 64 vs 4. 29 and 4. 34 and 4. 18 mm, P< 0. 01, respectively). The FW resulted significantly higher in males at 45 wk of age than females of the same age and males and females 20 wk old (4. 28 vs 3. 63 and 3. 76 and 3. 62 mm, P< 0. 01, respectively). Within the considered indices only compact index 1 (RW/BL) showed significant differences (P< 0. 01) : males 20 wk old resulted less compact than females of the same age and of adult ones. The results showed a clear sex dimorphism for quite all parameters considered, resulting in higher live weight in females than males at both age considered. The live weight and ear length at 45 wk of age exceeded the standard values of the considered dwarf breed and, considering also the high variability observed in most of the measurements used, it appears that through the selection procedures employed probably other breeds were used...|$|E

Three species of Melithreptus occur in the Mt Lofty Ranges : Brown - headed Honeyeater Melithreptus brevirostris; White - naped Honeyeater Melithreptus lunatus; and Black - chinned Honeyeater Melithreptus gularis. Since at least the 1970 ' s all three species have been in decline within the ranges. One species has been reduced in both abundance and distribution within the region (M. gularis), while the other two are now recognised as having reduced in abundance. Melithreptus species in the Mt Lofty Ranges are sympatric with strikingly similar ecology. Melithreptus gularis is the largest of the three, while M. brevirostris and M. lunatus are almost identical in weight, feeding behaviour and morphology. Despite their similarities no studies have closely examined their ecology in sympatry and no studies have examined possible causes of their decline. Interspecific competition is thought to be important in the organisation of honeyeater communities. Studies of nectarivore communities suggest a number of ways in which competition causes the component species to partition resources : size; beak length; habitat; and behaviour, which includes a mix of social and feeding strategies. Due to its role in honeyeater community organisation, changed level of interspecific competition has been highlighted as a possible cause of decline in some honeyeater species in the woodlands of southern Australia. Both interference competition and exploitative competition have been highlighted in various situations (Ford et al. 2001). Given the hypothesised role of interspecific competition in the decline of honeyeater species and the declining status of all the Melithreptus in the Mt Lofty Ranges the genus appeared to provide a good basis for examining the hypothesis that interspecific competition is contributing to the decline of some honeyeater species through exclusion from resources and / or reduction in resources available. (Ford et al. 2001) give the following as potential tests for their interspecific competition hypothesis : 1. examine community structure for ' forbidden combinations ' (pairs of species that rarely occur together); 2. compare time spent in interspecific competition (interference), and foraging in fragmented and continuous habitat; 3. measure seasonal and spatial patterns of resource abundance and depletion; and 4. remove competitors and observe response in abundance and behaviour of other species. These suggestions form the basis for much of the work {{presented in}} this thesis. An initial survey examined not only community structure for forbidden combinations, but also investigated other possible causes of decline, based on literature for both declining woodland birds and Melithreptus. Besides interspecific competition, other possible causes included insufficient preferred habitat, insufficient food resources and landscape fragmentation. Repeated counts of honeyeaters at 90 sites of one hectare in the Mt Lofty Ranges were undertaken over a one year period. Melithreptus lunatus was found to be more abundant where certain eucalypt species occurred (particularly E. viminalis), although this was postulated to be a reflection of productive soils. Melithreptus brevirostris was found to be more abundant where Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (New Holland Honeyeater) was most abundant, despite P. novaehollandiae also being the most widespread and abundant honeyeater in the Mt Lofty Ranges. Thus, the survey work did not find forbidden combinations of honeyeaters. However, the scale at which the survey work was undertaken (sites of 1 ha) may have masked any competition between species due to spatial heterogeneity. At the scale of one hectare there is likely to be areas of resource not used by other honeyeaters, allowing Melithreptus to avoid feeding territories of aggressive honeyeaters. Therefore, in order to more thoroughly investigate competition between P. novaehollandiae and Melithreptus, a removal experiment with finer resolution than 1 ha was carried out. This demonstrated that P. novaehollandiae do prevent M. lunatus from using certain areas of the landscape. A final examination of interactions between Melithreptus and widespread and abundant honeyeaters was carried out {{in the form of a}} survey in which individual trees were watched and visits by honeyeater species timed. Based on observations of Melithreptus, it appeared that generally M. brevirostris groups used a swamping strategy to access defended resources, whereas M. lunatus moved quietly, often as individuals or pairs. Thus the two species were hypothesised to use two different behavioural strategies to access defended resources, termed stealth (the use of secretive behaviour to access resources that are being protected) and swamping (the use of a combined direct approach by a number of individuals to access resources that are being protected). Based on estimations of the standardised protection of resources for individual trees, M. lunatus were able to access defended resources for longer, while M. brevirostris were able to access better defended resources but for a shorter time. These results were consistent with the hypothesis of two different behavioural strategies for accessing defended resources. Both species may employ both strategies, but M. brevirostris more often use swamping, and M. lunatus more often use stealth. Investigating the morphology of the small honeyeaters of the Mt Lofty Ranges confirmed that size and beak length were important in discriminating between most species. However, these did not provide any basis for separating the Melithreptus. Closer examination of morphology between M. brevirostris and the M. lunatus sexes revealed further similarities to those previously documented. The average values for many morphological attributes of M. brevirostris fell between the average value for the M. lunatus sexes, suggesting that ecologically the three species / sexes formed a continuum. The M. lunatus sexes and M. brevirostris were then referred to as the small Melithreptus guild (it was not possible to <b>sex</b> <b>M.</b> brevirostris based on the range of attributes measured). The greatest differences between the small Melithreptus guild were found in wing length and leg morphology. The direction of the differences suggested that M. brevirostris would be more similar to female M. lunatus in movements and more similar to male M. lunatus in foraging behaviour. These two aspects of Melithreptus ecology were the subject of the last and most extensive phase of the project. Movements were investigated for Melithreptus at four sites in the Mt Lofty Ranges using radio - telemetry techniques. Melithreptus were found to use large areas of the landscape and to have large core areas of activity within their home range. Using the same methods confirmed that Melithreptus had larger home ranges (mean 100 % minimum convex polygon 23 hectares) than P. novaehollandiae (mean 100 % MCP 5 hectares), and larger home ranges than those reported in the literature for other honeyeater species. Data on a single M. gularis (100 % MCP 140 hectares) suggest that this species has even larger home range requirements. Information from colour - banded birds suggests that most M. brevirostris and male M. lunatus had stable core areas of activity over the period of this study, while female M. lunatus were less likely to have stable core areas of activity, particularly during the non - breeding season. A trend in home range and movement data was consistent with the hypothesis that M. brevirostris was more similar to female M. lunatus than to male M. lunatus. Behaviour of Melithreptus and P. novaehollandiae were investigated using time budget techniques. Melithreptus were found to spend most of their day foraging (up to 84 %), very little time resting (as little as 1. 8 %) and very little time in aggression (as little as 0. 6 %). These values are each within the outer range of results published on other honeyeaters. Melithreptus gularis behaviour was very similar to both M. brevirostris and M. lunatus. Melithreptus appear to forage predominantly from poor quality resources, requiring a large proportion of their time allocated to foraging. The small proportion of time spent resting is probably a result of the time spent foraging. The small proportion of time spent in aggression is partly the result of a lack of aggression by Melithreptus, but is also potentially due to their knowledge of aggression levels within their home range and their use of stealth and swamping. Melithreptus are likely to avoid the most highly protected (and therefore the most productive) areas within their home ranges. A trend in behavioural data was consistent with the hypothesis that M. brevirostris was more similar to male M. lunatus than to female M. lunatus. Based on the data collected in this study, Melithreptus in the Mt Lofty Ranges are characterised by : relatively large home range size with core areas that are used over extended periods of time; similar foraging behaviour and morphology; lack of aggression; and (probably (complex social behaviour. Their decline in the Mt Lofty Ranges can be attributed to the preferential clearance of their preferred habitat, their requirement for a large home range and their predominant use of poor quality resources, particularly in comparison to other, locally successful honeyeaters. The final aim of this work on Melithreptus honeyeaters in the Mt Lofty Ranges was to provide options for managing remaining Melithreptus populations, in particular M. gularis which according to informed observers is now critically endangered in the region. Due to the extent of habitat clearance in the Mt Lofty Ranges, the decline of Melithreptus will only be addressed in the long term through large scale revegetation projects. Melithreptus requirements in any large scale revegetation are most likely to be met by providing a range of eucalypt species. In the short to medium term, management actions may be needed to prevent the loss of M. gularis from the region. Given the findings of this study, there are few such options available. The management of woody weeds in known Melithreptus home ranges is suggested as one possible management strategy. Melithreptus rarely use a shrub layer for foraging, shelter or nesting, whereas P. novaehollandiae use a shrub layer for each of these activities. Thus, where grassy woodlands have been invaded by woody weeds, P. novaehollandiae potentially have an increased year round presence. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Textbooks of urology and sexology provide only very limited information about erection angle dysfunction. In some men, this angle is too tight toward their belly, causing problems with intercourse. Aim. We reported two cases of an acute erection angle and reviewed pertinent literature. Methods. Comprehensive literature review was performed using PubMed. We performed additional searches based on relevant books. Results. There {{is very limited}} knowledge about erection angles and the "acute erection angle. " Our cases show that simple and safe surgical techniques can yield adequate results. Conclusion. Counseling a couple with complaints of sexual inadequacy, which has resulted specifically from the increased erection angle, {{should be based on}} objective reassuring information about anatomical and physiological facts.

This study aims to describe pre‐ and posttreatment vestibular pain, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and calculated free testosterone levels in women undergoing treatment for vestibulodynia. Methods. This was a chart review of 50 premenopausal women who presented with vestibular pain while currently using CHCs. Pre‐ and posttreatment vestibular pain, SHBG, and calculated free testosterone levels were assessed. Results. There was a statistically significant improvement in posttreatment vestibular pain scores (P[*]=[*] 0. 001), SHBG (P[*]=[*] 0. 001), and calculated free testosterone (P[*]=[*] 0. 001) levels from baseline. Conclusion. Women with vestibulodynia that began while on CHC may effectively be treated by discontinuing the CHC combined with the application topical hormone therapy. Symptomatic improvement is accompanied by normalization of calculated free testosterone and SHBG values. Burrows LJ and Goldstein AT.

40|$|Aim. We {{report on}} the {{corporal}} rotation technique, customized {{for the management of}} ventral curvature in patients without hypospadias. Methods. A male patient with ventral curvature of 90 degrees was operated on. The neurovascular bundle was mobilized for a short distance at the point of maximum curvature. The corpora cavernosa were approximated {{to each other in the}} dorsal midline by suturing pairs of longitudinal parallel incisions. To avoid urethral narrowing, minimal dissection was used to develop the groove on either side of the corpus spongiosum, to release it from its attachment to the rotated corpora cavernosa. Results. Full correction of the curvature was achieved, without shortening, erectile dysfunction, or micturition problems. Conclusion. Corporal rotation can be applied for the correction of ventral penile curvature in patients with and without hypospadias, without sacrificing penile length. Shaeer O.

40|$|Introduction. The {{diagnosis}} {{and the treatment}} of transsexualism, particularly during adolescence, generate considerable discussion among specialists. Many health and legal professionals have not yet reached a strong consensus on medical treatment for juvenile transsexuals. Hormonal therapy cannot only represent a medical procedure to adjust the somatic sex to the psychological gender, but {{can also be a}} reasonable means of preventing some juvenile transsexuals from engaging in undesirable and risky behavior. Aim. To report the cases of two transsexual adolescents who resorted to prostitution to afford hormonal medications when treatment was denied because of age criteria. Results. Hormonal medications were not recommended by the endocrinology staff because specific laws regulating this medical procedure for juvenile transsexuals in Brazil are lacking. In response, these adolescents chose to use illegally obtained sex hormones to treat themselves. Conclusions. We propose ""harm reduction"" as a means of coping with this dilemma in some cases.

40|$|Introduction: Conditions {{mimicking}} penile fracture {{are extremely}} rare {{and have been}} seldom described. Aim: To describe a patient with false penile fracture who presented with superficial dorsal vein injury/thrombosis managed with ligation. Methods: A 33 ‐year‐old male presented with penile swelling and ecchymosis after intercourse. A penile ultrasound demonstrated a thrombosed superficial dorsal vein but also questionable fracture of the tunica albuginea. As the thrombus was expanding, he was emergently taken {{to the operating room}} for exploration and required only dorsal venous ligation. Results: Postoperatively, patient's Sexual Health Inventory for Men score was 23, and he had no issues with erections or sexual intercourse. Conclusion: Early exploration of patients with suspected penile fracture provides excellent results with maintenance of erectile function. Also, in the setting of dorsal vein thrombosis, ligation preserves the integrity of the penile tissues and avoids unnecessary complications from conservative management.
