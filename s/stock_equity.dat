2500|$|In {{response}} {{to calls for}} agrarian reform, President Aquino issued Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order 229 on July 22, 1987, which outlined her land reform program, which included sugar lands. In 1988, {{with the backing of}} Aquino, the new Congress of the Philippines passed Republic Act No. 6657, more popularly known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law". The law {{paved the way for the}} redistribution of agricultural lands to tenant-farmers from landowners, who were paid in exchange by the government through just compensation but were also allowed to retain not more than five hectares of land. However, corporate landowners were also allowed under the law to [...] "voluntarily divest a proportion of their capital <b>stock,</b> <b>equity</b> or participation in favor of their workers or other qualified beneficiaries", in lieu of turning over their land to the government for redistribution. Despite the flaws in the law, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality in 1989, declaring that the implementation of the comprehensive agrarian reform program (CARP) provided by the said law, was [...] "a revolutionary kind of expropriation".|$|E

5000|$|Market capitalization: A stock’s {{weight in}} the index is {{determined}} by the float-adjusted market capitalization of the stock. This is a function of current index shares, the latest available stock price and the Investable weight factor (IWF). The IWF represents the float-adjusted portion of a <b>stock’s</b> <b>equity</b> capital. Therefore, any strategic holdings that are classified as either corporate, private or government holdings reduce the IWF which, in turn, results in a reduction in the float-adjusted market capital. Shares owned by founders, directors of the company, trusts, venture capitalists and other companies are also excluded. These are also deemed strategic holders, and are considered long-term holders of a <b>stock’s</b> <b>equity.</b> Any strategic shareholdings that are greater than 5% of total issued shares are excluded from the relevant float.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} fluctuations in the aggregate value of equities and the adequacy of households’ saving for retirement. We find that many and perhaps most households appear to be saving adequate amounts for retirement, but almost no link between stock values and the adequacy of retirement saving. Historical variation in equity values and ownership correlates poorly with historical variation in the adequacy of saving. Even a simulated 40 percent decline in stocks has {{little effect on the}} adequacy of saving. The results occur because equities are concentrated among households with significant amounts of other wealth. retirement, saving, <b>stocks,</b> <b>equities...</b>|$|R
