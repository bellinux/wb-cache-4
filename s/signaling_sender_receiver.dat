40|$|Quorum sensing (QS) {{is a type}} of cell-cell {{communication}} using signal {{molecules that}} are released and detected by cells, which respond to changes in their population density. A few studies explain that QS may operate in a density-dependent manner; however, due to experimental challenges, this fundamental hypothesis has never been investigated. Here, we present a microfluidic static droplet array (SDA) that combines a droplet generator with hydrodynamic traps to independently generate a bacterial population gradient into a parallel series of droplets under complete chemical and physical isolation. The SDA independently manipulates both a chemical concentration gradient and a bacterial population density. In addition, the bacterial population gradient in the SDA can be tuned by a simple change in the number of sample plug loading. Finally, the method allows the direct analysis of complicated biological events in an addressable droplet to enable the characterization of bacterial communication in response to the ratio of two microbial populations, including two genetically engineered QS circuits, such as the <b>signal</b> <b>sender</b> for acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) production and the signal receiver bacteria for green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression induced by AHL. For the first time, we found that the population ratio of the <b>signal</b> <b>sender</b> and <b>receiver</b> indicates a significant and potentially interesting partnership between microbial communities. Therefore, we envision that this simple SDA could be a useful platform in various research fields, including analytical chemistry, combinatorial chemistry, synthetic biology, microbiology, and molecular biology. close 4...|$|R
40|$|Honey bee queens (Apis mellifera) who {{mate with}} {{multiple}} males produce colonies that {{are filled with}} numerous genetically distinct patrilines of workers. A genetically diverse colony benefits from an enhanced foraging effort, fuelled in part {{by an increase in}} the number of recruitment signals that are produced by foragers. However, the influence of patriline diversity on the attention paid to these signals by audiences of potentially receptive workers remains unexplored. To determine whether recruitment dances performed by foragers in multiple-patriline colonies attract a greater number of dance followers than dances in colonies that lack patriline diversity, we trained workers from multiple- and single-patriline colonies to forage in a greenhouse and monitored their dance-following activity back in the hives. On average, more workers followed a dance if it was performed in a multiple-patriline colony rather than a single-patriline colony (33 % increase), and for a greater number of dance circuits per follower. Furthermore, dance-following workers in multiple-patriline colonies were more likely to exit their hive after following a dance, although this did not translate to a difference in colony-level exit rates between treatment types. Recruiting nest mates to profitable food sources through dance communication is critical to a colony’s foraging success and long-term fitness; polyandrous queens produce colonies that benefit not only from increased recruitment signalling, but also from the generation of larger and more attentive audiences of signal receivers. This study highlights the importance of integrating responses of both <b>signal</b> <b>senders</b> and <b>receivers</b> to understand more fully the success of animal-communication systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} a FUR Systems A 40 M infrared (IR) digital camera for thermal monitoring of a Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Ethanol bi-propellant Reaction Control Engine (RCE) during Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) testing at the National Aeronautics & Space Administration's (NASA) White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) near Las Cruces, New Mexico. Typically, NASA has relied mostly on the use of ThermoCouples (TC) for this type of thermal monitoring due to the variability of constraints required to accurately map rapidly changing temperatures from ambient to glowing hot chamber material. Obtaining accurate real-time temperatures in the JR spectrum is made even more elusive by the changing emissivity of the chamber material as it begins to glow. The parameters evaluated prior to APS testing included: (1) remote operation of the A 40 M camera using fiber optic Firewire <b>signal</b> <b>sender</b> and <b>receiver</b> units; (2) operation of the camera inside a Pelco explosion proof enclosure with a germanium window; (3) remote analog signal display for real-time monitoring; (4) remote digital data acquisition of the A 40 M's sensor information using FUR's ThermaCAM Researcher Pro 2. 8 software; and (5) overall reliability of the system. An initial characterization report was prepared after the A 40 M characterization tests at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to document controlled heat source comparisons to calibrated TCs. Summary IR digital data recorded from WSTF's APS testing is included within this document along with findings, lessons learned, and recommendations for further usage as a monitoring tool for the development of rocket engines...|$|R

The {{delay in}} the shortest weight path may be much larger than delay in the shortest delay path from a <b>sender</b> to a <b>receiver.</b> For delay sensitive applications, we investigate the possibility of adding proxies in networks to make the delay in the overlay path between <b>senders</b> and <b>receivers</b> close to the delay in shortest delay path and to reduce the delays from <b>senders</b> to <b>receivers.</b> By solving the integer linear programming formulations developed on the overlay logical network, we get optimization results: number of optimal proxies, optimal proxy locations and the improvement in reducing delays from <b>senders</b> to <b>receivers.</b> We also apply Dijkstra’s algorithm on the overlay logical network to explore the maximum benefit of placing proxies on reducing delays. From simulation results of 6 ISP networks, we observe that adding proxies significantly reduces the delay from <b>senders</b> to <b>receivers</b> for some networks. Finally, we identified a network metric, Default Delay Minimum Delay Ratio(DDMDR), which will provide guidance on whether adding proxies will significantly reduce the delays from <b>senders</b> to <b>receivers</b> in a network.

Among the control parameters, there are the strong parameters (which strongly effect the values of studied measures) and the weak ones (whose effect is negligible), therewith the eigenvalues of the initial state are given a privileged role.
