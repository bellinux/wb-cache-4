5000|$|A ball turret was a Plexiglas sphere {{set into}} the belly of a B-17 or B-24, and {{inhabited}} by two [...]50 caliber machine guns and one man, a short small man. When this gunner tracked with his machine guns a fighter attacking his bomber from below, he revolved with the turret; hunched upside-down in his little sphere, he looked like the fetus in the womb. The fighters which attacked him were armed with cannon firing explosive shells. The hose was a <b>steam</b> <b>hose.</b>|$|E
50|$|Winter flying was {{conducted}} each February at Camp Skeel at Oscoda, Michigan, although in January 1927 the group instead sent a detachment to Ottawa, Ontario. In January 1929 the group conducted a lengthy {{search and rescue}} operation for a missing person in Petoskey, Michigan; and in January 1930 flew a squadron to Spokane, Washington, and back by way of North Dakota and Montana. Temperatures during the Petoskey rescue reached −30 °F, disabling the aircraft engines. A local cement company extended a <b>steam</b> <b>hose</b> to thaw engine oil and other components, enabling the aircraft to operate.|$|E
50|$|While a {{graduate}} student at the School of Architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, Beaumont documented the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill through a series of black and white photographs called Steam Cleaning The Santa Barbara Shores… Her photographs captured the destruction of the shoreline ecosystem by the power washing oil from the rocks with high-pressure <b>steam</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The polymer was {{developed}} at the University of Bristol {{in an effort to}} curb pollution issues, due to regular chewing gum, which are prevalent in the United Kingdom. Britain spends over £150 million annually (as of 2008) on gum cleanup efforts, using techniques such as high pressure <b>steam</b> <b>hoses,</b> corrosive materials, and freezing machines to help remove this synthetic material from sidewalks and other public spaces [...]|$|R
50|$|For ships, ice {{presents}} {{two distinct}} hazards. Spray and freezing rain can produce an ice build-up on the superstructure of a vessel sufficient {{to make it}} unstable, and to require it to be hacked off or melted with <b>steam</b> <b>hoses.</b> And icebergs - large masses of ice floating in water (typically created when glaciers reach the sea) - can be dangerous if struck by a ship when underway. Icebergs {{have been responsible for}} the sinking of many ships, the most famous being the Titanic.|$|R
5000|$|The prison {{authorities}} {{attempted to}} keep the cells clean by breaking the cell windows and spraying in disinfectant, then temporarily removing the prisoners and sending in rubber-suited prison officers with <b>steam</b> <b>hoses</b> to clean the walls. However, {{as soon as the}} prisoners were returned to their cells they resumed their protest. By mid-1978 there were between 250 and 300 protesting prisoners, and the protest was attracting media attention from around the world. Tomás Ó Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Cardinal Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison on 31 July 1978 and condemned the conditions there: ...|$|R

50|$|On April 24, 1888, the San Pablo {{was in the}} Formosa Strait. There was a thick fog, and {{the ship}} ran aground north of Turnabout Island at about 3:30 in the morning. The ship was hard aground, and two holds and a coal bunker filled with water. The ship might capsize. The ship {{was going to be}} abandoned, and the crew and {{passengers}} were about to head for Turnabout lighthouse, when the ship was set upon by pirates from the mainland. Captain Reed armed the passengers and crew, and the first attack was repulsed. During a second attack, the pirates gained the main deck, but were beaten back with <b>steam</b> <b>hoses.</b> The pirates waited half a mile from the ship.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} stages of illegal immigration, small coastal craft were used to bring in Jewish refugees, but large vessels were soon used. In total, some 60 ships were employed, {{including}} 10 ships acquired as war surplus from US boneyards. Among the crews were Jewish American and Canadian volunteers. In order to prevent Jewish illegal migrants reaching Palestine a naval blockade was established to stop boats carrying illegal migrants, and there was extensive intelligence gathering and diplomatic pressure on countries through which the migrants were passing or from whose ports the ships were coming. When an illegal immigrant ship was spotted, it would be approached by warships, and would often maneuver violently to avoid being boarded. British boarding parties consisting of Royal Marines and Paratroopers would then be sent {{to take control of the}} ship. On 27 ships, they were met with some level of resistance, including 13 cases of violent resistance, during which boarding parties were opposed by passengers armed with weapons such as clubs, iron bars, axes, firebombs, scalding <b>steam</b> <b>hoses,</b> and pistols. Royal Navy ships would ram transports, and boarding parties forced their way onto the ships and engaged in close-quarters hand-to-hand fighting to gain control. In five instances, firearms were used. During these encounters, two Royal Navy warships were damaged in collisions with immigrant ships. Seven British soldiers were killed during battles to take control of immigrant ships - most of whom drowned after being pushed overboard by passengers. Six passengers were also killed. From 1945 to 1948, some 80,000 illegal immigrants attempted to enter Palestine. About 49 illegal immigrant ships were captured and 66,000 people were detained. Some 1,600 others drowned at sea.|$|R
5000|$|According to the September 9, 1883 {{edition of}} the Detroit Free Press William Scott & Company was the {{architect}} of the building. Detroit's Engine Company No. 11 was organized as the [...] "Steam Fire Engine Company #11" [...] on January 1, 1884. The original equipment included a horse-drawn Silsby <b>Steam</b> engine and <b>hose</b> reel cart. The company converted to motorized operation in 1916, obtaining a Seagrave gasoline propelled pumping engine.|$|R
50|$|In the evening, a Grand Inauguration Ball {{would be}} held at the Academy of Music. The second day would be devoted to a parade and amusements. Visiting <b>steam</b> fire engines, <b>hose</b> and other {{companies}} would compete in tests, and a trial of the city water works would be given. As a special feature, arrangements were made for a half-mile race between Hose Co. No. 7 of Ithaca and Niagara Hose Co. No. 3 of Auburn.|$|R
50|$|During {{their journey}} down the river, Charlie, Rose and the African Queen {{encounter}} many obstacles, including the German fort and {{three sets of}} rapids. The first set of rapids is rather easy; they get through with minimal flooding in the boat. But when they pass the fortress and the soldiers begin shooting at them, the bullets pierce {{the top of the}} boiler and cause one of the <b>steam</b> pressure <b>hoses</b> to disconnect from the boiler. This causes the boat's engine to stop. Luckily, Charlie manages to reattach the hose to the boiler just as they are about to enter the second set of rapids. The boat rolls and pitches crazily as it goes down the rapids, leading to more severe flooding in the boat. However, they make it through.|$|R
25|$|On 28 January 1915 USRC Unalga became USCGC Unalga {{by virtue}} of the {{establishment}} of the United States Coast Guard by merger of the United States Revenue Cutter Service with the United States Life-Saving Service. In February 1915 additional duties were assigned enforcing the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911 which related to prohibited pelagic sealing in the Bering Sea. Patrol work during 1915 and 1916 consisted of summers in Alaskan waters with sealing treaty duties, law enforcement, search and rescue, medical assistance to fishermen and others, and the delivery of mail to remote camps. Winters were spent at various locations along the Pacific Northwest coast doing law enforcement patrol work. In January 1917, Unalga was assigned her first winter patrol in Alaskan waters at the urging of representatives of the fishing industry to provide medical services to crews of fishing vessels as well as search and rescue work in remote waters. She stopped in Sitka, Alaska to investigate reports of a measles epidemic and to take on more coal for her first winter mission into the Gulf of Alaska. Unalgas first winter patrol was begun 30 January during a squall with hurricane force winds that iced the cutter over and threaten to sink her with the additional weight. After the starboard whaleboat was smashed by heavy seas and the radio masts snapped from the weight of ice, Captain Frederick Dodge made for the shelter of Yakutat Bay. The cutter was listing starboard at twenty degrees and the crew had to clear ice from the decks and machinery with axes and <b>steam</b> <b>hoses.</b> The crew of Unalga spent the next week repairing damage to the cutter while the surgeon treated the ills of inhabitants of Yakutat and gave the resident missionary a short course in medicine. Each time the cutter would leave the shelter of the bay another gale would appear, but Dodge took care to seek shelter before the cutter was as severely iced as the first time. Unalga was recalled to Seattle on 6 March after steaming 3000 miles, boarding 342 vessels, having given medical aid to 19 individuals of whom three were fishermen.|$|R
5000|$|Contrary to the EN Standard, the UL Standards 10B and 10C {{requires}} a Hose Stream Test, which measures integrity of specimens after exposure to fire. This includes that immediately within 3 minutes (according to UL 10B, the UL 10C stipulate 1-1/2 minutes) after {{the termination of}} the fire resistance test, the tested door is to start {{to be subjected to}} the impact, erosion, and cooling effects of a hose stream directed ?rst at the bottom center of the assembly and then at all parts of the exposed surface (according a <b>Hose</b> <b>steam</b> pattern which is specified in the UL standards UL 10B and UL 10C). This can cause penetration of the assembly, breakage and dislodgement of hardware or glazing. (See: UL 10C par. 12.1 and par. 10.1) ...|$|R
50|$|Danzig tells Hanson of Connerlys lung problems, and Hanson {{decides that}} he will dive on the Arianna instead of Connerly. While Connerly and Hanson argue over this, Rigbys diving bell becomes snagged on coral. The pearl divers, Hanson, and Connerly all dive into the water to free Rigby, and while they and the Batavia Queens other {{passengers}} and crew are thus occupied, Danzig steals a pistol he finds in the ships chart room, knocks the jailer unconscious, and frees the prisoners. They take over the ship, throw the unconscious jailer overboard to drown, and imprison the passengers and crew in the hold, where they also place Rigby and the pearl divers when they return to the Batavia Queen. Before returning, and unaware of the turn of events aboard the Batavia Queen, Hanson and Connerly swim to {{the wreck of the}} Arianna, find the ships safe, and attach a cable to it to have it hoisted aboard the Batavia Queen. Upon their return, Danzig has Connerly lowered into the hold but forces Hanson to look on at gunpoint as he opens the Ariannas safe on the Batavia Queens deck. They find nothing in the safe but a cheap pocket watch. When an explosion on Krakatoa distracts Danzig, Hanson overpowers him, takes the pistol from him, pushes the heavy safe over onto one convict, shoots two others, and uses <b>steam</b> from a <b>hose</b> to force the rest of the prisoners to jump overboard. They swim to nearby Krakatoa, never to be seen again.|$|R
