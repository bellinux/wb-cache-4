40|$|Precision {{injection}} molding {{technology can be}} applied for the computer, communication, electric appliance arid medical components industries. This paper presents a new design of a tiebarless clamping system for micro-{{injection molding}} machine. The tiebarless clamping system can provide lots of convenience, such as more mold space for automation etc., for a micro-injection molding machine. Good parallel precision between <b>stationary</b> <b>platen</b> and movable platen of a clamping system is an important feature for high precision injection molding. With special mechanism of this tiebarless clamping system, the movable platen will deform with the <b>stationary</b> <b>platen</b> synchronously under high clamping force to maintain the parallelism. Via tests and verifications, the parallel precision is controlled at good condition under 6 tons of clamping force...|$|E
40|$|Plastic are {{certainly}} most versatile of all known materials today and have therefore, established themselves in enviable position from where {{are not even}} possible to replaced. Injection molding machine {{is one of the}} most widely used method of conversion of plastic into various end products application to wide range of plastic materials from plastic commodity to specialty engineering plastic. In injection molding machine <b>stationary</b> <b>platen</b> play a very important role. During the process generally compressive stress generates at particular regions. As load varies with fast rate there is chance to failure of tie bar rod. Due to heavy mould shape, size of platen also change, thatâ€™s increase its weight as well as stress level at certain region and this is not good in practice. This leads to failure of platen or failure of tie rod due to stretching by nut and platen. This create loss of money (Production stop), man (injured due to accident), and material (increase inventory cost). The aim of this project is study about those areas where stress can affect the failure of tie bar due to heavy weight of <b>stationary</b> <b>platen</b> the deflection or misalignment with movable platen. Finally redistribution of stress sothat uniforme stress achive (optimization of platen). This project is including Finite Element Analysis and Design Optimization of a Typical Structural Component of a Plastic Injection Molding Machine. The aim of project is to optimize a typical structural component (<b>stationary</b> <b>platen)</b> by using finite element analysis after checking induced stresses with allowable design stress. Hence design modification of platen is carried out to achieve good strength and cost effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Oxide vapor {{distributions}} {{have been}} determined {{as a function}} of operating parameters of a high frequency sweep e-beam source combined with a programmable sweep controller. We will show which parameters are significant, the parameters that yield the broadest oxide deposition distribution, and the procedure used to arrive at these conclusions. A design-of-experimental strategy was used with five operating parameters: evaporation rate, sweep speed, sweep pattern (pre-programmed), phase speed (azimuthal rotation of the pattern), profile (dwell time {{as a function of}} radial position). A design was chosen that would show which of the parameters and parameter pairs have a statistically significant effect on the vapor distribution. Witness flats were placed symmetrically across a 25 inches diameter platen. The <b>stationary</b> <b>platen</b> was centered 24 inches above the e-gun crucible. An oxide material was evaporated under 27 different conditions. Thickness measurements were made with a stylus profilometer. The information will enable users of the high frequency e-gun systems to optimally locate the source in a vacuum system and understand which parameters have a major effect on the vapor distribution...|$|E
5000|$|The first commercially {{available}} Thermofax machine was the Model 12. The 'layup' {{of the original}} and the copy paper was placed on a <b>stationary</b> glass <b>platen</b> and an infrared {{lamp and reflector assembly}} moved beneath the glass, radiating upwards. The layup was held in position by a lid with an inflatable rubber bladder that was latched down by the user.|$|R
500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die {{contains}} the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to the mold cavity. The cover die is secured to the <b>stationary,</b> or front, <b>platen</b> of the casting machine, while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} movable platen. The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|R
