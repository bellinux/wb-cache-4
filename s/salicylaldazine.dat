40|$|The <b>salicylaldazine</b> (ligand) and its metal (II) {{complexes}} like copper (II), nickel (II), zinc (II), cobalt (II) and manganese (II) complexes {{has been}} synthesized and characterized by different techniques using FTIR, UV-VIS spectroscopy. The ligand (<b>salicylaldazine)</b> is synthesized by the condensation reaction of salicylaldehyde and hydrazine sulfate. The <b>salicylaldazine</b> metal (II) complexes like Cu (II), Ni(II), Zn (II), Co(II), Mn(II) were prepared by using metal (II) chloride in dioxane. The ratio of <b>salicylaldazine</b> and metal (II) chloride was 2 : 1 mole ration respectively. The resultant complexes having general formulae M+ 2 [L] 2 X 2. xH 2 O. The resultant compound {{was characterized by}} UV-VIS analysis and FTIR analysis. Their suggested formulae showed that Cu (II), Ni(II), Co(II), Mn(II) <b>salicylaldazine</b> complexes acted as tridentate ligands and have octahedral geometry while Zn(II) <b>salicylaldazine</b> complex acted as bidentate ligand and has tetrahedral geometry. All of them acted as coordination ligands via nitrogen atom of phenolic hydroxyl group. Their molar conductivities showed {{that all of them}} are insulators at room temperature while at high temperature they can act as semiconductors...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of NMR spectroscopy and theoretical methods Density functional theory including dispersion corrections (DFT-D) {{was used to}} study the structures of Lumogen and <b>salicylaldazine.</b> In the solid state, Lumogen exists as the dihydroxy tautomer 1 a (an azine, C¼N–N¼C) as was already known from an X-ray determination. In a deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide solution, another tautomer is observed besides 1 a; its structure corresponds to the hydroxy-oxo tautomer 1 b (a hydrazone, C¼N–NH–Csp 2). In what concerns <b>salicylaldazine,</b> we have observed only the dihydroxy tautomer 2 a.

40|$|Complexes {{containing}} mixed ligands of zirconium (IV) {{have been}} synthesized by {{the reaction of}} zirconium (IV) nitrate (Zr(NO 3) 4, 5 H 2 O) with <b>salicylaldazine</b> (SAH 2) and semicarbazone ligands benzaldehyde semicarbazone (BSCH), 4 -methoxybenzaldehyde semicarbzone (MBSCH), 2 -chlorobenzaldehyde semicrbazone (CISCH) and cinnamaldehyde semicarbazone (CinSCH) forming complexes of the type [Zr 2 (SAH) 2 (SCH) 2](NO 3) 8 and [Zr 2 (SA) 2 (SC) 2](NO 3) 2 in neutral and basic medium respectively. The ligands and their complexes are characterized physico-chemically...|$|E
