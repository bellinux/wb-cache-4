5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E
25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} it would be fair to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should be in New York, she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and in some way to earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also to find time and opportunity for that other work to which <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> make everything subordinate.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson {{murder trial}} {{is based on}} a real-life trial {{featured}} in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. In that real-life trial, a Baltimore detective misspeaks during his testimony and nearly jeopardizes the outcome of the case. This is mirrored by the actions of Kay Howard, who accidentally says the victim was dead at least 24 hours when <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> say 12 hours, leaving an opening for defense attorney Darin Russom to question her recollection and expertise. The defense attorney in the real-life trial lost the case for himself with a procedural misstep similar to the one portrayed in [...] "And the Rockets Dead Glare". In the episode, Russom asks Howard whether she had ever seen a murder victim killed by both a knife and a gun. This allows Howard to mention a second victim police suspect [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson murdered, which she would not have been allowed to mention had Russom not asked her. Homicide filmmakers sought to portray the trial scenes in a far more realistic light than most police drama shows, particularly with the inclusion of less dramatic courtroom elements such as Howard's waiting anxiously to testify and the awkward pauses during her testimony.|$|E

2500|$|After news {{organizations}} and blogs {{picked up the}} quotation, Palin issued a statement on her Facebook page in which she clarified that <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> say that voters {{have the right to}} ask questions, and she herself has never asked Obama to produce a birth certificate. She then went on to compare questioning of Obama's birth certificate to questions that were raised during the 2008 presidential elections about her maternity to her son, Trig. This analogy was criticized by Mark Milian of the Los Angeles Times, who commented that [...] "It's not like Barack Obama hosted a radio show and called her a baby faker." [...] In addition, Andrew Sullivan, an established skeptic of Palin's relationship with Trig, wrote in response to her comments: [...] "Palin has never produced Trig's birth certificate or a single piece of objective medical evidence that proves he is indeed her biological son." ...|$|E
2500|$|Katie Holmes portrays Kennedy in the 2011 miniseries The Kennedys, set {{during the}} Kennedy {{presidency}} and its 2017 sequel , focusing {{on her life}} after 1968. Mary McNamara and Hank Stuever regarded Holmes' performance with neutrality in their reviews of The Kennedys while Hadley Freeman called her [...] "bloodless" [...] in the role. Holmes stated reprising the role was a [...] "bigger challenge" [...] for having to act through later periods of Kennedy's life. When asked of the concurrent Jackie film, Holmes said, [...] "I think its really exciting. It's just {{is a testament to}} how amazing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was and how much <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> our country." [...] Holmes also stated both should be watched due to covering different periods of Jacqueline's life. [...] In The Kennedys: After Camelot, Holmes' performance was viewed favorably by Daniel Feinberg and Allison Keane while Kristi Turnquist panned her.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{international}} {{success has}} also received much attention. During {{an interview with}} Kyary, she was asked if <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> make music outside of Asia, where she responded; [...] "At first, I didn't think about global markets at all. But even in Japanese, my lyrics don’t make any sense and {{have a kind of}} mystery, like on Pon Pon Pon and Tsukema Tsukeru. I can feel that what I'm doing in Japanese is catchy to global audiences anyway." [...] Keiichi Ishizaka, {{chairman and chief executive officer}} of Warner Music Japan Inc, commenting on Kyary's image to The Japan Times, says [...] " [...] is a person who came directly out of Tokyo's Harajuku culture, and there is a growing international interest in Japan's kawaii culture," [...] Many critics and publications noted the increase of popularity within the Japanese popular culture outside Japan, such as its fashion and animation, and Kyary Pamyu Pamyu is serving as its global ambassador. Ishizaka believed that with the advent of the Internet, there is no difference in time and distance among countries anymore." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beset by depression, {{and with}} a history of suicide attempts, Plath took her own life on 11 February 1963, {{although}} it is unclear whether <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> ultimately succeed. Hughes was devastated. In a letter to an old friend of Plath's from Smith College, he wrote, [...] "That's the end of my life. The rest is posthumous." [...] Some people argued that Hughes had driven Plath to suicide. Plath's gravestone was repeatedly vandalized by those aggrieved that [...] "Hughes" [...] is written on the stone and attempted to chisel it off, leaving only the name [...] "Sylvia Plath." [...] Plath's poem [...] "The Jailor", in which the speaker condemns her husband's brutality, was included in the 1970 anthology [...] Radical feminist poet Robin Morgan published the poem [...] "Arraignment", in which she openly accused Hughes of the battery and murder of Plath. There were lawsuits, Morgan's 1972 book Monster which contained that poem was banned, and underground, pirated feminist editions of it were published. Other feminists threatened to kill Hughes in Plath's name. In 1989, with Hughes under public attack, a battle raged in the letters pages of The Guardian and The Independent. In The Guardian on 20 April 1989 Hughes wrote the article [...] "The Place Where Sylvia Plath Should Rest in Peace": ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Tohru's {{feelings}} for Kyo develop and she eventually admits {{he is the}} Sohma she wants the most to free, because she loves him. This, however, only distresses her further, as she feels she is being unfaithful to her mother's memory. However, when Tohru finally confesses to Kyo, he tells her he knew her mother {{when he was a}} child, and that he could have saved Kyoko from the car that killed her except it would have revealed his curse and Kyoko's final word [...] "I won't forgive you!" [...] (Later it is understood that <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> say [...] "I won't forgive you if you don't take care of Tohru!") But Tohru doesn't believe her mother would say that but if she did she would have to go against it because she loves him. Unable in his guilt to accept Tohru's feelings, he says her love is an illusion and runs away. As she follows him, she meets Akito, who believes that Tohru's kindness to and acceptance of the cursed zodiac members has made them unfaithful to her, weakening their [...] "bond" [...] to the point that Momiji and Hiro have been freed from the curse. As she angrily confronts her, however, Tohru realizes that she is trapped by the past as much as she herself has been, by clinging to her mother's memory, and she extends her hand in friendship to Akito and introduces herself as a new start. However, before Akito can accept, Tohru falls down a nearby cliff when the ground collapses in the rain. The accident makes Kyo realize how much he values Tohru, and also allows Akito to finally break away from the roles she has held for most of her life.|$|E
