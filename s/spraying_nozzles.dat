In practice, the probability distribution of the flow rate of new nozzles should be normal. The dispersion of the new nozzle flow rates was slightly higher than the theoretical one.

In order to accelerate the process, an erosive suspension is used in the test rig, but this suspension looses its characteristics during the utilisation time. This is the reason why a system measuring continuously the erosive power has been set up. This system is validated by different discontinuous measurement and the correlation observed have a coefficient of about 0, 99. From the signal detected by the new device, two calculations have been carried out. A first one determining continuously the total wear quantity of the nozzles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{reduction}} of pesticide spraying drift {{is still one}} of the major challenges in Brazilian agriculture. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of different adjuvant products, such as surfactants, drift retardants, mineral oil and vegetable oil for reducing drift in agricultural spraying. The experiment consisted of quantifying drift of sprayings of 18 adjuvants dissolved in water under controlled conditions in a wind tunnel. Tests were performed in triplicates with <b>spraying</b> <b>nozzles</b> type Teejet XR 8003 VK, pressure of 200 kPa and medium drops. Solutions sprayed were marked with Brilliant Blue dye at 0. 6 % (m v- 1). The drift was collected using polyethylene strips transversally fixed along the tunnel at different distances from the nozzle and different heights from the bottom part of the tunnel. Drift deposits were evaluated by spectrophotometry in order to quantify deposits. The adjuvants from chemical groups of mineral oil and drift retardant resulted in lower values of drift in comparison with surfactants and water. The results obtained in laboratory show that the selection of appropriate class and concentration of adjuvants can significantly decrease the risk of drift in agricultural spraying. However, the best results obtained in laboratory should be validated with pesticide under field conditions in the future...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{demonstrates the}} basic elements of a prototype automated orchard sprayer which delivers pesticide spray selectively with respect to the characteristics of the targets. The density of an apple tree canopy was detected by PROWAVE 400 EP 250 ultrasound sensors controlled by a Cypress PSOC CY 8 C 29466 microcontroller. The ultrasound signal was processed with an embedded computer built around a LPC 1343 microcontroller and fed in real time to electro-magnetic valves which open/close <b>spraying</b> <b>nozzles</b> in relation to the canopy structure. The analysis focuses on the detection of appropriate thresholds on 15 cm ultrasound bands, which correspond to maximal response to tree density, and this was selected for accurate spraying guidance. Evaluation of the system was performed in an apple orchard by detecting deposits of tartrazine dye (TD) on apple leaves. The employment of programmable microcontrollers and electro-magnetic valves decreased the amount of spray delivered by up to 48. 15 %. In contrast, the reduction of TD was only up to 37. 7 % at some positions within the tree crown and 65. 1 % in the gaps between trees. For all these reasons, this concept of precise orchard spraying can contribute to a reduction of costs and environmental pollution, while obtaining similar or even better leaf deposits...|$|E
