40|$|Many professionals, {{especially}} organizational ones (managers, controllers, <b>strategists),</b> face {{difficulties in}} organizing their professional fields. Work ambiguities and dependencies on outsiders {{make it difficult}} to set homogeneous standards and shelter occupational domains. Professionalism tends to be fragmented. It is questionable, however, whether professionalization is a matter of either enforced regulation or fragmented regulatory forms. More connective forms of professional control might enable groups to establish professional domains, despite ambiguities and dependencies. In order to understand professionalization dynamics in public domains and the relevance of connective professionalism, we study the development of one particular field, <b>strategists</b> in government. We show that the professionalization of Dutch <b>strategists</b> is fragmented: <b>strategists</b> are a varied and mobile group; they have different ideas about work; they depend on many other actors and factors. We also show that <b>strategists</b> opt for either more enforced forms of professionalism, or less professional control. Finally, we show how they might establish connective professionalism. By enacting embedded work spaces, <b>strategists</b> can reconfigure their work. This is also relevant for other (organizational) professionals...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} {{strategic}} management (SM) has presumed {{that the relationship}} between the state and market is unproblematic and that {{the role of the state}} should be seen solely within the context of regulation. Hence, the authority of CEOs within multinational corporations depends on the construction of its legitimate and sole validity and also on the delegitimation of other types of strategists—namely, government <b>strategists.</b> This paper emphasizes the territorial international dimension of authority and legitimacy to argue that the SM literature delegitimates the authority of government <b>strategists.</b> The paper suggests that SM in Brazil can be reorientated to help restore the legitimate authority of government <b>strategists</b> and challenge the sole privileging of <b>strategists</b> within big corporations...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2016. Major: Psychology. Advisor: Jeffry Simpson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 147 pages. From a life history perspective, individuals from higher-SES backgrounds should adopt a slower life history strategy, whereas individuals from lower-SES backgrounds should adopt a faster life history strategy. However, {{some researchers have}} found that lower-SES individuals behave more prosocially than higher-SES individuals. This finding is somewhat problematic for the popular view that faster life history <b>strategists</b> ought to behave more opportunistically than slower life history <b>strategists.</b> The goal of the current line of research was to resolve this paradox by identifying a moderator¬ (the cohesiveness of one’s social network) that might help to explain the prosocial interpersonal orientations observed among lower-SES individuals. Three studies were designed to test the notion that there are two ways faster life history <b>strategists</b> might interact with members of their social networks: (1) a dependent strategy among faster life history <b>strategists</b> who live in residentially stable environments that provide immediate, on-demand resources from members of narrower and deeper social networks, and (2) an opportunistic strategy among faster life history <b>strategists</b> who live in residentially unstable environments that allow them to maximize the resources they can extract from their environments in the absence of narrower and deeper social ties. Although the current studies provided very limited support for the hypothesis that faster life history <b>strategists</b> (lower-SES individuals) who possess more social network/residential stability would behave more prosocially than slower life history <b>strategists</b> (higher-SES individuals) or faster life history <b>strategists</b> who lack social network/residential stability, some of the current findings suggest that this hypothesis should not be abandoned out of hand...|$|R

40|$|Contrary {{to common}} misconceptions, firms tend {{generally}} to remain constant in their strategic approach to markets and rarely deviate from their prevailing strategic archetype. Consequently, {{the effectiveness of}} a firm's product–market strategy is as important as its persistence in achieving overall strategic performance. Adopting a resource-advantage perspective, we examine the extent to which resource bundles differ among firms within a product–market strategy performance typology. Analyzing data generated from high-technology industrial manufacturers, we find that successful <b>strategists</b> are endowed with significantly greater levels of resources–that include ‘strategy championing’, ‘strategy commitment’, ‘implementation support’, ‘implementation effectiveness’, ‘learning’, and ‘memory’–in contrast with unsuccessful <b>strategists,</b> hopeful <b>strategists,</b> and fortunate <b>strategists.</b> Further, important inter-group differences are identified and discussed, along with the implications of this study for researchers and marketing managers...|$|R

In 208 AD, Liu Bei finds talent in a <b>strategist</b> known as Zhuge Liang, who agreed to follow him after Liu Bei visited him three times. Zhuge Liang proves his worth by defeating Cao Cao's army in a series of ambushes at the Battle of Bo Wan Po and Liu Bei successfully manages to flee to Sun Jian in Wu after the Battle of Changban, where Zhao Yun saved his son.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that political-administrative {{organizations}} are becoming increasingly complex with more horizontal governance required. In Swedish municipal administration, there {{is a group of}} administrators assigned the task of monitoring and promoting strategic topics that should be integrated horizontally within the organization. Examples of strategic topics are sustainability, safety/security, diversity, children/youth, public health, human rights, and gender equality. In the thesis, these administrators are called cross-sector <b>strategists.</b> The purpose of this dissertation is to explore how cross-sector <b>strategists</b> {{become a part of the}} political-administrative organization when representing, enacting, and reflecting on values in the undertaking of their formal posts. They are situated between the tradition of vertical governance, with formal procedures and hierarchy as its foundation, and the tradition of horizontal governance, with informal networks and deliberation as its foundation. Previous research has shown that this is likely to give rise to value conflicts, and the question is if cross-sector <b>strategists</b> experience value conflicts, and if so, how they cope with them. The cross-sector <b>strategists</b> are studied in this thesis from the perspective of situated agency – focusing on both the contextual expectations of the cross-sector <b>strategists</b> and on their internal reflections to solve value conflicts – in order to explore their process of becoming a part of the local government administration. A mixed-methods design is applied, containing analysis of job advertisements for cross-sector <b>strategists,</b> public managers, and social workers; in-depth interviews with cross-sector strategists; and a survey of professional networks for cross-sector <b>strategists.</b> The results show that cross-sector <b>strategists</b> are subjects to ambivalent and often-contradictory contextual expectations. Cross-sector <b>strategists</b> use the ambivalence of their work for their strategic purposes, and such ambivalence allows them to reframe their topics, their methods, their arguments, and their identity according to current situation in order to increase the impact of their assigned topics and diminish the inner conflict of wanting to be both a responsive bureaucrat and an active lobbyist. Combining these two dedications requires them to be highly reflexive and flexible actors. The outcome of cross-sector strategists’ coping with value conflicts can be interpreted in two ways: 1) as if the cross-sector <b>strategists</b> are a formal tool to safeguard crucial democratic and ethical values due to the cross-sector strategists’ method of sneaking the strategic policy areas into the organization. Or 2) as a to democracy risky administrative behavior in the long-term due to the disguising of value conflicts and diminished possibilities to process these value conflicts...|$|R
