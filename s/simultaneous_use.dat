5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>use</b> of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the White Paper, the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ('Project Heathrow' for short) was set up to examine how expansion at Heathrow could best be accomplished within the constraints of the stringent environmental limits the White Paper required. A provisional assessment indicates that increased usage of the existing runways could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if 'mixed mode' operations (the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>use</b> of both runways for arrivals and departures) are phased in gradually as noisier aircraft are retired. Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow environmental assessment indicate that increased noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway. These issues are to be addressed as part of a three-month consultation beginning in December 2007, and considerable opposition is being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security warned National Football League {{officials}} in Miami, New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, and Cleveland {{about a possible}} threat involving the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>use</b> of dirty bombs at stadiums. The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22, {{the final day of}} the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats, but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness. The threats came to light in the national media after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.|$|E

25|$|Although most of {{them are}} brief, the {{subjects}} are extremely varied (see Example 1). Frequently some form of note repetition is used to emphasize a rhythmic (rather than melodic) contour. Many feature a dramatic leap (up to an octave), {{which may or may not}} be mirrored in one of the voices sometime during an episode– a characteristic Pachelbel technique, although it was also employed by earlier composers, albeit less pronounced. Minor alterations to the subject between the entries are observed in some of the fugues, and simple countersubjects occur several times. An interesting technique employed in many of the pieces is an occasional resort to style brisé for a few bars, both during episodes and in codas. The double fugues exhibit a typical three-section structure: fugue on subject 1, fugue on subject 2, and the counterpoint with <b>simultaneous</b> <b>use</b> of both subjects.|$|E
25|$|Interval {{and quality}} of {{exercise}} also affect hormonal response. Sessions of moderate to high intensity with multiple sets and short time intervals, during which energy is derived from glycolytic lactate metabolism, {{appear to be the}} greatest stimulus for steroid hormone response. Hormonal response in young men varies with the number of sets in the exercise session. However, when the number increased from 4 to 6, anabolic levels stabilized and cortisol continued to rise, suggesting that alterations in anaerobic volume could alter anabolic and catabolic hormonal balance. When sets are performed at maximum repetitions, interval has no influence at a certain intensity range, with no acute hormone response difference between protocols at 10 maximum reps with 2- and 5-minute intervals. There is a higher total testosterone response in hypertrophy protocols compared to those for strength and power, despite equalization of total work load (defined as load x sets x repetitions). There is a 27% greater testosterone response using protocols with <b>simultaneous</b> <b>use</b> of all four limbs. Androgenic response was also noted in protocols using upper and lower limbs separately to a lesser degree.|$|E

30|$|The {{weight loss}} of the {{modified}} samples {{is related to the}} removal of moisture, the decomposition of the deposited metal nitrates and the partial release of volatile substances {{as a result of the}} oxidation onset by the decomposition of nitrates.

Thus, the effect of mutual activity enhancement (synergism) with <b>simultaneous</b> <b>using</b> of cerium and copper nitrates in this case was not observed (the effect appears to be additive). Higher reactivity of copper nitrate can be explained by lower temperature of Cu(NO 3) 2 decomposition compared with cerium nitrate (Table  1).|$|R
