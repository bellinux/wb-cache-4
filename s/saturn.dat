5|$|<b>Saturn</b> (9.5AU), {{distinguished}} by its extensive ring system, has several similarities to Jupiter, {{such as its}} atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although <b>Saturn</b> has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it {{is less than a}} third as massive, at 95 Earth masses. <b>Saturn</b> is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of <b>Saturn</b> are made up of small ice and rock particles. <b>Saturn</b> has 62 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity. Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|<b>Saturn</b> is {{the sixth}} planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant {{with an average}} radius about nine times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but with its larger volume <b>Saturn</b> is over 95 times more massive. <b>Saturn</b> is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) {{represents}} the god's sickle.|$|E
5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{used more}} than one launch vehicle for space missions, NASA used spacecraft-launch vehicle {{combination}} series numbers: AS-10x for <b>Saturn</b> I, AS-20x for <b>Saturn</b> IB, and AS-50x for <b>Saturn</b> V (compare Mercury-Redstone 3, Mercury-Atlas 6) to designate and plan all missions, rather than numbering them sequentially as in Project Gemini. This was changed by the time manned flights began.|$|E
40|$|Black <b>Saturns</b> have {{multiple}} horizons and so offer a testing {{ground for the}} ideas of black hole thermodynamics. In this note, we numerically scan for phases that are in equilibrium by extremizing total entropy in the 2 -dimensional moduli space of stationary, singly rotating black <b>Saturns</b> with fixed total mass and angular momentum. On top of the known T H = T R, Ω H = Ω R configurations, we find phases that do not balance the temperature and angular velocity of the ring and the hole. But these (and most of the balanced <b>Saturns)</b> go away when we demand {{that the system is}} metastable, by imposing that the Hessian of the entropy is negative definite. Metastablity occurs when the dimensionless total angular momentum lies in a narrow window 0. 92457 <j< 0. 92463 of the thin ring branch. This is consistent with the expected range of classical stability of black <b>Saturns</b> and therefore may imply that thermal stability is tied to classical stability, in analogy with Gubser-Mitra in the translationally-invariant case. We also comment on the possibility of constructing plasma configurations that are dual to black <b>Saturns</b> in AdS. © 2008 SISSA. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|The album's working {{title was}} {{originally}} announced as Magic's in the Makeup in May 1998 {{and later as}} <b>Saturn</b> Returns in November 1999. Stefani was confused by her feelings of depression and interest in Sylvia Plath while recording the album. Her boyfriend Gavin Rossdale {{told her that she}} was going through her <b>Saturn</b> return. Saturn's orbit takes 29.4 Earth years and, in astrology, the time when <b>Saturn</b> returns to its position during a person's birth is believed to be a period of self-evaluation. Stefani was born October 3, 1969, and many of the songs were written during her <b>Saturn</b> return.|$|E
5|$|The average {{distance}} between <b>Saturn</b> and the Sun is over 1.4 billion kilometers (9AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68km/s, it takes <b>Saturn</b> 10,759 Earth days (or about years), to finish one revolution around the Sun. The elliptical orbit of <b>Saturn</b> is inclined 2.48° {{relative to the}} orbital plane of the Earth. The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957AU, on average. The visible features on <b>Saturn</b> rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in Jupiter's case).|$|E

50|$|There {{were also}} {{a limited number of}} <b>Saturns</b> that were {{exported}} to Japan as right hand drive vehicles circa between 1997 and 2000. Aside from having the steering wheel on the other side, Japanese market <b>Saturns</b> were also fitted with slightly different light units. The rear lamps had amber turn signals and the front indicators were mounted closer to the corners rather than inboard.|$|R

5|$|Titan is {{the sixth}} {{ellipsoidal}} moon from <b>Saturn.</b> Frequently {{described as a}} planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger than Earth's Moon, and it is 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System, after Jupiter's moon Ganymede, and {{is larger than the}} smallest planet, Mercury, but only 40% as massive. Discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of <b>Saturn,</b> and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's Moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits <b>Saturn</b> at 20 <b>Saturn</b> radii. From Titan's surface, <b>Saturn</b> subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees and would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky than the Moon from Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-quality}} port of the Namco arcade game Ridge Racer {{contributed to}} the PlayStation's early success, and garnered favorable comparisons in the media to the <b>Saturn</b> version of Sega's Daytona USA, which was considered inferior to its arcade counterpart. Namco, a longtime arcade competitor with Sega, also unveiled the Namco System 11 arcade board, based on raw PlayStation hardware. Although the System 11 was technically inferior to Sega's Model 2 arcade board, its lower price made it attractive to smaller arcades. Following a 1994 acquisition of Sega developers, Namco released Tekken for the System 11 and PlayStation. Directed by former Virtua Fighter designer Seiichi Ishii, Tekken {{was intended to be}} a fundamentally similar title, with the addition of detailed textures and twice the frame rate. Tekken surpassed Virtua Fighter in popularity due to its superior graphics and nearly arcade-perfect console port, becoming the first million-selling PlayStation title. On October 2, 1995 Sega announced a <b>Saturn</b> price reduction to $299. Moreover, high-quality <b>Saturn</b> ports of the Sega Model 2 arcade hits Sega Rally Championship, Virtua Cop, and Virtua Fighter 2 (running at 60 frames per second at a high resolution) were available {{by the end of the}} year, and were generally regarded as superior to competitors on the PlayStation. Notwithstanding a subsequent increase in <b>Saturn</b> sales during the 1995 holiday season, these games were not enough to reverse the PlayStation's decisive lead. By 1996, the PlayStation had a considerably larger library than the <b>Saturn,</b> although Sega hoped to generate increased interest in the <b>Saturn</b> with upcoming exclusives such as Nights into Dreams. An informal survey of retailers showed that the <b>Saturn</b> and PlayStation sold in roughly equal numbers during the first quarter of 1996. Within its first year, the PlayStation secured over 20% of the entire U.S. video game market. On the first day of the May 1996 E3 show, Sony announced a PlayStation price reduction to $199, a reaction to the release of the Model 2 <b>Saturn</b> in Japan at a price roughly equivalent to $199. On the second day, Sega announced it would match this price, though <b>Saturn</b> hardware was more expensive to manufacture.|$|E

5|$|A precise {{value for}} the {{rotation}} period of the interior remains elusive. While approaching <b>Saturn</b> in 2004, Cassini found that the radio rotation period of <b>Saturn</b> had increased appreciably, to approximately 10hr 45min 45sec (±36sec). The latest estimate of Saturn's rotation (as an indicated rotation rate for <b>Saturn</b> as a whole) based on a compilation of various measurements from the Cassini, Voyager and Pioneer probes was reported in September 2007 is 10hr 32min 35sec.|$|E

5000|$|So Sega {{was asking}} for {{exclusive}} rights to the game, and I said, OK, if youll donate a thousand <b>Saturns</b> to blind people, then Ill donate a thousand of the Real Sound game along with the <b>Saturns.</b> And my condition was that if Sega would go for this idea, I would make that game Sega exclusive. So, thats how this happened. Its been several years now, {{and of course the}} contract probably isnt valid anymore, but the reason that I havent done anything with this game is that I made this promise with Sega back in the day, and its exclusive because of those conditions." ...|$|R

5|$|Crew-only or cargo-only supply {{missions}} {{would have}} been launched aboard a Titan II, and the <b>Saturn</b> I or <b>Saturn</b> IB {{would have been}} used for the combined crew and cargo spacecraft. Because of the increased power of the <b>Saturn</b> I, the Gemini spacecraft's ejection seats {{would not have been able}} to propel the crew far enough in the event of an explosion, so a launch escape tower was proposed, based on the one used on the Mercury spacecraft. The Titan IIIM was also considered to launch the heavier spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Development of the <b>Saturn</b> {{began in}} 1992, {{the same year}} Sega's {{groundbreaking}} 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted. Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi, another video display processor was incorporated into the system's design in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming PlayStation. The <b>Saturn</b> was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996, the <b>Saturn</b> rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the <b>Saturn</b> is considered a commercial failure. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, known in development as Sonic X-treme, has been considered {{a factor in the}} console's poor performance.|$|E
