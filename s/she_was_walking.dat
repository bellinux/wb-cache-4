5|$|The {{kidnapping}} of Jaycee Dugard occurred on June 10, 1991, south of South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 {{years old at}} the time and was abducted from a street while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> from home to a school bus stop. Searches began immediately after her disappearance, but no reliable leads were generated despite the fact that her stepfather, Carl Probyn, witnessed her kidnapping and chased the kidnappers on his mountain bike. Dugard remained missing until 2009, when a convicted sex offender, Phillip Garrido, visited the University of California campus in Berkeley accompanied by two young girls on August 24 and 25 that same year. The unusual behavior of the trio sparked an investigation that led Garrido's parole officer to order him to take the two girls to a parole office in Concord, California, on August 26. He was accompanied by a woman who was successfully identified as Jaycee Dugard who was by then 29 years old.|$|E
25|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} of the Philippines, Rosal worked as a newsreader in a Japanese-run radio station. Shortly {{after the end of}} the war, Rosal worked part-time at the San Lazaro Hospital. One night, she was passing by a film shooting as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> home, and she was spotted by the film's producer, Luis Nolasco. She was offered a film contract by Nolasco, who headed his own outfit, the Nolasco Brothers Studio.|$|E
25|$|On 17 March 1920, {{at the age}} of 23, while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> on {{a street}} with her mother, a delinquent youth struck her in the back with an iron bar for no {{apparent}} reason. As a result of that injury, she was confined to bed for three months. Although she seemed to have recovered, and was able to move around for over a decade thereafter, the complications from that incident eventually confined her to bed for 28 years, from April 1934 to the end of her life.|$|E

25|$|News of the {{controversial}} incident rapidly spread throughout the town of Oberlin, whose populace did not generally hold the same progressive views purported by the college, and through Ohio. While <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> home alone one night, she was dragged into an open field by unknown assailants, badly beaten, and left for dead. After the attack, local authorities arrested Lewis, charging her with poisoning her friends. John Mercer Langston, an Oberlin College alumnus, and the only practicing African-American lawyer in Oberlin, represented Lewis during her trial. Although most witnesses spoke against her {{and she did not}} testify, the jury acquitted her of the charges.|$|E
25|$|On March 12, 2011, Giffords's husband {{informed}} her that six {{other people had}} been killed in the attack on her, but he did not identify who they were until months later. In late April, Giffords's doctors reported that her physical, cognitive, and language production abilities had improved significantly, placing her in the top 5 percent of patients recovering from similar injuries. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> under supervision with perfect control of her left arm and leg, and able to write with her left hand. She was able to read and understand, and spoke in short phrases. With longer efforts, she was able to produce more complex sentences.|$|E
25|$|Sutcliffe {{attacked}} Olive Smelt in Halifax in August. Employing {{the same}} modus operandi, he struck {{her from behind}} and used a knife to slash her, this time above her buttocks. Again he was interrupted, and left his victim badly injured but alive. Like Rogulskyj, Smelt suffered emotional scars, including clinical depression. On 27 August, Sutcliffe attacked 14-year-old Tracy Browne in Silsden. He struck her from behind and hit her on the head five times while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> along a country lane. He ran off {{when he saw the}} lights of a passing car, leaving his victim requiring brain surgery. Sutcliffe was not convicted of the attack, but confessed to it in 1992.|$|E

She was to have been interviewed by the British actor Peter Ustinov, who was filming a documentary for Irish television. Beant Singh shot her three times using his side-arm and Satwant Singh fired 30 rounds. Beant Singh and Satwant Singh dropped their weapons and surrendered. Afterwards they were taken away by other guards into a closed room where Beant Singh was shot dead. Kehar Singh was later arrested for conspiracy in the attack. Both Satwant and Kehar were sentenced to death and hanged in Delhi's Tihar Jail.|$|E
25|$|The {{last three}} days are very much {{connected}} and are sometimes described as a blur. The third day of the convention, June 20, 1969, began with tense conversations between RYM, RYM II, and PL who fought over how to proceed with SDS as a whole. The question of black nationalism {{and the role of}} women in SDS caused much disagreement. RYM thought that black nationalism was important and backed it, while RYM II merely agreed that it existed and PL very strongly opposed to it. Like black nationalism, when it came to the “matter of women’s liberation,” PL thought that it was more important for women to “focus upon the ‘class struggle’”. RYM disagreed, instead proposing that women’s focus be in “anti-imperialism and anti-racism,” but in a more prominent and powerful role. To PL’s beliefs, Bernardine Dohrn, Mike Klonsky, and others “responded by declaring that it was impossible to remain in the same organization with people who opposed self-determination in practice and demanded an immediate split”. After this, Dohrn “announced that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> out and invited all those who agreed with her to follow”.|$|E

Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day, and she hoped that he would grow bored with music, often telling him, [...] "The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it". On 15 July 1958 (when Lennon was 17 years old) his mother was struck and killed by a car while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> home after visiting the Smiths' house.|$|E

500|$|The {{first of}} twenty-eight books in Blyton's Old Thatch series, The Talking Teapot and Other Tales, was {{published}} in 1934, {{the same year as}} the first book in her Brer Rabbit series, Brer Rabbit Retold; (note that Brer Rabbit originally featured in Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris), her first serial story and first full-length book, Adventures of the Wishing-Chair, followed in 1937. The Enchanted Wood, the first book in the Faraway Tree series, published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the Norse mythology that had fascinated Blyton as a child. According to Blyton's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from [...] "thinking up a story one day and suddenly <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> in the enchanted wood and found the tree. In her imagination she climbed up through the branches and met Moon-Face, Silky, the Saucepan Man {{and the rest of the}} characters. She had all she needed." [...] As in the Wishing-Chair series, these fantasy books typically involve children being transported into a magical world in which they meet fairies, goblins, elves, pixies and other mythological creatures.|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} of {{commercial}} success, the extensive media attention and [...] "the stress of the grand tour" [...] began to affect Björk, as she repeatedly complained about the intrusiveness of tabloids and reporters. During the Asian leg of the Post Tour, Björk arrived at Bangkok International Airport with her son Sindri after a long haul flight; reporters were present, despite Björk's earlier request that the press leave her and her son alone until she held a press conference. While <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> away from the reporters, Julie Kaufman began to ask Sindri questions; this angered Björk, who lunged at Kaufman, knocking her to the ground. Björk's record company said that the reporter had been pestering her for four days. She later apologised to Kaufman, who declined to involve the police. The televised incident generated unwanted attention, as did the suicide of Björk's stalker Ricardo López, which caused a media sensation. On 12 September, López sent a letter bomb rigged with sulfuric acid to Björk's residence in London, returned home and filmed his suicide. After viewing his video diary, police contacted Scotland Yard, who intercepted the package without incident. To record in privacy away from the unwanted interest of the press, Björk's tour drummer Trevor Morais offered his studio in Málaga, Spain for Björk to record what would be Homogenic. Björk had begun the first sessions of the album in 1996, at her Maida Vale residence, {{after the completion of}} the extensive Post Tour gave her an urgent need to write new songs as a form of therapy.|$|E
500|$|The tour {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times gave the concert a rave review affirming that Mars' energy never runs {{out as well}} as the [...] "seemingly effortless precision", which made the performance about itself. Wood finalized, [...] "The harder he played, the easier it appeared to get." [...] Holly Perry from AXS wrote that Mars was not only a [...] "true artist", but also [...] "an icon in the making". She concluded that the finale had the best production of the entire concert. Mike Wass of Idolator gave a positive review, as he witnessed Mars' [...] "powerful" [...] vocals and the band's [...] "incredibly musicianship." [...] He enlighted the singers [...] "swoonworthy rendition" [...] of [...] "When I Was Your Man", the [...] "rock interpretation" [...] of [...] "Grenade" [...] and the Pharrell duet. Jason Lipshutz, Billboard magazine writer, felt {{that one of the most}} stunning things on the concert was the catalog of number one records he left off the live show and still make it impressive. He continued, saying that Mars is a pop artist with the [...] "whole package", comparing him to [...] "an ace Pixar movie". Lipshutz ended his review stating that Mars is one of the best live performers at the given moment. The Boston Globes Sarah Rodman commented that the singer kept a high level of energy during the entire concert. She added, [...] "much work, planning, and rehearsal went in to the show, but Mars made it look easy." [...] Lillian Altman writing for The AU Review felt that [...] "the chemistry between the nine performers was phenomenal", since the band enjoys performing together by dancing and interacting with the public. After the show's finale Altman confessed that it was the first time <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> home [...] "singing and dancing in the streets" [...] after attending a concert or festival as she listened to Mars' tracks on her iPod.|$|E
