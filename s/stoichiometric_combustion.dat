In order to implement a hydrogen infrastructure advances in hydrogen technology must continue to occur (Padro 1996);Engines fueled by hydrogen gas combusted in a combustion chamber with air produce oxides of nitrogen. These oxides of nitrogen are responsible for photochemical smog, health and environmental problems.

It was observed that, as mixture injection pressures are increased, torque output increased. Also the greatest torque output occurred between 180 ° and 240 °, close to 210 ° of mixture injection duration of mainshaft rotation. Higher engine torque output was also observed at lower engine speeds;Low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide emissions were detected in the exhaust with the greatest amount being produced at 110 / 300 / 120 psi mixture injection pressure.

In the analysis of results, the relation between pressure and mass fraction burnt, x(p), is crucial. The linear x(p) relation by Lewis and Von Elbe is still widely used.

We then extend our analytical approach to a multi-zone model, which is used to benchmark several other analytical x(p) relations.

The forthcoming advent in the 2017 – 2020 timeframe of the real driving emission (RDE) standards affords little time for the identification of viable solutions. The present research work aims to contribute towards a much-needed improved understanding of the process of PM formation in theoretically-homogeneous <b>stoichiometric</b> spark-ignition <b>combustion.</b> Experimental measurements of engine-out PM have been taken from a wall-guided GDI engine operated at part-load; through parallel computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the test-engine, the process of mixture preparation was investigated. About 80 % of the total particle number is emitted on average in the 5 – 50 nm range, with the vast majority being below the regulated lower limit of 23 nm. The results suggest that both improved charge homogeneity and lower peak combustion temperature contribute to lower particle number density (PNDen) and larger particle size, as engine speed and load increase. The effect of engine load is stronger and results from greater injection pressure through better fuel droplet atomisation. Increases in pre-combustion homogeneity of 6 % are associated with one order of magnitude reductions of PNDen.
