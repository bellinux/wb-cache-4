40|$|As <b>spoil</b> <b>dumps</b> get higher, {{particularly}} in strip mining where most overburden is placed in-pit, consequences of slope failure become disproportionately greater. Current {{understanding of the}} shearing behaviour of spoil for stability design has involved a combination of laboratory-scale diagnostic testing and engineering judgment. This is a relatively empirical approach that provides a linear shear strength envelope for materials known to exhibit non-linear behaviour, particularly under high confining stresses. A shortcoming to the diagnostic testing is that oversize particles are usually scalped to accommodate the device capacity. The influence of prototype-size particles on the geomechanical behaviour of mine spoil is not truly captured. In response to concerns about overestimating the shear strength and stability of high <b>spoil</b> <b>dumps,</b> and current plans for coal mine dumps to exceed 400 m in height, {{there is a need}} to rationally define the stress-strain behaviour of more characteristic spoil masses under representative compressive and shearing loads.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} nature of {{sediment}}s {{and the role of}} tides, currents, waves and winds in driving sediment transport on the intertidal flats and shallow subtidal areas in the vicinity of Pine Harbour Marina which is situated in a shallow embayment adjoining Tamaki Strait in Hauraki Gulf, northeast North Island, New Zealand. The results from these investigations along with the study of the marina approach channel and dredge <b>spoil</b> <b>dump</b> site are used to examine the causes of sediment infilling the approach channel to the marina. This work was undertaken in support of two resource consents (W 9205 and W 9258) granted to Pine Harbour Marina by the Auckland Regional Council to undertake maintenance dredging to excavate 4, 500 m 3 of sediment from the navigation approach channel between June and October 1994. The sediments of the intertidal and shallow subtidal regions in the vicinity of Pine Harbour Marina were characterised and sediment mixing depths and transport patterns investigated with sedimentation rods, tracer studies, beach surveys and hydrographic surveys. The forcing processes of tide, wave, current and wind in the embayment were also investigated with hydrodynamic monitoring and a wave generation model for fetch limited environments was used to hind cast wave conditions. The data was collected, in conjunction with a monitoring program of the physical impacts of the 1994 dredging, to identify sediment transport pathways and to obtain quantitative sediment volume changes over the intertidal and subtidal channel areas. Pine Harbour Marina is situated in a fetch limited low wave energy environment, dominated by local wind generated waves. Wave generation model WGEN 3 DD for limited fetches, was set up to hind cast wave conditions from wind data recorded at the site. The wave climate is characterised by wave heights (Hₛ) between 0. 1 m to 0. 4 m, and wave periods (Tₛ) between 1. 0 and 2. 0 s. Large wave events are rare, but wave heights (Hₛ) up to 0. 5 m and periods (Tₛ) of 2. 5 s are generated by wind speeds greater than 10 m/s from the northwest where fetch is greatest. Wind driven circulation is important over the shallow intertidal region. On a day-to-day basis suspended sediment is transported north driven by the prevailing south-westerly winds. However large infrequent storms from the north have a greater impact on sediment transport over short time periods where significant volumes of sediment are entrained beneath high energy waves. Greater sediment transport occurs over the intertidal region than the subtidal region because sediment threshold velocities are more frequently exceeded in the shallower water depths. Thus sediment deposited in the approach channel to Pine Harbour Marina is infrequently entrained as wave orbital velocities are attenuated before they reach the bed in the deeper water. A sediment tracer experiment was undertaken using artificial fluorescent particles to identify the pattern of fine grained sediment dispersion over the intertidal flats. The dominant sediment transport direction detected was towards the southeast during a westerly storm, and a significant concentration of tracer particles accumulated in the approach channel. Sediment depth of disturbance rods on the intertidal flats indicate that sediment mixing depths were generally less than 1. 5 cm due to shallow disturbance created the movement of small (h = 1. 0 - 1. 5 cm) wave ripples. Depth of sediment disturbance increased to between 2. 0 and 3. 0 cm associated with storm periods. The maximum sediment mixing depth recorded by sedimentation rods was 6. 2 cm. Similar mixing depths of 2. 5 cm were recorded during mixing depth experiments involving short cores through buried dyed sediment and vertical mixing of fluorescent tracer particles. Fluorescent tracer was mixed to a maximum depth of 17 cm, which was not attributed to wave action but rather to bioturbation. Six monthly beach surveys indicated 2. 5 cm of accretion occurred over the mid tide region on the northern intertidal flats. This volume of sediment accretion accounts for approximately half of the dredgings material dumped on the intertidal flats. The remaining dumped sediment was resuspended by wave action and either transported back into the approach channel to Pine Harbour Marina, or removed from the area in suspension. Within 9 months of dredging of the approach channel, an average of 0. 5 m of sediment deposition occurred along the northern side of the landward 700 m of approach channel. This was estimated to be approximately 5, 250 m³ ± 2, 100 m³ of sediment infilling the channel. The increased rate of sediment infilling the approach channel is attributed to natural sediment accumulation combined with the rapid transportation of some dredgings sediment back into the channel. Initially dredgings sediment appeared to consolidate in situ, but became dispersed as a shallow layer extending up to 100 m over the intertidal flats north of the approach channel. Over the course of the investigation the dredge mounds were observed to be eroded by small drainage channels which became incised into the silty sediment at various locations transporting fine sediment from the dredge mound and intertidal flats into the approach channel. Some 12 months after dredging, the dredge mounds were dissipated and only remnant blocks of gravel to boulder sized fragments of bed rock were left. This investigation has shown that a significant amount of dredge spoil deposited on the northern intertidal flats during the 1994 dredging operation became transported back into the approach channel within 9 months of the completion of the dredging works. An alternate disposal site for future maintenance dredging works in the approach channel at a further distance from the channel edge would reduce the likelihood of "recycling" of dredged material. Possible alternate disposal options for management of dredge spoil from future maintenance dredging could include: sidecasting disposal further from the channel; offshore disposal site - adjacent or distant; contained disposal; or landfill...|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} dredging {{of shipping}} channels is a commom problem in most estuaries. Shoals constitute navigational hazards, which {{have to be}} removed to guarantee a safe access to the adjacent harbors. Dredging is always associated with the <b>dumping</b> of dredge <b>spoil</b> at declared sites, which are normally located close to the dredged channel. In this context, a main problem is the uncertainty, whether the dumped material remains at the site or is further transported by currents and redistributed in the surrounding estuarine area.

40|$|Aim and Background. In {{the process}} of {{creating}} safe navigable waterways for oil exploitation, the companies operating in the Niger Delta generate tons of sulfidic spoils. These are often deposited over bank, mostly upon fringing mangroves, and abandoned. This leads to a myriad of environmental problems. The extent of these impacts is not exactly known, but was inferred from the activities of oil companies operating in the area. This paper describes the impacts following the disturbance of sulfidic sediment through dredging and by subsequent poor spoil management practices. Environmental impacts of exposed and abandoned sulfidic sediments. The practice of dumping and abandoning sulfidic dredged spoils along canal banks triggers a series of environmental problems leading to extreme acidification, heavy metal pollution, and general habitat degradation which prevent the re-colonization of the sites by native species. The resultant <b>spoil</b> <b>dumps</b> remain bare for several years and they become colonized by invasive species later. Later still they may become attractive to the local population as sites for houses, fishing camps and home gardens, which is nevertheless regarded as a positive impact. Management of abandoned sulfidic <b>spoil</b> <b>dumps.</b> As a panacea to environmental problems caused by the sulfidic spoils, they need to be properly handled to prevent their acidification. This should be followed by mangrove restoration to pristine conditions or rehabilitation to other beneficial uses. Conclusion and Recommendation. The abandoned sulfidic spoils in the Niger Delta have resulted in the death of several thousands of hectares of mangrove habitat and their associated biota. Despite the increasing scale of dredging and spoil abandonment, the accompanying problems have been recognized by neither the oil companies nor by national government. This paper attempts to highlight these problems and concludes by recommending sound spoil management strategies involving the handling, restoration and rehabilitation of impacted areas. Furthermore, possible beneficial use of dredged spoils for civil construction, beach nourishment / shoreline protection is identified.

Behavioural experiments were carried out in the laboratory to evaluate the abilities of the common cockle (Austrovenus stutchburyi) to rebury if left on the surf ace and to resurface if buried under sediment. The intertidal benthic ecology of the area was diverse, with 89 taxa being identified. The 10 most common taxa accounted for 66 % of the 39125 individuals recorded. The assemblage composition was similar to other low energy intertidal areas. The taxal assemblages were reasonably stable in time, with seasonal fluctuations in assemblage composition being related to recruitment phases. Spatially, there was variation between the transects, however the transects close to the approach channel to the marina were similar. Mid and low tide sites had similar mollusc assemblages, which changed similarly through time. High tide sites however were distinct. The dumpground faunal assemblage changed post-dumping. Not all taxa were affected and within 6 months the dumpground was recolonised to pre-dumping levels. The subtidal area to the west of Motukaraka Island was dominated numerically by the introduced bivalve Theora lubrica. Species diversity changed in an onshore/offshore direction, with a higher species diversity closer to shore. In laboratory experiments cockles were able to resurface through sediment at burial depths of up to 10 cm, and rebury when left on the surface, in under 15 hours...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis The east {{basin of}} the Irish Sea (Liverpool Bay to the Solway) is {{predominantly}} of sediment including some very extensive intertidal flats. Rocky habitats occur as boulder scars, as artificial substrata (harbour walls, furnace waste) and at headlands {{especially in the}} Solway Firth where bedrock is also present in the sublittoral. However, most sublittoral areas are of sandy sediments. There are glacial lag deposits of coarse sediments including boulders at various locations especially off Lancashire and Cumbria. Water is often very turbid, of variable salinity and water temperature can fall to low levels in winter and rise very high in summer. Several significant estuaries enter the sector including the Dee, Mersey, Ribble and the Solway {{and much of the}} benthic survey work in the area has been concentrated within or just outside of these estuaries. Studies have also particularly been carried out in Liverpool Bay associated mainly with assessing the impact of sewage sludge and dredge <b>spoil</b> <b>dumping</b> but also in Morecambe Bay and the Solway especially in relation to fisheries and off the Cumbria coast near to large industrial installations. The long time-series of quantitative benthic samples taken since 1970 in the greater Liverpool Bay area provide an exceptional run of data. Degradation of estuarine communities as a result of human activities has occurred in some estuaries but more diverse faunas are now being reported compared with some years ago, notably in the Mersey. Many of the docks in the Mersey support diverse and unusual communities. Farther north, the boulder scars along the Cumbrian coast, the extensive sandflats of Morecambe Bay and the Solway and the rocky headlands in the Solway provide a variety of habitats. 11. ...|$|R
