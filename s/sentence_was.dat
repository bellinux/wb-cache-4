5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} {{that as a result of}} appeals brought by prosecutors and heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had the death penalty reimposed after his reduced sentence of life imprisonment was overturned. Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death penalty imposed. The new death sentences were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so her <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> not rejudged.|$|E

5000|$|But now let's try {{assuming}} that the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> false. In order for a conditional to be false, the antecedent condition must be true while the consequent is false. So to assume the falsity of the sentence: [...] "if this <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> true, then 'Germany borders China' is true," [...] we must assume that [...] "this <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> true" [...] (the antecedent condition), and [...] "it is not true that Germany borders China" [...] (the consequent). Notice, though, that in assuming the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> false, we must assume that the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> true. This contradiction means that, in fact, the <b>sentence</b> must <b>be</b> true.|$|R
5|$|After {{listening}} to Marshall's damning summing-up, {{on the evening}} of 30 July Ward took an overdose of sleeping tablets and was taken to hospital.

5|$|Dyer {{was charged}} and, in May 2001, pleaded guilty on nine counts of blackmail, {{as well as}} a sole count of common assault against Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb.

In May 1946, Hergé was issued a certificate of good citizenship, which became largely necessary to obtain employment in post-war Belgium.

For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any film or from using a film camera {{for the rest of}} his life.

Clouzot's <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been one of the first people to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E
5|$|After the war, five Croatian {{fighters were}} charged and convicted of eleven counts of murder, one of {{attempted}} murder, {{and one of}} torture of Serb civilians found in the JNA barracks, which surrendered on 15 September 1991. They received prison sentences of between five and eight years. Glavaš, who was tried alongside them for the same crimes, received a ten-year sentence. Before the conviction became final in 2009, and to avoid extradition, Glavaš fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he had granted citizenship. His <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> reduced to eight years and became final in 2010, {{when he was arrested}} and imprisoned in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
