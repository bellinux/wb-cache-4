40|$|Abstract: Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) was {{employed}} to study the Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) film in lithium ion batteries in this work. <b>Silver</b> <b>island</b> <b>film</b> was deposited {{on the surface of}} Hard Carbon Spherule (HCS) and this resulted in SERS effect and the SEI film discharged to different voltages was analyzed and its Raman spectra were assigned. The breakthrough of the technology of the anode materials of batteries has lead to the birth and commercialization of lithium ion batteries since the late twentieth century and from then on the anode materials have always been the hotspot in this area. While studying the way to enhance the cycling capability and capacity of batteries, many researchers reported the Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) film between the electrode and electrolyte [1 - 2]. This film is an insulator for electron and a good conductor for lithium ion which can freely insert and deinsert through this passivate film. The formation of this film has a crucial influence upon the capability of electrode materials [3]. The study of SEI film has been a focus in the area of lithium ion batteries in recent years. Silver particles were chemically deposited on the surface of HCS particles, which is a kind of cathode material for lithium ion batteries. <b>Silver</b> <b>island</b> <b>film</b> deposited upon can result in SERS effect through comparing the Raman spectra of HCS powder before and after silver particles were deposited...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{thermally}} annealed <b>silver</b> <b>island</b> <b>films</b> {{have been studied}} {{with regard to their}} potential applicability in applications of metal-enhanced fluorescence, an emerging tool in nano-biotechnology. <b>Silver</b> <b>island</b> <b>films</b> were thermally annealed between 75 and 250 ◦ C for several hours. As a function of both time and annealing temperature, the surface plasmon band at ≈ 420 nm both diminished and was blue shifted. These changes in plasmon resonance have been characterized using both absorption measurements, as well as topographically using Atomic Force Microscopy. Subsequently, the net changes in plasmon absorption are interpreted as the <b>silver</b> <b>island</b> <b>films</b> becoming spherical and growing in height, as well as an increased spacing between the particles. Interestingly, when the annealed surfaces are coated with a fluorescein-labeled protein, significant enhancements in fluorescence are osbserved, scaling with annealing temperature and time. These observations strongly support our recent hypothesis that the extent of metal-enhanced fluorescence is due to the ability of surface plasmons to radiate coupled fluorophore fluorescence. Given that the extinction spectrum of the silvered films is comprised of both an absorption and scattering component, and that these components are proportional to the diameter cubed and to the sixth power, respectively, then larger structures are expected to have a greater scattering contribution to their extinction spectrum and, therefore, more efficiently radiate coupled fluorophore emission. Subsequently, {{we have been able to}} correlate our increases in fluorescence emission with an increased particle size, providing strong experiment evidence for our recently reported metal-enhanced fluorescence, facilitated by radiating plasmons hypothesis.

The dependence of enhancement factors on the excitation wavelength is not correlated with the absorption spectrum of the plasmonic structure. In particular, the presence of one (or multiple) trimers of the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) protein reveals itself in bimodal distribution of enhancement factors for the excitation at 589 nm, the wavelength corresponding to bacteriochlorophyll absorption of FMO and {{the core of the}} RC.

The thickness of the silica layer is varied from 0 to approximately 46 nm on a single sample, thus allowing for continuous variation of the interaction strength between plasmon excitations in the metallic film and the excited states of pigments comprising photosynthetic complexes used to probe this interaction. While the largest separation between the silver film and photosynthetic complexes provides fluorescence featuring mono-exponential decay, thinner silica spacer distances show bi-exponential decay.

30|$|Here {{we propose}} a new {{technique}} that enables MIF self-assembling on a dielectric substrate enriched with metal. The processing of such substrates in reducing hydrogen atmosphere results {{in the formation of}} the metal nanoislands on the substrate surface. This process can be described in terms of reactive diffusion of hydrogen, i.e., in terms of penetration of hydrogen into the substrate and its ionization via reducing metal ions to neutral atoms which are hardly soluble in glass and diffuse towards substrate surface. The accumulation of the metal atoms at the surface results in the formation of metal nuclei that grow and form metal nanoislands. We employed this technique to form <b>silver</b> <b>island</b> <b>film</b> on the surface of silver-containing phosphate glasses, and we characterized the morphology and optical properties of the MIF using atomic force microscopy, optical absorption, and Raman spectroscopy. In order to demonstrate the performance of the created MIF in SERS-based sensors, we showed that it is capable to detect 10 − 7 M concentration of rhodamine 6 G (R 6 G) deposited on the glass surface. The developed technique does not require external metal source and enables multiple usages of the same glass substrate in SERS measurements.|$|E
30|$|We {{fabricated}} silver nanoisland films using SOD from {{glass in}} the course of the ion-exchanged glass substrate annealing in a reducing hydrogen atmosphere. In the experiments, we used soda-lime glass microscope slides produced by Menzel [22]. The silver-sodium ion exchange was performed at 325 °C in an ion-exchange bath containing 5  wt.% of silver nitrate and 95  wt.% of sodium nitrate as was reported elsewhere [23]. One-millimeter-thick slides with a size of 20 [*]×[*] 30  mm 2 were immersed in the melt for 20  min, which provided a few microns of silver penetration depth in the glass. Optical absorption spectroscopy of the ion-exchanged slides did not show any absorption peaks in the spectral range corresponding to the surface plasmon resonance, which indicated the absence of silver nanoparticles both in the bulk and on the surface of the slides. The ion-exchanged slides were annealed in hydrogen for 10  min to reduce silver ions to atoms and get a supersaturated solid solution of neutral silver in the glass matrix. According to the proposed mechanism [24], this results in the formation of both silver nanoparticles within the glass and a <b>silver</b> <b>island</b> <b>film</b> on the glass surface (MIF) due to the out-diffusion of silver atoms.|$|E

30|$|Here, {{we report}} {{a study of}} the {{relation}} between the preparation conditions of island-like silver substrates, their morphology, and SERS properties. Rhodamine 6 G (Rh 6 G) was chosen as an analyte due to its broad application as fluorescent labelling and sensing reagent [14, 15], as well as due to its common use as an analyte in testing SERS substrates [16]. In addition, the SERS spectra of the nanoparticles of an inorganic semiconductor, CdSe, are also obtained and analysed. In contrast to the huge work done on SERS experiments with molecules as analyte [1 – 3], only a few attempts succeeded in observing surface enhancement of Raman signal from semiconductor nanoparticles as analyte [17 – 23]. At the same time, the effect of interaction with the plasmon onto the optical and electrical properties of semiconductor NPs is presently an intense field of research [24]. The reported successful SERS experiments on semiconductor NPs were realized using colloidal Ag NPs [17, 21, 22], Ag–CdS composites formed by the Langmuir–Blodgett technique [23], or by thermal deposition of silver onto the epitaxialy grown nanostructures [19, 20].

Its properties were studied on the basis of interference in reflection and transmission. Dipolar properties of the fluorescent collector dye molecules were obtained from analysis of the flourescence lifetime measurements and the spectra for absorption and fluorescence. The electric potential for the system consisting of silver, polymer and dye was derived as a sum of dipolar and higher order multipolar components. From this, expressions for the rates of radiative and non-radiative decay were obtained. Their quotient for a given spectral range depends {{on the extent to which}} surface plasmons are excited in the silver spheroid, which in turn is determined by the size and eccentricity of the spheroid.

30|$|In {{the past}} decade, using {{metallic}} nanostructures {{to perform the}} metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF; or called surface-enhanced fluorescence) has attracted a lot of attentions [1 – 11]. Due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of gold or silver nanostructures, the local electric field in their vicinity can be enhanced significantly to raise the excitation rate on a nearby molecule [11 – 17]. Additionally, the plasmon-mediated Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the excited molecule and the nanostructure facilitates the emission of the fluorescence, so as to raise the quantum yield and reduce the lifetime of the fluorescence dramatically [6 – 8, 15 – 21]. In particular, for some molecular fluorescence with low quantum yield, the MEF becomes of importance [7]. The advantages of MEF include the increased detectability and photostability of fluorophores. Moreover, Purcell effect has elucidated that the environment can modify the spontaneous emission of emitters [22 – 24]. A variety of nanostructures have been proposed for the purpose such as silver nanoparticle (SNP), nanoshell, gold nanorod, silver nanotriangle, and <b>silver</b> <b>island</b> <b>film</b> (SIF) [25 – 40]. For example, SIF with discrete silver islands (SIs) on a substrate has been widely used for sensing single molecular fluorescence and protein in nano-biotechnology [2, 5, 8, 10]. Recently, a hybrid nanostructure using SIF associated with SNPs has been developed to enhance the fluorescence of molecules located within the gap zone between the SI and SNP [41]. The hybrid nanostructure of SNPs over SIF on a substrate forms a sandwiched layer where the detected molecule is in between the gap of SI and SNP. Within the nanogap, which is a hot spot, the MEF can be performed significantly. In addition, this new structure can also {{be applied to the}} surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) [42 – 44].|$|E

40|$|In Chapter 1, various {{techniques}} of surface analysis are briefy reviewed and compared. The application of surface-enhanced Raman scattering {{to the study}} of semiconductor electrodes is described. ^ In Chapter 2, the UV-vis and Raman scattering spectroscopy of the reduced form of methylviologen (MV) is described in detail. Analysis of the UV-vis and Raman spectra of reduced forms of MV provides some information about the molecular configuration of this compound. Tentative assignment of absorption and Raman scattering bands is given. The Raman scattering of reduced MV on a silver electrode is surface-enhanced due to the adsorption of MV on silver surface. There are two kinds of interactions between MV and silver that give rise of two different surface-enhanced Raman spectra. Type I surface-enhanced Raman scattering is a result of usual chemisorption whereas Type II surface-enhanced Raman scattering may involve the chemical interaction between MV, silver and supporting electrolyte and formation of a complex. ^ In Chapter 3, the charge transfer at an illuminated p-indium phosphide (p-InP) /methylviologen solution interface is studied by cyclic voltammetry and differential capacitance measurements. The open circuit potential of this system was found to be linearly proportional to the logarithm of light intensity. The photopotential, measured by comparing the cathodic peaks of MV 2 +/MV+ at Pt and illuminated p-InP electrodes, is a function of light intensity and solution concentration but not of wavelength. No evidence for a hot electron effect was found under the experimental conditions employed. The concept of quasi-Fermi level is used to explain the experimental results. ^ In Chapter 4, the surface-enhanced Raman effect is employed to monitor the photoelectrochemically reduced methylviologen at a p-type InP electrode with a silver overlayer.

40|$|The present work explores {{vibrational}} Raman spectroscopy. Vibrational Raman and vibrational infrared are {{the most}} commonly used spectroscopies for detection and identification of molecules with their vibrational fingerprint. Under certain conditions, molecules display unique florescence and Raman scattering behavior when they are close to metal nanostructures sustaining localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR), giving rise to surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS). The utilization of LSPR in metallic nanoparticles, in particular silver and gold nanostructures, is a remarkable means of improving the efficiency of Raman scattering enhancing optical signals in SERS and SERRS. Correspondingly, the fabrication and characterization of silver and gold island films are first presented, and SERS signals enhancement of an organic dye on these metal nanostructured films are demonstrated. The excitations are characterized by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, while the morphology is revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). To control the surface coverage of the metal nanostructures, the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique is used to coat the SERS substrate with monomolecular layers of several target systems, such as dyes and phospholipids. The most important results in this work are in the field of single molecule detection (SMD) using two spectroscopic approaches: LB-SERRS and LB-SERS. LB-SERRS improves the scattering efficiency from the electronic resonances (resonance Raman) of dye using <b>silver</b> <b>island</b> <b>film</b> with a plasmon absorption overlapping the molecular absorption. Several experiments are designed to the statistical average of LB-SERRS spectra, and the statistical breakdown observed in spectral characteristics when SMD is approached.
