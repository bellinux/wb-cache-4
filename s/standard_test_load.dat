With the {{background}} of the foundation treatment engineering of a river dam in a reservoir, the thesis introduced the site experiments for soft soil foundation reinforced by vibro-replacement stone piles. Moreover, the study had also conducted inspection and analysis of the reinforcing effect of the composite foundation being reinforced by vibro-replacement stone piles including the inspec-tions like the stress ratio between the vibro-replacement stone pile and earth among pile and the ratio between the vibro-replacement stone pile and the pile earth. Finally, the study came to below results after comprehensively considering the results of the heavy dynamic penetration <b>test,</b> <b>standard</b> pene-tration <b>test,</b> <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> reading of earth pressure cell and etc. The reinforcement of the vi-bro-replacement stone piles could reach the expected reinforcement effect for the soft earth founda-tion. After the application of the piles, the carrying fore of the composite foundation is higher than the design requirements and the liquefaction resistance has experienced significant improvement. Moreover, this kind of composite soil foundation could effectively reduce the total settlement of the foundation, accelerate the consolidation of the foundation and improve the hydraulic conductivity of the foundation...|$|R

The interconnected two area power system of non-reheat thermal power plants consisting of 2 DOF-PID controller in each area has been considered for design and analysis. Firstly, the proposed approach has been implemented in the aforementioned <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> system and thereafter, the robustness of the system consisting 2 DOF-PID controller optimized by proposed technique has been estimated using the sensitivity analysis for the same.

40|$|Load {{rating is}} a tool that bridge {{managers}} can use to address aging assets, increasing traffic, and dwindling maintenance budgets. A <b>standard</b> diagnostic <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is financially impractical given {{the large number of}} bridges requiring load rating.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare two methods of blade <b>test</b> <b>loading</b> and show how they are applied in an actual blade test. Strength and load-based methods were {{examined}} to determine the <b>test</b> <b>load</b> for an Atlantic Orient Corporation (AOC) 15 / 50 wind turbine blade for fatigue and static testing. Fatigue load-based analysis was performed using measured field <b>test</b> <b>loads</b> extrapolated for extreme rare events and scaled to thirty-year spectra. An accelerated constant amplitude fatigue test that gives equivalent damage at critical locations was developed using Miner`s Rule and the material S-N curves. Test load factors were applied to adjust the <b>test</b> <b>loads</b> for uncertainties, and differences between the test and operating environment. Similar analyses were carried, out for the strength-based fatigue test using the strength of the blade and the material properties to determine the load level and number of constant amplitude cycles to failure. Static tests were also developed using load and strength criteria. The resulting <b>test</b> <b>loads</b> were compared and contrasted.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simplified method for converting wind turbine rotor design loads into equivalent-damage, constant-amplitude loads and load ratios for both flap and lead-lag directions. It is an iterative method {{that was developed}} at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) using Palmgren-Miner's linear damage principles. The general method is unique {{because it does not}} presume that any information about the materials or blade structural properties is precisely known. According to this method, the loads are never converted to stresses. Instead, a family of M-N curves (moment vs. cycles) is defined with reasonable boundaries for load-amplitude and slope. An optimization program iterates and converges on the constant amplitude <b>test</b> <b>load</b> and load ratio that minimizes the sensitivity to the range of M-N curves for each blade section. The authors constrained the general method to match the NedWind 25 design condition for the <b>Standards,</b> Measurements, and <b>Testing</b> (SMT) blade testing pro gram. SMT participants agreed to use the fixed S-N slope of m = 10 from the original design to produce consistent test-loads among the laboratories. Unconstrained, the general method suggests that slightly higher <b>test</b> <b>loads</b> should be used for the NedWind 25 blade design spectrum.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the dynamic monitoring {{carried out by}} means of vibration measurements during the <b>standard</b> static <b>load</b> <b>test</b> of a half-through steel arch bridge on the Potenza river. The structural design of the bridge is characterized by some notable aspects: the river crossing is obtained by two coupled steel arches, having a span length around 115 m, and a steel-concrete composite deck sustained by thirty couples of steel hangers; the approaching spans are realized with continuous girders on intermediate supports, having cross section with variable height; the arches are supported on rubber bearing seismic isolators. The vibration measurements were nearly continuously acquired during the <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> to detect the occurrence of anomalies in the structural behavior. In particular, the global dynamic characteristics of the structure, in terms of modal parameters, were determined using the data set of measurements at specific phases of the load test: first on the unloaded configuration, then on two different loaded configurations and finally after the bridge unloading. Measurements of vibrations due both to the ambient and to the impulse produced by a fully loaded truck passing over a bump, were carried out. The experimental results, in terms of modal parameters of the bridge, are {{in agreement with the}} theoretical results obtained with the predictive finite element model developed for design purposes and opportunely modified to account for the real conditions of the bridge during the tests...|$|R

40|$|Low-cost {{test and}} tuning methods for difficult-to-measure {{specifications}} {{are presented in}} this research from the following perspectives: 1) "Safe" test and self-tuning for power converters: To avoid the risk of device under test (DUT) damage during conventional load/line regulation measurement on power converter, a "safe" alternate test structure is developed where the power converter (boost/buck converter) is placed in a different mode of operation during alternative <b>test</b> (light switching <b>load)</b> as opposed to <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> (heavy switching <b>load)</b> to prevent damage to the DUT during manufacturing test. Based on the alternative test structure, self-tuning methods for both boost and buck converters are also developed in this thesis. In addition, to make these test structures suitable for on-chip built-in self-test (BIST) application, a special sensing circuit has been designed and implemented. Stability analysis filters and appropriate models are also implemented to predict the DUT’s electrical stability condition during test and to further predict the values of tuning knobs needed for the tuning process. 2) High bandwidth RF signal generation: Up-convertion has been widely used in high frequency RF signal generation but mixer nonlinearity results in signal distortion {{that is difficult to}} eliminate with such methods. To address this problem, a framework for low-cost high-fidelity wideband RF signal generation is developed in this thesis. Depending on the band-limited target waveform, the input data for two interleaved DACs (digital-to-analog converters) system is optimized by a matrix-model-based algorithm {{in such a way that}} it minimizes the distortion between one of its image replicas in the frequency domain and the target RF waveform within a specified signal bandwidth. The approach is used to demonstrate how interferers with specified frequency characteristics can be synthesized at low cost for interference testing of RF communications systems. The frameworks presented in this thesis have a significant impact in enabling low-cost test and tuning of difficult-to-measure device specifications for power converter and high-speed devices. Ph.
