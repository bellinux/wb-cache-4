40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{is focused on}} developing an e-learning model {{that can be used}} by academic departments and colleges in the University of Tabuk and <b>other</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> to monitor and evaluate the quality of their distance education programs and courses. Although extensive research has been done in the U. S. and other countries regarding distance education quality standards and measures, as of yet, no significant efforts have been made toward establishing such standards in Saudi Arabia. The model states that online learning must be assessed from a holistic perspective; that is, all six aspects outlined in this model must be considered and asked and taken into account to an equal extent. The model is constructed of three levels, as follows: 175 benchmarks are categorized and stored in 27 “sub-factors ” and 6 main factors/building-blocks. These factors represent a cluster of related benchmarks that are mostly centered on a specific aspect of online settings...|$|R

Additionally, it investigated faculty professional development needs in adopting online teaching. The data in this study were obtained from 147 faculty members (response rate 63. 9 %). A non-experimental, cross-sectional survey design was used, incorporating the Stages of Concern Questionnaire. The data were analyzed using quantitative measures (descriptive data analysis and inferential analysis). This study utilized the Concerns Based Adoption Model as its theoretical framework. King Abdulaziz University faculty Stages of Concerns findings showed a mean score percentile of 87 % of them as Unconcerned. The Informational stage showed a mean score percentile of 72 %, and the Personal stage was the third highest with a mean score percentile of 70 %. Refocusing, Collaboration, and Management were the fourth, fifth, and sixth highest stages of concern. The Consequence stage was the lowest stage of concern. The Stages of Concern Questionnaire had concerns that were generally aligned to nonusers or users who sometimes implement parts of online teaching. The data analysis regarding the participants’ personal characteristics indicated that their concerns in adopting online teaching were not influenced by their age, country of graduation, or years of teaching experience. A statistically significant difference was found in the participant concerns in adopting online teaching by gender, p<. 05. The significance differences were found in stage one (Informational) (p<. 05), stage two (Personal) (p<. 01), and stage six (Refocusing) (p<. 001). Likewise, the data analysis regarding the participants’ contextual characteristics indicated that their concerns in adopting online teaching were not influenced by their department or academic rank. A statistically significant difference was found in the participants’ concerns in adopting online teaching based on administrative support, p<. 05. The significances were found in stages zero (Unconcerned) (p<. 05) and three (Management) (p<. 01). The data analysis regarding the technographic characteristics also indicated a statistically significant influence of participants' prior instructional technology use and technology-related professional development on their use of technology in teaching. The significance values were. 000,. 006,. 009, and. 030. The study concludes with recommendations for King Abdulaziz University regarding faculty adoption of online teaching and recommendations for future studies focused on professional development programs and the adoption of online teaching in King Abdulaziz University as well as in <b>other</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{number of}} student {{enrollment in the}} college of education at King Faisal University has led many faculty members to abandon essay and open-ended type tests and resort to the quickly scorable multiple choice and short answer techniques. However, close observation of achievement tests, (particularly summative) given to students in different subjects has repeatedly revealed that this tendency towards using objective techniques has resulted in the development of tests that are deficient in their fulfillment of course objectives, coverage of course content and instructional materials, demonstration of acquired skills and /or learning, and application of sound test construction techniques. To decide on the exact nature and scope of this awareness/training formula, a good number oF final achievement tests in different subjects offered in the college is examined and analyzed and the opinions of a representative sample of faculty members are elicited. The aforementioned investigations are conducted in light of recent developments in educational measurement and performance assessment. This study hypothesizes that faculty members in the College of Education at King Faisal <b>University</b> (and probably <b>other</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> too) are in great need of: 1. Awareness of recent developments in the theory and practice of educational measurement and performance assessment. 2. Further training on sound practices of the design and implementation of effective tests. لقد أدى التزايد المطرد في أعداد الطلبة المقبولين بكلة التربية بجامعه الملك فيصل في السنوات الأخيرة إلى نزوع كتير من أعضاء هيئه التدريس إلى ترك استخدام الاختبارات المقالية وذات الإجابة المفتوحة واللجوء إلى استخدام الاختبارات ذات الاختيار من متعدد والأخرى ذات الإجابة القصيرة ، ولكن الملاحظة عن كثب لاختبارات التحصيل (النهائية بالذات) التي تعطى للطلبة في مواد مختلفة بينت بشكل متكرر أن هذا الميل إلى استخدام الأساليب الموضوعية في الاختبارات نتج عنه إعداد اختبارات عاجزه عن تحقيق أهداف المقررات وتغطية محتوى كل مقرر ومادته الدراسية ، وعرض المهارات المكتسبة والتعلم ، وكذلك تطبيق الأساليب الصحيحة في بناء ووضع الاختبارات. وتفترض هذه الدراسة أن أعضاء هيئة التدريس بكلية التربية بجامعة الملك فيصل (وربما غيرها من الجامعات السعودية أيضاً) بحاجه ماسة إلى : 1 -	‏الإلمام بالمستجدات الأخيرة في نظريات وتطبيقات القياس التربوي وتقويم الأداء. 2 -	المزيد من التدريب على الممارسات السلمية في تصميم وتطبق الاختبارات الناجعة. ولتقرير طبيعة وأفق معادلة الإلمام والتدريب هذه بشكل دقيق ، تم فحص وتحليل عدد جديد من اختبارات النهائية التي تقدم في مواد مختلفة بالكلية ، كما تم استقصاء آراء أعضاء هيئة التدريس بالكلية حول هذا الموضوع ، هذا وقد أجريت هذه الفحوص والتساؤلات في ضوء المستجدات الحديثة في القياس التربوي وتقويم الأداء...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates ICT in Saudi HE as {{represented}} by the researcher’s own institution: King Saud University (KSU). Using a naturalistic approach in pursuing the inquiry and making use of mixed methods, the research questions were investigated using surveys and in-depth interviews. A convenient sample of the University’s stakeholders; namely the senior managers, the academic staff and the students were investigated and asked to explain the process of ICT adoption and deployment on the management level; their use and adoption of ICT in their personal and professional activities and elaborate on the ICT adoption process at KSU and compare it {{to that of other}} universities. They also related these experiences to the University’s plans and efforts in this regard. The findings indicated a boom in ICT adoption {{over the course of the}} recent years. However, this process did not follow a clear strategic plan. Rather, it was based on an administrative decision by the recently appointed KSU management. The rector’s positive attitude and belief in ICT played a role in this process. The study showed that KSU administration values ICT and views it as a means for the University to achieve its aims. The results also showed the increasing use of ICT among the three groups in the study both on personal and professional levels. While these professional purposes may differ between the three groups in this research, results indicate that there is an increasing implementation of ICT in the daily work of all the groups, both in and out of KSU. These uses are also supported by the positive attitudes all the stakeholders hold towards ICT, as the study indicated. The study also revealed the aspiration of both KSU and Higher Education System in the country in general, and the role that ICT is perceived to play in helping them to achieve these aspirations. Results indicated that the current state of ICT in Saudi HE is increasing when compared to that of other universities and countries, especially in terms of hardware implementation. Although it was not possible to achieve specific comparisons between <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> due to lack of data and access, many different comparison points were pointed and elaborated on both nationally and internationally. Finally, the study revealed many ICT enablers in the Saudi HE system, such as the generous financial support provided by the government, the positive attitudes, and the changing role of the university, as well as the technical, administrative and sociocultural barriers facing more ICT integration in Saudi HE, and how KSU dealt with these opportunities and threats. Based on the results, implications for future research were elicited and recommendations for better practice were provided. The urgent need for a clear ICT strategic plan for KSU as well as the <b>other</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> seems inevitable. A need for clear benchmarks within this plan is an important indicator of the need for the institution to evaluate the process. Of importance concern is the fact that these plans need to include all the stakeholders in the planning phase so as to properly conduct the assessment, implementation and evaluation successfully...|$|R

The migration to cloud-based IT resources is not yet widespread in <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> due to several challenges including security, legal policies and implementation. At present, there is lack of research and guidance for <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> on how to overcome these challenges and how contextual factors can influence the successful migration to the educational clouds. This research presents a framework for the successful migration to cloud technology in the <b>Saudi</b> Arabian <b>universities.</b> In this research, a set of key critical success factors (CSFs) were identified by synthesizing components from studies concerned with the migration of cloud for higher education and factors identified from the successful implementation of WBL (Web Based Learning) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) on higher education in Saudi Arabia.

The study applied three measures developed by Van House et al. (1990) : Facilities Use Rate, Services Points Use, and Reference Transactions. The study investigated if any significant differences existed in the use rates of services points and supportive facilities among the seven <b>Saudi</b> <b>university</b> libraries and between two designated groups [...] -large versus small universities. The study used different individual methods to collect the data: (1) interviews with librarians and department heads, (2) review of the literature and the related library documents and reports, and (3) masurement of the information services points and facilities. Based on the performance measurement data obtained, the average percentage use rate of facilities at the <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> ranges from 17 % to 72 %. For the service points use rate, the average rate of users per employee for the service points' desks ranges from 0. 45 to 2. 05. For the reference transactions rate, the average rate of transactions per employee for the service points' desks ranges from 0. 77 to 7. 90. The study found that at least one of the seven libraries has a significantly different average use rate of facilities, a significantly different average user rate per employee of the service points' desks, and a significantly different average transaction rate per employee of the reference points' desks at <b>Saudi</b> <b>university</b> libraries.
