40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> <b>rolling</b> on tensile and microstructural properties of three industrial grade steels was investigated. <b>Skin</b> <b>pass</b> <b>rolling</b> {{was performed on}} a laboratory mill equipped with a device designed to reproduce the effects of sheet tension and with load cells aimed at measuring the main working parameters. Analysis on tensile properties of skin pass rolled samples showed for an ultralow C grade and a low C grade a decreasing trend of the yield strength down to a minimum, followed by progressive rising values with increasing rolling elongation. This trend was related to changes of the tensile curve shape, leading to a transition from discontinuous to continuous yielding. A zinc-coated mild steel grade featured a tensile curve with a knee at transition from elastic to plastic regime. Accordingly, the change in yield strength with increasing skin pass elongation followed a linear trend. Microstructural and crystallographic information supplied by EBSD analyses suggested that the plastic strain induced by <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> <b>rolling</b> originated a fairly homogeneous deformation field even on grains directly exposed on the strip surface. Micro-hardness profiles taken across strip thickness highlighted both increasing peak hardness values at strip surfaces and rising values at mid-thickness...|$|E
40|$|The common {{grades of}} steel used in roll forming are: hot rolled carbon steel, high {{strength}} low alloy and recovery annealed cold rolled sheet. These steels {{are prone to}} ageing and are often skin passed and/or roller leveled to eliminate ageing as it can lead to problems in forming. In roll forming, shape defects such as bow, twist and camber are considered to be related to very small plastic strains in the longitudinal direction and hence knowledge of the material properties in the elastic plastic transition range is necessary if the process is to be modelled accurately. Previous studies with aluminium have indicated that <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> <b>rolling</b> can lead to residual stresses in the strip. In this work, the study was extended to aged carbon steel and to the effect of roller leveling on both aged material and strip that had been given a light cold rolling to simulate a skin pass treatment. The results suggest that roller leveling reduced the magnitude of residual stresses resulting from <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> <b>rolling.</b> The significant differences observed between tensile and bending test results, at and near, the elastic plastic transition reinforces the need to consider bending properties when assessing the effect of prior processing on strip for roll forming. <br /...|$|E
40|$|After casting, {{the process}} chain for the {{production}} of semi-finished sheet metals consists of different process steps like hot-rolling, cold-rolling, heat treatment, and <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> <b>rolling.</b> Thereafter, the semi-finished part is manufactured to a component by sheet metal forming operations like deep drawing. During such process chains, a strong evolution of the microstructure and the resulting mechanical properties can be observed. Due to the occurring finite plastic deformations and the accompanied increase in dislocation density during the cold rolling process, the grain structure is extremely deformed and the orientations of the grains are changed. In contrast to hot-rolled metals, the cold-rolled material shows recrystallization by temperature rise. The recrystallization processes are required to adjust the mechanical behaviour of the annealed material. For process optimization, it is essential to understand the combined process of cold-rolling and annealing: i. e. how the microstructure like the grain orientations evolves and also how that influences the mechanical behaviour. Only detailed knowledge about the microstructural evolution enables to find the optimal design of such process chains. During component production by deep drawing, the resulting material properties of the semi-finished product influence strongly the material behaviour in the manufacturing process...|$|E
40|$|Bending {{and reverse}} bending are the {{dominant}} material deformations in roll forming, and hence property data derived from bend tests {{could be more}} relevant than tensile test data for numerical simulation of a roll forming process. Recent investigations have shown that residual stresses change the material behavior close to the yield in a bending test. So, residual stresses introduced during prior steel processing operations may affect the roll forming process, and therefore {{they need to be}} included in roll forming simulations to achieve improved model accuracy. Measuring the residual stress profile experimentally is time consuming and has limited accuracy while analytical models that are available require detailed information about the pre-processing conditions that is generally not available for roll forming materials. The main goal {{of this study is to}} develop an inverse routine that determines a residual stress profile through the material thickness based on experimental pure bend test data. A numerical model of the <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> (temper <b>rolling)</b> process is performed to introduce a residual stress profile in DP 780 steel sheet. The <b>skin</b> <b>passed</b> strips are used in a pure bending simulation to record moment-curvature data and this data is then applied in an inverse analysis to predict the residual stress profile in the material. Comparison of the residual stress profile predicted by the inverse routine with that calculated by finite element analysis (FEA) indicates an inverse approach combined with pure bend test may present an alternative to predict residual stresses in sheet metals...|$|R
40|$|The {{metal strip}} used in roll forming {{has often been}} preprocessed by (tension or roller) {{leveling}} or by skin-pass rolling, and as a consequence, may contain residual stresses. These stresses are not well observed by the tensile test, but could {{have a significant effect}} on the bending and springback behavior. With the advent of improved process design techniques for roll forming, including advanced finite element techniques, the need for precise material property data has become important. The major deformation mode of roll forming is that of bending combined with unloading and reverse bending, and hence property data derived from bend tests could be more relevant than that from tensile testing. This work presents a numerical study on the effect of <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> on the material behavior of stainless steel strip in pure bending and tension. A two dimensional (2 -D) numerical model was developed using Abaqus Explicit to analyze the affect of <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> on the residual stress profile across a section for various working conditions. The deformed meshes and their final stress fields were then imported as pre-defined fields into Abaqus Standard, and the post-skin passing material behavior in pure bending was determined. The results show that a residual stress profile is introduced into the steel strip during <b>skin</b> <b>passing,</b> and that its shape and stress level depend on the overall thickness reduction as well as the number of <b>rolling</b> <b>passes</b> used in the <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> process. The material behavior in bending and the amount of springback changed significantly depending on the <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> condition...|$|R

40|$|The {{process chain}} for sheet metals after casting to produce {{components}} made of semi-finished products {{is complex and}} the resulting mechanical properties of the produced material depend strongly {{on the evolution of}} the microstructure. After casting, a typical process chain consists of hot rolling, cold rolling, annealing, <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> <b>rolling,</b> and sheet metal forming. In order to represent the microstructure evolution in an adequate way, a multiscale modeling concept is applied for the process steps cold rolling, annealing, and sheet metal forming. In this Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) concept, the strong microstructure evolution during the production of semi-finished products is modeled by using crystal plasticity for the representation of the cold rolling process and a cellular automaton is incorporated to model the annealing procedure. In both cases, only the microstructure in an adequate unit cell is considered. For sheet metal forming, the whole component has to be simulated together with the interaction between workpiece and the forming tools in order to solve technological problems like springback. For this purpose, classical macroscopic plasticity models have been applied. To connect the different length scales of the modeling approaches, a scale transition on the basis of numerical homogenization is introduced for the determination of the mechanical properties like the multi-axial yield behavior. These information are required to virtually determine the type of the macroscopic plasticity model, the material parameters of the plasticity model, and to simulate sheet metal forming processes. In the article, the different modeling approaches are compared step by step with experimental investigations in order to prove the predictability of each modeling technique...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, wedge-shape samples {{were used to}} study the effect of strain induced {{transformation}} on the formation of ultrafine grained structures in steel by single <b>pass</b> <b>rolling.</b> The results showed two different transition strains for bainite formation and ultrafine ferrite (UFF) formation in the surface layer of strip at reductions of 40 % and 70 %, respectively, in a plain carbon steel. The bainitic microstructure formed by strain induced bainitic transformation during single <b>pass</b> <b>rolling</b> was also very fine. The evolution of UFF formation in the surface layer showed that ferrite coarsening is significantly reduced through strain induced transformation combined with rapid cooling {{in comparison with the}} centre of the strip. In the surface, the ferrite coarsening mostly occurred for intragranular nucleated grains (IG) rather than grain boundary (GB) ferrite grains. The results suggest that normal grain growth occurred during overall transformation in the GB ferrite grains.
