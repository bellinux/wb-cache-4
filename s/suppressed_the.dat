40|$|In Cambodia, the {{planting}} of rice lines with a competitive and/or allelopathic ability {{would be a}} very useful way to supplement weed management in the rain-fed, low-input production systems. The present study examines a wide range of rice germplasm, mainly from Cambodia, and uses a series of bioassay techniques to identify those that might have a weed growth-suppressing, allelopathic trait. A laboratory bioassay study that involved 359 rice lines showed that there were 15 that could significantly reduce the growth of awnless barnyard grass seedlings. In a second laboratory bioassay, involving the best 96 rice lines that were identified in the first study, 14 were shown to <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> shoot growth of awnless barnyard grass, 11 could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> shoot growth of barnyard grass, six could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> shoot growth of small umbrella sedge, four could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> shoot growth of two-leaf fimbristylis, four could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> shoot growth of water primrose, and three could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> shoot growth of gooseweed. Of the 13 rice lines that were able to <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> growth of at least two weed species, there were three lines that could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> growth of three weed species, one line that could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> growth of four weed species, and one line that could <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> growth of five weed species. In a third soil-based, pot bioassay that studied the 18 best lines coming from the second laboratory bioassay, all showed a significant weed growth-suppressive ability. A linear regression analysis showed that there was no correlation between their weed growth-suppressive ability and their physical seedling size, supporting the idea that the growth suppression was allelopathic in nature and not a physical competition effect. In summary, the results indicate that an allelopathic trait does exist in some Cambodian rice lines and that this trait is effective in the growth suppression of a number of major rice weeds...|$|R

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature.

5|$|After Caesar's {{preliminary}} low-scale {{invasions of}} Britain, the Romans invaded in force in 43 AD, forcing their way inland through several battles against British tribes, including the Battle of the Medway, the Battle of the Thames, the Battle of Caer Caradoc and the Battle of Mona. Following a general uprising {{in which the}} Britons sacked Colchester, St Albans and London, the Romans <b>suppressed</b> <b>the</b> rebellion in the Battle of Watling Street {{and went on to}} push as far north as central Scotland in the Battle of Mons Graupius.

5|$|Around 1350BC, the {{stability}} of the New Kingdom seemed threatened further when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity, <b>suppressed</b> <b>the</b> worship of most other deities, and attacked the power of the temple that had become dominated by the priests of Amun in Thebes, whom he saw as corrupt. Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to events in the Near East (where the Hittites, Mitanni, and Assyrians were vying for control). He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned, the priests of Amun soon regained power and returned the capital to Thebes. Under their influence the subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and possibly even Neferneferuaten/Nefertiti herself worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the Amarna Period.|$|E

Not without much hesitation and regret, she issued a decree which removed them from all the institutions of the monarchy, and carried it out thoroughly.
