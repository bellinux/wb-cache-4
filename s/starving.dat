40|$|Arterial [...] venous {{differences}} for metabolites across liver, kidney and hindquarters were measured in fed or <b>starved,</b> artificially ventilated chickens. The {{results indicate that}} the liver takes up amino acids under both conditions. Urate and glucose are released by the liver in both the fed and the <b>starved</b> state. Lactate and amino acids are extracted from blood by the kidneys, and this increases in the <b>starved</b> chicken. Urate is removed from the circulation by the kidney in the fed and <b>starved</b> state and excreted. In the fed bird there is no significant arteriovenous difference of glucose across the kidney, but in the <b>starved</b> state the kidney releases glucose into the circulation. The hindquarters take up glucose in the fed but not in the <b>starved</b> state. The branched-chain amino acids valine and leucine were taken up by the hindquarters in the fed, but not the <b>starved,</b> chicken. Glycerol is released by the hindquarter of fed and <b>starved</b> chickens. In the <b>starved</b> state, alanine and glutamine represent 57 % of the amino acids released by the hindquarter. Lactate is released by the hindquarter of <b>starved</b> chickens and represents the major gluconeogenic carbon source released by the hindquarter and taken up by kidney and liver. Although the liver is the major gluconeogenic organ in the <b>starved</b> chicken, the kidney accounts for approx. 30 % of the glucose produced...|$|R

5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the <b>starving</b> British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret.

5|$|For {{various reasons}} it was {{impossible}} to apply some of the terms of the Act. Less eligibility was in some cases impossible without <b>starving</b> paupers and the high cost of building workhouses incurred by rate payers meant that outdoor relief continued to be a popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more cost-effective method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to try to prevent people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E

5|$|One {{reason for}} the lack of sales, and for the poor {{condition}} of many surviving specimens, was that while the fair was open, the economic Panic of 1893 began, one of the worst depressions in the nation's history—fifty cents could make the difference between a family eating or <b>starving</b> {{at a time when the}} average visitor to the fair spent $1.18. Fairgoers were disinclined to exchange a dollar for a fifty-cent piece, and those who had bought Columbian half dollars before the crash often spent their souvenirs.|$|E
40|$|Polysomes were {{isolated}} from livers of rats fed various diets and were translated in a protein-synthesizing system derived from cultured Chang liver cells. One of the labeled products {{was identified as}} complete subunit(s) of fatty acid synthetase by indirect immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the solubilized immunoprecipitate. The relative amounts of fatty acid synthetase synthesized by polysomes from livers of rats fed a normal diet, <b>starved</b> rats, and rats <b>starved</b> and refed a fat-free diet for 16 hr were 1, 0. 1, and 10, respectively. Induction of synthesis of fatty acid synthetase after fat-free refeeding of <b>starved</b> rats began by 2 hr (3 -fold increase over <b>starved</b> animals), was increasing rapidly by 5 hr (19 -fold over <b>starved</b> animals), and reached a high level by 16 hr (95 -fold over <b>starved</b> and 10 -fold over normally fed) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} starvation on the course of Listeria monocytogenes infections in mice. Mice <b>starved</b> for 24, 48, or 72 h and then inoculated with a lethal dose of L. monocytogenes showed significantly less mortality than mice not <b>starved</b> (i. e., fed mice). The protective effect of 48 or 72 h of starvation began immediately after the starvation period and persisted for at least 48 h. <b>Starved,</b> infected mice had significantly fewer L. monocytogenes cells in their spleens 2, 3, and 4 days after infection than did fed mice. Neither changes in T-lymphocyte function nor serum factors appeared {{to be responsible for}} the protective effect. Delayed hypersensitivity responses to L. monocytogenes antigen were smaller in <b>starved</b> mice than in fed mice. Adoptive transfer of spleen cells from nonimmune <b>starved</b> mice did not protect against L. monocytogenes. Additional studies indicated that the serum of <b>starved</b> mice did not inhibit multiplication of L. monocytogenes in vitro, nor was it able to transfer protection against L. monocytogenes to normal mice. In contrast, peritoneal macrophages from <b>starved</b> mice inhibited deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis of P 815 tumor cells compared with macrophages from control mice. Therefore, the resistance of <b>starved</b> mice to L. monocytogenes is most likely due to nonspecific factors, one of which may be activation of macrophages...|$|R

The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed metamorphosis) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, <b>starving</b> many larvae.|$|E

Afterwards, Macrinus sent Domna's sister Julia Maesa and her children back to Emesa in Syria, from where Maesa set in motion her plans to have Macrinus overthrown.

50|$|With {{the growth}} of {{competitive}} sites, Walther struggled to keep the complex economically stable. In 1911, he sold the land to the Illinois State Parks Commission for $146,000. The Commission was initially headquartered at <b>Starved</b> Rock State Park after the land was acquired. The state initially acquired 898 acres and opened <b>Starved</b> Rock State Park as a public facility in 1912.During its early years, <b>Starved</b> Rock State Park was directly accessible only by railroad. Visitors had reached <b>Starved</b> Rock by rail and ferry since at least 1904, while the property was still a Walther-run resort.

5|$|Gulls {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} seen seabirds, given their use of human-made habitats (such as cities and dumps) and their often fearless nature. They therefore also have made it into the popular consciousness – they have been used metaphorically, as in Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach, or to denote a closeness to the sea, such as their use in The Lord of the Rings both in the insignia of Gondor and therefore Númenor (used in the design of the films), and to call Legolas to (and across) the sea. Other species have also made an impact; pelicans have long been associated with mercy and altruism because of an early Western Christian myth that they split open their breast to feed their <b>starving</b> chicks.|$|E
5|$|In 1640, {{masses of}} Chinese peasants who were <b>starving,</b> {{unable to pay}} their taxes, and no longer in fear of the {{frequently}} defeated Chinese army, began to form into huge bands of rebels.
