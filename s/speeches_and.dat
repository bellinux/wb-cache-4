40|$|<b>Speech</b> <b>and</b> {{language}} {{difficulties are}} a common reason for referral to child health services during the preschool years. A <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language problem {{in the early years}} may have significant implications for one‘s communication outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. However, there is considerable variation in what constitutes normal <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language acquisition. Many preschool children who are late to talk improve spontaneously, while some apparently typical young children may decline in their <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language performance in later years. The predictive power of an individual‘s speechlanguage ability for their later speech-language status improves with age. <b>Speech</b> <b>and</b> language problems at school-entry appear to be a stronger predicator for later communication issues than <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language problems in the preschool years. With the potential long-term impact of <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language problems, screening procedures for <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language problems in school-age children have been developed. This chapter addresses some of the difficulties in implementing population-wide screening for <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language problems in the early years and reviews some commonly used assessment tools for identifying school children with suspected <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language problems. Procedures for conducting language screening that are both beneficial to school-age children and cost-effective for society are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the motor profile of 125 children with developmental <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language disorders and to test for differences, if any, in motor profile among subgroups of children with developmental <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language disorders. METHODS. The participants were 125 children with developmental <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language disorders aged 6 to 9 years from 2 special schools for children with communication problems in the northern Netherlands. They were tested with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. The children were classified by the schools' <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language therapists into 3 subgroups on the basis of language tests, oral motor tests, and clinical examinations: children with speech disorders (n = 14), language disorders (n = 46), or both (n = 65). RESULTS. Compared with the norms of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, children with developmental <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language disorders performed significantly less well. Results showed that 51 % of the children with developmental <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language disorders had borderline or definite motor problems. Children with language disorders had significantly lower scores (ie, better performance) on the ball-skills subtest and the total test than children with <b>speech</b> disorders <b>and</b> children with both <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language disorders. Furthermore, children with language disorders had significantly better performance on the balance subtest than children with both <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language disorders. CONCLUSIONS. The findings of this study support the idea that developmental <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language disorders are frequently associated with motor problems and that the kind of developmental <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language disorders affects motor performance differently. <b>Speech</b> <b>and</b> language disorders seem to have more impact on motor performance than only language disorders, and it seems that when speech production is affected, motor problems are more pronounced. The findings support the need to give early and more attention to the motor skills of children with developmental <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> language disorders in the educational and home setting, with special attention to children whose speech is affected...|$|R
