Ciprofloxacin (750 mg per os) was administered every 12 h for nine doses in the multidose study and every 12 h for seven doses in the single dose protocol. Subjects were sixteen healthy, non-smoking young adult males. The oral clearance of theophylline at steady state, (CL/F) ss, decreased from a mean (+/- s. d.) value of 0. 035 (+/- 0. 008) 1 h- 1 kg- 1 to 0. 024 (+/- 0. 004) 1 h- 1 kg- 1 during ciprofloxacin treatment. Single sample estimates of theophylline clearance, CL/F, similarly decreased from 0. 040 (+/- 0. 014) 1 h- 1 kg- 1 to 0. 018 (+/- 0. 008) 1 h- 1 kg- 1. Mean theophylline clearances were significantly different when comparing control with ciprofloxacin treatment means (P less than 0. 01), but were not different when comparing single sample vs multiple sample clearances for a given treatment (i. e. control or ciprofloxacin).

40|$|Within-site {{variability}} in species detectability {{is a problem}} common to many biodiversity assessments and can strongly bias the results. Such variability {{can be caused by}} many factors, including simple counting inaccuracies, which can be solved by increasing sample size, or by temporal changes in species behavior, meaning that the way the temporal <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> is designed is also very important. Here we use the example of mist-netted tropical birds to determine how design decisions in the temporal <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> can alter the data collected and how these changes might affect the detection of ecological patterns, such as the species-area relationship (SAR). Using data from almost 3400 birds captured from 21, 000 net-hours at 31 sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we found that the magnitude of ecological trends remained fairly stable, but the probability of detecting statistically significant ecological patterns varied depending on sampling effort, time of day and season in which sampling was conducted. For example, more species were detected in the wet season, but the SAR was strongest in the dry season. We found that the temporal distribution of sampling effort was more important than its total amount, discovering that similar ecological results could have been obtained with one-third of the total effort, as long as each site had been equally sampled over 2 yr. We discuss that projects with the same sampling effort and spatial design, but with different temporal <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> are likely to report different ecological patterns, which may ultimately lead to inappropriate conservation strategies.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Economic {{survey data}} are often {{obtained}} from <b>sampling</b> <b>protocols</b> that involve stratification, censoring, or selection. Econometric estimators designed for random samples may be inconsistent or inefficient {{when applied to}} these samples. Several strands in the econometrics literature have investigated estimators appropriate to such data: seminal papers of Heckman (1974) on sample selection, and Manski and Lerman (1977) on choice-based sampling; further work on endogenous stratification by Hausman and Wise (1977), Manski and McFadden (1981), Cosslett (1981), and Hsieh, Manski, and McFadden (1984); and related work on switching regression by Goldfeld and Quandt (1973, 1975), Madalla and Nelson (1974), and Lee and Porter (1984).

It is recommended to conduct sampling efficiency studies prior to field sampling, under conditions that are quite similar to conditions of exposure regarding exposure process, levels of skin loading, and time of residence of the compound on the skin.
