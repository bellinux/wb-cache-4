500|$|A {{digitally}} restored {{version of}} Karnan {{was released on}} 16 March 2012, to commemorate the birth centenary of Panthulu. It is the first Tamil film to be fully digitally restored, costing [...] and consuming an effort of three years. The effort was undertaken by film distributor Shanthi Chokkalingam, who stated, [...] "The <b>sound</b> <b>negative</b> was totally gone and the five to six reels from the picture negative were damaged to a great extent". The digital restoration of Karnan took place at Sangeetha Sound Studios in Chennai, after a failed attempt with the Mumbai-based Famous Studios, who earlier restored the 1960 Hindi film Mughal-e-Azam. Visual improvements and audio restoration were excessively worked upon, with Shanthi stating that the [...] "biggest challenge was to restore the background score". DVDs were also used to get the sound and music in its original form. To create awareness about the restoration of Karnan, a teaser trailer was launched on 21 February 2012, which received a positive response.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of auditory-induced emotion on response inhibition. Fifty kinds of positive, neutral, and <b>negative</b> <b>sounds</b> were used as emotional materials whose presentation {{was followed by a}} Go/Nogo task. Event-related potentials were recorded for Go and Nogo tones. The response times for Go stimuli were longer under negative than under positive and neutral emotions. In addition, Go and Nogo stimuli elicited larger N 1 amplitudes during neutral than during emotional conditions. Moreover, Nogo-related N 2 was larger for neutral sounds than for positive and <b>negative</b> <b>sounds.</b> The Nogo-N 2, however, was not different between positive and <b>negative</b> <b>sounds.</b> Therefore, auditory-induced emotions significantly modulated the behavioral performance and the process of response conflict monitoring, a central component to the activity of response inhibition.

50|$|By early 1969, {{nearly all}} the Bosstown groups had either disbanded or {{disappeared}} from the public view {{as a consequence of}} media and youth culture backlash. Ultimate Spinach barely managed to chart at number 198 with their album Behold & See, which noticeably lacked the organ-driven instrumentals that were featured on their debut. Following Bruce-Douglas's departure from the band, Ultimate Spinach released one final, but directionless, album in 1969 with a completely reconstructed lineup. The Beacon Street Union's The Clown Died in Marvin Gardens was plagued by the <b>Sound's</b> <b>negative</b> stigma, and only reached number 175. Orpheus was among the few groups to remain active into the 1970s, and has since conducted reunions in the 1980s and, again, in the 2000s.|$|R

A conventional appendectomy is performed. Acute appendix diverticulitis is a rare entity and its finding is by casualty. It is important to consider it a differential diagnosis especially in the intraoperative treatment which in most cases does not differ from conventional appendectomy. ...|$|R

5|$|By 1955 the {{original}} <b>sound</b> <b>negatives</b> began to deteriorate, though a four-track copy had survived in good condition. Using the remaining Fantasound {{system at the}} studio, a three-track stereo copy was transferred across telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood. This copy was used when Fantasia was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in SuperScope, a derivative of the anamorphic widescreen CinemaScope format, on February 7, 1956. The projector featured an automatic control mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens, which allowed the picture to switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to the wide ratio of 2.35:1 in twenty seconds without {{a break in the}} film. This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels. Only selected parts of the animation were stretched, while all live action scenes remained unchanged. This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers, as the widescreen format led to the cropping and reframing of the images.|$|R
5000|$|Hudson blames {{this style}} of media coverage, at least partly, for trivialised elections: [...] "The bites of {{information}} voters receive from both print and electronic media are simply insufficient for constructive political discourse. ... candidates for office have adjusted their style of campaigning {{in response to this}} tabloid style of media coverage. ... modern campaigns are exercises in image manipulation. ... Elections decided on <b>sound</b> bites, <b>negative</b> campaign commercials, and sensationalised exposure of personal character flaws provide no meaningful direction for government".|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{organisational}} structure is characterised by {{the creation of}} temporary teams within a basic departmental structure to solve a particular difficult task, important for the organisation and limited by time. It can be stated on its grounds that team work {{is the basis of}} innovative organisation operation. However, fact that organisations most often use individuals and not the creation of a team specialised in the given issue in solving of new, important and demanding projects and tasks <b>sounds</b> <b>negative.</b> If organisations want to create so called innovative environment, it is necessary to focus on {{organisational structure}}, while it is necessary to realise that different organisational structures are appropriate for different types of organisations. Presumption which was the basis of our analysis of organisational structure flexibility was the fact that organisational flexibility results from its ability to respond to changing conditions and new situations. Therefore, we monitored the frequency of characteristics like adaptation of organisational structure to changing conditions and delegation of operational decisions to line managers. However, the research implied that only a smaller part of organisational structures of the analysed organisations fulfils this characteristics. Stanisław Borkowsk...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the open}} ocean, the {{thermocline}} {{is characterized by}} a <b>negative</b> <b>sound</b> speed gradient, making the thermocline important in submarine warfare because it can reflect active sonar and other acoustic signals.

50|$|Numan's {{previous}} three albums {{had been released}} on his own record label, Numa Records. However, the disappointing sales of those albums led to Numan closing down the label and signing to IRS Records. Most of the album had, in fact, been recorded before Numan signed with the record label. IRS therefore had little opportunity to make changes to the recorded material, but the label {{was still able to}} exert influence on the album's release. Numan wanted to call the album Cold Metal Rhythm after its song of the same name, but IRS believed that the shortened title <b>sounded</b> less <b>negative</b> and more commercial.|$|R

However, [...] "this led to a perverse reversal that lasted nearly to the impact: each time Bonin happened to lower the nose, rendering the angle of attack marginally less severe, the stall warning <b>sounded</b> again—a <b>negative</b> reinforcement that may have locked him into his pattern of pitching up" [...] which increased the angle of attack and thus prevented the plane from getting out of its stall.|$|R
40|$|Time perception, {{crucial for}} {{adaptive}} behavior, {{has been shown}} to be altered by emotion. An arousal-dependent mechanism is proposed to account for such an effect. Yet, physiological measure of arousal related with emotional timing is still lacking. We addressed this question using skin conductance response (SCR) in an emotion regulation paradigm. Nineteen participants estimated durations of neutral and <b>negative</b> <b>sounds</b> by comparing them to a previously memorized duration. Instructions were given to attend either to temporal or to emotional stimulus features. Attending to emotion with <b>negative</b> <b>sounds</b> generated longer subjective duration and greater physiological arousal than attending to time. However, a shared-attention condition showed discrepancy between behavioral and physiological results. Supporting the idea of a link between autonomic arousal and subjective duration, our results however suggest that this relation is not as direct as was expected. Results are discussed within recent model linking time perception, emotion and awareness...|$|R

40|$|Tinnitus is the {{experience}} of sounds without an appropriate external auditory source. These auditory sensations are intertwined with emotional and attentional processing. Drawing on theories of mental control, we predicted that suppressing an affectively <b>negative</b> <b>sound</b> mimicking the psychoacoustic features of tinnitus would result in decreased persistence in a mentally challenging task (mental arithmetic) that required participants to ignore the same sound, but that receiving a mindfulness exercise would reduce this effect. Normal hearing participants (N = 119) were instructed to suppress an affectively <b>negative</b> <b>sound</b> under cognitive load or were given no such instructions. Next, participants received either a mindfulness induction or an attention control task. Finally, all participants worked with mental arithmetic while exposed to the same sound. The length of time participants could persist in the second task served as the dependent variable. As hypothesized, results indicated that an auditory suppression rationale reduced time of persistence relative to no suc...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we aim at}} {{examining}} the myth of Narcissus {{in the work of}} the Chilean poet Humberto Diaz-Casanueva (1906 - 1992). We are interested in emphasizing the originality of his reinterpretation of the Greek myth. In our opinion, the peculiarity of this Narcissus is that he is not in love with his reflection in the mirror, but with the mirror itself. From our point of view, this means that the subject, before the empty mirror, recognizes his own death. This thesis, which may <b>sound</b> purely <b>negative,</b> should be understood in a positive fashion: the poet tries to think of a subjectivity that is not governed by the principle of identity...|$|R
