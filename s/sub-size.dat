The objective is to establish small size testing technology for the determination of fracture mechanical properties. The applicability of the evaluation procedure is verified on the ferritic-martensitic steel T 91. In this approach the fracture process is described by using a cohesive zone model (CZM). The CZM model needs two parameters to be identified on <b>sub-size</b> specimens. The geometry of <b>sub-size</b> three point bending specimen is 27 x 3 x 4 mm 3 with side grooves. To identify both parameters another experimental test on notched <b>sub-size</b> tensile specimens is required.

40|$|Zircaloy- 4 is a {{zirconium}} alloy {{that will be}} used for construction of many of the core components in the replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights. The fracture toughness of the alloy and its radiation-induced reduction over the 40 year planned life of the reactor is an important mechanical property for this application. This study aims to simulate the radiation-induced reduction in fracture toughness by hydriding Zircaloy- 4. A range of fracture toughnesses is required to calibrate the <b>sub-size</b> Charpy and small punch (SP) surveillance specimens that will be irradiated {{over the life of the}} reactor against standard J 1 C fracture toughness specimens. Pieces of Zircaloy- 4 plate were hydrided in a vessel at a temperature of 520 °C, at different pressures for either 10 or 22 hours. Final hydrogen concentrations between 25 wt% ppm and 380 wt % ppm hydrogen were obtained under gaseous atmosphere. The fracture toughness of the hydrided Zircaloy- 4 was assessed using <b>sub-size</b> 2. 5 mm-thick Charpy, three-point bend J 1 C and SP tests. The results were correlated to determine the relationship between the J-integral fracture toughness, Charpy impact energy and equivalent fracture strain (εqf) from the SP tests. It was found that as hydrogen concentration and hydride formation increased, the fracture toughness of the alloy generally decreased. The results show there to be a useful relationship between fracture toughness and εqf measured for the SP tests. 1...|$|E

The CIC conductor is a 48 -strand cable, each strand coated with 2 lm thick chromium. The first experiment determined the time constant for coupling currents between strands through AC loss measurements. The second experiment measured the stability margin of the model coil against short length disturbances. The final experiment recorded the "ramp rate limitation " due to a transport current ramp.

The load-displacement data obtained using SPT can be interpreted in terms of and correlated with uniaxial mechanical properties. In order to establish a correlation between SPT and tensile data, <b>sub-size</b> tensile and microhardness testing were performed on U-Mo alloys.

40|$|The cable-in-conduit {{conductors}} (CICC) for ITER magnets {{consist of}} more than thousand superconducting strands. Usually such cables exhibit a significant non-uniform current distribution between the strands due to inequality of strand impedances. This undesirable effect can complicate the measurement of the conductor critical transport properties, particularly for short samples. To improve the interpretation of measurement results, detailed knowledge of the current distribution is highly desired. We present a review of current unbalance measurements and current distribution reconstruction techniques in CICC as they were intensively performed during the last years. The experimental methods of current unbalance detection are described, starting with earlier attempts on <b>sub-size</b> CICCs and ending with more sophisticated methods on full-size conductors. The models of current identification developed by various research groups are briefly compared, emphasizing their similarities, differences and limitations. Finally, the results of current unbalance reconstructions performed by different groups on several full-size CICCs are discussed together with the implication of the results for ITER short sample conductor tests and coil performance...|$|E
40|$|With the {{numerical}} cable model JackPot {{it is possible}} to calculate the interstrand coupling losses, generated by a time-changing background and self-field, between all strands in a cable-in-conduit conductor (CICC). For this, the model uses a system of equations in which the mutual inductances between all strand segments are calculated in advance. The model works well for analysing <b>sub-size</b> CICC sections. However, the exponential relationship between the model size and the computation time make it unpractical to simulate full size ITER CICC sections. For this reason, the multi-level fast multipole method (MLFMM) is implemented to control the computation load. For additional efficiency, it is written in a code that runs on graphics processing units, thereby utilizing an efficient low-cost parallel computation technique. A good accuracy is obtained with a considerably fast computation of the mutually induced voltages between all strands. This allows parametric studies on the coupling loss of long lengths of ITER size CICCs with the purpose of optimizing the cable design and to accurately compute the coupling loss for any applied magnetic field scenari...|$|E

In order to evaluate the amount and distribution of defects around the notch, the specimens have been analysed by means of density measurements, according to Archimedes’s principle, and X-ray investigations. Through an optical microscope, the microstructural features, such as secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) and eutectic silicon particles, have been examined. A dedicated image-analysis software has been used for SDAS measurements. By means of optical and scanning electron microscopes, the fracture profile and surface of Charpy specimens have been investigated in order to identify the crack paths and to describe the characteristic morphological features of the fracture surface.

Apart from various types of novel techniques developed worldwide, the evaluation of mechanical properties from a miniature tensile test has a greater advantage as it is a direct method of measurement of mechanical properties. The paper also discusses various challenges in fabrication of miniature tensile test specimens, testing methodologies and acceptance of the test results. A comparison with the test results from conventional size specimen has been done for establishing the suitability of the miniature test specimen.

Therefore, the usability of some aggregate materials was investigated in the present paper. The properties of Los Angeles abrasion resistance, freezing-thaw resistance, slake durability strength and frost resistance of basalt and andesite samples obtained from Karaman and Ankara regions were studied at the first stage. In the second order, the grindability performance of these materials was also determined from the discontinuous grinding tests and the obtained results were correlated. Whereas the Los Angeles resistance of the basalt sample was higher than the andesite sample, the mass losses after the freezing-thaw and the frost tests for the andesite sample were superior. Both of the basalt and andesite samples were classified as ‘very high’ for their slake durability strength (Id- 2) values.

40|$|Lighter {{structural}} and energy absorbing materials {{are essential to}} increase fuel efficiency in transportation systems and have provided a motivation to investigate the use of new joining techniques based {{on the use of}} high strength and high tenacity adhesives. Current joining techniques, such as spot-welding, limit the possible weight reduction that can be achieved if lighter sections, dissimilar materials and/or novel geometries were to be used. Adhesive materials can address many limitations of current joining techniques. To take advantage of the available numerical codes for the simulation of bonded structures during dynamic crash events, a constitutive model for structural adhesive material using cohesive elements was assembled from the measured properties of two structural adhesives; DP- 460 NS and EC- 2214 (3 M, Canada). To verify that the proposed cohesive model accurately describes the behavior of the materials a two stage approach was used. First, a cohesive element formulation of the adhesive material was implemented to investigate a Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) (ASTM test D 3433 - 99). The results of the simulation were compared against available experimental data. Second, using <b>sub-size</b> crush tube structures assembled from steel sections that were adhesively bonded, quasi-static and impact events were performed. The results from the experiment were compared against the numerical simulation of the same structure using cohesive elements to describe the adhesive joint. Later, Tie-Breaks were implemented to reduce computational times. Both types of elements successfully represented the adhesive joint and the numerical model of the crush tube was in good agreement with the overall load-displacement behavior of the experimental crush tubes. The use and testing of <b>sub-size</b> structures not only permitted the validation of the numerical models; it also investigated the feasibility of adhesive-only joints in automotive structures that may be exposed to crash scenarios. Sub-sized tubes were used due to equipment capacity limits, but an analysis was undertaken to demonstrate appropriate structural scaling. Even though the results between the experiments and the simulations were in very good agreement, it is clear that current cohesive material models and Tie-Breaks cannot incorporate strain rate effects, which may be important under dynamic impact conditions. Although testing in the literature has reported that the mechanical properties of the bond are affected by the properties of the joined materials as well as the geometry of the joint, these effects in the case of crush tube structures seem perhaps negligible in view of the simulation results...|$|E
40|$|A Nb 3 Sn strand {{inside a}} superconducting cable behaves like a beam loaded by Lorentz forces and {{supported}} by strand-to-strand contacts. Due to the strand material heterogeneity and the complex cable layout the strain field developed {{is not easy to}} be studied. In this work we present a hierarchical beam model to analyse a superconducting cable level by level. The basic idea is to perform a recursive substitution of discrete models involving many beams with a single, continuous beam model, which behaviour can be deduced from the preceding cabling stages. The theory of asymptotic homogenisation is here suitably extended for the analysis of the SC fibrous composite with non-linear, temperature dependent components. We account also for local material yielding at the stage of microanalysis. The transformation strains due to cool down from the reaction temperature to the cable operating conditions are computed, as well as the following distribution of strain due to energisation. To recover the strain inside each single strand and in the filaments, a suitable unsmearing technique is applied.

The R/sub c/ and AC loss were measured on the conductors being in the "virgin" state and after they have been loaded 40, 000 times with a peak force of 315 kN/m. The test results are compared with those, obtained on sections from the same conductor lengths, in the SULTAN test facility. The consequences of the cyclic loading and the sub-cable wraps on the R/sub c/ and the coupling AC loss are discussed in view of the previously published results on full- and <b>sub-size</b> ITER NbTi CICCs. Special emphasis was paid to the measurements of the contact resistances between individual sub-cables and the conduit, since the knowledge of them is important for proper interpretation of the DC test results.

Electric discharge machining (EDM) techniques for cutting tensile and fracture toughness samples from the tritium-exposed regions of returned reservoirs were demonstrated. An existing electric discharge machine was used to cut <b>sub-size</b> tensile and fracture toughness samples from the inside walls of reservoir mock-ups. Tensile properties from the EDM tensile samples were similar to those measured using full-size samples cut from similar stock. Although the existing equipment could not be used for machining tritium-exposed hardware, off-the-shelf EDM units are available that could. With the right equipment and the required radiological controls in place, similar machining and testing techniques could be used to directly measure the effects of tritium on the properties of material cut from reservoir returns. Stress-strain property data from tritium-exposed reservoirs would improve finite-element modeling of reservoir performance because the data are representative of the true state of the reservoir material in the field.

40|$|The cable-in-conduit superconductors for the ITER coils have {{operating}} current {{in excess of}} 40 kA and function under last ramp conditions and fields up to 13 T. The transverse Lorentz force acting on strands may reduce the effective contact resistance between strands in the cable and as a consequence, the coupling loss will increase. This influence is investigated with a <b>sub-size</b> jacketed cable having 81 Cr-coated Nb 3 Sn strands. The AC loss is measured with a sinusoidal and trapezoidal magnetic field superimposed to a stationary background field of 1 or 2 T while the cable carries a constant transport current up to about 30 kA. The AC loss is determined by a pick-up coil system and partly with a calorimeter for calibration purposes. The nτ at 0 current declines after cyclic loading, from 9 ms in the virgin state to 2 ms after several loads. The increase of the interstrand coupling loss due to Lorentz effects, accompanied by resistance-hysteresis and relaxation effects as observed in the loss are discussed.

Both experimental and numerical works are carried out to solve the current dilemma. Based on the investigation outcomes, recommendations on the improvement of current pipeline fracture control approaches are made to ensure a safe operation of the small diameter gas pipelines. The findings demonstrate that the Charpy test is no longer suitable for transition temperature prediction, especially in small-diameter, thin-walled pipes, where various <b>sub-size</b> Charpy specimens could create more uncertainties. DWTT is essential for predicting the transition temperatures of small-diameter line pipes. Flattened DWTT specimens with reinforcement plates successfully minimise buckling and deliver more accurate transition temperature predictions compared {{to the results of}} full-scale tests.

These include plain pipes, pipe bends, branched pipes etc., the manufacture of such components may also require welds to be inserted in them.

Also, the proportion of life consumed will vary from position to position within a component and the plant. Hence, nondestructive techniques are adopted to assist in making decisions on whether to repair, continue operating or scrap certain components. One such approach is to use scoop samples removed from the components to make small creep test specimens, i. e., <b>sub-size</b> uniaxial creep test specimens, impression creep test specimens, small punch creep test specimens, and small ring (circular or elliptical) creep test specimens.

The wheels show different geometry and thermal treatment. In this paper, the effects of microstructure and defects on the impact properties are studied. The results indicate that the impact energy is lower in as-cast wheel than in T 6 heat-treated wheels. A finer microstructure always corresponds to higher {{impact strength}}, while a direct correlation between the resistance to crack propagation values and secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) exists. Casting defects, revealed by means of X-ray and density measurements techniques, become critical when concentrated around the V-notch, where they reduce the load bearing area of Charpy specimens. The fracture profile and surface of Charpy specimens have been investigated revealing how the crack crosses the interdendritic eutectic region where a significant fraction of cracked eutectic silicon and intermetallic particles is found. Numerical simulations have been performed to study the filling and solidification behaviour of the alloy of the wheels analysed, in order to predict the final microstructure and shrinkage formation. Solidification times, estimated by means of SDAS measurements and calculated with a numerical simulation approach, showa good correspondence.

In hypoeutectic Al-Si alloys, microstructure and defects play a significant rule in the definition of this property. On the other side, instrumented Charpy impact energy tests give the opportunity to investigate crack nucleation and growth mechanisms. Plotting the force between the impact hammer and the specimen over the displacement, a useful evaluation of the material’s behavior can be done. Processing conditions (alloy modification level, die temperatures, furnace pressurization steep slope, cooling conditions, wheel geometry) influence microstructural features of Al-Si alloys such as: secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) and eutectic silicon. Instrumented impact tests have been performed on three different A 356 17 -inch wheels, in order to evaluate variability in impact toughness due to thickness, type of wheel and processing conditions.

Its presence overcomes the effect of microstructure itself. Radioscopic investigation has been performed on KV samples, in order to evaluate the effect of porosity.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{tests on}} the Model Coils {{have shown that the}} behavior of Nb 3 Sn based cables is not as good as expected {{on the basis of the}} characteristics evaluated for the uncabled strands. This degradation of the cable performance seems to be due to various factors, among which the strain state of the filaments due to bending and contact phenomena inside the cable. After these results it was decided that high performance strands will be used for ITER magnets, even if they have never been tested on a full size cable. Therefore the capability of evaluating the coil performance from the strands characteristics becomes a crucial point in the Research and Development (R&D) activity. Recently some extrapolations were attempted, but the mechanical model used is rather simplified and needs some fitting parameters which are not known a priori. In this work we present a thermo-mechanical model suitably developed to evaluate the strain state of a Nb 3 Sn strand inside a superconducting (SC) cable. It is based on the idea of multiscale modeling, starting from a enriched formulation of the beam kinematics to take into account the fibrous nature of a multifilamentary strand. The method consists in performing a successive substitution of discrete models involving many beams with a single equivalent beam model, which behavior is identified from the preceding cabling stage. This recursive substitution allows to perform the analysis within a reasonable computational time. Once the stress and strain fields are obtained at the higher level, a suitable unsmearing technique gives the strain till the first level, on the scale of the SC filament. The method is applied to the real case of the 3 3 and 3 3 5 CICC <b>sub-size</b> samples tested at FZK in Germany...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} two years (2001 - 2002) of this project, the primary effort was focused on {{evaluating}} the effect of hydrogen on the cracking behavior of candidate target materials namely, Alloys EP- 823, HT- 9 and 422 in aqueous environments of different pH values at ambient and elevated temperatures. More recently, emphasis is being placed to evaluate the cracking behavior of these materials in molten lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) environment at much higher testing temperatures so as to compare the cracking susceptibility in environments containing molten metals and aqueous solutions, respectively. The most recent tests to evaluate the cracking susceptibility were primarily based on two state-of-the-art techniques known as constant-load and slow-strain rate (SSR) methods. Simultaneously, efforts were made to determine the localized corrosion (pitting and crevice corrosion) behavior in similar aqueous environments at ambient and elevated temperatures using electrochemical polarization techniques. However, these techniques cannot be applied to LBE environment. Therefore, the work scope described in the original proposal is being modified to include additional testing methods to suit the high-temperature LBE environment. Although, testing still will be continued to complete the original matrix involving all three alloys in aqueous environments using constant-load, SSR, and polarization techniques, future testing will be performed in both aqueous and LBE environments using self-loaded specimens such as C-Ring and U-Bend stress-corrosion-cracking (SCC) test specimens. In addition to this corrosion testing, significant efforts will be made to evaluate the crack-growth behavior of radiation hardened target materials using <b>sub-size</b> compact tension (CT) specimens. The test materials will undergo appropriate thermal treatments prior to their testing. All tested specimens will be examined metallographically. Further, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) will be used to determine the extent and nature of cracking in the tested specimens. The thrust of this overall testing program is to evaluate the environmental and radiation effects on the cracking behavior of candidate target materials for applications in spallation-neutron-target (SNT) systems...|$|E
40|$|After {{the last}} year’s {{decision}} about the construction site, ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) experimental reactor has entered its realization phase. During {{the last decade}} an extensive Research and Development (R&D) program has been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of its magnet system. The major elements of this program have been the construction and test of real scale coils (the Central Solenoid Model Coil CSMC and the Toroidal Field Model Coil TFMC) as well as solenoid prototypes (the various Insert Coils). The testing of the model coils has provided valuable information to finalize {{the design of the}} magnetic system. However the behavior of Nb 3 Sn based cables was not as good as expected {{on the basis of the}} characteristics evaluated for the uncabled strands. This degradation in Nb 3 Sn performance seems to be due to various factors, among which the strain state of the filaments. It is worth to mention that Nb 3 Sn critical current depends upon the strain state, in addition to the applied magnetic field and temperature. A Nb 3 Sn strand inside a superconducting cable behaves like a beam loaded by Lorentz forces and supported by strand-to-strand contacts. Due to the strand material heterogeneity and the complex cable layout the strain field developed is not easy to study. In this work we present a hierarchical beam model to analyse a superconducting cable level by level. The basic idea is to perform a recursive substitution of discrete models involving many beams with a single, continuous beam model, which behaviour can be deduced from the preceding cabling stage. The theory of asymptotic homogenisation is here suitably extended for the analysis of the SC fibrous composite with non-linear, temperature dependent components. We account also for local material yielding at the stage of microanalysis. The transformation strains due to cool down from the reaction temperature to the cable operating conditions are computed, as well as the following distribution of strain due to energisation. To recover the strain inside each single strand and in the filaments, a suitable unsmearing technique is applied. The method is applied to the real case of the 3 x 3 and 3 x 3 x 5 CICC <b>sub-size</b> samples tested at FZK in Germany...|$|E
40|$|VOCALIST (validation of constraint-based {{methodology}} in structural integrity) was {{a shared}} cost action project co-financed by DG Research of the European Commission under the Fifth Framework of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). The motivation for VOCALIST {{was based on}} the understanding that the pattern of crack-tip stresses and strains causing plastic flow and fracture in components is different to that in test specimens. This gives rise to the so-called constraint effect. Crack-tip constraint in components is generally lower than in test specimens. Effective toughness is correspondingly higher. The fracture toughness measured on test specimens is thus likely to underestimate that exhibited by cracks in components. The purpose of VOCALIST was to develop validated models of the constraint effect and associated best practice advice, with the objective of aiding improvements in defect assessment methodology for predicting safety margins and making component lifetime management decisions. The main focus in VOCALIST was an assessment of constraint effects on the cleavage fracture toughness of ferritic steels used in the fabrication of nuclear reactor pressure vessels, because of relevance to the development of improved safety assessments for plant under postulated accident conditions. This paper provides a detailed summary of the main results and conclusions from VOCALIST and points out their contribution to advances in constraint-based methodology for structural integrity assessment. In particular, the output from VOCALIST has improved confidence in the use of KJ − Tstress and KJ − Q approaches to assessments of cleavage fracture where the effects of in-plane constraint are dominant. Cleavage fracture models based on the Weibull stress, W, {{have been shown to be}} reliable, although current best practice advice suggests that W should be computed in terms of hydrostatic stress (as distinct from maximum principal stress) for problems involving out-of-plane loading. Correspondingly, the results suggest that the hydrostatic parameter, QH, is the appropriate one with which to characterize crack-tip constraint in analysing such problems. The materials characterization test results generated as part of VOCALIST have provided added confidence in the use of <b>sub-size</b> specimens to determine the Master Curve reference temperature, T 0, for as-received and degraded ferritic RPV materials. The usefulness of correlating the Master Curve reference temperature, T 0, with the constraint parameter, Q, has been demonstrated; however, the trend curves derived require further development and validation before they can be used in fracture analyses. The output from VOCALIST has contributed in providing the validation of methodology necessary to underpin the diffusion of constraint-based fracture mechanics arguments in RPV safety cases, with potential applications including WWER as well asWestern-style LWR reactor types.

It is worth to mention that Nb 3 Sn critical current depends upon the strain state, in addition to the applied magnetic field and temperature. For electrical and thermal stability in a superconducting (SC) strand the Nb 3 Sn compound is distributed into fine filaments (up to about 50 micrometers diameter) and embedded in a resistive matrix. Nb 3 Sn formation requires a solid state diffusion reaction at high temperature (900 - 950 K), which causes transformation strains in each material during cool down to operating condition (4. 2 K). Moreover, the thermal strain is only part of the strain field, because of the complex layout of the wires inside the cable causes an additional strain. Finally, when the coil is energized, electromagnetic forces act as bending loads on the wires, which behave like continuous beams supported by the contacting wires in their neighbourhood. In this way a bending strain is added to the existing strain field. An accurate estimate of the strain state of the strand inside a coil experiencing magnetic loads is clearly not an easy task, a wide spectrum of coupled physical problems have to be considered for the prediction of Nb 3 Sn conductor performances. In this work we present a thermo-mechanical model based on homogenisation methods, suitably developed for the analysis of the SC fibrous composite with non-linear, temperature dependent components. We account also for local material yielding at the stage of microanalysis.
