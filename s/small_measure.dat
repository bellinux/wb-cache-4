As the weeks progressed and as public discontent mounting on inaction in the match-fixing scandal and in no <b>small</b> <b>measure</b> the pressure from the then Union Sport Minister Shukdev Singh Dhindsa, Kapil Dev resigned from his position of Indian Cricket Coach on 12 September 2000 vowing farewell to the game of cricket.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{acting on}} these {{feelings}} and perceptions, Stanton joined Mott, Mott's sister Martha Coffin Wright, Jane Hunt {{and a handful}} of other women in Seneca Falls. Together they organized the Seneca Falls Convention held in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20. Over 300 people attended. Stanton drafted a Declaration of Sentiments, which she read at the convention. Modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence, Stanton's declaration proclaimed that men and women are created equal. She proposed, among other things, a then-controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women. The final resolutions, including female suffrage, were passed, in no <b>small</b> <b>measure,</b> because of the support of Frederick Douglass, who attended and informally spoke at the convention.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>small</b> <b>measure</b> of {{stability}} again returned at this point, with the empire split into a Tetrarchy of two greater and two lesser emperors, {{a system that}} staved off civil wars {{for a short time}} until 312 AD. In that year, relations between the tetrarchy collapsed for good and Constantine I, Licinius, Maxentius and Maximinus jostled for control of the empire. In the Battle of Turin Constantine defeated Maxentius, and in the Battle of Tzirallum, Licinius defeated Maximinus. From 314 AD onwards, Constantine defeated Licinius in the Battle of Cibalae, then the Battle of Mardia, and then again at the Battle of Adrianople, the Battle of the Hellespont and the Battle of Chrysopolis.|$|E

5|$|Goldfaden {{was both}} a {{theoretician}} and a practitioner of theater. That {{he was in no}} <b>small</b> <b>measure</b> a theoretician – for example, he was interested almost from the start in having set design seriously support the themes of his plays – relates to a key property of Yiddish theater {{at the time of its}} birth: in general, writes Bercovici, theory ran ahead of practice. Much of the Jewish community, Goldfaden included, were already familiar with contemporary theater in other languages. The initial itinerary of Goldfaden's company – Iaşi, Botoşani, Galaţi, Brăila, Bucharest – could as easily have been the itinerary of a Romanian-language troupe. Yiddish theater may have been seen from the outset as an expression of a Jewish national character, but the theatrical values of Goldfaden's company were in many ways those of a good Romanian theater of the time. Also, Yiddish was a German dialect which became a well-known language even among non-Jews in Moldavia (and Transylvania), an important language of commerce; the fact that one of the first to write about Yiddish theater was Romania's national poet, Mihai Eminescu, is testimony that interest in Yiddish theater went beyond the Jewish community.|$|E
5|$|The founders' {{hopes that}} their college would produce {{prominent}} Welsh clergy were fulfilled in no <b>small</b> <b>measure</b> when a former student, A. G. Edwards, was elected the first Archbishop of Wales when the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. Two later Archbishops of Wales, Glyn Simon (Archbishop from 1968 to 1971) and Gwilym Owen Williams (Archbishop 1971–1982) were also educated at the college. Celticists {{associated with the}} college include Sir John Rhys, Sir John Morris-Jones, and Sir Thomas (T. H.) Parry-Williams, whilst the list of historians includes the college's first graduate, David Powel, who published the first printed history of Wales in 1584, and the Victorian historian J. R. Green. Angus Buchanan won the Victoria Cross during the First World War. Record-breaking quadriplegic solo sailor Hilary Lister was also a student here, whilst {{from the field of}} arts and entertainment there are names such as Magnus Magnusson, presenter of Mastermind, the National Poet of Wales Gwyn Thomas, and television weather presenters Kirsty McCabe and Siân Lloyd. Nigel Hitchin, the Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford since 1997, studied at the college, as did Edward Hinds (a physicist who won the Rumford Medal in 2008), Chris Rapley (director of the Science Museum), and the zoologists Edward Bagnall Poulton and James Brontë Gatenby.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} exponent of avant-garde art, Cocteau {{had great}} {{influence on the}} work of others, including a group of composers known as Les six.

25|$|The heat {{drawn from}} ground-sourced systems is {{in most cases}} stored solar heat, and {{it should not be}} {{confused}} with direct geothermal heating, though the latter will contribute in some <b>small</b> <b>measure</b> to all heat in the ground. True geothermal heat, when used for heating, requires a circulation pump but no heat pump, since for this technology the ground temperature is higher than that of the space that is to be heated, so the technology relies only upon simple heat convection.|$|E

25|$|Hurling {{was said}} to be played in ancient times by teams {{representing}} neighbouring villages. Villages would play games involving hundreds of players, which would last several hours or even days. Injuries were rife in the early form of the game, but this changed dramatically in the mid 1800s with the introduction of the ball, which was due in no <b>small</b> <b>measure</b> to the tireless lobbying of Sir William Arthur Clement, and led soon after to the flattening of the hurley stick, and removal of the notorious 'Claddagh' spikes.|$|E
25|$|Of the 60 man {{detachment}} {{involved in}} Operation Hasty, only two officers and 25 men successfully returned to Allied lines. Little physical or material damage was caused to the Germans, but a <b>small</b> <b>measure</b> of success was {{the diversion of}} a brigade to hunt down 60 men {{and the loss of}} a division, retained behind the front line during the mission. The Germans succeeded in withdrawing to the Gothic line, and held the Allies there until mid September when following the Battle of Rimini, the city was captured.|$|E
25|$|The {{wheels and}} basket of the chariot were usually of wood, {{strengthened}} in places with bronze or iron. They had {{from four to}} eight spokes and tires of bronze or iron. Due to the widely spaced spokes, {{the rim of the}} chariot wheel was held in tension over comparatively large spans. Whilst this provided a <b>small</b> <b>measure</b> of shock absorption, it also necessitated the removal of the wheels when the chariot was not in use, to prevent warping from continued weight bearing. Most other nations of this time had chariots of similar design to the Greeks, the chief differences being the mountings.|$|E

25|$|During World War II Hay was the {{location}} of internment and prisoner of war camps, due in no <b>small</b> <b>measure</b> to its isolated location. Three high-security camps were constructed there in 1940. The first arrivals were over two thousand refugees from Nazi Germany and Austria, many of them Jewish, aged between 16 and 60. They had been rounded up in Britain when fears of invasion were at their peak, and were then transported to Australia aboard the HMT Dunera. They arrived at Hay on 7 September 1940 in four trains from Sydney and were interned in Camps 7 and 8 (located near the Hay showground) under the guard of the 16th Garrison Battalion of the Australian Army.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{favorable}} laws, promising institutional arrangements, {{and external}} funding, {{the government has}} not, on the whole, been effective in controlling damage to the environment. This failure is only in <b>small</b> <b>measure</b> because of the opposition of anti-environmental groups. In greater part, it {{can be attributed to}} the traditional separation between official rhetoric and actual practice in Brazil. It is also related to general problems of governance, fiscal crisis, and lingering doubts about appropriate tradeoffs between the environment and development. Some of the most effective governmental action in the environmental area has occurred at the state and local levels in the most developed states and has involved NGOs. In 1994 the PNMA began to stress decentralization and strengthening of state environmental agencies, a tendency that subsequently gained momentum.|$|E
