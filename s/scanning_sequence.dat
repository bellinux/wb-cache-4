In this work, we present a novel approach that uses a C-arm angiography system capable of CT-like imaging (C-arm CT) for this purpose. With C-arm CT one reconstructed volume can be obtained every 4 – 6 s which makes it challenging to measure the flow of an injected contrast bolus. We have developed an interleaved scanning (IS) protocol that uses several <b>scan</b> <b>sequences</b> to increase temporal sampling. Using a dedicated 4 -D reconstruction approach based on partial reconstruction interpolation (PRI) we can optimally process our data. We evaluated our combined approach (IS-PRI) with simu-lations and a study in 5 healthy pigs. In our simulations, the cerebral blood flow values (unit: ml/ 100 g/min) were 60 (healthy tissue) and 20 (pathological tissue). For one <b>scan</b> <b>sequence</b> the values were estimated with standard deviations of 14. 3 and 2. 9, respectively.

40|$|According to the LATER model (linear {{approach}} to thresholds with ergodic rate), the latency {{of a single}} saccade in response to target appearance {{can be understood as}} a decision process, which is subject to (i) variations in the rate of (visual) information processing; and (ii) the threshold for the decision. We tested whether the LATER model can also be applied to the sequences of saccades in a multiple fixation search, during which latencies of second and subsequent saccades are typically shorter than that of the initial saccade. We found that the distributions of the reciprocal latencies for later saccades, unlike those of the first saccade, are highly asymmetrical, much like a gamma distribution. This suggests that the normal distribution of the rate r, which the LATER model assumes, is not appropriate to describe the rate distributions of subsequent saccades in a <b>scanning</b> <b>sequence.</b> By contrast, the gamma distribution is also appropriate to describe the distribution of reciprocal latencies for the first saccade.

Firstly, the algorithm transformed a source file into a binary watermark sequence and put redundant encoding and random scrambling on it. Then, the algorithm selected two neighboring blocks each time from the Hilbert <b>scanning</b> <b>sequence</b> of the host image blocks, and transformed them by DWT.

This can also potentially increase the image quality by reducing the motion artefacts and contrast washout.

Compressive Sensing (CS) theory has been perfectly matched to the MRI <b>scanning</b> <b>sequence</b> design with much less required raw data for the image reconstruction.

A filmless radiometric technique utilizing the basic radiation principle of Compton scattering, which will detect cavities in the explosive filler with minimal interference from the steel casing, has been identified and tested. By scanning the shell with a beam of radiation and observing the Compton scattering through a unique collimating system, it has been possible to detect voids as small as 1 / 16 inch in cross section.

40|$|AbstractEchoplanar MRI is {{associated}} with significant acoustic noise, which can interfere with the presentation of auditory stimuli, create a more challenging listening environment, and increase discomfort felt by participants. Here we investigate a <b>scanning</b> <b>sequence</b> that significantly reduces the amplitude of acoustic noise associated with echoplanar imaging (EPI). This is accomplished using a constant phase encoding gradient and a sinusoidal readout echo train to produce a narrow-band acoustic frequency spectrum, which is adapted to the scanner's frequency response function by choosing an optimum gradient switching frequency. To evaluate {{the effect of these}} nonstandard parameters we conducted a speech experiment comparing four different EPI sequences: Quiet, Sparse, Standard, and Matched Standard (using the same readout duration as Quiet). For each sequence participants listened to sentences and signal-correlated noise (SCN), which provides an unintelligible amplitude-matched control condition. We used BOLD sensitivity maps to quantify sensitivity loss caused by the longer EPI readout duration used in the Quiet and Matched Standard EPI sequences. We found that the Quiet sequence provided more robust activation for SCN in primary auditory areas and comparable activation in frontal and temporal regions for Sentences>SCN, but less sentence-related activity in inferotemporal cortex. The increased listening effort associated with the louder Standard sequence relative to the Quiet sequence resulted in increased activation in the left temporal and inferior parietal cortices. Together, these results suggest that the Quiet sequence is suitable, and perhaps preferable, for many auditory studies. However, its applicability depends on the specific brain regions of interest...|$|E

The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate experimentally and theoretically the effects of a new scanning pattern with the aim of improving the dimensional and geometrical performance of Stereolithography against a benchmarked industry standard scanning pattern. The development of the new Bisector scanning patterns is based on the hypothesis that a contour-oriented <b>scanning</b> <b>sequence</b> with more built-in relaxation could provide a more uniform distribution of residual stress caused by the intrinsic phase transformation due to the photopolymerization process. Experiments on a variety of geometries showed that the new scanning pattern offers substantial improvements in terms of dimensional accuracy, part flatness, surface profile and the system running cost. This further insight into the effects of the scanning patterns was gained through the use of Finite Element (FE) modelling. A commercial FE package ABAQUS was employed to develop thermo-mechanical analogous models to ~nalyse and compare the stresses, strains and distortion induced by each pattern. For the Bisector scanning pattern, the scanning direction and length of scanning vectors are more symmetrical distributed in X and Y axes and hence the distortion or curl occurs in both axes and is comparatively less than that observed for the STAR-WEAVE scanning pattern. If the same overall shrinkage is distributed in both axes then the net distortion must be reduced. The modelling results are consistent with the experimental results of this research, in that the amount of distortion on Bisector scanning patterns is less than the STAR-WEAVE scanning pattern.

40|$|CONTEXT: The {{orbitofrontal cortex}} (OFC) -striatal circuit, which is {{important}} for motivational behavior, {{is assumed to be}} involved in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) according to current neurobiological models of this disorder. However, the engagement of this neural loop in OCD has not been tested directly in a cognitive activation imaging paradigm so far. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the OFC and the ventral striatum show abnormal neural activity in OCD during cognitive challenge. DESIGN: A reversal learning task was employed in 20 patients with OCD who were not receiving medication and 27 healthy controls during an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment using a <b>scanning</b> <b>sequence</b> sensitive to OFC signal. This design allowed investigation of the neural correlates of reward and punishment receipt as well as of "affective switching," ie, altering behavior on reversing reinforcement contingencies. RESULTS: Patients with OCD exhibited an impaired task end result reflected by a reduced number of correct responses relative to control subjects but showed adequate behavior on receipt of punishment and with regard to affective switching. On reward outcome, patients showed decreased responsiveness in right medial and lateral OFC as well as in the right caudate nucleus (border zone ventral striatum) when compared with controls. During affective switching, patients recruited the left posterior OFC, bilateral insular cortex, bilateral dorsolateral, and bilateral anterior prefrontal cortex to a lesser extent than control subjects. No areas were found for which patients exhibited increased activity relative to controls, and no differential activations were observed for punishment in a direct group comparison. CONCLUSIONS: These data show behavioral impairments accompanied by aberrant OFC-striatal and dorsal prefrontal activity in OCD on a reversal learning task that addresses this circuit's function. These findings not only confirm previous reports of dorsal prefrontal dysfunction in OCD but also provide evidence for the involvement of the OFC-striatal loop in the pathophysiology of OC...|$|E

40|$|Magnetic {{particle}} imaging (MPI) {{is a novel}} {{medical imaging}} modality that spatially detects a tracer of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) with high sensitivity, contrast, and no tissue penetration limitations. MPI has great potential for safer angiography, in vivo cell tracking, and cancer detection, among other applications. Current MPI theoretical descriptions and reconstruction techniques make an adiabatic assumption that the SPIO tracer instantaneously follows the applied magnetic fields of the MPI scanner. This assumption is not strictly true, and we refer to SPIO magnetization delays as relaxation effects. We begin by extending the x-space theory of MPI to include relaxation effects. We choose this MPI theory because it directly converts the temporal MPI signal to the image (spatial) domain, lending itself well to investigating how relaxation time delays translate into spatial effects. Using the non-adiabatic x-space theory and experimentally-measured data, we demonstrate that relaxation blurs the x-space image in the scanning direction. Next, we study how we may design MPI scanning sequences to minimize relaxation-induced blurring. From the non-adiabatic x-space theory we derive a mathematical description of how this blur can vary with scanning parameters for a given relaxation time. We compare theoretical predictions to experimental data by measuring relaxation times and spatial resolution under various scanning conditions. Despite increased relaxation time delays with slower scanning conditions, we observe that relaxation-induced blurring can be minimized when scanning slower. Finally, we derive a magnetic field-driven relaxation mechanism called magneto-viscous relaxation. This mechanism describes how the applied magnetic field creates a magnetic torque on the SPIO, inducing physical rotation of the SPIO to align with the field; however viscous resistance of the carrier liquid hinders this movement. We compare predicted relaxation times to measured values {{for a range of}} SPIO characteristics and scanning conditions. In this dissertation, we show how relaxation can have deleterious effects on the MPI signal and image. We explore how relaxation-induced blurring and relaxation times may be minimized through improved SPIO characteristics and MPI <b>scanning</b> <b>sequence</b> design. In addition to improving MPI image quality, this important area of research can lead to future clinical applications. Using this knowledge and specially-designed MPI pulse sequences, we can exploit variations in relaxation behavior as a source of contrast, which will increase the diagnostic potential of MPI...|$|E
40|$|Limb {{measurements}} {{provided by}} the Scanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) on the ENVISAT satellite allow retrieving stratospheric profiles of various trace gases on a global scale. Combining measurements of the same air volume from different viewing positions along the orbit, a tomographic approach can be applied and 2 -D distribution fields of stratospheric trace gases can be acquired in one inversion. With this approach, {{it is possible to}} improve the accounting for the effect of horizontal gradients in the trace gas distribution on the profile retrieval. This was shown in a previous study for the retrieval of NO 2 and OClO profiles in the Arctic region near the polar vortex boundary. In this study, the tomographic retrieval is applied on measurements during special limb-only orbits performed on 14 December 2008. For these orbits the distance between consecutive limb scanning sequences was reduced to ~ 3. 3 ° of the orbital circle (i. e. more than two times with respect to the nominal operational mode). Thus, the same air volumes are scanned successively by more than one <b>scanning</b> <b>sequence</b> also for midlatitudes and the tropics. It is found that the profiles obtained by the tomographic 2 -D approach show significant differences to those obtained by the 1 -D approach. In particular, for regions close to stratospheric transport barriers (i. e. near {{to the edge of the}} polar vortex and subtropical transport barrier) up to 50 % larger or smaller NO 2 number densities (depending on the sign of the gradient along the line of sight) for altitudes below the peak of the profile (around 20 km) are obtained. The limb-only measurements allow examining the systematic error if the horizontal gradient is not accounted for, and studying the impact of the gradient strength on the profile retrieval on a global scale. The findings for the actual SCIAMACHY observations are verified by sensitivity studies for simulated data for which the NO 2 distributions to be retrieved are known in advance. In addition, the impact of the horizontal distance between consecutive limb scanning sequences on the quality of the tomographic 2 -D retrieval is investigated and a possibility to take into account the horizontal gradients by an interpolation approach is studied...|$|E
40|$|The human bladder is an {{important}} organ within the pelvic system of the human body. It routinely collects urine excreted by the kidneys prior to disposal via urination causing significant variation in the shape and volume of the bladder. The mechanics of the filling process directly affects {{the function of the}} bladder and its interaction with the surrounding organs, in particular the position of the prostate that can influence the diagnosis and planning of radiotherapy treatments of prostate cancer. The success of prostate radiotherapy depends on the delivery of high doses of radiation to a defined tissue volume {{with a high degree of}} positional accuracy. A detailed study is required to establish the volume and shape change of the bladder during the course of the radiotherapy treatment, over a long period of time, and to develop an effective modelling tool to simulate this complex mechanical process to provide guidance to diagnosis and treatment planning. In this work, systematic data of the bladder dimension are presented based on measurement of Computed Tomography (CT) images of a group of 10 patients with prostate cancer, over the course of radiotherapy treatment. A method of measuring the bladder wall distance in the anterior-posterior (AP), superiorinferior (SI) and left-right (LR) directions is implemented. Systematic data obtained from scanned images taken on the transaxial, sagittal and coronal planes are analysed and compared to assess the potential influence of the <b>scanning</b> <b>sequence</b> on the shape and size of the bladder. The variation of the bladder dimensions, volume and shape were analysed between different arms for the same subject and the upper limit of bladder volume variation were determined. The relationship between some key dimensional parameters (such as wall distance and aspect ratio) with the volume change is established. Key systematic results of prostatic displacement are determined, and inter subject difference of prostate positional change is analysed. The process of bladder filling and potential inter and intra subject difference and their influence on the diagnosis and planning process are discussed. A systematic numerical modelling method based on MR images has been developed to simulate the mechanics of bladder filling and its effects on the position of the prostate. A new approach for constructing detailed three dimensional (3 D) Finite Element (FE) models that were specific to each patient were developed using multiple magnetic resonance (MR) images taken in three different planes (transaxial, sagittal, and coronal). Detailed sensitivity studies have been performed in comparing the 2 -D and 3 -D model, mesh size, materials models and parameters. The overall model of bladder deformation was compared with repeated images of the filled bladder that were obtained using computed tomography (CT) to validate the FE models. FE bladder deformation was found to be comparable to repeated CT images of the same patient, thus validating the FE models and the approach used in this work. The relationship between bladder deformation and its volume change has been established. The numerical results showed that the bladder dimensions increased linearly with its volume and the predicted coefficients is comparable to some published clinical results. The movement of the prostate in the anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI), left-right (LR) directions, as well as its rotational movement, that is associated with changes in bladder volume was predicted. The numerical results showed that the movement of the prostate in the AP and SI directions (3 - 4 mm and 1 [...] S- 4 mm) was much greater than that in the LR direction (O. 5 - 1 mm). The scale of the movement of the prostate with the increase in bladder volume varied considerably among subjects. The numerical predictions were compared with published clinical data and the significance of the results in medical application is discussed. The work showed that subject specific Finite Element modelling could potentially provide crucial guidance for the medical practice on the treatment planning process of the prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|Software {{tools for}} motif and pattern scanning: program {{descriptions}} including a universal sequence reading algorithm Kerri Y. Cockwell and Ian G. Giles Two programs, MOTIF and PATTERN, that <b>scan</b> <b>sequences</b> for matches to user-defined motifs {{and patterns of}} motifs based on identity and set membership are described. The programs use a simple and logical notation to define motifs, and may be used either interactively or by using command line parameters (suitable for batch processing). The two programs described also incorporate a simple, yet reliable, algorithm that automatically detects in which of six possible formats the sequence entry is written...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{provides}} some important thermodynamic and kinetic {{data for the}} CO 2 hydrate formation in flow system. Images were obtained dynamically using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system, with a fast spin-echo multi-slice <b>scan</b> <b>sequence</b> (FSEMS). The CO 2 hydrate dissociation rate was quantified using MRI mean intensity of liquid water. The saturation of residual liquid water, CO 2 hydrate and CO 2 gas during the dissociation of CO 2 hydrate were also quantified using MRI data. The highest CO 2 hydrate saturation was 58 % in the first process, and 26 % for the second process in this investigation...|$|R

In order to overcome this, MSR_PreTree uses a prefix-tree structure presented in Sect. 4. Every node in the prefix-tree is always the prefix of its child nodes (only sequence-extended nodes). Consequently, {{it is possible to}} generate rules directly without <b>scanning</b> all frequent <b>sequences</b> for prefix checking.|$|R
