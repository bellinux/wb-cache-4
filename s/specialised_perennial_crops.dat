50|$|Although most of {{humanity}} is {{fed by the}} re-sowing of the seeds of annual grain crops, (either naturally or by the manual efforts of man), <b>perennial</b> <b>crops</b> provide numerous benefits. Perennial plants often have deep, extensive root systems which can hold soil to prevent erosion, capture dissolved nitrogen before it can contaminate ground and surface water, and out-compete weeds (reducing the need for herbicides). These potential benefits of perennials have resulted in new attempts to increase the seed yield of perennial species, which {{could result in the}} creation of new <b>perennial</b> grain <b>crops.</b> Some examples of new <b>perennial</b> <b>crops</b> being developed are perennial rice and intermediate wheatgrass.

40|$|International audiencePurpose: <b>Perennial</b> <b>crops</b> {{globally}} {{provide a}} lot of fruit and other food products. They may also provide feedstock for bioenergy and have been, notably to this end, the subject of several LCA-based studies mostly focusing on energy and GHG balances. The purpose of this review {{was to investigate the}} relevance of LCAs on <b>perennial</b> <b>crops,</b> especially focusing on how the <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> specificities were accounted for in the farm stage modelling. * Methods: More than one hundred papers were reviewed covering 14 products from perennial crops: apple, banana (managed over several years), orange and other citrus fruits, cocoa, coconut, coffee, grape fruit, Jatropha oil, kiwi fruit, palm oil, olive, pear, and sugarcane. These papers were classified into three categories according to the comprehensiveness of the LCA study and depending on whether they were peer-reviewed or not. An in-depth analysis of the goal and scope, data origin for farming systems, modelling approach for the <b>perennial</b> <b>cropping</b> systems, and methods and data for field emissions helped reveal the more critical issues and design some key recommendations to account better for <b>perennial</b> <b>cropping</b> systems in LCA. * Results and discussion: In {{the vast majority of the}} reviewed papers, very little attention was paid on integrating the <b>perennial</b> <b>cropping</b> cycle in the LCA. It is especially true for bioenergy LCA-based studies that often mostly focused on the industrial transformation without detailing the agricultural raw material production, although it might contribute to a large extent to the studied impacts. Some key parameters, such as the length of the crop cycle, the immature and unproductive phase, or the biannual yield alternance, were mostly not accounted for. Moreover the lack of conceptual modelling of the perennial cycle was not balanced by any attempt to represent the temporal variability of the system with a comprehensive inventory of crop managements and field emissions over several years. * Conclusions: According to the reviewed papers and complementary references, we identified the gaps in current LCA of <b>perennial</b> <b>cropping</b> systems and proposed a road map for scientific researches to help fill-in the knowledge-based gaps. We also made some methodological recommendations in order to account better for the perennial cycle within LCA considering the aim of the study and data availability...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPerennial crops {{can be used}} as {{renewable}} resource but only rare information concerning their site-specific biomass production are available. Also, their yield stability as well as the quality of the produced biomass, whether for energetic or material utilisation, is relatively unknown. <b>Perennial</b> <b>crops</b> offer several ecological benefits such as protection of soil and waterbodies, long flowering and cover for wild animals during winter. Most of these crops have a high yield potential and are – after planting and establishing is completed – labour efficient to cultivate.

The aim of a Bavarian project, started 2014, is to evaluate several <b>perennial</b> <b>crops</b> at six Bavarian sites with varying soils and climatic conditions. Cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum), sida (Sida hermaphrodita), tall wheatgrass (Agropyron elongatum), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) are cultivated in field trials in 100 m 2 plots and four replications.

40|$|<b>Perennial</b> <b>crops</b> are plants, used in agriculture, {{that can}} be {{harvested}} multiple times before replanting. They are beneficial {{in a variety of}} ways, producing food and fuel, and providing agronomic, environmental, and cultural benefits. Economic analysis of the production of perennials is complicated by the long life of these crops, and by the changing patten of productivity over the crop's lifespan. This dissertation contains three studies looking at the implications of these two facts on <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> production and processing. The first chapter introduces <b>perennial</b> <b>crops</b> and the history of agricultural economists' attempts to study these issues. Chapters 2 and 3 analyze <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> production and processing in the context of biofuel production in Brazil. Chapter 4 presents the foundation of a unifying framework that can overcome limitations in the proceeding two chapters. Brazilian sugarcane production growth, being a key feedstock to sugar and ethanol production, exhibited a puzzling slow-down in the decade starting in 2010. In chapter 2 I investigate a noted, but unexplored, mechanism to explain this slow-down: the link between credit availability, sugarcane replanting, and sugarcane yield. Using secondary sources, I establish the plausibility of the conjecture that credit restrictions affected sugarcane farmer replanting decisions. To establish the link between replanting and yield, I develop a formal model to analyze the dynamics of yield after a change in the replant rate. I test this model econometrically using data from the South-Central region of Brazil, finding evidence mostly consistent with the model. The model is able to explain around one third of the variation in sugarcane yields, implying that, while this channel is important, it alone cannot explain the production slow-down. <b>Perennial</b> <b>crop</b> field-biorefinery supply chains are necessary in the production of many agricultural products. In particular, the low-cost production of low-carbon biofuels, such as ethanol from sugarcane or cellulosic feedstocks, relies on minimizing the costs of production along a <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> field-biorefinery supply chain. In chapter 3 I develop and analyze an unexplored mechanism to reduce <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> field-biorefinery supply chain costs: adjusting the age-structure, and hence yield, of the perennial feedstock. I present comparative statics of this model, finding that smaller biorefineries are most likely to benefit from age-structure endogenization. However, the results from a simulation of this model, calibrated to the sugarcane ethanol industry in the South-Central region of Brazil and comparing the cost-minimizing to the yield-maximizing age-structure, show that the cost-reductions from endogenization are small in this case (less than 1 percent cost reduction). Generally, the magnitude of the cost-reduction will depend on the growing pattern of the crop, the costs of growing and transporting the feedstock, and the reference age-structure. In chapter 4 I adapt the theoretical framework of Mitra 1991 to a two-age-class, finite horizon model, recasting their growth theoretic model into a form better suited for policy analysis. After introducing a simplified version of the model, and its general case, I determine necessary conditions on key parameters (relative productivity of mature trees, opportunity cost of land, and farmer patience) for each qualitative trajectory type in an arbitrary period. I use these conditions to develop a proposition about planting in the final period, and to analyze an example trajectory. Finally, I propose ways that this model can be used to answer several questions about <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> management...|$|R
