5|$|Commercial {{concentrated}} <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> {{plants were}} first {{developed in the}} 1980s. The 392 MW Ivanpah <b>Solar</b> <b>Power</b> Facility, in the Mojave Desert of California, is the largest <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> plant in the world. Other large concentrated <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> plants include the 150 MW Solnova <b>Solar</b> <b>Power</b> Station and the 100 MW Andasol <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> station, both in Spain. The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project, in the United States, and the 221 MW Charanka Solar Park in India, are the world's largest photovoltaic plants. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, {{but most of the}} deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{thermal power}} {{stations}} include the 354megawatt (MW) Solar Energy Generating Systems {{power plant in}} the USA, Solnova <b>Solar</b> <b>Power</b> Station (Spain, 150MW), Andasol <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> station (Spain, 100MW), Nevada Solar One (USA, 64MW), PS20 <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> tower (Spain, 20MW), and the PS10 <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> tower (Spain, 11MW). The 370 MW Ivanpah <b>Solar</b> <b>Power</b> Facility, located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world's largest solar-thermal power plant project currently under construction. Many other plants are under construction or planned, mainly in Spain and the USA. In developing countries, three World Bank projects for integrated solar thermal/combined-cycle gas-turbine power plants in Egypt, Mexico, and Morocco have been approved.|$|E

5|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>power</b> is {{anticipated}} {{to become the}} world's largest source of electricity by 2050, with solar photovoltaics and concentrated <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> contributing 16 and 11 percent to the global overall consumption, respectively.

5|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>power</b> is the {{conversion}} of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated <b>solar</b> <b>power,</b> or a combination. Concentrated <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> {{plants in the}} Mojave Desert which supply power to the {{electricity}} grid. Insolation (solar radiation) in the Mojave Desert is among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area.

Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> installation in the world, until Ivanpah <b>Solar</b> <b>Power</b> Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E
5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of <b>solar</b> <b>power.</b> Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> may be limited.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{hydroelectricity}} {{works very}} well in conjunction with <b>solar</b> <b>power,</b> water can be held back or released from a reservoir behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity uses <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again. However, this cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of <b>solar</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An {{environmental}} control system utilizing solar energy would generally be more cost- effective {{if it were}} used to provide both heating and cooling requirements in the building it serves. Various <b>solar</b> <b>powered</b> heating systems have been tested extensively, but <b>solar</b> <b>powered</b> airconditioners have received little more than short-term demonstration attention. This paper reviews past efforts {{in the field of}} <b>solar</b> <b>powered</b> cooling systems with the absorption pair of Ammonia-Water. A number of attempts have been made by researchers to improve the performance of the solar applied air-cooling subsystems. It is seen that the generator inlet temperature of the chiller is the most important parameter in the design and fabrication of a <b>solar</b> <b>powered</b> refrigeration and air conditioning system.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{immediate}} and lethal problems facing many third world countries is the availability of clean drinking water. <b>Solar</b> <b>powered</b> technologies can help alleviate this problem with minimal cost {{using a combination of}} <b>solar</b> <b>powered</b> well pumping, a water tower or other holding tank, and a <b>solar</b> <b>powered</b> water purifier. These technologies require minimal maintenance, have low operational costs, and once set up, will help provide clean water for drinking and agriculture. With large enough reservoirs for the water that has been pumped and purified with <b>solar</b> <b>powered</b> technology, a community will be better able to withstand drought or famine. This reservoir water could be consumed by humans, livestock, or used to irrigate community gardens and fields, thus improving crop yields and community health. A <b>solar</b> <b>powered</b> water purification system can be used to clean many pathogens and germs from groundwater and runoff. A group of these devices, filtering the water from wells or runoff could help with poor sanitation and controlling the spread of waterborne illnesses.|$|R
