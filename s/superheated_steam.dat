5|$|Initially, diesel {{propulsion}} {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use <b>superheated</b> <b>steam</b> propulsion. The main reason was that the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, this would have meant more than twice the shaft horsepower per shaft of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, this would have amounted to more than 40,000 horsepower per shaft. This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure <b>superheated</b> <b>steam</b> had already proved successful, it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery.|$|E

40|$|Sufficient atomic power {{generation}} safety increase may {{be done with}} microfuel adapting to reactor plants with water coolant. Microfuel particle is a millimeter size grain containing fission material core in a protecting coverage. The coverage protects fuel contact with coolant and provides isolation of fission products inside. Well thermophysical properties of microfuel bed in a direct contact with water coolant excludes fuel overheating when accidents. Microfuel use was suggested for a VVER, а direct flow reactor for <b>superheat</b> <b>steam</b> generation, a reactor with neutron spectra adjustment by the steam partial content varying in the coolant. Nonuniformities of two-phase coolant distribution in a heat generating particles bed are predicted by calculations in this text. The one is due to multiple-valuedness of pressure drop across the bed on the steam quality dependency. The nonuniformity decreases with flow rate and particle size growths absolute pressure diminishing while porosity effect is weak. The worse case is for pressure quality of order of one. Some pure steam filled pores appears parallel to steam water mixture filled pores, latter steam quality {{is less than the}} mean of the bed. Considering this regime for the direct flow reactor for <b>superheat</b> <b>steam</b> generation we predict some water drops at the exit flow.

5000|$|The {{superheater}} {{works like}} coils on an air conditioning unit, however {{to a different}} end. The steam piping (with steam flowing through it) is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace. This area typically is between 1300 - 1600 C. Some superheaters are radiant type (absorb heat by thermal radiation), others are convection type (absorb heat via a fluid i.e. gas) and some are {{a combination of the}} two. So whether by convection or radiation the extreme heat in the boiler furnace/flue gas path will also heat the superheater steam piping and the steam within as well. While the temperature of the steam in the superheater is raised, the pressure of the steam is not: the turbine or moving pistons offer a [...] "continuously expanding space" [...] and the pressure remains {{the same as that of}} the boiler. The process of <b>superheating</b> <b>steam</b> is most importantly designed to remove all droplets entrained in the steam to prevent damage to the turbine blading and/or associated piping. <b>Superheating</b> the <b>steam</b> expands the volume of steam, which allows a given quantity (by weight) of steam to generate more power.|$|R

Carnot's book did, however, eventually have a real impact on the design of practical engines. Rudolf Diesel, for example, used Carnot's theories to design the diesel engine, in which the temperature of the hot reservoir is much higher than that of a steam engine, resulting in an engine which is more efficient.|$|E

Based on the calculated results, the effects of degree of <b>superheat</b> of <b>steam</b> and the shape of nozzle on the total pressure loss have been discussed.
