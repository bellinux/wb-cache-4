40|$|Investment {{decisions}} in dry bulk <b>shipping</b> <b>form</b> {{one of the}} most difficult managerial tasks due to the high degree of uncertainty and the cyclical nature of the market. Adequate information on ship prices is, therefore, crucial when justifying such decisions. This paper is the first to embed trading rules in an evolutionary agent-based system to dynamically incorporate different traders' beliefs on future ship prices. The model is applied to two types of traders, two trading rules and three vessel types for the newbuild and second-hand market in the period 1990 - 2005. The results indicate that strategy selection is important to understand market pricing. Traders are also shown to benefit from adjusting their strategies over time and over vessel types...|$|E
40|$|The three {{compounds}} {{chosen for}} evaluation were Pu (NO{sub 3 }) {sub 4 }*XH{sub 20 }O, K{sub 2 }Pu (NO{sub 3 }) {sub 6 } and (NH{sub 4 }) {sub 2 }Pu(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 6 }. The nitrates were selected since {{they would not}} add an extraneous anion to the process streams. The halides were ruled out since {{they would not be}} compatible with stainless steel, and organics were not felt to be sufficiently stable for use. A systematic study of the radiolytic and thermal stability, solubility, and ease of preparation of each of the three nitrate compounds selected was then accomplished. These results allowed each compound to be evaluated as a potential solid <b>shipping</b> <b>form</b> as a guide to shipping package requirements. This report presents the results of the chemical development on a laboratory scale...|$|E
