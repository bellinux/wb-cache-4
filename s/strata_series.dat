40|$|In this thesis, set {{thicknesses}} {{are used}} to estimate the paleohydraulics (paleodischarge and give magnitudes for paleocurrent directions) of the ancient river system which deposited the Parthenon Sandstone in northwest Arkansas. Set thickness is the vertical thickness {{of a group of}} <b>strata</b> conformable <b>series</b> (Mckee and Weir, 1953); set thickness represents truncated dunes. The goal of this thesis is to: 1) obtain paleodischarge estimates of the Parthenon sandstone via cross-sets and compare the results with previously calculated discharge estimates which use basin area to discharge collation techniques and 2) use paleodischarge estimates calculated within this thesis to give magnitude to the paleocurrent direction data and compare the results with, more traditional, non-vector paleocurrent direction data. The quantitative work that has been done on the Parthenon suggests a paleodischarge which differs from qualitative estimates by multiple orders of magnitude; resulting in the need for more research. By obtaining quantitative measurements of set thickness, grain size, and paleocurrent direction on twenty-one Parthenon outcrops (over a 4. 5 x 103 km 2 study area), multiple paleohydraulic parameters can be estimated with existing models including: mean bedform height, channel depth, channel belt width, channel width, paleoslope, boundary shear stress, Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, paleoflow velocity, paleodischarge, and overall paleocurrent direction. Paleodischarge estimates in this study average 13, 000 m 3 /s; the minimum estimates average 2, 200 m 3 /s; and the maximum estimates average 53, 000 m 3 /s. Maximum average estimates in this study are lower than the minimum estimates (64, 000 m 3 /s) from past research based on total basin area; estimates in this thesis remain many orders of magnitude larger than any modern flashy system (the type of system the Parthenon has been interpreted as in the past). The overall paleocurrent direction found in this thesis is to the southwest; similar to past analyses. The total mean paleocurrent direction is 211 degrees; the mean of the outcrop means is 191 degree; and the mean of the paleodischarge weighted outcrop means is 198 degrees. There is little change between the overall paleocurrent directions when using vector or just directional data...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} he was across the mountain-top, and on the brink of the most {{remarkable}} chasm he had ever seen. The place was known as Lion's Kloof, or Leeuwen Kloof in Dutch, because three lions had once been penned up by a party of Boers and shot there. This chasm or gorge was between a quarter and half a mile long, about six hundred feet in width, and a hundred and fifty to a hundred and eighty feet deep. Evidently it owed its origin to the action of running water, for at its head, just to the right of where John Niel stood, a little stream welling from hidden springs in the flat mountain-top trickled from stratum to <b>stratum,</b> forming a <b>series</b> of crystal pools and tiny waterfalls, till at last it reached the bottom of the mighty gorge, and pursued its way through it to the plains beyond, half-hidden by the umbrella-topped mimosa and other thorns that were scattered about. Without doubt this little stream was the parent of the ravine it trickled down and through, but, wondered John Niel, how many centuries of patient, never-ceasing flow must have been necessary to the vast result before him? First centuries of saturation of the soil piled on and between the bed rocks that lay beneath it and jutted up through it, then centuries of floods caused by rain and perhaps by melting snows, to carry away the loosened mould; then centuries upon centuries more of flowing and of rainfall to wash the debris clean and complete the colossal work.|$|R
40|$|Determining the {{hydraulic}} conditions whereby gravel dunes first develop in subaqueous environments is fundamental as their presence may influence engineering solutions designed to maintain bed stability. In addition, {{estimates of the}} flow conditions associated with preserved gravel bed forms in sedimentary sequences are useful for reconstructing the depositional environments and geometries of, for example, oil- and gas-bearing geological <b>strata.</b> Consequently, a <b>series</b> of experiments considered dune initiation. In these experiments, defects and latterly incipient dunes developed from lower-stage plane gravel beds during near-threshold conditions of motion (/ crit = 1. 0 – 1. 016) and long periods of marginal bed load transport rates. The three-dimensional defects were almost imperceptible positive ovoid features with heights {{of one or two}} grain diameters and lengths and spans of a few decimeters. After 17 hours of flow, incipient, low-amplitude, simple two-dimensional dunes developed from the defects, with heights ranging between 0. 029 and 0. 055 m, nonequilibrium wavelengths of 1 – 4 m and spans of 0. 6 – 0. 9 m. Continued development over several days, with / crit ratios of around 1. 3, resulted in near-equilibrium two-dimensional dunes with wavelengths averaging 2. 6 – 3. 5 m and spans equal to the flume width (4 m). The inception of incipient dunes could be predicted using bulk flow models; however, this approach was not suitable for the prediction of defect development. Near-bed turbulence, in the form of small-scale sweep events of limited breadth, controls the initiation of defects, but larger-scale, coherent turbulent structures in the outer flow are related to dune development. Significantly, both defects and incipient dunes can exist at the same time, which indicates that the effects of sweeps on the bed morphology persist {{at the same time as}} larger-scale turbulent structures are beginning to effect sediment transport. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In the Ravenna quadrangle, {{north central}} Los Angeles county, {{approximately}} 8, 400 feet of middle Miocene (?) fanglomerates and 3, 600 feet of curiously interbedded basalts are exposed. They lie unconformably on a pre-Tertiary basement and unconformably under the Mint Canyon formation (upper Miocene). For {{this group of}} rocks the name "Vasquez Series" is suggested to replace the term "Escondido Series" of O. H. Hershey, which is preoccupied. The fanglomerates of the Vasquez Series are composed of angular fragments of anorthosite, quartz diorite, granite, and gneiss, commonly {{a foot or two}} in diameter though larger fragments are abundant. The fragments are embedded in a sparse matrix of sand and gravel cemented by calcite and iron oxides. The rude and irregular <b>strata</b> of the <b>series</b> are typically red, brown, or white in color. These sediments accumulated rapidly under semi-arid conditions in a large canoe-shaped basin and formed a series of coalescing alluvial fans which sloped in general toward the west. The upper part of the series contains local occurrences of fine silty beds of lacustrine origin. Some of the interbedded basalts exhibit phenomena suggestive of intrusive emplacement, others are clearly extrusive. These lavas range from massive hypohysline porphyricitc rocks to spongy amygdaloidal masses. Subsequent to deposition, the Vasquez Series was uplifted and deformed. After an epoch of erosion the basaltic conglomerate of the basal Mint Canyon (middle Miocene (?) was laid down. Faulting is greatly predominant over folding in the Ravenna quadrangle. Since upper Miocene time two periods of faulting have occurred. The first characterized by the Soledad fault, a normal fault, and the second characterized by a series of northeast trending strike slip faults. This last group of faults is clearly due to shearing stresses. Physiographically the area has a mature topography which was formed {{by the end of the}} Pleistocene. This mature topography is now being dissected by headward working streams rejuvenated in recent time. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Thrust faults often {{associate}} 3 {{types of}} structures, imbricate fan structures, ramp-flat structures, and duplex structures, {{all of which}} are seen within the Lewis thrust and the Rocky Mountain thrust and fold belt. Duplex structures are common and have been located in numerous locations along the Lewis thrust. These structures are distinct due to their structurally overlapping, lenticular stacked thrust fault slices. A prime example is seen in an area that extends from the Kootenay Pass north of the border to Marias Pass found in Montana. This section shows the Lewis Thrust following a series of bedding-parallel detachment horizons with a fairly thin stratigraphic interval near the base of the Purcell Supergroup, which is also the base of the mid-Proterozoic belt. Two windows in this section showing exposures of Upper Cretaceous strata exposed beneath the Lewis Thrust occur adjacent to the Flathead Fault. Within these windows, the Lewis thrust is folded along with overlying and underlying <b>strata</b> in a <b>series</b> of northwest trending anticlinal culminations that extend the length of {{the west side of the}} salient. Furthermore, two distinct structural levels can be seen in this section, an upper level comprising the majority of the mass of the Lewis thrust sheet which is characterized by broad open folds in relatively undeformed rocks, and a fairly thin lower level consisting of stacked imbricate, southwest-facing, sigmoidal thrust fault slices, bounded below by the Lewis thrust, and above by a separate bedding-parallel thrust called the Tombstone thrust. These culminations progressively stack up and accommodate significant lateral crustal shortening associated with the compression along the Lewis thrust fault. Another extremely similar section of this duplexing is seen at another outcrop in the Waterton Lakes area in Southwest Alberta. In addition to duplexes seen in windows, the Lewis thrust also shows isolated remnants of the eastern edge of the upper plate( [...] klippes) located at Chief Mountain in Montana and Crowsnest Mountain in Alberta. Erosion over time has shaped the mountains into their characteristic shape, where they tower over the associated prairies.|$|R
40|$|Approximately 5000 ft (1525 m) of strata crop {{out in the}} D Cross Mountain {{quadrangle}} in west-central New Mexico. The oldest strata are red shales and sandstones of the Chinle Formation (Late Triassic) that accumulated on an extensive, low-lying, {{coastal plain}} in a meandering stream complex. Jurassic age strata, if deposited in the area, were subsequently eroded due to uplift of the Mogollon Highlands and north-northwest tilting of the area during the Jurassic. The basal Dakota Sandstone was deposited by laterally planing, meandering streams before regional subsidence during the Cenomanian resulted in the initial encroachment of the mid-continent Cretaceous seaway into the Acoma embayment. The area oscillated between paralic and coastal non-marine environments {{for the remainder of}} the Cretaceous Period. As a result, a complex sequence of dark, offshore marine muds of the Mancos Shale interfinger to the west with coastal marine and fluvial sandstones and shales of the Dakota, Tres Hermanos, Gallup, and Crevasse Canyon Formations. Northeast-directed compressional forces associated with the Laramide orogeny deformed the <b>strata</b> into a <b>series</b> of broad open folds at the close of Cretaceous time. Pebble conglomerates and arkosic sandstones of the Baca Formation (Eocene) were eroded from the Zuni Mountains, transported to the southeast in a fluvial channel-floodplain complex, and accumulated in an east-trending, elongate, structural low. A thick cover of volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks spread over the area during the Oligocene. Lithic-crystal and crystal-lithic tuffs and debris flows of the Spears Formation were derived from a major volcanic center located south of the D Cross Mountain quadrangle. After cessation of volcanism, sediments were stripped from this volcanic highland and accumulated in a northward extending alluvial fan complex. The Miocene (?) conglomerate of Rock Tank Canyon is a fanglomerate that was derived principally from erosion of Spears tuffs. The dominant structure of the area is a south-dipping homocline formed as the result of uplift of the Colorado Plateau. The continuity of the homocline is, however, broken by a series of Neogene normal faults that formed in response to the opening of the Rio Grande rift. Volcanic necks and plugs cropping out on D Cross Mountain and Blue Mesa were emplaced during the Late Tertiary and appear to post-date uplift of the Plateau...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} karst springs {{rise in the}} Carboniferous strata of the Mells Valley, Somerset which is an area {{surrounded}} by many active and disused quarries. Some of these karst springs actively deposit tufa, a secondary precipitate of calcium carbonate, {{and they have been}} identified by the Environment Agency as potentially vulnerable to the effects of local sub-water table quarrying. A comparative study of a tufa-depositing spring, Whitehole Farm Spring, and a non tufa-depositing spring, St. Dunstan's Well, was carried out {{in order to determine the}} influence of hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry and environmental biology on the processes of tufa deposition. The two springs are approximately 2 km apart and located within the same outcrop of Carboniferous Limestone <b>strata.</b> A <b>series</b> of qualitative dye-tracing tests established a positive hydraulic connection between a feeder stream which rose in the Old Red Sandstone of the upper hydrological catchment, a sinkhole at the junction with the Lower Limestone Shales and Whitehole Farm Spring resurgence in the Carboniferous Limestone. The sinkhole was shown to have two separate channels to the water table. The tests demonstrated that structural geology and the water table had definable effects on the subterranean route and travel time of the allogenic recharge water. The recharge water to Whitehole Farm Spring was guided by the SE - NW Downhead Fault and did not follow the SW - NE course of the natural dry valley. The water velocity was dependent on the height of the local water table at the time of the tests. Hydrograph analysis of flow data combined with the dye-tracing tests illustrated the rapid response of the springs to storm events (< 24 hrs). The results gave an indication of the shallow nature of the Carboniferous Limestone aquifer and the different stages of development of fissures and conduits in the two spring systems, St. Dunstan's Well being a more mature karst system than Whitehole Farm Spring. Analysis of 18 monthly water samples from both springs at their resurgences and 100 metres downstream revealed temporal and spatial differences in the hydrogeochemistry of the springs and their streams. Ca 2 + and HCOs' were the dominant ions in both spring waters, however, neither of the spring resurgences were supersaturated with respect to calcite (Whitehole Farm Spring, mean - 0. 17 ± 0. 08 Sic; St. Dunstan's Well, mean - 0. 33 ± 0. 08 Sic). The resurgence water at Whitehole Farm Spring was higher in Ca 2 + (mean 112 ± 3. 35 mg I" 1) than at St. Dunstan's Well and became supersaturated as it flowed downstream (mean 0. 43 ± 0. 10 Sic). Lower Ca 2 + levels at St. Dunstan's Well (80 ± 2. 7 mg I" 1) were influenced by the degassing of recharge water and the deposition of calcite as speleothem within the open system of caves behind the resurgence. Downstream supersaturation was also lower (- 0. 011 ± 0. 079 Sic). There was a highly significant difference (p < 0. 001) between mean daily flow at Whitehole Farm Spring (0. 95 ± 0. 19 ML d" 1) and St. Dunstan's Well (11. 58 ± 1. 93 ML d" 1). Electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, Na, K, and NO 3 were also higher at Whitehole Farm Spring, the differences being significant (p < 0. 01). There were major differences in the biodiversity and environment of the two sites. Petrographic examination of field-collected tufa samples from Whitehole Farm Spring demonstrated that the stream flora, in particular lower plants, and the surrounding riparian vegetation were a major influence on the formation and morphology of the tufa deposits. Newly accreted tufa which had formed on artificial substrates placed in the stream, revealed calcite crystals surrounding the empty moulds of filamentous cyanobacteria. Hydrological conditions within the stream also influenced the micromorphology of calcite crystals forming on two filamentous algal species, Vaucheria longata and Zygnema stellinum. Whitehole Farm Spring was also found to be the more stable environment where biodiversity was higher. The shaded conditions created by Whitehole Farm Spring's woodland environment were beneficial to the growth of filamentous algae, cyanobacteria and bryophytes. The dominant species upstream was a crustose epilithic red alga Hildenbrandia rivularis. Downstream, in and on the tufa deposits the dominant aquatic flora were a number of species of the filamentous yellow-green alga Vaucheria and the cyanobacterium Lyngbya and the moss species Palustriella (Cratoneuron) commutatum. These species were either absent or growing under different ecological conditions at St. Dunstan's Well where there was sparse woodland. The dominant species at St. Dunstan's Well was the filamentous green alga Cladophora glomerata which was not present at Whitehole Farm Spring. Debris from the surrounding riparian vegetation at Whitehole Farm Spring acted as substrates for colonisation by microorganisms which enhanced the nucleation and growth of tufa in the stream. Hydrological and environmental conditions at St. Dunstan's Well prevented the accumulation of organic debris within the stream flow. The study highlighted the need for conservation of the natural environment and biota in order to maintain actively-depositing tufa springs...|$|R
40|$|On {{behalf of}} the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) {{conducted}} testing and data recovery investigations at the Siren site (41 WM 1126), a prehistoric multi-component site in the Interstate Highway 35 right-of-way along the South Fork of the San Gabriel River in Williamson County, Texas. The work was done to fulfill TxDOT’s compliance obligations under the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas. The testing investigations were conducted under Antiquities Permit 3834, and the subsequent data recovery was under Permit 3938. Kevin Miller served as Principal Investigator on both permits. Though the site extends far beyond the area of potential effects both horizontally and vertically, the investigations focused on Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components within a relatively limited area that {{would be subject to}} project impacts. The investigations were conducted in February 2006. The investigations identified five isolable components that were intermittently laid down from approximately 2600 to 900 years ago. A substantial Late Prehistoric Austin phase occupation is represented by Scallorn projectile points, stone tools, burned rock, faunal materials, and radiocarbon dates from cooking features. The component feature assemblage includes a cluster of discrete, well-preserved burned rock features that range from small fire-cracked rock concentrations to a large, slab-lined feature that dominates the cluster. The underlying components include four cultural <b>strata</b> representing a <b>series</b> of phases in the final millennium or so of the long Archaic period. These components span approximately 2600 to 1500 b. p., though earlier, deeply buried components were also noted on the site. These deeper deposits were not the focus of the investigations, however, since they would not be affected by the project. The Archaic components revealed a suite of small side-notched dart points such as Ensor, Fairland, and Frio, as well as many earlier broad-bladed styles such as Castroville, Montell, Marshall, and Pedernales. These robust components contained numerous burned rock features of varying size and function, abundant tools, well-preserved faunal materials, macrobotanical remains including geophytes from several earth ovens, and a large suite of radiocarbon dates. The features include an incipient burned rock midden, burned rock clusters, a debitage reduction area, a biface cache, slab-lined hearths, basin-shaped hearths, and small circular hearths. The distributions of artifacts and features within the Archaic components across the excavation blocks showed significant variations. These differences reflect sequential components that provide a view of diachronic trends in technology, subsistence, economy, and a suite of other behaviors and activities during the long transition from Archaic to Late Prehistoric adaptations. As previously determined by the testing excavations and further substantiated by the data recovery investigations, the Siren site, most notably the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components, is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D, 36 CFR 60. 4, and eligible for State Archeological Landmark designation under Criteria 1 and 2 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas, 13 TAC 26. 8. The excavations and subsequent analysis have mitigated the adverse effects of the bridge construction by recovering {{the vast majority of the}} affected components within the area of potential effect. No further archaeological work is recommended. Portions of the site outside the area of potential effects have not been fully evaluated, and any future impacts beyond the mitigated areas warrant further assessment...|$|R

The units consist of: late Eocene to early Miocene Oswald West mudstones (informal), middle Miocene Astoria Formation (Angora Peak sandstone and Silver Point mudstone members. -informal), middle Miocene basalts of intrusive and extrusive Depoe Bay Basalt, and intrusive Cape Foulweather Basalt. Beach sands, Pleistocene marine terraces, and stream alluvium unconformably overlie these Tertiary units. The Oswald West mudstones consist of more than 1600 feet of well-bedded, burrowed, tuffaceou siltstones and mudstones with sub ordinate tuff and glauconitic sandstone beds. Foraminiferal and trace fossil evidence suggest that these mudstones were deposited in marine waters of upper bathyal depths. The overlying 1700 -foot thick Astoria Formation is divided into two informal mappable members: the 1100 -foot thick Angora Peak sandstone and the 600 -foot thick Silver Point mudstone (proposed informally in this study). The Angora Peak sandstone member is composed of several hundred feet of thickly laminated feldspathic sandstones with local cross-bedded lithic conglomerates and carbonaceous siltstones. The overlying Silver Point mudstone member consists of rhythmically interbedded mudstones and graded turbidite sandstones, overlain by bedded mudstones, thin siltstones, and local conglomerate lenses. Conglomerate clast lithologies and heavy mineral suites of the Silver Point and Angora. Peak members are similar to the sediment carried by the Columbia River today and may be an ancient deposit of that river system. The provenances for these strata were pre-Miocene andesitic and dacitic rocks of the western Cascades, the Coast Range Eocene Tillamook basalts, and plutonic, metamorphic, and sedimentary contributions from eastern Oregon and Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Canada, Channel fluvial sandstones, conglomerates, and well-bedded shallow marine sandstones of the Angora Peak member, probably interfingering with interbedded, deeper marine (600 feet-outer shelf) mudstones and turbidite sndstones of the Silver Point member, are interpreted to have been deposited near the mouth of a river, adjacent to the ocean as a delta. Dikes, sills, peperites, and irregular intrusive bodies of middle Miocene Depoe Bay Basalt intruded Oswald West mudstones and the Astoria Formation. These aphanitic to finely crystalline equigranular basaltic intrusives locally fed over 2000 feet of palagonitized pillow lavas and basaltic breccias which now form the highest peaks in the area. The intrusives locally penecontemporaneously deformed the Astoria <b>strata</b> into a <b>series</b> of large-scale soft sediment deformation folds and sedimentary breccias. Cape Foulweather Basalt intrudes all sedimentary units and cuts the Depoe Bay Basalts. The basalt is recognized by sparse, large plagioclase phenocrysts. The area is cut by several east-west and north-south trending high angle faults with up to 500 feet displacement A large north-south syncline in {{the central part of the}} thesis area delineates a structural and depositional basin. A smaller north-plunging anticline is present near the coast. Recent landslides in the Silver Point member have been particularly destructive along the coast and inland; they have been caused by wave, stream action, and by man over-steepening unstable slopes.
