40|$|Background: The {{combination}} of pepsinogen, gastrin- 17 and anti-H. pylori antibodies serological assays (panel test) is a non invasive {{tool for the}} diagnosis of atrophic gastritis. However, the diagnostic reliability of this test is still uncertain. Aim: To assess the diagnostic performance of the <b>serum</b> <b>panel</b> test for the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis. Methods: Medline via PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library databases and abstracts of international conferences proceedings were searched from January 1995 to December 2016 using the primary keywords “pepsinogens”, “gastrin”, “atrophic gastritis”, “gastric precancerous lesions”. Studies were included if they assessed {{the accuracy of the}} <b>serum</b> <b>panel</b> test for the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis using histology according to the updated Sydney System as reference standard. Results: Twenty studies with a total of 4241 subjects assessed the performance of <b>serum</b> <b>panel</b> test for the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis regardless of the site in the stomach. The summary sensitivity was 74. 7 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 62. 0 - 84. 3) and the specificity was 95. 6 % (95 %CI, 92. 6 - 97. 4). With a prevalence of atrophic gastritis of 27 % (median prevalence across the studies), the negative predictive value was 91 %. Few studies with small sample size assessed the performance of the test in detecting the site of atrophic gastritis. Conclusions: The {{combination of}} pepsinogen, gastrin- 17 and anti-H. pylori antibodies serological assays appears to be a reliable tool for the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis. This test may be used for screening subjects or populations at high risk of gastric cancer for atrophic gastritis; however, a cost-effectiveness analysis is needed...|$|E

The C 6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, based on the IR 6 region of VlsE, has become widely used in both the United States and Europe. We mapped the antigenic epitopes of IR 6 to a shorter sequence that is equivalent in sensitivity and specificity to the full-length IR 6 25 -residue peptide. In addition, we observed significant differences in sensitivity between <b>serum</b> <b>panels</b> (60 to 100 %), indicating that {{the selection of the}} <b>serum</b> <b>panels</b> can shape the apparent overall sensitivity of the assay. Contrary to prior reports, the assay sensitivity is greater when the IR 6 peptide is derived from the sequence of the same infecting Borrelia genospecies.

The {{prevalence}} of antibody to hantaviruses in Slovakia (<b>serum</b> <b>panel</b> n 5 2, 133) was {{lower in the}} western part (0. 54 %) and higher in the eastern part (1. 91 %) of the country and was found to be significantly enhanced in a group of forest workers from eastern Slovakia (5. 88 %). One-third of the IgM-negative convalescent phase sera from patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome exhibited antibodies reacting predominantly with Puumala virus antigen, while two-thirds had antibodies directed mainly against Hantaan virus antigen. Fine analysis of two Hantaan virus–reactive sera by a focus reduction neutralization test showed that Dobrava hantavirus was the source of these human infections.

The PA kits exhibited 94. 0 - 100. 0 % sensitivity and 99. 5 - 100. 0 % specificity; the sensitivity range was ascribed {{to the quality of}} the HTLV- 1 antigens coated on the particles. The EIA kits had 99. 5 - 100 % sensitivity and 98. 5 - 100 % specificity; the 98. 5 %- 99. 5 % specificity exhibited by five of the EIA kits could have been due to nonspecific reactions that were detected through use of an inadequate cut-off value and the use of recombinant proteins.

Despite the {{availability}} of many methods for rapid and early diagnosis of dengue, {{there is still a}} need to develop new approaches that not only combine low cost, specificity, and sensitivity, but also are capable of accurately detecting secondary infection {{in the early stages of}} the disease. We report the potential of the high mobility group box 1 protein as an auxiliary biomarker for early dengue diagnosis. We tested a 205 -sample <b>serum</b> <b>panel</b> that included negative and positive samples from primary and secondary dengue cases, as well as samples from patients with dengue-like symptoms. We observed that high mobility group box 1 protein was generally detected only in dengue-positive samples for persons with primary and secondary infections. These results highlight the possibility of using this endogenous molecule as an auxiliary biomarker to aid in dengue detection and improve current methods for early diagnosis of dengue. Dengue infection affects at least 50 million persons per year in tropical and subtropical regions.

The current multiplexed assay consists of synthetically produced peptide signatures 3 A, 3 B, and 3 D and the recombinant protein signature 3 ABC in combination with four controls. To determine the diagnostic specificity of each signature in the multiplex, the assay was evaluated against a naive population (n = 104) and a vaccinated population (n = 94).

MethodsFor the common protocol, rather lenient criteria for reference individuals were adopted to facilitate harmonized recruitment with planned use of the latent abnormal values exclusion (LAVE) method. As of July 2015, 12 countries had completed their study with total recruitment of 13, 386 healthy adults. 25 analytes were measured chemically and 25 immunologically. A <b>serum</b> <b>panel</b> with assigned values was measured by all laboratories. RIs were derived by parametric and nonparametric methods.

In order to examine a wide variety of animal species that may be infected with N. caninum, a modified direct agglutination test (N-MAT) similar to the Toxoplasma gondii modified direct agglutination test (T-MAT) was developed. This test measures the direct agglutination of parasites by N. caninum-specific antibodies in serum, thus eliminating the need for secondary host-specific anti-isotype sera. The N-MAT was compared to the indirect fluorescent-antibody test (IFAT) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a “gold standard” <b>serum</b> <b>panel</b> from species for which secondary antibodies were available (n = 547). All positive samples tested were from animals with histologically confirmed infections. Up to 16 different species were tested.

The reduced specificity of the N-MAT was due to false-positive reactions in testing fetal fluids with particulate matter or severely hemolyzed serum. Overall, the N-MAT proved to be highly sensitive and specific for both naturally and experimentally infected animals, highly reproducible between and within readers, easy to use on large sample sizes without requiring special equipment, and useful in testing serum from any species without modification...|$|E

Of these, 112 suffered from malignant disease (57 patients had pancreatic carcinoma and 55, extra-pancreatic malignancies) and 89 had benign disease (49 patients with hepato-pancreato-biliary disease and 40 with other benign disease). FAP protein was measured by a competitive radioimmunoassay. In this technique, the normal cut-off level was 10 % inhibition. This was deducted from values in 32 normal sera. FAP protein levels superior to 10 % inhibition were found in 86 % of patients with pancreatic cancer, in 31 % with non-pancreatic malignancy, in 69 % with benign hepato-pancreato-biliary disease and in 20 % with other benign diseases. Accordingly, sensitivity of FAP protein for pancreatic carcinoma was 86 % and specificity, 66 %. However, high FAP protein levels (greater than 30 % inhibition) were almost exclusively seen in patients with pancreatic cancer.

40|$|The Wellcozyme HTLV-I/II ELISA (Murex Diagnostics) was {{evaluated}} in 7800 samples of various <b>serum</b> <b>panels.</b> Repeat activity {{was found by}} Wellcozyme in (A) 1 / 2181 (0. 05 %) Dutch blood donors, (B) 44 / 3036 (1. 4 %) Curaçao (Caribbean area) blood donors, (C) 46 / 2533 (1. 8 %) individuals of different Ethiopian population subsets, (D) 30 / 30 (100 %) confirmed anti-HTLV-I positive samples and (E) 20 / 20 (100 %) HTLV-II PCR-positive samples. All 91 Wellcozyme-positive samples were tested for confirmation by Western blot (WB, Diagnostic Biotechnology). Among Wellcozyme HTLV-I/II ELISA-positive individuals, HTLV-I/II WB positivity was found in 0 / 1 Dutch blood donors, 40 / 44 (88. 9 %) Curaçao blood donors and 20 / 46 (43. 5 %) Ethiopian individuals. HTLV-I positivity was found in 40 (1. 3 %) WB-positive Curaçao blood donors and in 9 (0. 35 %) Ethiopian individuals. HTLV-II positivity was found in 11 (0. 43 %) WB-positive Ethiopian individuals. The Wellcozyme HTLV-I/II ELISA had a specificity of 99. 95 % in Dutch blood donors and a sensitivity of 100 % on confirmed HTLV-I- and HTLV-II-positive samples. In Ethiopia 55 % of the HTLV-I/II WB-positive individuals were exclusively HTLV-II positive, whereas in Curaçao no HTLV-II infections were foun...|$|R
40|$|The {{acute phase}} protein (APP) {{response}} {{is an early}} systemic sign of disease, detected as substantial changes in APP serum concentrations and most disease states involving inflammatory reactions give rise to APP responses. To obtain a detailed picture of the general utility of porcine APPs to detect any disease with an inflammatory component seven porcine APPs were analysed in serum sampled at regular intervals in six different experimental challenge groups of pigs, including three bacterial (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyosynoviae), one parasitic (Toxoplasma gondii) and one viral (porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus) infection and one aseptic inflammation. Immunochemical analyses of seven APPs, four positive (C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin (Hp), pig major acute phase protein (pigMAP) and serum amyloid A (SAA)) and three negative (albumin, transthyretin, and apolipoprotein A 1 (apoA 1)) were performed {{in the more than}} 400 serum samples constituting the <b>serum</b> <b>panel.</b> This was followed by advanced statistical treatment of the data using a multi-step procedure which included defining cut-off values and calculating detection probabilities for single APPs and for APP combinations. Combinations of APPs allowed the detection of disease more sensitively than any individual APP and the best three-protein combinations were CRP, apoA 1, pigMAP and CRP, apoA 1, Hp, respectively, closely followed by the two-protein combinations CRP, pigMAP and apoA 1, pigMAP, respectively. For the practical use of such combinations, methodology is described for establishing individual APP threshold values, above which, for any APP in the combination, ongoing infection/inflammation is indicated...|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} introduced a homogeneous immunoassay based on time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) elic-ited by fluorophore-labeled antigen and fluorophore-labeled protein L, bound by an immunoglobulin. As the first clinical appli-cation, we employ this approach (LFRET) in serodiagnosis of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection. A reference panel contain-ing serum from individuals with acute (n 21) or past (n 17) PUUV infection and from PUUV-seronegative individuals (n 20) {{was used to}} define the parameters. The clinical assay performance was evaluated with a prospectively collected <b>serum</b> <b>panel</b> (panel 2; n 153). Based on the results for panel 1, the threshold for positivity was set at a signal level that was 3 -fold over back-ground, while those with a signal< 3 -fold over the background level were considered PUUV seronegative. With panel 1, 20 / 21 acute- and 7 / 10 past-infection samples induced positive signals, compared to 0 / 20 seronegatives. With panel 2, a positive signal was obtained in 39 / 40 acute- and 4 / 10 past-infection samples, as opposed to 7 / 103 seronegatives. However, after IgG depletion, 58 / 61 acute-infection samples were LFRET positive, while all past-infection and seronegative samples were negative, correspond-ing to 100 % specificity and 95 % sensitivity in detection of acute PUUV infection. We demonstrate that the novel immunoassay is a promising tool for rapid serodiagnosis of acute Puumala virus infection. Puumala virus (PUUV) belongs to the genusHantaviruswithinthe family Bunyaviridae, comprising typically rodent- and in-sectivore-borne negative-stranded RNA viruses (1). The known reservoir hosts of hantaviruses are chronically infected and sprea...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The IFCC Committee on Reference Intervals and Decision Limits coordinated {{a global}} multicenter study on {{reference}} values (RVs) to explore rational and harmonizable procedures for derivation of reference intervals (RIs) and investigate {{the feasibility of}} sharing RIs through evaluation of sources of variation of RVs on a global scale. Methods: For the common protocol, rather lenient criteria for reference individuals were adopted to facilitate harmonized recruitment with planned use of the latent abnormal values exclusion (LAVE) method. As of July 2015, 12 countries had completed their study with total recruitment of 13, 386 healthy adults. 25 analytes were measured chemically and 25 immunologically. A <b>serum</b> <b>panel</b> with assigned values was measured by all laboratories. RIs were derived by parametric and nonparametric methods. Results: The effect of LAVE methods is prominent in analytes which reflect nutritional status, inflammation and muscular exertion, indicating that inappropriate results are frequent in any country. The validity of the parametric method was confirmed {{by the presence of}} analyte-specific distribution patterns and successful Gaussian transformation using the modified Box-Cox formula in all countries. After successful alignment of RVs based on the panel test results, nearly half the analytes showed variable degrees of between-country differences. This finding, however, requires confirmation after adjusting for BMI and other sources of variation. The results are reported {{in the second part of}} this paper. Conclusion: The collaborative study enabled us to evaluate rational methods for deriving RIs and comparing the RVs based on real-world datasets obtained in a harmonized manner...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the prevalence of HIV infection and risk factors for HIV infection in various population subgroups in Ethiopia. <b>Serum</b> <b>panels</b> from blood donors (n = 2610), from various population subgroups in Ethiopia were tested for anti-HIV- 1 / 2 by ELISA. All ELISA repeatedly reactive samples were subjected for confirmation by immunoblot (IB) and anti-HIV- 1 and anti-HIV- 2 specific ELISAs. 155 / 2610 (5. 9 %) blood donors were HIV- 1 infected. Of pregnant women, 84 / 797 (10. 5 %) were HIV- 1 infected, and 1 / 797 (0. 1 %) was HIV- 2 infected. 1 / 240 (0. 4 %) individuals from the rural population were HIV- 1 infected. 198 / 480 (41. 3 %) female attendees, and 106 / 419 (25. 3 %) male attendees at sexual transmitted disease (STD) clinics were HIV- 1 infected. One (0. 2 %) male, and 2 (0. 4 %) female STD patients were infected with both HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. It was concluded that the prevalence of HIV- 1 infection varied from 0. 4 % among urban residents to 25. 3 - 41. 3 % among STD attendees. There is a low prevalence of HIV- 2 present in Ethiopian subjects. Risky sexual behaviour is significantly associated with HIV-infection in Ethiopi...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} serologic testing algorithms {{for human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) based {{on a combination of}} rapid assays among persons with HIV- 1 (non-B subtypes) infection, HIV- 2 infection, and HIV- 1 –HIV- 2 dual infections in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, a total of 1, 216 sera with known HIV serologic status were used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of four rapid assays: Determine HIV- 1 / 2, Capillus HIV- 1 /HIV- 2, HIV-SPOT, and Genie II HIV- 1 /HIV- 2. Two <b>serum</b> <b>panels</b> obtained from patients recently infected with HIV- 1 subtypes B and non-B were also included. Based on sensitivity and specificity, three of the four rapid assays were evaluated prospectively in parallel (serum samples tested by two simultaneous rapid assays) and serial (serum samples tested by two consecutive rapid assays) testing algorithms. All assays were 100 % sensitive, and specificities ranged from 99. 4 to 100 %. In the prospective evaluation, both the parallel and serial algorithms were 100 % sensitive and specific. Our results suggest that rapid assays have high sensitivity and specificity and, when used in parallel or serial testing algorithms, yield results similar to those of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based testing strategies. HIV serodiagnosis based on rapid assays may be a valuable alternative in implementing HIV prevention and surveillance programs in areas where sophisticated laboratories are difficult to establish...|$|R
40|$|The microneutralization assay is {{commonly}} used to detect antibodies to influenza virus, and multiple protocols are used worldwide. These protocols differ in the incubation time of the assay {{as well as in}} the order of specific steps, and even within protocols there are often further adjustments in individual laboratories. The impact these protocol variations have on influenza serology data is unclear. Thus, a laboratory comparison of the 2 -day enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and 3 -day hemagglutination (HA) microneutralization (MN) protocols, using A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09, A(H 3 N 2), and A(H 5 N 1) viruses, was performed by the CONSISE Laboratory Working Group. Individual laboratories performed both assay protocols, on multiple occasions, using different <b>serum</b> <b>panels.</b> Thirteen laboratories from around the world participated. Within each laboratory, serum sample titers for the different assay protocols were compared between assays to determine the sensitivity of each assay and were compared between replicates to assess the reproducibility of each protocol for each laboratory. There was good correlation of the results obtained using the two assay protocols in most laboratories, indicating that these assays may be interchangeable for detecting antibodies to the influenza A viruses included in this study. Importantly, participating laboratories have aligned their methodologies to the CONSISE consensus 2 -day ELISA and 3 -day HA MN assay protocols to enable better correlation of these assays in the future...|$|R
