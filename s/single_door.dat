5|$|The trams were {{unidirectional}} {{and had a}} <b>single</b> <b>door</b> at {{the front}} and a double door in the middle, both on the right side. Class E also had a <b>single</b> <b>door</b> at the rear. The trams were originally delivered with two apartments, with a wall and inside door {{in front of the}} centre door. This was removed after the trams became smoke-free. They had a partial wooden interior, with linoleum floors. Various renovations changed the panelling, usually variations of brown and yellow. The trams originally had incandescent light bulbs, but these were replaced with fluorescent lamps after 1955. From 1970 to 1974, the trams were rebuilt to remove the conductor, and the driver was given space for a purse and ticket machine, as well as an announcement system. The E-series eventually had the rear door taken out of use and blocked with an extra seat.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} to the church, a <b>single</b> <b>door</b> in the south transept—through the crusader façade—is found past a group of streets winding through the outer Via Dolorosa, {{by way of a}} local souq in the Muristan. This narrow way of access to such a large structure has proven to be hazardous at times. For example, when a fire broke out in 1840, dozens of pilgrims were trampled to death.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground floor}} {{served as a}} {{commercial}} space for two businesses and the windows are large for display purposes. Slender cast iron columns frame the recessed doorway. Wooden decorative panels appear above the transom of the double doors. A <b>single</b> <b>door</b> in an arched entry way {{at the south end}} of the storefront provides access to the upper floors. cast iron columns support the small arch and a decorative wooden panel also appears above the doorway.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has three main exits including the double front <b>doors</b> and two <b>single</b> timber <b>doors</b> {{located at the}} rear of the church. One of the <b>single</b> <b>doors</b> leads from the vestry and the other from the storage room.|$|R

25|$|A flat semicircular roof {{covers the}} main {{entrance}} portico on Franklin. Its wide overhanging eave, with another red cornice at the roofline, is supported by several dual steel flat-plate brackets extending to the ground. The entrance doors are aluminum and glass, set in a wall of square glass panels. The rear entrance is a smaller portico faced in rusticated stone with a red cornice, flat roof, and <b>single</b> <b>door</b> in a similar glass treatment with light fixtures flanking its upper corners.|$|E
25|$|The {{church was}} {{constructed}} between 1850 and 1853. In terms of design, it features three semi-domes and an elongated cella. Single-nave domed chapels (each dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damian and Saint John the Baptist) {{are attached to}} {{each side of the}} church, with three additional domes topping the cella's middle nave. At the entrance, the three parts of the church form a U-shaped external narthex. In total, there are five octahedral domes and six doors. Two enter the narthex, two serve the side chapels and a <b>single</b> <b>door</b> is intended for the priest to step into the diaconicon. The church's stone columns were the work of stonemasons from Elovitsa.|$|E
25|$|The {{hull of the}} Seastar {{features}} complex angling and shaping, as {{the result}} of extensive water tank testing. Pilots exit and enter the Seastar through a <b>single</b> <b>door</b> on the left-hand side of the aircraft from the sponson, and passengers board via a separate hatch located aft of the wing, also stepping from the sponson. This approach enables the aircraft to close to a relatively short distance from docks or boats for boarding purposes. The cabin can house up to 12 passengers, in addition to the crew in high-density seating, or can alternatively accommodate six-nine passengers in more spacious configurations; an aft baggage compartment is also present.|$|E

50|$|The {{three main}} entry doors are set within a stepped-back {{limestone}} surround. The large main door {{is a double}} door set {{in the center of}} the elevation, and smaller <b>single</b> entry <b>doors</b> flank the main one. There are ornamental cast bronze grilles above wave-like lintels atop the doors. The central grille depicts the stage coach, steam ship and mail train. The <b>single</b> <b>doors</b> depict mail delivery by packet boat and airplane. Above each <b>single</b> entry <b>door</b> is a carved, recessed limestone plaque with the American eagle motif.|$|R
25|$|The trams were {{originally}} constructed with an entrance {{through the back}} door and exit through the middle and front doors. The conductor was seated at the back and the passengers would enter a platform before passing by the conductor. This was opposite on the trailers, which had the entrance at the front. This allowed for a common boarding area, which had the psychological effect of encouraging passengers to a greater extent board the trailer. The vehicles were equipped with blinker doors. MBO consisted of double doors at the front and back, and a <b>single</b> <b>door</b> in the middle. The first two TO units had the same design, while the remaining trailers had only single exit doors. The vehicles were not built with compartments.|$|E
25|$|Fenestration on {{both side}} {{profiles}} consists of five large round-arched stained glass windows framed by molded limestone casings with bracketed sills. On the east in the center is an engaged buttress added {{to shore up the}} wall. A three-bay projecting pavilion on the west supports the bell tower. Its entrance is a <b>single</b> <b>door</b> with round-arched window above and on the sides. Its lowest stage is a three-story masonry tower with wooden cornices separating the stories, topped by three frame ones above a curved cornice. The lower two are octagonal, one featuring a clock and the next louvered round-arched vents. The uppermost stage, the conical steeple, has ribs defining its eight facts and is covered with diamond-shaped wooden shingles. Kingston's city ordinances prohibit the construction of any building taller than its base in the Stockade District.|$|E
25|$|Ob'yekt 914 - {{experimental}} IFV. This {{vehicle was}} developed in the early 1960s by a design team led by I. V. Gavalov at the Volgograd Tractor Works (VTZ) and the prototype was ready for trials in 1964. The Ob.914 was armed with two 7.62mm PKT general-purpose machine guns mounted in the hull {{on either side of the}} driver. It had a crew of two and could transport up to eight fully equipped soldiers (two of whom operated the PKTs). Its combat weight was 14.4 tons. After a series of trials in 1964, the Ob.765 was selected to become the BMP-1 due mostly to the rear engine design which obliged the infantry to mount and dismount through the <b>single</b> <b>door</b> in the rear of the right hand side of the vehicle and roof hatches. It was also felt that the Ob.765 had a better overall layout.|$|E
60|$|A curtain {{was drawn}} over {{the window of}} the cottage, so that Dick could not see into the room. The cottage was small, with but a <b>single</b> <b>doors</b> and on this the youth rapped loudly.|$|R
50|$|In {{the eastern}} {{section of the}} building, some {{original}} timber double doors are infilled with weatherboards, louvre windows and <b>single</b> <b>doors.</b> To the northern elevation, aluminium framed windows and doors are positioned in many original door openings.|$|R
50|$|In 1926 101 new 'K Stock' {{motor cars}} were ordered from Birmingham RC&W along with 263 sets of BTH {{equipment}} and WT54B motors. These new motor cars had two double <b>doors</b> and two <b>single</b> <b>doors</b> {{on each side}} and {{the ends of the}} clerestory curved down at the end.|$|R
25|$|The {{church is}} {{connected}} to the college by a walkway-like corridor over a Roman arch, its corridor illuminated by rectangular windows on either side. It is about two to three stories tall, and adapted to the inclined terrain that the complex is built. On the main floor of the northern face are three rectangular doorways, complemented by three guillotine-windows on the second floor. The eastern facade is protected by a wall of granite, also of three floors in height, with the first accessible by a <b>single</b> <b>door,</b> the second has picture windows and the third with eight windows (six of which are surmounted by cornices). The facade oriented towards the west, of two to three stories, is marked by rectangular doors and simple frames, surmounted by five guillotine windows. The courtyard, also two floors in height, includes a single rectangular door with guillotine windows on the floor superior (one with Roman arch).|$|E
25|$|In both {{town and}} country, {{means of access}} between the main house and the servant's wings were kept to a minimum, often the <b>single</b> <b>door</b> would be lined with green baize to deaden any sound. Long and {{complicated}} passages linking kitchens with dining rooms were devised; in some houses the tortuous route through corridors and staircases from kitchen to dining room could be an eighth of a mile – an absence of cooking smells taking priority over hot food. Even the doors linking to the connecting corridors would be covered by screens, sometimes disguised as bookcases with dummy books, or just simply covered in the same wallpaper as that with which the room was decorated, as the existence of servants {{was not to be}} acknowledged. Cleaning had to be performed {{in the early hours of}} the morning while the employers were asleep, and in the grander houses only male servants were allowed to be visible, and then only when required.|$|E
25|$|Several {{additions}} {{had been}} built onto the original structure between 1970 and 1976, creating a sprawling, non-linear complex of function rooms and service areas. The resulting complex was roughly square in shape, and {{though it was not}} situated in a north-south direction, reports of the fire have tended to assign those points to points in the complex for ease of reference. Assuming this system, the front entrance of the complex lay at the southern point of the compass. Along the central portion of the southern wall, to the east of the building entrance, was a small event room called the Zebra Room. A narrow corridor to the Zebra Room's east separated it from the Viennese Room and a series of service spaces, which ran northward along the building's eastern wall. This interior corridor terminated between the Garden Room, occupying the central portion of the north wall of the building, and the Cabaret Room, which jutted out from the northeastern corner of the building. A smaller, branching corridor led from the internal corridor to an exit door that sat between the Garden Room and the Cabaret Room; to exit the building from the Cabaret Room using that corridor, a person would have, in order, pass through a set of double doors into the main interior corridor, pass through a <b>single</b> <b>door</b> between the main interior corridor and the branching interior corridor, turn a sharp corner into the branching corridor, and proceed approximately one-quarter of the length of the Cabaret Room to the <b>single</b> <b>door</b> that connected the branching corridor to the exterior of the building. This complex navigation was not atypical for the building; a number of other event and services spaces were scattered {{throughout the rest of the}} building, with some rooms leading into each other, some leading into interior hallways, and some leading to the outside of the building. A partial second story covered approximately the southern third of the building, sitting above the main entrance, Zebra Room, and main dining room; it held two more small event rooms made of six smaller rooms conjoined, collectively labeled the Crystal Rooms.|$|E
50|$|The trams {{featured}} four {{double and}} two <b>single</b> <b>doors</b> on each side. The seats were unpadded and were generally {{built in the}} longitudinal seating configuration - running parallel {{to the sides of}} the tram body. Digital voice announcements and internal dot-matrix displays provided information about the next stop.|$|R
50|$|The Urbos 3 trams are {{approximately}} 33 metres long and feature two double and two <b>single</b> <b>doors</b> on each side. Seats are generally in the transverse configuration - at 90 {{degrees to the}} sides of the vehicle. Digital voice announcements and internal dot-matrix displays provide information about the next stop. The trams are numbered 2112, 2114-2124.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the church building has changed little through the years, but the interior has undergone repairs and changes. At first, there was a choir loft across the front reached by stairs in the vestibule. Centered in a higher ceiling hung a bronze chandelier with five or six oil lamps and on the wall {{at the rear of}} the choir were similar side lamps. Two large wood burning stoves heated the building. There were two <b>single</b> <b>doors</b> entering the worship room that were replaced by double doors in the center because of difficulty experienced in passing through <b>single</b> <b>doors</b> with a casket. The narrow straight-backed pews have also been replaced, although two originals pews are still kept in the vestibule. Most of these updates were done in the 1940s.The present windows are original and contain handmade glass. The plank floors are original, as are the boards on the walls and the altar.|$|R
25|$|From {{the ground}} level {{entrance}} {{door on the}} western side of the tower, a spiral concrete staircase with steel tubular handrail winds around a central service duct before arriving in the near-centre of the observation room. Apart from an enclosed toilet in the north-west corner, the observation room is an open space with a central pillar that contains cavities for services that link to the roof level. Fixed angled glazing wraps around the north, east and south sides. A set of recent laminated cabinetry sits below the observation windows along the north-east. Original metal window frames on the western wall are a mixture of mid-point pivoting and fixed panes, while more recent aluminium-framed windows are found in the toilet. Floors are lined with linoleum and a system of suspended ceiling panels conceals the underside of the concrete roof slab. A recent sink and cupboard sits up against the southern wall of the toilet. All original communications equipment has been removed. Access to the external balcony, which wraps around all sides except the straight, western edge, is through a <b>single</b> <b>door</b> in the south-west corner. This timber door retains the original separate screen door. The narrow balcony has a concrete floor and a balustrade made from two tubular steel rails and widely separated balusters covered in asbestos cement sheeting rendered with pebble-dash on the exterior face. The steel balusters pierce the concrete floor slab and are fixed on the underside.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. Air Force {{initially}} ordered 15 [...] "Full-Scale Development" [...] (FSD) aircraft (11 single-seat {{and four}} two-seat models) for its flight test program, but {{was reduced to}} eight (six F-16A single-seaters and two F-16B two-seaters). [...] The YF-16 design was altered for the production F-16. The fuselage was lengthened by , a larger nose radome was fitted for the AN/APG-66 radar, wing area was increased from [...] to , the tailfin height was decreased, the ventral fins were enlarged, two more stores stations were added, and a <b>single</b> <b>door</b> replaced the original nosewheel double doors. The F-16's weight was increased by 25% over the YF-16 by these modifications.|$|E
500|$|Each tram has a total {{capacity}} of 162 riders, of which 71 can be seated. Seating is at {{three or four}} abreast. Series two was delivered with vandal-proof seats that proved uncomfortable and were replaced. The floor is [...] above the tracks. The trams have four doors {{on the right side}}. The first series also have a <b>single</b> <b>door</b> on the left side, and the back right door was made single to match this. On series two, there are four double doors on the right side and none on the left side. SL79 was the first tram to be delivered with color-coded destination signs. By 2007, all the trams had had their rolling signs replaced by LED-type signs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Single</b> skin <b>doors</b> are {{available}} at extra cost and where fitted, usually require external hinges.|$|R
50|$|Although the Eurotram’s {{design has}} {{generally}} been applauded for its user-friendliness, it has also received some criticism. For instance, the doors have been criticised for being too slow to open/close (they are <b>single</b> <b>doors),</b> lengthening the time spent in stations. Additionally, the large window over and around the driver’s cabin can result in the cabin becoming too hot, a problem that was remedied with sun blinds.|$|R
5000|$|A large arched Gothic window {{dominates the}} church's front facade. Under it are three doorways: one with double {{doors in the}} center and one on each side of it with <b>single</b> <b>doors.</b> [...] "INTROIBO AD ALTARE DEI", which {{translates}} to [...] "I will go to the altar of God", is carved over the central doorway, while an Alpha and an Omega are carved over the side doors.|$|R
500|$|After {{concluding}} the European and Japanese legs {{of their}} tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view. The early development of Holy Wood coincided with Manson's three-month seclusion {{at his home}} in the Hollywood Hills, during which he considered how to respond to the controversy. Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: [...] "There was a bit of trepidation, [...] deciding: 'Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I'm trying to say? Am I even gonna be allowed to say it?' Because I definitely had every <b>single</b> <b>door</b> shut in my face... there were {{not a lot of people}} who stood behind me." [...] He told Alternative Press that he felt his safety was threatened to the point that he [...] "could be shot Mark David Chapman-style." [...] He began work on the album as a counterattack.|$|E
2500|$|The Generator Building {{is a small}} single story shed with gabled ends. [...] It {{has three}} windows and a <b>single</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Near the icehouse {{is a small}} tabby {{building}}, {{thought to}} have been used as a gardener's shed and/or a smokehouse. [...] The building has a <b>single</b> <b>door</b> and no windows. [...] The roof is slightly bell-cast, clad with cypress shingles, and topped with a wood finial; a board decorated with large serrated dentils runs around the building below the eaves.|$|E
5000|$|The 1983 Tube stock owed {{much to the}} sub-surface D Stock in design. Like D Stock, the 1983 Tube Stock had <b>single</b> leaf <b>doors,</b> {{a similar}} orange {{interior}} and cab design. Unlike the D Stock however, the 1983 Tube Stock proved to be unreliable. Electrical generators for lighting the carriages failed often, as did the motors. Boarding of passengers was slow because of the <b>single</b> leaf <b>doors.</b>|$|R
25|$|The ancient Greek and Roman <b>doors</b> {{were either}} <b>single</b> <b>doors,</b> double doors, triple doors, sliding doors or folding doors, {{in the last}} case the leaves were hinged and folded back. In Eumachia, is a {{painting}} of a door with three leaves. In the tomb of Theron at Agrigentum there is a <b>single</b> four-panel <b>door</b> carved in stone. In the Blundell collection is a bas-relief of a temple with double doors, each leaf with five panels. Among existing examples, the bronze doors in the church of SS. Cosmas and Damiano, in Rome, are important examples of Roman metal work of the best period; they are in two leaves, each with two panels, and are framed in bronze. Those of the Pantheon are similar in design, with narrow horizontal panels in addition, at the top, bottom and middle. Two other bronze doors of the Roman period are in the Lateran Basilica.|$|R
50|$|All three {{northern}} bays {{are on a}} projecting pavilion. To its {{south on}} the first story, double French doors, flanked by similar <b>single</b> <b>doors,</b> with three- and six-pane transoms open onto a set of stone steps. Above them {{there is a single}} arched one-over-one window near the southwest corner of the main block. A matching window on the east side is the only one on that entire facade.|$|R
