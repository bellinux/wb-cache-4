40|$|Metabolite {{profiles}} (GC–MS), drimane sesquiterpenes, sugars {{and sugar}} alcohols, {{were compared with}} bacterial and fungal endophyte communities (T-RFLP, DNA clones, qPCR) in leaves and roots of the pepper <b>bark</b> <b>tree,</b> Warburgia ugandensis (Canellaceae). Ten individuals each were assessed from two locations east and west of the Great Rift Valley, Kenya, Africa, which differed in humidity and vegetation, closed forest versus open savannah. Despite organ- and partially site-specific variation of drimane sesquiterpenes, no clear effects on bacterial and fungal endophyte communities could be detected. The former were dominated by gram-negative Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, as well as gram-positive Firmicutes; the fungal endophyte communities were more diverse but no specific groups dominated.

40|$|The {{community}} structure, {{stable isotope}} ratios (15 N/ 14 N, 13 C/ 12 C) and reproductive mode of oribatid mites (Acari, Oribatida) were investigated in four habitats (upper <b>tree</b> <b>bark,</b> lower <b>tree</b> <b>bark,</b> dry grassland soil, forest soil) at two {{sites in the}} Central Alps (Tyrol, Austria). We hypothesized that community structure and trophic position of oribatid mites of dry grassland soils and <b>bark</b> of <b>trees</b> are similar since these habitats have similar abiotic characteristics (open, dry) compared with forest soil. Further, we hypothesized that derived taxa of oribatid mites reproducing sexually dominate on the <b>bark</b> of <b>trees</b> since species in this habitat consume living resources such as lichens. In contrast to our hypothesis, the community structure of oribatid mites differed among grassland, forest and bark indicating the existence of niche differentiation in the respective oribatid mite species. In agreement with our hypothesis, sexually reproducing taxa of oribatid mites dominated on the <b>bark</b> of <b>trees</b> whereas parthenogenetic species were more frequent in soil. Several species of bark-living oribatid mites had stable isotope signatures that were similar to lichens indicating that they feed on lichens. However, nine species that frequently occurred on <b>tree</b> <b>bark</b> did not feed on lichens according to their stable isotope signatures. No oribatid mite species could be ascribed to moss feeding. We conclude that sexual reproduction served as preadaptation for oribatid mites allowing them to exploit new habitats and new resources on the <b>bark</b> of <b>trees.</b> Abiotic factors likely are of limited importance for bark-living oribatid mites since harsh abiotic conditions are assumed to favor parthenogenesis...|$|R
