40|$|The {{link between}} city {{morphology}} and urban energy consumption, although proved, requires further research. In that sense, {{the analysis of}} parameters describing the urban texture may be a useful approach for energy assessment at a city scale. Some geometrical parameters {{have been used to}} study urban energy aspects related to the radiative phenomena, such as heat island or even a rough indicator of solar energy availability in locations where direct radiation is not determining. This paper aims to explore the correlation between one of these parameters -the <b>Sky</b> <b>Factor</b> (SF) - and direct solar radiation over facades, as a characterization tool of solar access within an urban context. Barcelona, a Mediterranean city where direct sunlight and the built environment density are deciding factors, has been chosen as case study. At different points of the facade for several urban canyons, SF value and direct solar radiation for different orientations and times of the year have been computed using Heliodon software. Both results have been related one to another and it has been found that, for a specific latitude, it is possible to define a smooth dependence between these parameters, if the orientation is taken into account.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{daylighting}} performances of a building, {{one of the}} most commonly used quantities is the Daylight factor, which is defined for a given surface element inside the analysed room as the ratio of the inside and outside illuminances under a CIE overcast sky. The Daylight factor consists of three components: the sky component, due to light flux reaching the surface element directly from the sky, the externally and the internally reflected components, respectively due to light flux reflected on external and internal surfaces. To estimate the direct sky component (also called <b>sky</b> <b>factor),</b> analytical methods can be used, based on the luminance distribution of the sky and the window’s geometric properties (dimensions and position in regard to the considered surface element). However, such methods have always been restricted to vertical (lateral) and horizontal (zenithal) windows, requiring heavy approximations to be applied whenever a tilted rectangular opening was considered. In this paper, a generalized method for assessing the sky component is proposed, extending it to rectangular windows of any tilt angle. As a purely analytical approach was found to be inapplicable, it is based on an optimised combination of vertical and horizontal windows situations. To validate the developed methodology, scale model measurements were performed with a sky simulator for two rectangular openings of varying tilt angle (every 15 ° from vertical to horizontal) : the experimental results proved to be in very good agreement with the calculation-based approach...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The paper {{examines}} {{the origins of}} the so-called "grumble point" (a <b>sky</b> <b>factor</b> of 0. 2 per cent) as the measure of daylight adequacy in rights to light disputes. It seeks to identify the rationale, and underlying scientific basis, for the adoption of this standard in the early twentieth century. Design/methodology/approach - Analysis of archive materials. Findings - The use of the 0. 2 per cent standard {{does not appear to be}} based on empirical investigations involving human perceptions of adequate light. No evidence exists of the investigations reputedly undertaken by Percy Waldram during the early twentieth century. Waldram's own writings suggest that the standard began as a "rule of thumb" and was only later justified by reference to other independent reports. These generally do not support the use of the standard and, in any event, were soon superseded by other reports that concluded that it was too low. There is a lack of reliable evidence to justify the original adoption of the 0. 2 per cent figure, and many of the assumptions underpinning modern rights to light practice are found to be based on inaccurate information. Research limitations/implications - Continues the debate, started in this journal in 2000, about the future of surveying practice in rights to light disputes.

The study uses six critical on-site variables such as surface albedo, <b>sky</b> view <b>factor,</b> altitude, shrub cover, tree cover and average height to floor area ratio to carry out analysis in five data sets. The climatic parameters and physical characteristics were measured and surveyed, respectively in 216 stations in high-rise high-density residential developments of coastal Hong Kong. The data set is mainly categorised into peak summer clear sky days (PSCS-days), peak summer partially cloudy days (PSPC-days) and late summer days to address the issues related to cloudy sky conditions in Hong Kong. The trend analysis shows that at a lower <b>sky</b> view <b>factor,</b> ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 25, shrub cover as low as 10 - 15 % in a 1000 m 2 open area is more effective in reducing outdoor temperature than the same level of tree cover in a location with a higher <b>sky</b> view <b>factor</b> (0. 4 or above). The regression models used in this study were able to explain the influence of on-site variables on vegetation in lowering the outdoor temperature within the respective urban settings. In high-rise high-density environments, on-site variables such as <b>sky</b> view <b>factor</b> and altitude have a substantial impact on the influence of vegetation in lowering outdoor temperature. However, off-site variables such as high urban density and anthropogenic heat could negate the behaviour of <b>sky</b> view <b>factor</b> and altitude.

40|$|Surface {{emissivity}} is {{a critical}} parameter for studying city-, meso-, and micro-scale climate and energy balance. The emissivity of complex surfaces e. g. a forest or an urban canopy is an effective surface property since it depends on both surface materials and geometry. This study presents a novel methodology for estimating effective emissivity using <b>sky</b> view <b>factor</b> retrieved from airborne Lidar data, building GIS data, and land use and land cover classification data. First, a high correlation between the effective emissivity retrieved from ASTER TIR bands 10 - 14 and the <b>sky</b> view <b>factor</b> was observed (r 2 = 0. 93, 0. 99, 0. 99, 0. 97, 0. 97). When the <b>sky</b> view <b>factor</b> decreases, the effective emissivity tends to increase, which is mainly due to multiple scattering (cavity effect), thus increases the effective emissivity. A simplified model which assumes that reflection and scattering only occurs within a single pixel was developed. Results showed that {{the correlations between the}} modeled and the spectral (band) emissivity retrieved from the ASTER multispectral TIR data (five spectral bands) are high (r 2 = 0. 93, 0. 99, 0. 98, 0. 93, 0. 97), and with low RMSE (0. 019, 0. 016, 0. 012, 0. 003 and 0. 004 from band 10 - 14 respectively). The emissivity derived from this simplified model, however, tends to be overestimated in band 10 - 12. Thus, a refined urban emissivity model based on <b>sky</b> view <b>factor</b> (UEM-SVF) which considers the scattering and reflection from adjacent pixels was developed in this study. Results show a good agreement with ASTER spectral (band) emissivity: r 2 = 0. 90, 0. 98, 0. 96, 0. 94 and 0. 96, and very low RMSE (0. 006, 0. 003, 0. 004, 0. 002 and 0. 004).

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 The H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the Cascades {{of central}} Oregon {{provides}} {{a unique opportunity}} to study spatial climate patterns on a relatively small scale. Historical records at the 64 square-kilometer site provide a spatiallydense 30 -year dataset. Thermal regimes at the H. J. Andrews are generally known but the effects of its complex topography and canopy cover on temperatures have been poorly understood. In this study, 1971 - 2000 mean monthly maximum and minimum temperature maps of the H. J. Andrews were created over a 50 - meter grid, accounting for several environmental factors affecting microclimates in forested, mountainous terrain. The effects of elevation, forest canopy, cloudiness, and topographic shading on radiation regimes were assumed to be the primary factors and the datasets were adjusted to account for them. Specifically, it was assumed that maximum temperatures were affected by shortwave daytime radiation regimes, and minimum temperatures were affected by surface longwave radiation emission at night. The Image-Processing Workbench (IPW) was used to estimate incoming shortwave solar radiation at all climate station sites, taking into account elevation, cloudiness and topographic shading. Using IPW, fisheye photographs, and the HemiView program, proportions of solar radiation and <b>sky</b> view <b>factors</b> blocked by the tree canopy were calculated at each site, and accounted for when calculating daily shortwave radiation values for each month. <b>Sky</b> view <b>factors</b> were calculated at each site accounting for canopy and surrounding topography. Specific site pairs were then analyzed by plotting observed monthly temperature differences against simulated radiation and <b>sky</b> view <b>factors</b> and computing monthly regression functions. Monthly maximum temperature/shortwave radiation regression functions were used to adjust maximum temperatures onto 'open, flat' terrain, (leaving only elevation effects on temperatures), and monthly minimum temperature/sky view factor regression functions were used to adjust minimum temperatures. Temperatures were spatially interpolated over the H. J. Andrews using the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) program, which calculates spatially-varying temperature/elevation gradients. Topographic effects of shortwave radiation and <b>sky</b> view <b>factors</b> were reintroduced to the PRISM temperature grids using the appropriate regression functions. To make the resulting maps as useful and applicable as possible for future research, temperatures were modeled to simulate open siting conditions common in NWS station networks. Overall, temperatures were most sensitive to elevation and topographic position. Maximum temperature was sensitive to variations in shortwave radiation, especially in winter when solar radiation loads were small. Minimum temperature was sensitive to variations in <b>sky</b> view <b>factors,</b> particularly during clear summer months. Factors not accounted for in the project include small-scale effects of cold-air drainage, forest edge effects, topographic scale effects, and stream effects.

Using a satellite landcover classification, aided by a field analysis of urban canyon characteristics, {{it is possible to}} estimate the spatial variety of surface variables across the West Midlands. Spatial analysis of topography using a Geographical Information System (GIS) database calculated values at 1 km 2 resolution for the geographic variables.

Sensitivity analysis shows that the geographical variables which have the most significant influence on the model are slope angle and <b>sky</b> view <b>factor,</b> however all the physical variables could have a significant influence. Validation of the model against actual road surface temperature for 15 road weather sensors, for February 2000, gave r 2 values as high as 0. 84, however regression indicated that the model overestimated the minimum road surface temperature by 1. 16 °C, as opposed to the Meteorological Office model which underestimated by 1. 49 °C for the same period.

The structure of the heat island suggests that current Open Road weather forecast zones are not applicable in simulated clear calm conditions because of the wide temperature variations caused by the degree of urbanisation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Is it {{possible}} to increase physical density whilst limiting the perception of density? This thesis outlines the main determinants of perceived urban density, exploring alternative parameters to those commonly used to define density. The study uses Hong Kong as an urban case study. Findings suggest high perceived density {{is seen as a}} negative aspect of urban life in Hong Kong. To create a satisfactory urban environment, means of reducing the perception of density are welcome. A number of candidate urban parameters were investigated and their effects on the perception of density are discussed. Plot ratio has a significant but weak correlation with perceived density. This suggests actual physical density has minor influences on the perception of urban density. However, urban developments with similar plot ratios can exhibit very different urban forms and are thus likely to be perceived differently. This thesis demonstrates spatial openness is a key factor in the perception of density. This study used the <b>sky</b> view <b>factor</b> as a measure of spatial openness. According to findings, the perception of density decreases with increasing sky view. This thesis illustrates the application of the findings through the development of a speculative urban plan for an old district of Hong Kong. The use of the <b>sky</b> view <b>factor</b> coupled with other modelling techniques such as passive zone analysis provides a good indication of spatial openness and urban daylight availability. These output parameters {{can be used as a}} basis for performance comparison. The <b>sky</b> view <b>factor</b> provides an indicator for assessing the performances of urban design both in terms of human perception and urban micro-climate, and so this work can shed light on the formulation of new urban planning policy.

50|$|The <b>sky</b> view <b>factor</b> (SVF) {{denotes the}} ratio between {{radiation}} received by a planar surface and {{that from the}} entire hemispheric radiating environment and is calculated as the fraction of sky visible from the ground up. SVF is a dimensionless value that ranges from 0 to 1. A SVF of 1 means that the sky is completely visible, for example, in a flat terrain. When a location has buildings and trees, it will cause the SVF to decrease proportionally.|$|R
