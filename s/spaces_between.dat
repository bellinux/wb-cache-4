50|$|English style guides {{prescribe}} {{writing the}} number and percent sign without any <b>space</b> <b>between.</b> However, the International System of Units and ISO 31-0 standard prescribe a <b>space</b> <b>between</b> {{the number and}} percent sign, {{in line with the}} general practice of using a non-breaking <b>space</b> <b>between</b> a numerical value and its corresponding unit of measurement.|$|R
50|$|Well {{cementing}} is {{the process}} of introducing cement to the annular <b>space</b> <b>between</b> the well-bore and casing or to the annular <b>space</b> <b>between</b> two successive casing strings.|$|R
5|$|A new {{construction}} technique {{was employed to}} save weight. Previous battlecruisers were built {{with a combination of}} transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only the longitudinal ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the large}} pendentives {{that support the}} vault are windows, six {{on each side of}} the chapel. There were two more windows in each end of the chapel, now closed, and those above the High Altar covered by the Last Judgement. Above each window is an arched shape, {{referred}} to as a lunette and above eight of the lunettes at the sides of the chapel are triangular spandrels filling the <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the side pendentives and the vault, the other eight lunettes each being below one of the corner pendentives.|$|E
5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> joints and fractures.|$|E

50|$|Lyre's second feature was The <b>Space</b> <b>Between</b> - an Edinburgh love story, {{following}} 2 strangers, brought together. Shot in September 2009 in 17 {{days for}} £15,000, the film stars Vivien Reid, Tim Barrow and David Whitney. Written {{and directed by}} Tim Barrow, The <b>Space</b> <b>Between</b> premiered at Edinburgh's Filmhouse in March 2011. The <b>Space</b> <b>Between</b> was released by Lyre on DVD in December 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Similar to the <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> letters (kerning) in European languages, Chinese writing uses a {{very narrow}} <b>space</b> <b>between</b> characters, though it does not observe the {{equivalent}} to the wider <b>space</b> <b>between</b> words except on rare occasions. Chinese—particularly classical Chinese—is thus a form of scriptio continua and {{it is common for}} words to be split between lines with no marking in the text equivalent to the English hyphen.|$|R
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation with Earth, always {{showing the}} same face, with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. As {{seen from the}} Earth, it is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky, after the Sun. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance just slightly {{higher than that of}} worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} a total length of , {{including}} the atrium. It was mostly built of rectangular limestone blocks sparingly joined with mortar. Inside the apse, the mortar is red-coloured. The floor {{was covered by}} marble and stone tiles glued on top of red mortar in the narthex and white mortar elsewhere. Red and yellow bricks and pieces of bricks {{were used for the}} atrium, the arches, and possibly the dome; some brick pieces were used to fill <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the stones on the walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} built with stone foundations, {{and the main}} {{structure}} is made of oak timbers, joined together using mortice and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs. Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the timbers. The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.|$|E
5000|$|In British practice, the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> {{the rails}} of a track is colloquially {{referred}} to as the [...] "four-foot", and the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> two tracks the [...] "six-foot", descriptions relating to the respective dimensions.|$|R
5000|$|Word spacing in {{typography}} {{refers to}} the size of the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> words. It should be distinguished from letter-spacing (the <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> the letters within each word) and sentence <b>spacing</b> (the <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> sentences). Typographers may modify the spacing of letters or words in a body of type to aid readability and copy fit, or for aesthetic effect. In web browsers and standardized digital typography the word spacing is controlled by the CSS1 word-spacing property.|$|R
50|$|Increased <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> taro plants {{has been}} {{explored}} {{as a method}} of limiting transmission. However, this method has also proven ineffective as taro plants grow best when planted close together. Therefore, increasing <b>space</b> <b>between</b> plants also decreases yield.|$|R
5|$|Among lemurs, the toothcomb is {{variable}} in structure. Among indriids (Indriidae), the toothcomb is less procumbent {{and consists of}} four teeth instead of six. The indriid toothcomb is more robust and wider, with shorter incisors, wider <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the teeth (interdental spaces), and a broader apical ridge. It is unclear whether this four-toothed toothcomb consists of two pairs of incisors or one pair of incisors and one pair of canines. In fork-marked lemurs (Phaner) the toothcomb is more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces. All six teeth are longer, straighter, and form a more continuous apical ridge. In the recently extinct monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) and sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae), the toothcomb was lost and the incisors and canines resumed a typical configuration {{in the front of}} the mouth. The aye-aye also lost its toothcomb, replacing it with continually growing (hypselodont) front teeth, similar to the incisors of rodents.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|E
50|$|Modern British PPMs have a 4 dB <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> {{the scale}} marks. Older designs had a 6 dB <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> '1' and '2'. This {{discrepancy}} can sometimes {{also be found}} at the equivalent position on the derived CBC and ABC scales.|$|R
50|$|The female Parcoblatta bolliana is {{the only}} other female of the Parcoblatta genus that has such {{significantly}} reduced tegmina and absence of hind wings. The female P. bolliana is distinguished from P. americana by its compact form, <b>space</b> <b>between</b> its compound eyes less than the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> its antennal sockets, its tegmina having few traces of venation, and its supra-anal plate weakly produced with its side edges converging to a broadly rounded apex, while the P. americana having a normal, less compact form, <b>space</b> <b>between</b> its compound eyes noticeably wider than the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> its antennal sockets, its tegmina have visible venation, its supra-anal plate is normally produced with its side edges converging to a sharply rounded apex.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} or five {{accepted}} and cognate meanings of spandrel in architectural and art history, mostly relating to the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> a curved figure and a rectangular boundary - such as the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> the curve of an arch and a rectilinear bounding moulding, or the wallspace bounded by adjacent arches in an arcade and the stringcourse or moulding above them, or the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> the central medallion of a carpet and its rectangular corners, or the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> the circular face of a clock and {{the corners of the}} square revealed by its hood. Also included is the space under a flight of stairs, if it is not occupied by another flight of stairs.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} {{walls of the}} throne hall are painted with a lotus bud design arranged in a geometric pattern. Within the lotus buds are seated praying deities, a common Thai motif often associated with holy places. The ceiling, which has a coffered octagonal shape section directly below the spire, is decorated with glass mosaic stars. This reinforces the impression {{of being in a}} heavenly abode. The interior panel of the door and window shutters depicted standing deities facing each other holding weapons as guards for the king. The thickness of the walls allow further <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the shutters and the wall to be decorated, these are decorated with murals depicting trees in Chinese style.|$|E
5|$|The new Ibrox had a {{capacity}} of 44,000 and was opened with an Old Firm game played on 19 September 1981. By this time, however, the development cost had risen to £10 million, which depleted the club financially. This resulted in a difficult period {{in the history of}} Rangers, as the average attendance fell to 17,500 in the 1981–82 season, including a crowd of only 4,500 for a game against St Mirren. The redeveloped stadium was partly blamed for this, as some fans felt that the new ground lacked atmosphere due to the <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the stands. This was during a period of low attendances in Scottish football in general. Despite the relatively low attendance at Ibrox, Rangers had the highest average home attendances in the Premier Division in both 1983–84 and 1984–85.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{magazines}} and books, Robinson challenged many gardening traditions and introduced new ideas {{that have become}} commonplace today. He is most linked with introducing the herbaceous border, which he referred to by the older name of 'mixed border'—it included a mixture of shrubs, hardy and half-hardy herbaceous plants. He also advocated dense plantings that left no bare soil, with the <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> taller plants filled with what are now commonly called ground cover plants. Even his rose garden at Gravetye was filled with saxifrage between and under the roses. Following {{a visit to the}} Alps, Robinson wrote Alpine Flowers for Gardens, which for the first time showed how to use alpine plants in a designed rock garden.|$|E
50|$|IDW's first title, Star Trek: The Next Generation: The <b>Space</b> <b>Between,</b> is a six-issue limited series {{launched}} January 2007. The <b>Space</b> <b>Between</b> {{is written}} by David Tischman and drawn by Casey Maloney. This storyline was collected in trade paperback form in September 2007.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pitch of}} a string can also be varied by moving the bridges. Because two notes are missing, {{there should be some}} <b>space</b> <b>between</b> the bridges of the E and G strings, and also some <b>space</b> <b>between</b> the A and C strings.|$|R
5000|$|In India, he {{discovered}} the “space between”: that <b>space</b> <b>between</b> the Ying and the Yang, that <b>space</b> <b>between</b> {{the sum of all}} colors and its absence. He saw this space in his negatives and found a way to enlarge them in order to explore this enchanted gap. Monet used the same rendering process for the following projects and, in 2003, he published a book entitled The <b>space</b> <b>between</b> including three different body of works: “Passage to India”, “Homage to Gaudí” and “Exotic Flowers”.” ...|$|R
5|$|As in {{the rest}} of Italy, the finest and most {{decorated}} rooms were those on the piano nobile, reserved for guests and entertaining. Entered formally from the external Baroque double staircase, these rooms consisted of a suite of large and small salons, with one very large salon being the principal room of the house, often used as a ballroom. Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here too, {{but by the end of}} the 18th century they were more often on a secondary floor above. If decorated during the Baroque era, the rooms would be profusely ornamented. Walls were frequently mirrored, the mirrors inset into gilded frames in the walls, often alternating with paintings similarly framed, while moulded nymphs and shepherdesses decorated the <b>spaces</b> <b>between.</b> Ceilings were high and frescoed, and from the ceiling hung huge coloured chandeliers of Murano glass, while further light came from gilded sconces flanking the mirrors adorning the walls. One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery of Mirrors in Palermo's Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi (Illustration 17). This room with its frescoed ceiling by Gaspare Fumagalli is, however, one of the few Baroque rooms in this Baroque palazzo, which was (from 1750) extended and transformed by its owner Marianna Valguarnera, mostly in the later neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with}} the blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E
5|$|Exipulum is a {{term used}} to refer to the tissue or tissues {{containing}} the hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer tissue layer) is thin (20–30µm thickness), made of a tissue type known as texura porrecta, consisting of more or less parallel hyphae all in one direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The medullary exipulum (middle tissue layer) is thick (200–600µm) and made of textura intricata, a tissue layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the hyphae. The asci (filamentous structures in which the ascospores develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240–280 by 12–15µm. The ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with blunt ends, and measure 19–22 by 10–12µm. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are cylindrical, 2–3µm thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes anastomose, but do not form a conspicuous network. The paraphyses contain numerous red granules.|$|E
3000|$|T_i, ([...] i = 1, [...]... 271) is the ith {{structural}} period. AF {{values are}} systematically computed for 271 values, equally <b>spaced</b> <b>between</b> 0.01 and 10  s on a logarithmic period axis, i.e., also equally <b>spaced</b> <b>between</b> 0.1 and 100  Hz on a logarithmic frequency axis.|$|R
50|$|Typography {{includes}} type design, modifying type glyphs {{and arranging}} type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is {{the selection of}} typefaces, point size, tracking (the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> all characters used), kerning (the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).|$|R
