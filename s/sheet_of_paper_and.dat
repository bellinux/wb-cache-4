25|$|Another way {{to imagine}} wormholes {{is to take}} a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> draw two {{somewhat}} distant points {{on one side of the}} paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the spacetime continuum, and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this way it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} literary figure, the Irish poet W. B. Yeats {{was also}} {{fascinated by the}} Arabian Nights, when {{he wrote in his}} prose book, A Vision an autobiographical poem, titled The Gift of Harun Al-Rashid, in relation to his joint experiments with his wife Georgie Hyde-Lees, with Automatic writing. The gift of his wife, given only allegedly by the caliph, is a technique used by many occultists in order to discern messages from the subconscious mind or from other spiritual beings, when the hand moves a pencil or a pen, writing only on a simple <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> when the person's eyes are shut. In July 1934 he was asked by Louis Lambert, while in a tour in the United States, which six books satisfied him most. The list that he gave placed the Arabian Nights, secondary only to William Shakespeare's works.|$|E

500|$|During {{the writing}} for the season, Ward and series' head writer Kent Osborne noted that it was {{increasingly}} difficult to produce new episode concepts because the writers had [...] "already used a lot of cool ideas". Osborne called this slump the [...] "season four blues". Ward went on to clarify that, [...] "everything's still coming out super weird and interesting—but it just gets a little harder. You have to dig deeper." [...] To combat these issues, the writer staff tried different story writing methods, such as a technique called exquisite corpse, in which one writer starts a story on a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>and</b> the paper is folded and another writer tries to finish it. Ward, however, noted that [...] "the ideas are usually terrible". They also decided to experiment with different types of storytelling and to introduce more new characters to the show.|$|E
500|$|The {{partnership}} between Garran and Hughes is regarded {{by some as}} unusual, given that Garran was [...] "tall, gentlemanly, wise and scholarly", and patient with his staff, whereas Hughes was [...] "short of stature [...] renowned for bursts of temper." [...] Nevertheless, the partnership was a successful one, with Hughes recognising the importance of Garran's constitutional expertise, remarking once about the World War I period that [...] "the best way to govern Australia was to have Sir Robert Garran at [...] elbow, with a fountain pen and a blank <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>and</b> the War Precautions Act." [...] Likewise, Garran respected Hughes' strong leadership style, which had been important in guiding the country through the war, although in describing the Nationalist Party's loss in the 1922 federal election, Garran later said that [...] "Hughes also overestimated his own hold on Parliament [...] his hold on the people was probably undiminished." ...|$|E
500|$|Alongside ghostwriter Don Moore, a pulp-fiction veteran, Raymond {{created the}} {{visually}} sumptuous science-fiction epic comic strip Flash Gordon. The duo also created the [...] "complementary strip, Jungle Jim, an adventurous saga set in South-East Asia", a topper which ran above Flash in some papers Raymond was concurrently illustrating Secret Agent X-9, which premiered January 22, 1934, {{two weeks after}} the two other strips. It was Flash Gordon that would outlast the others, quickly [...] "develop an audience far surpassing" [...] that of Buck Rogers. Flash Gordon, wrote Stephen Becker, [...] "was wittier and moved faster," [...] so [...] "Buck's position as America's favorite sci-fi hero", wrote historian Bill Crouch, Jr., [...] "went down in flames to the artistic lash and spectacle of Alex Raymond's virtuoso artwork." [...] Alex Raymond has stated, [...] "I decided honestly that comic art is an art form in itself. It reflects the life and times more accurately and actually is more artistic than magazine illustration—since it is entirely creative. An illustrator works with camera and models; a comic artist begins with a white <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> dreams up his own business—he is playwright, director, editor and artist at once." [...] A. E. Mendez has also stated that [...] "Raymond’s achievements are chopped into bite-sized pieces by the comic art cognoscenti. Lost in the worthwhile effort to distinguish comics as an art form, the romance, sweep and beauty of Raymond's draftsmanship, his incomparable line work, is dismissed. To many, it's just pretty pictures. Somehow or another, it's OK for people like Caniff and Eisner to borrow from film. That’s real storytelling. But for Raymond to study illustrators, well, that's just not comics." ...|$|E
50|$|In the Victorian era, {{broadside}} ballads were {{a popular}} type of broadside and were printed on thin <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> sold for a penny or half-penny in London.|$|R

50|$|Mykola Tseluiko {{painted with}} tempera <b>and</b> water-color on <b>paper.</b> Most his works were painted from nature: {{he took a}} sketchbox, a board, <b>and</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>and</b> went sketching. He painted very quickly in a single session.|$|R
2500|$|Thermal binding uses a {{one-piece}} {{cover with}} glue down the spine to {{quickly and easily}} bind documents {{without the need for}} punching. Individuals usually purchase [...] "thermal covers" [...] or [...] "therm-a-bind covers", which are usually made to fit a standard-size <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> come with a glue channel down the spine. The paper is placed in the cover, heated in a machine (basically a griddle), and when the glue cools, it adheres the paper to the spine. Thermal glue strips can also be purchased separately for individuals that wish to use customized/original covers. However, creating documents using thermal binding glue strips can be a tedious process, which requires a scoring device and a large-format printer.|$|E
2500|$|Block {{books are}} short books, 50 or fewer leaves, that were {{printed in the}} second half of the 15th century from wood blocks in which the text and {{illustrations}} were both cut. [...] Some block books, called chiro-xylographic (from the Greek cheir (χειρ) [...] "hand") contain only the printed illustrations, with the text added by hand. [...] Some books also were made with the illustrations printed from woodcuts, but the text printed from movable metal type, but are nevertheless considered block books because of their method of printing (only on one side of a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper)</b> <b>and</b> their close relation to [...] "pure" [...] block books. [...] Block books are categorized as incunabula, or books printed before 1501. [...] The only example of the blockbook form that contains no images is the school textbook Latin grammar of Donatus.|$|E
