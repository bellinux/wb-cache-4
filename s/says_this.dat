5|$|In 1 John 5:6 it has textual variant δι' ὕδατος καὶ αἵματος καὶ πνεύματος (through {{water and}} blood and spirit) {{together}} with the manuscripts: Codex Alexandrinus, 104, 424c, 614, 1739c, 2412, 2495, ℓ 598m, syrh, copsa, copbo, Origen. Bart D. Ehrman <b>says</b> <b>this</b> was a corrupt reading from the orthodox party, although this is widely disputed.|$|E

Olivia says she recognizes the victim as Raul Lugo from {{their time in the}} Marines together. Peter and Walter go to a local {{hardware}} store and buy an electric saw to cut the man out of the wall.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the terms}} were agreed to, Buffalo marked and was {{recorded}} as Pe-zhe-ke, {{head of the}} La Pointe delegation. Although Buffalo and the other Lake Superior chiefs signed, they {{were said to be}} relatively silent compared with the Mississippi Chippewa chiefs during the negotiations. Historian Satz <b>says</b> <b>this</b> symbolized disagreement rather than acceptance of the terms of the treaty. Lyman Warren, a trader and interpreter from La Pointe, later complained that the Pillagers (bands from present-day Minnesota) had been bribed into selling the lands rightfully belonging to the Wisconsin bands.|$|E

5|$|Ploughshare, triangular-shaped: Triangular-shaped stone ploughshares {{are found}} at the sites of Majiabang culture dated to 3500 BC around Lake Tai. Ploughshares have also been {{discovered}} at the nearby Liangzhu and Maqiao sites roughly dated to the same period. David R. Harris <b>says</b> <b>this</b> indicates that more intensive cultivation in fixed, probably bunded, fields had developed by this time. According to Mu Yongkang and Song Zhaolin's classification and methods of use, the triangular plough assumed many kinds and were the departure from the Hemudu and Luojiajiao spade, with the Songze small plough in mid-process. The post-Liangzhu ploughs used draft animals.|$|E
5|$|The final episode begins after Becky and Michael {{had slept}} {{together}} while house sitting for Tracy and Robert, and Michael hides {{in the bathroom}} when the latter couple return. Tracy phones a morning television phone-in show (hosted by Michael Thomas and Helen Atkinson-Wood, with appearances by Rachael Fielding and Jonathan Barlow), and when she realises that the show's divorce expert is hiding in her bathroom she takes on his role (with a heavy Northern accent, actually a slightly exaggerated version of Bennett's own voice) to give herself advice on the other line. Bennett <b>says</b> <b>this</b> was the hardest thing she has had to do in her career.|$|E
5|$|The group {{carried out}} their vocal overdubs during the {{afternoon}} of 18 October. Over the instrumental break and the outro, the harmonies consist of McCartney singing a third above and Lennon a tenth below Harrison's double-tracked lead vocal. During the same session, Ringo Starr added a tambourine part. Although some Beatles authors credit Martin as having played harmonium, Fontenot <b>says</b> <b>this</b> contribution is inaudible on the completed track. A mono mix of the song was made on 25 October, and a stereo mix on 26 October – the day the Beatles collected their MBEs from Buckingham Palace.|$|E

5|$|When Rome had {{received}} word of Germanicus' death, the people began observing a iustitium before the Senate had officially declared it. Tacitus <b>says</b> <b>this</b> shows the true grief {{that the people}} of Rome felt, and this also shows that by this time the people already knew the proper way to commemorate dead princes without an edict from a magistrate. At his funeral, there were no procession statues of Germanicus. There were abundant eulogies and reminders of his fine character and a particular eulogy was given by Tiberius himself in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In the Life of Probus, {{the author}} 'Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse' {{states that the}} Emperor's {{descendants}} (posteri) fled from Rome and settled near Verona. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus (supposedly writing under Constantine) <b>says</b> <b>this</b> prophecy has not yet come to pass. This {{is one of the}} strongest indications of the History's late 4th-century date, as {{it seems to be a}} fairly transparent allusion to the rich and powerful senator Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395. Petronius Probus was born in Verona.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending {{features}} a character named Ventus who bears a strong {{striking resemblance to}} him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus {{are not the same}} character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection. For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura <b>says</b> <b>this</b> will be {{explained by the fact that}} the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist at the same time as the original one.|$|E

5|$|Parsifal {{wonders if}} the Garden is a dream and asks {{how it is that}} Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (""), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had {{abandoned}} and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. He thinks himself very stupid to have forgotten her. Kundry <b>says</b> <b>this</b> realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand his mother's love. As they kiss Parsifal suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas' name: he feels the wounded king's pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony (""). Filled with this compassion, Parsifal rejects Kundry's advances.|$|E
5|$|Sociologist Reiner Grundmann's {{review in}} BioSocieties journal, {{acknowledges}} that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in {{a black and white}} manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He <b>says</b> <b>this</b> shows a lack of basic understanding of the political process and the mechanisms of knowledge policy, because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides all the (formal) hallmarks of science, Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} as Mr. and Mrs. Mallard fly over various {{potential}} {{locations around the}} city of Boston, Massachusetts (United States) to start a family. Each time Mr. Mallard selects a location, Mrs. Mallard finds something wrong with it. Tired from their search, the mallards land at the Public Garden Lagoon to spend the night. In the morning, a swan boat passes by the mallards. The mallards mistake the swan boat for a real bird and enjoy peanuts thrown by {{the people on the}} boat. Mrs. Mallard suggests that they build their nest in the Public Garden. However, just as she <b>says</b> <b>this,</b> her husband is nearly run down by a passing bicyclist. The mallards continue their search, flying over Boston landmarks such as Beacon Hill, the Massachusetts State House, and Louisburg Square. The Mallards finally decide on an island in the Charles River. From this island, the Mallards visit a policeman named Michael on the shore, who feeds them peanuts every day.|$|E

5|$|The time-line for Salamis is {{difficult}} to establish with any certainty. Herodotus presents the battle as though it occurred directly after the capture of Athens, but nowhere explicitly states as much. If Thermopylae/Artemisium occurred in September, then {{this may be the}} case, but it is probably more likely that the Persians spent two or three weeks capturing Athens, refitting the fleet, and resupplying. Clearly though, at some point after capturing Athens, Xerxes held a council of war with the Persian fleet; Herodotus <b>says</b> <b>this</b> occurred at Phalerum. Artemisia, queen of Halicarnassus and commander of its naval squadron in Xerxes's fleet, tried to convince him to wait for the Allies to surrender believing that battle in the straits of Salamis was an unnecessary risk. Nevertheless, Xerxes and his chief advisor Mardonius pressed for an attack.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{recorded}} that the Han Dynasty (202 BC– AD 220) court eunuch Cai Lun (50 AD– AD 121) invented the pulp papermaking process and established {{the use of}} new materials used in making paper, ancient padding and wrapping paper artifacts dating to the 2nd century BC {{have been found in}} China, the oldest example of pulp papermaking being a map from Fangmatan, Tianshui; by the 3rd century, paper as a writing medium was in widespread use, replacing traditional but more expensive writing mediums such as strips of bamboo rolled into threaded scrolls, strips of silk, wet clay tablets hardened later in a furnace, and wooden tablets. The earliest known piece of paper with writing on it was discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a Xiongnu attack. In the paper making process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into paste and stirred with water; a wooden frame sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of paper that were bleached under the exposure of sunlight; K.S. Tom <b>says</b> <b>this</b> process was gradually improved through leaching, polishing and glazing to produce a smooth, strong paper. Paper is used a lot.|$|E
