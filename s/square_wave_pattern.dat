Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively.

Although many models and theories have been proposed for how the brain extracts the angular speed of the retinal image, termed optic flow, we lack the detailed electrophysiological and behavioral data necessary to conclusively support any one model. One key property by which different models of motion detection can be differentiated is their spatiotemporal frequency tuning. Numerous studies have suggested that optic-flow-dependent behaviors are largely insensitive to the spatial frequency of a visual stimulus, but they have sampled only a narrow range of spatial frequencies, have not always used narrowband stimuli, and have yielded slightly different results between studies based on the behaviors being investigated.

40|$|The ideal {{magnetic}} switching {{mechanism for}} magnetic recording is isolated domain coherent rotation. However, in typical Pd/Co and Pt/Co multilayers with high coercivity, the dominant switching mechanism is domain wall motion, which causes {{noise in the}} readback signal. Wall motion, however requires exchange coupling between grains. Oxidation and carbon incorporation into Pd/Co multilayers have been investigated as ways of reducing the exchange coupling among adjacent grains. This reduction of magnetic coupling reduces the length scale over which incoherent switching occurs. Kelly-Hankel plots and switching radius ratio {{have been used to}} compare interactions and domain sizes of oxidized and carbon segregated Pd/Co multilayers. Both oxidation and carbon segregation reduce the coupling between domains, but the multilayers nevertheless remain more strongly coupled than perpendicular alloy films. A Pt/CoCrTa multilayer structure has been invented which display little intergranular exchange coupling and nearly 100 % remanence in the perpendicular direction. Magnetic recordings of continuous <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> <b>patterns</b> have been made and characterized using an inductive contact recording transducer and by magnetic force microscopy. Written transitions appear to retain good fidelity at more than 300, 000 transitions per inch.

Analysis of magnetic force microscopy images yields a signal to integrated noise ratio of 17 dB at 309, 000 transitions per inch written in a four micron wide track, which is comparable to a measured signal to noise ratio of 8 dB at 350, 000 reversals per inch measured using an inductive transducer at 100 inches/sec.

40|$|The {{modulation}} {{transfer function}} (MTF) {{of a medical}} imaging display is typically determined by measuring its response to <b>square</b> <b>waves</b> (bar <b>patterns),</b> white noise, and/or line stimuli. However, <b>square</b> <b>waves</b> and white noise methods involve capture and analysis of multiple images and are thus quite tedious. Measurement of the line-spread function (LSF) offers a good alternative. However, as previously reported, low-frequency response obtained from the LSF method {{is not as good}} as that obtained from measurement of edge-spread function (ESF). In this paper, we present two methods for evaluating the MTF of a medical imaging display from its ESF. High degree of accuracy in the higher frequency region (near the Nyquist frequency of the system) was achieved by reducing the noise. In the first method, whichis a variant of the Gans' original method, the periodic raster noise is reduced by subtracting a shifted ESF from the ESF. The second method employs a low-pass differentiator (LPD). A novel near maximally flat LPD with the desired cut-off frequency was designed for this purpose. Noise reduction in both the methods was alsoachieved by averaging over large portions of the image data to form the ESF. Experimental results show that the MTF obtained by these methods is comparable to that obtained from the <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> response.

40|$|Sensory neurons {{process and}} convey {{information}} about our surroundings, providing the physiological basis for how we {{interact with the}} external world. In order to understand neuronal responses we must identify the rules governing how sensory information is encoded. It was proposed {{more than fifty years}} ago that neural codes constitute efficient representations of the natural world (Attneave, 1954; Barlow, 1961). In an information maximization paradigm, an efficient coding strategy will match the encoded neural response to the statistics of the input signals. Adaptation of the stimulus-response function to the statistics of the stimulus is one way to efficiently encode a stimulus when the response range and resolution are limited compared to the entire range of stimulus probabilities (Laughlin, 1981). Recent work has indeed shown that adaptation to the input statistics can occur in real time (Smirnakis et al., 1997) and that this form of adaptation can be used to efficiently encode the stimulus and maximize information transmission (Brenner et al., 2000). In this work I examined the mechanisms of dynamic adaptation in fly motion vision. The H 1 -cell is a large field tangential cell of the blowfly visual system that responds to motion in a directionally selective way. It also adapts its response properties to the second order statistics of an apparent motion stimulus (Fairhall et al., 2001). I measured the adaptation of the H 1 -cell to the variance and temporal correlations of a Gaussian low-pass filtered velocity signal that directed a sine wave visual grating. I found that the H 1 -cell adapted the slope, or gain, and range of its input-output function to the variance of the velocity signal over two orders of magnitude. The H 1 -cell also adapted its response properties to the low-pass filter time constant of the velocity signal over one order of magnitude. I compared the adaptation between flies by normalizing the gain of the stimulus-response function by the gain of the stimulus-response function during steady-state firing properties. This “dynamic gain” decreased as the velocity variance increased and broadened to cover the larger range of velocities. In contrast, as the time constant of the velocity fluctuations increased, the dynamic gain increased. The results of these experiments were then compared with simulations of the correlation-type or Reichardt motion detector model. The Reichardt detector is an algorithmic model for motion detection that explains the behavior of directionally selective large-field tangential cells in flies including the H 1 -cell, as well as directionally selective motion vision in humans (Zanker, 1996; Borst and Egelhaaf, 1989). The Reichardt detector model showed the same adaptive properties as the H 1 -cell in response to the same stimuli. Reichardt detector adaptation occurred without changing any of the model parameters; it was an automatic function of the dynamics of the model. This suggested that the mathematical properties of the Reichardt detector provide a mechanism for adaptation in the H 1 -cell of the blowfly. This adaptation was further characterized in both the Reichardt detector model and the H 1 -cell. The time course of this form of velocity adaptation in the H 1 -cell was examined by switching between two different variances and two different low-pass filter time constants of the velocity signal. The H 1 -cell adapted to the statistics or the time course of the new velocity signal within two seconds after the switch. The Reichardt detector showed a similar time course for adaptation as in the experiments. The effect of the visual pattern on adaptation was also examined, using a <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> <b>pattern</b> in addition to the sine wave used previously. The visual pattern affects the output of an array of Reichardt motion detectors and may therefore affect adaptation in the system. The overall shape of the adaptation function with respect to the stimulus variance was not different between the two stimulus patterns. In the experiments, the H 1 -cell showed a consistently higher dynamic gain with a <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> <b>pattern.</b> The Reichardt detector model, however, had a lower dynamic gain when the <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> <b>pattern</b> was presented. After careful investigation of the potential causes of this discrepancy I found that the steady-state firing rate of the H 1 -cell saturated when a <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> <b>pattern</b> was used, thereby altering the normalization under experimental conditions that was not accounted for in the simulations. These results suggest that contrast saturation is an important feature of fly motion vision that has not been explained by the Reichardt detector model. The Reichardt detector provides an automatic mechanism and mathematical explanation for adaptation in the fly visual system involving the nature of the incoming visual signals and the non-linearity in the motion detector model. Interestingly, the gradient detector model, although it is also non-linear, does not display automatic adaptation. It {{remains to be seen whether}} this type of adaptation is prominent in other sensory systems and whether it leads to and efficient and accurate representation of the natural world...|$|E

40|$|Prior studies {{ascribed}} people’s {{poor performance}} in dealing with basic systems concepts to different causes. While results indicate that, among other things, domain specific experience and familiarity with the problem context {{play a role in}} this stock-flow-(SF-) performance, this has not yet been fully clarified. In this article, we present an experiment that examines the role of educational background in SF-performance. We hypothesize that SF-performance increases when the problem context is embedded in the problem solver’s knowledge domain, indicated by educational background. Using the <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> <b>pattern</b> and the sawtooth pattern tasks from the initial study by Booth Sweeney and Sterman (2000), we design two additional cover stories for the former, the Vehicle story from the engineering domain and the Application story from the business domain, next to the original Bathtub story. We then test the three sets of questions on business students. Results mainly support our hypothesis. Interestingly, participants even do better on a more complex behavioral pattern from their knowledge domain than on a simpler pattern from more distant domains. Although these findings have to be confirmed by further studies, they contribute both to the methodology of future surveys and the context familiarity discussion...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{refractive}} blur upon postural stability was investigated under three conditions: normal standing, standing with {{input from the}} somatosensory system disrupted and standing with input from the somatosensory and vestibular systems disrupted. Standing stability was assessed using the centre of pressure (COP) signal from force plate data in four young subjects (mean 23. 9 ± 3. 1 years) and five repeated sets of measurements were taken. The subjects looked straight ahead at a horizontal and vertical <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> <b>pattern</b> of 2. 5 cycles (degree) ¿ 1. Under {{each of the three}} test conditions, standing stability was measured with the optimal refractive correction and under binocular blur levels of 0, + 1, + 2, + 4, and + 8 D and with eyes closed. In the normal standing condition, dioptric blur had only a mild effect on postural stability. However refractive blur produced large increases in postural instability when input from {{one or both of the}} other two sensory systems were disrupted. We hypothesized that dioptric blur would have an even great effect on postural stability if the visual target used was of higher spatial frequency. This was confirmed by repeated measurements on one subject using a target of 8 cycles (degree) ¿ 1. The study highlights the possible importance of an optimal correction to postural stability, particular in situations (or people) where input from the somatosensory and/or vestibular systems are disrupted, and where the visual surrounds are of high spatial frequency...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to compare the performance of i-gel supraglottic airway with cLMA in difficult airway management in post burn neck contracture patients and assess the feasibility of i-gel use for emergency airway management in difficult airway situation with reduced neck movement and limited mouth opening. Methods: Prospective, crossover, randomized controlled trial was performed amongst forty eight post burn neck contracture patients with limited mouth opening and neck movement. i-gel and cLMA were placed in random order in each patient. Primary outcome was overall success rate. Other measurements were time to successful ventilation, airway leak pressure, fiberoptic glottic view, visualization of <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> <b>pattern.</b> Results: Success rate for the i-gel was 91. 7 % versus 79. 2 % for the cLMA. i-gel required shorter insertion time (19. 3 seconds vs. 23. 5 seconds, P= 0. 000). Airway leak pressure difference was statistically significant (i-gel 21. 2 cm H 20; cLMA 16. 9 cm H 2 0; P= 0. 00). Fiberoptic view through the i-gel showed there were less epiglottic downfolding and better fiberoptic view of the glottis than cLMA. Overall agreement in insertion outcome for i-gel was 22 / 24 (91. 7 %) successes and 2 / 24 (8. 3 %) failure and for cLMA, 19 / 24 (79. 16 %) successes and 5 / 24 (16. 7 %) failure in the first attempt. Conclusion: The i-gel is cheap, effective airway device which is easier to insert and has better clinical performance in the difficult airway management of the airway in the post burn contracture of the neck. Our study shows that i-gel is feasible for emergency airway management in difficult airway situation with reduced neck movement and limited mouth opening in post burn neck...|$|E
