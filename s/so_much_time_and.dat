Xtra! asserted that Egale was devoting <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> effort to advocacy around same-sex marriage that it was missing the boat on other important issues.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the army that Reza Shah had spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> effort creating was humiliating. Many of the military generals had behaved incompetently or secretly sympathised with the British and ended up sabotaging the Iranian resistance. The army generals met in secret to discuss surrender options. When the Shah learned of the generals' actions, he beat {{the head of the}} armed forces General Ahmad Nakhjavan with a cane and physically stripped him of his rank. He was nearly shot by the Shah on the spot, but at the insistence of the Crown Prince, he was sent to prison instead.|$|E

25|$|The Department of Justice {{decision}} to not prosecute Presser prompted members of Congress {{to investigate the}} handling of the politically sensitive case. Some congressmen were concerned that Presser's close political ties to the Reagan administration had led to favorable treatment, while others wanted to know why <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> so many resources had been expended when DOJ had no intention of prosecuting Presser. Additionally, many members of Congress had spent years telling voters that the Teamsters were corrupt, and now voters were demanding an answer as to why Presser was not being called to account. DOJ defended its actions by pointing to Presser's long-time role as a criminal informant, but members of Congress were unhappy that DOJ seemed willing tolerate corruption in the nation's largest labor movement. Senators William V. Roth, Jr. (R-Delaware) and Sam Nunn (D-Georgia) ordered the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) to look into {{the handling of the}} case, and Senator Joe Biden (D-Delaware) asked the Judiciary Committee to probe the matter. The PSI quickly asked the FBI, DOJ and DOL to turn over their files on the Presser probe.|$|E
500|$|Hańska {{lived with}} Balzac's mother {{for a time}} after his death, in the house he had spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> expense furnishing. The elder Mme. Balzac moved in with a friend after several months, and Hańska {{approached}} the remains of her late husband's writing. Several works had been left incomplete, and publishers inquired about releasing a final edition of his grand collection La Comédie humaine. Hańska sponsored new editions of his works and was involved in editing some of them, even adding occasional content. Balzac's debt, meanwhile, still exceeded 200,000 francs, which Hańska paid while also providing for his mother's living expenses. One of her letters at the time gives voice to her frustrations: [...] "In nursing my husband's incurable malady I ruined my health, just as I have ruined my private fortune in accepting the inheritance of debts and embarrassments which he left me." [...] Anna and Jerzy moved into a nearby house in Paris.|$|E
500|$|On 7 February 1979, {{just five}} days after Vicious's death, {{hearings}} began in London on Lydon's lawsuit. Cook and Jones were allied with McLaren, but as evidence mounted that their manager had poured {{virtually all of the}} band's revenue into his beloved film project, they switched sides. On 14 February, the court put the film and its soundtrack into receivership—no longer under McLaren's control, they were now to be administered as exploitable assets for addressing the band members' financial claims. McLaren, with substantial personal debts and legal fees, took off for Paris to sign a record deal for an LP of standards, including [...] "Non, je ne regrette rien". A month later, back in London, he disassociated himself from the film to which he had devoted <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money. McLaren went on to manage Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow. In the mid-1980s he released a number of successful and influential records as a solo artist, including the UK's first ever hip-hop chart single, [...] "Buffalo Gals".|$|E

60|$|It had not escaped me that, {{though the}} virtuoso was evidently {{a man of}} high cultivation, yet he seemed to lack sympathy with the spiritual, the sublime, and the tender. Apart from the whim that had led him to devote <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time,</b> pains, <b>and</b> expense to the {{collection}} of this museum, he impressed me {{as one of the}} hardest and coldest men of the world whom I had ever met.|$|R
500|$|The {{winter of}} 1941–1942 {{ended up being}} mild through all of December and most of January and workers were able to {{continue}} work on the church until January 27, 1942. On January 4, 1941 a blizzard carried [...] winds and left [...] of snow. The blizzard forced workers inside the church. Camarata became the director of excavations, concrete, block, brick, stone and marble works, steel structures, road-grading, electric and plumbing systems, carpentry, and landscaping. John Stanish was now his assistant. He built marble grinders, hoisting devices, marble cutters, and marble sanders. He worked with much machinery, including bulldozers, steam-shovels, grading-tractors, and steam-rollers. Stanish collected marble, iron and bronze grilles, electric and plumbing equipment, lumber, panels, light fixtures, paint, chemicals, and ceiling and floor materials from Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York. <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> effort was put in by this one man. [...] As a token of the parish's gratitude to him, an inscription {{was placed in the}} main vestibule of Mt. St. Peter Church, on the right, going down into the Marble Hall (downstairs of the church). The Latin inscription reads, Joannes Stanish Res Procuravit (John Stanish procured the material).|$|E
500|$|Musician and ambient music pioneer Brian Eno has {{praised the}} album and said, {{regarding}} the song [...] "Soon", that [...] "t {{set a new}} standard for pop. It's the vaguest music ever {{to have been a}} hit." [...] Robert Smith of The Cure discovered Loveless after a period of almost exclusively listening to [...] "disco, or Irish bands like the Dubliners" [...] as a means of avoiding his contemporaries, and said, [...] " [...] was the first band I heard who quite clearly pissed all over us, and their album Loveless is certainly one of my all-time three favourite records. It's the sound of someone [...] who is so driven that they're demented. And the fact that they spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money on it is so excellent." [...] Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins told Spin, [...] "It's rare in guitar-based music that somebody does something new [...] At the time, everybody was like, 'How the fuck are they doing this?' And, of course, it's way simpler than anybody would imagine." [...] Trey Anastasio of jam band Phish believed that [...] "Loveless [...] the best album recorded in the '90s", and wanted his band to cover the album in its entirety for a Halloween show. Robert Pollard of indie rock band Guided by Voices acknowledged the album as a source of inspiration, noting, [...] "Sometimes when I want to write lyrics, I'll listen to Loveless. Because of the way the vocals are buried, you can almost listen to the songs as if they're instrumental pieces." [...] Loveless has also been said by Jim DeRogatis to have been a considerable influence on British band Radiohead.|$|E
500|$|Throughout Venice's old possessions, {{but above}} all in the Ionian islands, {{the memory of the}} Republic is deeply rooted in the population, who recall it with a shade of nostalgia even after <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> so many events. Because of the long Venetian period, the manners and traditions of the {{inhabitants}} of the Ionian Islands are a mixture of Greek and Italian. The Venetian influence is illustrated in all aspects of culture and everyday life. In 1800 the Septinsular Republic was established; its flag design was based on the flag of the Republic of Venice. In addition, Italian was the co-official language of both the Septinsular Republic and the United States of the Ionian Islands. Because of its status, Italian was also taught at schools along with Greek and English (Ionian Islands were a protectorate of the United Kingdom from 1815 until 1864). In the First Year of the secondary education, for instance, Greek was taught four times a week, Italian three times and English twice. In the Greek Census of 1907, 4,675 people from the Ionian Islands stated Catholicism as their denomination, about 1.8% of the total population (254,494), while 2,541 (1%) Ionians stated Italian as their mother tongue, making it the second language by number of speakers. The Italian language remains popular on the islands. The Hellenic Union of Eptanisians, a civil non-profit company working for the promotion of the Heptanesian Culture, objected to the decision of the Ministry to abolish the teaching of Italian in schools, saying that [...] "especially for the Ionian Islands the selection of the Italian language has become a tradition for their schools, but also a necessary language because of the many tourists from Italy and other relations e.g. cultural, commercial, etc., of the islands with the country" [...] and they propose [...] "respect for the choice of the children and recognition of their right to learn the language they want and especially the Italian as it's the language with the greatest preference on the Ionian Islands".|$|E

50|$|After {{spending}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> together, <b>and</b> lots of arguments, misunderstandings and denial, Falco and Helena {{fall in love}} (and subsequently consummate this in a horse stable, in {{a public}} garden). Eventually, Falco sorts out the case and only has to bring the culprits to justice. However, there is no justice, {{as one of the}} culprits is Domitian, the Emperor's wayward son, and the only other surviving culprit is very close to Helena and her senator father.|$|R
2500|$|Susan Sulley {{said that}} the {{rejection}} of Secrets was [...] "the lowest the band had been since 1992 and after putting in <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> effort in to an album that then failed, nearly causing them {{to call it a}} day." ...|$|E
2500|$|ABC {{executive}} producer Julie Hanan Carruthers later explained {{in an interview}} what the writers were going for with the storyline. Carruthers said, [...] "When Megan [...] {{came up with this}} whole concept, it was about, 'How do we emotionally impact [...] all the people we care about?' And obviously high stakes, and life-or-death stakes, really raise the bar of emotion. When you can tap into the personal relationships and the love and the caring and also the hopes and fears of all these people we've invested <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> support in, you have compelling storytelling." ...|$|E
2500|$|An early {{source of}} {{ammunition}} {{for both sides}} of the debate was a 1940 interview of Whitehead's wife Louise. The Bridgeport Sunday Post reported that Mrs. Whitehead said her husband's first words upon returning home from Fairfield on 14 August 1901, were an excited, [...] "Mama, we went up!" [...] Mrs. Whitehead said her husband was always busy with motors and flying machines when he was not working in coal yards or factories. The interview quoted her as saying, [...] "I hated to see him put <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money into that work." [...] Mrs. Whitehead said her husband's aviation efforts took their toll on the family budget and she had to work to help meet expenses. She said she never saw any of her husband's reported flights.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} on February 7, 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Palin if she supported repeal of [...] "don't ask, don't tell", the United States military policy which restricts efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. Palin responded, [...] "I don't think so right now. I was surprised that the President spent time on that in his State of the Union speech when he only spent about 9 percent {{of his time in}} the State of the Union on national security issues. And I say that because there are other things to be worried about right now with the military. I think that kind of on the back burner is sufficient for now. To put <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> effort and politics into it– unnecessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie [...] "Hex" [...] Bendixsen (Series 5–12) {{took over}} the role from Junglist in time for series 5. Bendixsen had also auditioned for ABC3, but won the role on Good Game after {{approaching}} Bajo at Supanova as a fan, and being told Good Game was looking for someone. She sent {{in a series of}} reviews, the style of which she said she already knew how to do having already watched the show for a couple of years. She later did a screen test and ended up getting the job [...] "quite quickly". Her first episode was on 26 October 2009. Hex got into games relatively late as she did not have a gaming household. Her first games were MUDs – specifically the game Lensmoor which she started playing at age 15), and enjoyed as it was like [...] "collectively writing a book". Hex says she is okay with the harder parts of production as they are a part of her job. She said she finds great satisfaction in seeing a completed show go to air as <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> love has gone into it. Hex states that, [...] "The only thing that's sometimes difficult is that I have less time to play the games that I want to play recreationally, because the games I'm reviewing for work take priority." [...] While she is happy to weigh in on gender-related issues, she also acknowledges that she {{does not want to be}} a [...] "poster girl" [...] for it and instead wants to be thought of as [...] "a PERSON who just enjoys gaming".|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} is now generally discouraged since {{it affects the}} educational performance of school children. Top fighters can fetch up to 100 pesos (US$ 2), making the sport lucrative for children. They could spend <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> hunting <b>and</b> training spiders that lessons and homework are neglected. Adults also play the sport {{but in a way}} similar to cockfighting. Derbies are also held and bets could go as high as 50,000 pesos (about US$1,000). The cheaper maintenance cost of raising spiders compared to raising fighting cocks caused some players to switch to spider fighting.|$|R
50|$|There {{were reports}} that PBL deal that Max Markson {{negotiated}} would bring in more than $200,000 for Natasha Ryan, prompting {{a discussion about the}} ethics of Ryan accepting the money when <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time,</b> effort <b>and</b> money was spent on the search for her, and the police investigation. Rockhampton SES volunteer Lyle Dobbs expressed his view that any profit Ryan gained from her interviews should go back to Queensland taxpayers who funded the search which came at significant cost to police and a lot of effort from SES volunteers.|$|R
