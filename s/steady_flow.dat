Two decades later, Vlad III the Impaler (1448, 14561462, 1476), notorious as the model for the Dracula legend, turned against the Ottoman Empire. He carried out a series of attacks across the Danube in the winter of 14611462. The response was a massive invasion led by Mehmed II who drove Vlad III from the throne and replaced him with his brother, Radu III the Fair (14621475).

5|$|Various {{concepts}} were mooted for the A-4's deployment in a March 1942 {{study by}} Walter Dornberger, {{the head of}} the A-4 development project at the Peenemünde Army Research Center. He suggested that the missiles should be based in heavily defended fixed sites of a bunker-style design similar to the massive submarine pens then under construction in occupied France and Norway. The rockets could be stored in such sites, armed, fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant, and launched. This offered significant technical advantages; not only would the LOX loss be minimised, but the complex process of pre-launch testing would be simplified. A high rate of fire could be sustained as the facility could effectively operate like a production line, sending a <b>steady</b> <b>flow</b> of missiles to the launch pads.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{lifetime}} the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the <b>steady</b> <b>flow</b> of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 'the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1925, Pflueger {{designed}} a , 28-story, step-back skyscraper made of brick framed with steel, {{along the lines}} of his just-completed Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building. Its main decorative theme was neo-Gothic, expressed strongly in the three Gothic arches which formed the main street-level entrance for the church. The Great Hall, the large worship area located within the second, third and fourth floors was to seat 1,500 churchgoers and a smaller chapel was designed for 125 more. A grand pipe organ from Skinner Organ Company was installed with four manuals controlling 3,881 pipes. A stained glass window was placed 80 feet above the sanctuary, representing Faith, Love and Hope in three tall, narrow panels. Two assembly halls could be combined to hold 1,100 attendees for theatrical or athletic events. Some 500 guest rooms and 32 tower apartments were intended to bring a <b>steady</b> <b>flow</b> of visitors and a source of profit to the church.

40|$|The scale {{heights of}} {{stratification}} and the widths of steady solar coronal loops exhibit properties unexplained by standard theory: observed scale heights are often {{much greater than}} static theory predicts, while the nearly-constant widths of loop emission signatures defy theoretical expectations for large flux tubes in stratified media. In this work we relate the cross-sectional profile of a coronal flux tube to its density scale height in steady-state plasma <b>flow</b> regimes. <b>Steady</b> <b>flows</b> may shorten or lengthen the scale height according to how the tube cross-sectional area varies with arclength. In a near-potential corona the flux tubes {{are expected to be}} sufficiently expansive in many active regions for scale heights to be increased by <b>steady</b> <b>flows.</b> On the other hand, cases where scale lengths are actually increased to observed sizes form {{a small part of the}} solution space, close to regimes where density profiles reverse. Therefore, although <b>steady</b> <b>flows</b> are the only steady process known to be capable of extending scale heights significantly, they are not expected to be not responsible for the majority of extended active region scale heights...|$|R

At the same time, the 1st Ukrainian Front (now commanded by Ivan Konev) and the 1st Belorussian Front's left wing (which had been uncommitted thus far) opened up a fresh offensive against Army Group North Ukraine. In this battle, the First Panzer Army managed to hold the line east of Lvov using Model's defensive tactics, but was forced to retreat when the Fourth Panzer Army, weakened by the <b>steady</b> <b>flow</b> of units to Army Group Centre, was unable to stem the Soviet penetrations of its front.

Several new vents with no travertine mound were actively releasing carbon dioxide gas in 2015. Analysis of the carbon-13 isotope in the carbon dioxide gas emissions suggest a magmatic origin. This has led to the possibility of a volcanic geothermal system, the existence of which has been investigated by Geoscience BC as part of their Targeting Resources for Exploration and Knowledge project. The lack of hot springs and geothermal evidence on the surface suggest that the heat source of such a system would be very deep underground.|$|E

We observe three major regimes: arresting <b>flows,</b> <b>steady</b> uniform <b>flows</b> and ac-celerating flows. For flows over a smooth base, other (quasi-steady) regimes are observed: for small inclinations the flow can be highly energetic and strongly layered in depth; where-as, for large inclinations it can be non-uniform and oscillat-ing. For <b>steady</b> uniform <b>flows,</b> depth profiles of density, ve-locity and stress are obtained using an improved coarse-graining method, which provides accurate statistics even {{at the base of}} the flow. A shallow-layer model for granular flows is completed with macro-scale closure relations ob-tained from micro-scale DPM simulations of <b>steady</b> <b>flows.</b> We obtain functional relations for effective basal friction, shape factor, mean density, and the normal stress anisotropy as functions of layer thickness, flow velocity and basal rough-ness...|$|R
