Squalus acanthias fisheries are largely unmanaged and/or poorly monitored in several other parts of its range, where inter-national trade demand for its high value meat is likely to increase {{as a result of the}} closure of EU fisheries.

All countries must abide by this law. In addition, a country may choose to create a national law or program in order to further provide methods to make sure this species is protected. For example, the English government rewards farmers who replant hedges. Hopefully, this will increase available shrubbery for dormice to occupy. Another program is administered by English Nature. This is a reintroduction program whose purpose is to place captive-bred dormice in locations where the population has been dwindling. In addition to these programs, the UK has created a National Dormouse Monitoring Programme. Its main purpose is to observe hazel dormice.

The population size and geographical {{distribution of the}} species were monitored for three years. C. lochiae was recorded in ten locations and S. morrisii was recorded in five locations. C. lochiae occurs in Pinus forests with/without Quercus alnifolia understory or in forest margins and riparian vegetation with Platanus orientalis. Favorable habitat of S. morrisii is the understory of Quercus infectoria stands and the Pistacia terebinthus-Quercus coccifera-Styrax officinalis shrubs. The distribution pattern of the species seems to follow habitat availability. Fecundity and Relative Reproductive Success of C. lochiae were stable and low, while in S. morrisii were constantly high. The lack of pollinators {{seems to be the}} main cause of the low sexual reproduction of C. lochiae. The germination strategy for both species is dependent on temperature.

The ultimate objective is to get all habitat types (of Annex I of the Habitats Directive) and <b>species</b> (of <b>Annexes</b> II, III and IV of the Habitats Directive and Annex I of the Birds Directive) in a favourable conservation status. In the Netherlands a national ecological network {{has been set up}} for this purpose which includes the designated Natura 2000 sites. The current amount of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, acidification and desiccation were compared with limit values per habitat type for nitrogen deposition load, soil pH and spring groundwater table respectively and subsequently presented together in one map. Fragmentation was tested for 80 species. For two-third of the examined natural surface the critical load for nitrogen deposition is exceeded, desiccation is present in over 90 % of the area of groundwater dependent nature. Problems with acidification are less pronounced. Fragmentation is present causing regional problems for up to six species. When the four pressures are combined, about two third of the areas suffer from at least one pressure. Many areas suffer from a combination of nitrogen deposition and desiccation.

40|$|Biogenic {{detritic}} beds with {{accumulation of}} free-living calcareous algae, known as “maërl” or “rhodoliths”, {{are one of}} the most biodiversity-rich habitats in the Mediterranean Sea. Rhodoliths form a perennial, heterogeneous habitat that houses a complex structural and functional community, helping to create an ecosystem with high species diversity, as well as a nursery area, food and shelter for many species of commercial interest. The importance of this habitat has determined its designation as habitat of Community importance of the Barcelona Convention and the inclusion of some of its constituent <b>species</b> in <b>Annex</b> V of the Habitats Directive (92 / 43) of the European Union. Maërl/rhodolith beds are threatened by human impacts; among them, bottom trawl fishing is a major cause of disturbance. However other fisheries may also produce impacts. The trammel-net, one of the most traditional fishing gears in the Mediterranean, is widely used by artisanal fleets to catch various species of high commercial value, including the European spiny lobster Palinurus elephas (Fabricius, 1787) and the red scorpionfish Scorpaena scrofa Linnaeus, 1758, and its impacts on maërl habitats are poorly known. The ubiquity of fishing activities over maërl beds has hampered research on their impacts for lack of reference values of a pristine state. Maërl / rhodoliths beds are characteristic of the Marine Reserve Columbretes Islands (NW Mediterranean). The reserve, 30 miles away from the coast and with an extension of 55 km, is protected from extractive activities since its creation in 1990, while both bottom trawl and artisanal fisheries continue to operate in its surroundings.
