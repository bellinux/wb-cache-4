5|$|Disregarding the dates, most historians agree {{upon the}} same <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> for {{this part of}} the Sacred War.

Thus, Buckler (as well as Beloch and Cloche) dates Neon to 355 BC, Methone to 355–354 BC, Philip's first Thessalian campaign to 354 BC, and his second to 353 BC. Conversely, Cawkwell, Sealey, Hammond and others give these dates as occurring one year later, beginning with Neon in 354 BC.|$|E

Holland's disregard for procedures governing the safe operation of the B-52 aircraft that he commanded {{and the absence of}} firm and consistent corrective action by his superior officers allowed Holland to believe that he could conduct his flight in an unsafe manner, culminating with the slow, steeply banked, 360° turn around the control tower.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> {{during the}} {{injection}} mould {{of a plastic}} part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} investigation {{concluded that}} the crash was attributable primarily to three factors: Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders' delayed or inadequate reactions to earlier incidents involving Holland, and the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> during the aircraft's final flight. The crash is now used in military and civilian aviation environments {{as a case study}} in teaching crew resource management. It is also often used by the U.S. Armed Forces during aviation safety training {{as an example of the}} importance of compliance with safety regulations and correcting the behavior of anyone who violates safety procedures.|$|E

5|$|At {{some time}} between his {{coronation}} and his death, Darius left a tri-lingual monumental relief on Mount Behistun, {{which was written}} in Elamite, Old Persian and Babylonian. The inscription begins with a brief autobiography including his ancestry and lineage. To aid the presentation of his ancestry, Darius wrote down the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> that occurred {{after the death of}} Cyrus the Great. Darius mentions several times that he is the rightful king by the grace of Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian god. In addition, further texts and monuments from Persepolis have been found, as well as a clay tablet containing an Old Persian cuneiform of Darius from Gherla, Romania (Harmatta) and a letter from Darius to Gadates, preserved in a Greek text of the Roman period.|$|E

What is certain is that Carrouges encountered his rival Jacques Le Gris at the court of Count Pierre and words were exchanged, although what was said is unknown. In contrast to his bankrupt rival, Le Gris had not been on the Scottish expedition and had grown wealthier in Carrouges' absence. Le Gris also had a reputation as a fierce and strong soldier in addition to that of a notorious womaniser, a reputation that may have played a part in the allegations which followed.|$|E
5|$|From the {{conflicting}} {{accounts of the}} sources, historians have tried to reconstruct the most likely <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> {{leading up to the}} battle. It is probable that Olaf Tryggvason was indeed sailing from Wendland to Norway when he was ambushed, though the kings' sagas probably play up the importance of Thyri and her marriages. While it is possible that Olaf was collecting dowry, it seems more probable that he was expecting war and seeking allies in Wendland, but met with little success. The character of Sigvaldi remains enigmatic, though there is evidence from skaldic poetry that he did indeed betray Olaf.|$|E

5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes {{that the}} events in Völuspá {{occurring}} {{after the death of}} the gods (the sun turning black, steam rising, flames touching the heavens, etc.) may be inspired by the volcanic eruptions on Iceland. Records of eruptions on Iceland bear strong similarities to the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> described in Völuspá, especially the eruption at Laki that occurred in 1783. Bertha Phillpotts theorizes that the figure of Surtr was inspired by Icelandic eruptions, and that he was a volcano demon. Surtr's name occurs in some Icelandic place names, among them the lava tube caves Surtshellir, a number of dark caverns in the volcanic central region of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Keen to {{strengthen}} Bolton for a European push in the 2006–07 season, Allardyce signed France international striker Nicolas Anelka from Fenerbahçe for a club record £8million. He also signed Ivory Coast defender Abdoulaye Méïté from Marseille, {{and in an}} unusual <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> made a £400,000 profit on Dietmar Hamann, who {{changed his mind about}} joining Bolton and signed with Manchester City a day after signing a pre-contract agreement with Bolton; Manchester City agreed to pay Bolton £400,000 in compensation. However Allardyce's relationship with chairman Phil Gartside became increasingly strained as Gartside refused to sanction greater transfer spending to finance a push for UEFA Champions League qualification. On 29 April 2007, Allardyce resigned with the club in fifth place with two games of the season left to play, and the following day his assistant Sammy Lee was announced as his replacement.|$|E

40|$|The {{method of}} decoherent {{histories}} allows probabilities {{to be assigned}} to <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> quantum <b>events</b> in systems, such as the universe as a whole, {{where there is no}} external observer to make measurements. This paper applies the method of decoherent histories to address cosmological questions. Using a series of simple examples, beginning with the harmonic oscillator, we show that systems in a stationary state such as an energy eigenstate or thermal state can exhibit decoherent histories with non-trivial dynamics. We then examine decoherent histories in a universe that undergoes eternal inflation. Decoherent histories that assign probabilities to <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> in the vicinity of a timelike geodesic supply a natural cosmological measure. Under reasonable conditions, such <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> do not suffer from the presence of unlikely statistical fluctuations that mimic reality. Comment: 18 pages, plain Te...|$|R

5|$|Only 4.46% of the {{recreational}} diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable {{to a single}} contributory cause.

The study also concluded that it would be impossible to completely eliminate all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.|$|E

On 2 September, Watford confirmed the appointment of former Brighton & Hove Albion head coach Óscar García as the successor to Sannino, beating off competition from fellow Championship side Leeds United for his services. García, however, resigned from his position on 29 September 2014 for health reasons, having been admitted to hospital with chest pains a couple of weeks prior. Billy McKinlay, who had only been appointed first team coach on 26 September 2014, was appointed as his immediate successor on the same day – his first position in management. A week later, McKinlay was released by mutual consent and former Partizan coach Slaviša Jokanović appointed in his place, apparently because the club favoured a head coach with greater experience.|$|E
