Preventing the propagation of methane or coal dust explosions through the use of active explosion-suppression systems {{remains one of the most}} underutilised explosion controls in underground coal mines. As part of the effort to develop better technologies to safeguard mines, the use of active barrier systems was investigated at Kloppersbos in South Africa. The system is designed to meet the requirements of the European Standard (EN 14591 - 4 : 2007) (European Standard, 2007), as well as the Mine Safety Standardisation in the Ministry of Coal Industry, Coal Industrial Standard (MT 694 - 1997) of the People’s Republic of China. From the tests conducted, it can be concluded that the HS Suppression System was successful in stopping flame propagation for a methane explosion, as well preventing methane explosions from progressing into methane and coal dust hybrid explosions when ammonium phosphate powder was used as the suppression material. The use of this barrier can provide coal mine management with an additional explosion control close to the point of ignition and may find application within longwall faces, further protecting mines against the risk of an explosion propagating...|$|R

The tests were conducted in a three- entry section of the LLEM. Two types of explosions were used {{to evaluate the}} distributed and concentrated bagged barrier performance in a multi-entry mine section. The fuel zone of the first explosion type was only in the center B-drift. In the second explosion type, coal and <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> mixtures were place in all three drifts. A total of six explosions, including two baseline and four barrier evaluation explosions, were conducted. Of the four barrier explosions, the distributed and concentrated barriers were each evaluated against the two explosion types. For these explosion tests, the distributed barrier extended from about 74 to 170 m and the concentrated barrier from about 74 to 104 m in B-drift. The distributed barrier successfully stopped flame propagation in both types of explosion tests. The flame extended further for the explosion tests where the dust was loaded in all three entries compared with dust loaded only in the center entry% but in both cases the flame was stopped within the barrier zone. The concentrated barrier was also successful in stopping flame propagation m both explosion tests. From the full-scale experimental mine test results, it can be concluded that both bagged barrier designs were effective in stopping coal dust explosions in the multiple entries of the LLEM...|$|R

Fly ash {{was replaced by}} Lime <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> in various proportions (10 % and 15 %) where Fly ash was used as source material for {{synthesis of}} geopolymer. Sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solutions were mixed maintaining a silicate modulus (Na 2 O / SiO 2) at 1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury intrusion porosimetry was carried out to characterize the geopolymer specimens. Compressive strength and water absorption were also tested on geopolymer pastes.

In the current work, laboratory scale fluidized bed experiments and process simulations were conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process. The experimental work concluded that oxidation of ventilation air methane in the <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process can be successfully achieved at temperatures between 500 and 650 °C. The experimental results indicated that oxidation of methane was found to increase at higher temperatures while carbon dioxide capture efficiency showed a declining trend with increasing temperature. Furthermore, higher methane conversion and optimum (thermodynamic) carbon dioxide capture efficiency were observed for lower ventilation air methane flow rates and higher bed inventory. The concentration of methane in ventilation air methane and <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> particle size did not {{have a significant effect on}} methane conversion or carbon dioxide capture. Also, comparison with synthetically prepared CuO and Fe 2 O 3 catalysts has been made with CaO for VAM oxidation. CaO was found to be comparable to Fe 2 O 3 and superior to CuO. From the process simulations, it was concluded that thermal energy generation in the carbonator was increased with higher methane and carbon dioxide concentrations. However, at the same time for higher methane and carbon dioxide concentrations, a greater CaO flux was required in the carbonator and hence a larger amount of goaf gas was required for the calcination reaction. The higher thermal energy generation in the carbonator was expected to improve the autothermicity of the <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process at concentrations of methane in the ventilation stream < 0. 2 vol. % (thermodynamic limit) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{addition}} of <b>stone</b> (limestone) <b>dust</b> to roadway dust in an underground coal mine increases the Total Incombustible Content (TIC) {{to reduce the}} potential of the coal dust igniting and propagating an explosion. Coal dust explosions have been proven {{to be one of the}} most severe hazards in an underground coal mine hence as Queensland legislation requires the use of roadway <b>stone</b> <b>dusting,</b> the required levels of TIC are higher than other mining districts around the world which also employ other coal <b>dust</b> explosion <b>barriers.</b> Compliance testing currently involves Low Temperature Ashing (LTA) of representative samples with a turn around on results of up to two weeks. To minimise the time that the mine is potentially out of compliance and unsafe, the Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM) has been tested at a Queensland underground coal mine to determine its effectiveness, through 11 different calibration methods, in rapidly measuring the TIC of roadway dust samples. The key focus of the calibration methods was to explore the effectiveness of the CDEM at its designed threshold of 80 % TIC, the use of an inbuilt methane content adjustment to replicate the Queensland legislative requirement of 85 % TIC and the use of actual 85 % TIC calibration samples. These calibration methods were replicated using both the manufacturer provided Pittsburgh coal dust an...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} defence against propagating {{coal dust}} explosions is {{the application of}} dry <b>stone</b> <b>dust.</b> This proven and effective safety measure is strictly regulated based on extensive international experience. While new products, such as foamed <b>stone</b> <b>dust,</b> offer significant practical benefits, no benchmark tests currently exist to certify their dust lifting performance in comparison to dry <b>stone</b> <b>dust.</b> This paper reviews the coal dust explosion mechanism, and argues that benchmark testing should focus on dust lifting during the initial development of the explosion, prior to arrival of the flame. In a practical context, this requires the generation of shock waves with Mach numbers ranging from 1. 05 to 1. 4, and test times {{of the order of}} 10 ’s to 100 ’s of milliseconds. These proposed test times are significantly longer than previous laboratory studies, however, for certification purposes, it is argued that the dust lifting behaviour should be examined over the full timescales of an actual explosion scenario. These conditions can be accurately targeted using a shock tube at length scales of approximately 50 m. It is further proposed that useful test time can be maximised if an appropriately sized orifice plate is fitted to the tube exit, an arrangement which also offers practical advantages for testing.
