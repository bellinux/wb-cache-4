25|$|Kipling's birth home on {{the campus}} of the J J School of Art in Bombay was for many years used as the Dean's residence. Although the cottage bears a plaque noting it as the site where Kipling was born, the {{original}} cottage may have been torn down decades ago and a new one built in its place. Some historians and conservationists are also of the view that the bungalow marks a site that is merely close to the home of Kipling's birth, as the bungalow was built in 1882—about 15 years after Kipling was born. In fact, Kipling seems to have <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> to the Dean when he visited J J School in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|But Paley, {{according}} to CBS historian Robert Metz, {{also learned that}} Benny chafed under NBC's almost indifferent attitude toward the talent that attracted the listeners. NBC, {{under the leadership of}} David Sarnoff, seemed at the time to think that listeners were listening to NBC because of NBC itself. To Paley, {{according to}} Metz, that was foolish thinking at best: Paley believed listeners were listening because of the talent, not because of which platform hosted them. When Paley <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> to Benny, the comedian agreed. Because Paley took a personal interest in the Benny negotiations, as opposed to Sarnoff, who had never met his top-rated star, Benny was convinced to make the jump. He convinced a number of his fellow NBC performers (notably Burns and Allen, Edgar Bergen, Red Skelton and Kate Smith) to join him.|$|E
500|$|While this {{correspondence}} {{was taking}} place, another issue arose when, in early 1644, a publication entitled A Short Story of the Rise, reign and ruin of the Antinomians, Familists & Libertines that infected the Churches of New England... {{was published in}} London. The author of the work was never stated, though the Reverend Thomas Weld provided the introduction and preface. Scholars through the years have almost unanimously attributed the authorship of this work to John Winthrop, and John Cotton <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> in a book he published in 1648. It was hardly a balanced account of events, and Wheelwright biographer Charles Bell wrote that [...] "it may be characterized as a very bitter and partisan production, even for that day".|$|E

500|$|Bond, already ambitious, asked Gilbert if {{he might}} be able to {{increase}} the size of her role. [...] Gilbert tried to mollify her in a letter, concluding, [...] "I am writing such a particularly good part for you in the new piece that I should be distressed beyond measure if you should leave us. I've never <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as this to any actor or actress before. I don't say it to induce you to play so insignificant a part as Edith, for if you left us now, and came back to us to play that part, I should be satisfied. But if you didn't play it, my calculations would be all upset, and I should lose a dear little lady for whom I have always had a very special regard." [...] True to Gilbert's word, Edith was followed by a string of roles of increasing importance. [...] First was Lady Angela in Patience (1881–82). [...] Bond did not much like the role, writing later that she did not relate to the sentimental lady of luxury indulging in the aesthetic craze. At the same time, Bond was becoming known to theatregoers and attracting the attention of young men. [...] Having had such bad experiences with romance in the past, Bond ignored such attentions. [...] One poem sent to her by an admirer ran in mock-Gilbertian style as follows (in part): ...|$|E
2500|$|George Burns himself <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> in an {{interview}} years later, adding that, surprisingly enough, no one ever thought of having Allen say [...] "Good night, Gracie". [...] However, the former Burns and Allen head writer, Paul Henning, did use the [...] "say good night" [...] bit {{in at least one}} [...] episode of the Beverly Hillbillies ("The Richest Woman", aired January 5, 1966, two years before Laugh-In premiered. [...] JED: [...] "Say good night, Jethro." [...] JETHRO: [...] "Good night, Jethro.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{administration}} officials, {{torn between}} {{pressure from the}} Republicans to go forward and a reluctance to respond to any Iraqi confrontation (and there was sure to be one) with military force, had tried to convince Butler to postpone the inspection until [...] "a more opportune time." [...] Butler was convinced. To me, he called it a case of [...] "bad timing." [...] I viewed it as something elsean appalling lack of leadership, not only in Washington and London, but also on Butler's part. He was allowing a golden opportunity to slip through his fingers. I <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> in a long, critical memorandum that I wrote to him the next day.|$|E

2500|$|The Journal of the American Medical Association {{referred}} to Stevenson’s Cases of the Reincarnation Type (1975) as a [...] "painstaking and unemotional" [...] collection {{of cases that}} were [...] "difficult to explain on any assumption other than reincarnation." [...] In September 1977, the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease devoted most of one issue to Stevenson's research. Writing in the journal, the psychiatrist Harold Lief described Stevenson as a methodical investigator and added, [...] "Either he is making a colossal mistake, or he will be known (I have <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> to him) as 'the Galileo of the 20th century'." [...] The issue proved popular: the journal's editor, the psychiatrist Eugene Brody, said he had received 300–400 requests for reprints.|$|E
2500|$|Murrow {{achieved}} great {{celebrity status}} {{as a result of}} his war reports. They led to his second famous catchphrase. At the end of 1940, with every night's German bombing raid, Londoners who might not necessarily see each other the next morning often closed their conversations with [...] "good night, and good luck." [...] The future British monarch, Princess Elizabeth, <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> to the Western world in a live radio address at the end of the year, when she said [...] "good night, and good luck to you all". So, at the end of one 1940 broadcast, Murrow ended his segment with [...] "Good night, and good luck." [...] Speech teacher Anderson insisted he stick with it, and another Murrow catchphrase was born.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{said she}} wanted her music {{to be remembered as}} that of Nina Simone, one of her {{favourite}} artists. She {{went on to say that}} Nina Simone achieved this for herself and writing her own songs is the best way possible. She also said [...] "These days nothing lasts, music is like fast food, you're in then you're out. She <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as she would like, she would never play the piano as well as Simone, but she would give it her best shot. She loves the songs Simone produced, including [...] "I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free" [...] and Simone's version of [...] "I Think It's Going to Rain Today". She said that Simone's original songs are very poetic and she said [...] "So when I listen to commercial stuff at the moment, I'm just thinking 'haven't you heard Nina Simone, haven't you heard how a song should be written?" [...] She went on to say [...] "We choose and consume, feast and forget, then rush on to the next hot thing. There's no point chasing that kind of success because it's so transient. Far better to follow (our) own paths and be true to (ourselves)." ...|$|E
