50|$|Traditionally, Spätzle are scraped {{manually}} on a board, {{which is}} still considered a <b>special</b> <b>certification</b> mark. For efficiency reasons, a mechanical production of “homemade” Spätzle comparable with manually scraped ones emerged {{at the start of}} the 20th century. With the beginning of industrialisation and progressing prosperity, Spätzle advanced from everyday food to a delicacy eaten during the holidays. People from a Swabian farming village called it a festive dish in 1937. One year prior, regional poet Sebastian Blau (Josef Eberle’s pseudonym) rendered Spätzle a symbol of Swabian identity: “… Spätzle are the foundation of our cuisine, the glory of our country, … the be-all and end-all of the Swabian menu…”.|$|R
5000|$|According to Philippe Chevallier, the CEO of the airline, the {{aircraft}} was not {{equipped with a}} black box, and thus investigators {{had to rely on}} observations of air traffic controller recordings, eyewitnesses, wreckage observation and their best guess on what might have happened on Flight 1501. Airport officials quickly claimed that mechanical failure caused the crash. One witness stated that he heard an engine [...] "sputtering" [...] before {{the aircraft}} slammed onto the house.The Saint Barthélemy Airport is surrounded by the La Tourmente Pass, requiring pilots to have <b>special</b> <b>certification</b> to land there. Aircraft approaching the runway must make a steep descent and fly low over houses before landing, with no night flights and all aircraft to be equipped with radio.|$|R
50|$|In 1993 a new Quota Count {{system was}} {{introduced}} based on aircraft noise certification data. Each aircraft type is classified and awarded a quota count (QC) value {{depending on the}} amount of noise it generated under controlled <b>certification</b> <b>conditions.</b> The quieter the aircraft the smaller the QC value. Aircraft are classified separately for landing and take-off. Take-off quota count values are based on the average of the certificated flyover and sideline noise levels at maximum take-off weight, with 1.75 EPNdB added for Chapter 2 aircraft. Landing quota count values are based on the certificated approach noise level at maximum landing weight minus 9.0 EPNdB.|$|R

Curriculum development was by teams of Saint Francis University Faculty in the Business Administration and Science Departments and industry experts. Students seeking undergraduate and graduate degrees are able to enroll in courses offered within these departments which will combine theory and hands-on training in the various elements of wind power development. For example, the business department curriculum areas include economic modeling, finance, contracting, etc. The science areas include meteorology, energy conversion and projection, species identification, habitat protection, field data collection and analysis, etc...|$|R

5000|$|In 2017 Orbital ATK {{filed suit}} via the U.S. District {{court in the}} {{district}} of Minnesota against Heckler and Koch for damages of over $27 million dollars, claiming failure to deliver 20 XM25 prototype units. The filing also requested Transfer of Intellectual Property to allow Orbital ATK to contract another vendor for production of the system. The complaint stated that Heckler and Koch had wished legal clarification regarding potential violations of the Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868, which bans [...] "any projectile of a weight below 400 grams" [...] containing explosives. After consultation Heckler and Koch had stipulated that the US Government issue a <b>special</b> <b>certification</b> regarding use of the weapons system. The US Government did not issue such and negotiations broke down. In April 2017, the Army cancelled its contract with Orbital ATK after they failed to deliver 20 weapons as specified by the terms, putting the operational future of the XM25 in jeopardy.|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation, many changes are {{occurring}} in the field of special education. More than ever before, students with disabilities are being included in each state’s NCLB required assessment to determine adequate yearly progress. This has resulted in an influx of students with disabilities enrolled in intensive reading classes in the schools. Educators, administrators, and reading coaches are attempting to figure out the best way to educate these students to achieve the reading gains that NCLB requires. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine factors believed to affect reading achievement of students with disabilities in intensive reading classes. The factors under study were the reading achievement of students with mild disabilities in classes taught by teachers who were highly qualified in reading (as defined by NCLB legislation), not highly qualified in reading, and teachers highly qualified in both reading and special education (distinguishing between traditional and alternate <b>special</b> education <b>certification).</b> In addition, student demographics and teacher demographics were analyzed as covariates to determine their effects on student achievement. Results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the reading achievement of students taught by highly qualified reading teachers (HQ), non-highly qualified reading teachers (NHQ), highly qualified reading teachers with additional <b>special</b> education <b>certification</b> (HQP), and highly qualified reading teachers with additional <b>special</b> education <b>certification</b> obtained through an alternate certification program (HQAP). Several teacher demographic variables were highly correlated with a teacher’s sense of feeling prepared and competent to teach reading. Additionally, after controlling for their 8 th grade FCAT scores, as the number of students with disabilities per HQ, HQAP, or HQP teacher increased, student reading achievement decreased...|$|R
