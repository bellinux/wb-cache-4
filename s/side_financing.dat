40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{examine the}} choice of {{healthcare}} providers for treating kala azar (KA) in Nepal. MethodsInformation was collected from clinically diagnosed KA patients seeking care from public hospitals located in KA endemic districts. The survey collected information from more than 25 percent of total KA cases in the country. For empirical estimation of probability of choosing a provider-type as a first contact healthcare provider, a multinomial logit model was defined with five alternative options with self care as the reference category. ResultsThe empirical model found that price of medical care services, income of households, knowledge of patients on KA and KA treatment, borrowing money, age of patient, perceived quality of provider types, etc. determine the likelihood of seeking care from the alternative options considered in the analysis. All variables have expected signs and are consistent with earlier studies. The price and income elasticity {{were found to be}} very high indicating that poorer households are very sensitive to price and income changes, even for a severe disease like KA. Using the empirical models, we have analyzed two policy instruments: demand <b>side</b> <b>financing</b> and interventions to improve the knowledge index about KA. ConclusionsDue to high price elasticity of KA care and high spillover effects of KA on the society, policy makers may consider demand <b>side</b> <b>financing</b> as an instrument to encourage utilization of public hospitals...|$|E

40|$|Objectives Demand <b>side</b> <b>financing</b> (DSF) {{mechanisms}} transfer {{purchasing power}} to specified groups for defined {{goods and services}} {{in order to increase}} access to specified services. This is an important innovation in health care systems where access remains poor despite substantial subsidies towards the supply side. In Bangladesh, a maternal health DSF pilot in 33 sub-districts was launched in 2007. We report the results of a rapid review of this scheme undertaken during 2008 after 1 year of its setup. Methods Quantitative data collected by DSF committees, facilities and national information systems were assessed alongside qualitative data, i. e. key informant interviews and focus group discussions with beneficiaries and health service providers on the operation of the scheme in 6 sub-districts. Results The scheme provides vouchers to women distributed by health workers that entitle mainly poor women to receive skilled care at home or a facility and also provide payments for transport and food. After initial setbacks voucher distribution rose quickly. The data also suggest that the rise in facility based delivery appeared to be more rapid in DSF than in other non-DSF areas, although the methods do not allow for a strict causal attribution as there might be co-founding effects. Fears that the financial incentives for surgical delivery would lead to an over emphasis on Caesarean section appear to be unfounded although the trends need further monitoring. DSF provides substantial additional funding to facilities but remains complex to administer, requiring a parallel administrative mechanism putting additional work burden on the health workers. There is little evidence that the mechanism encourages competition due to the limited provision of health care services. Conclusions The main question outstanding is whether the achievements of the DSF scheme could be achieved more efficiently by adapting the regular government funding rather than creating an entirely new mechanism. Also, improving the quality of health care services cannot be expected by the DSF mechanism alone within an environment lacking the pre-requirements for competition. Quality assurance mechanisms need to be put in place. A large-scale impact evaluation is currently underway. Demand <b>side</b> <b>financing</b> Vouchers Maternal Health Bangladesh...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Skilled {{attendance}} at delivery {{is an important}} indicator in monitoring progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5 to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015. In addition to professional attention, {{it is important that}} mothers deliver their babies in an appropriate setting, where life saving equipment and hygienic conditions can also help reduce the risk of complications that may cause death or illness to mother and child. Over the past decade interest has grown in examining influences on care-seeking behavior and this study investigates the determinants of place of delivery in rural India, with a particular focus on assessing the relative importance of community access and economic status. Methods A descriptive analysis of trends in place of delivery using data from two national representative sample surveys in 1992 and 1998 is followed by a two-level (child/mother and community) random-effects logistical regression model using the second survey to investigate the determinants. Results In this investigation of institutional care seeking for child birth in rural India, economic status emerges as a more crucial determinant than access. Economic status is also the strongest influence on the choice between a private-for-profit or public facility amongst institutional births. Conclusion Greater availability of obstetric services will not alone solve the problem of low institutional delivery rates. This is particularly true for the use of private-for-profit institutions, in which the distance to services does not have a significant adjusted effect. In the light of these findings a focus on increasing demand for existing services seems the most rational action. In particular, financial constraints need to be addressed, and results support current trials of demand <b>side</b> <b>financing</b> in India. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background High {{maternal}} mortality in India {{is a serious}} public health challenge. Demand <b>side</b> <b>financing</b> interventions have emerged as a strategy to promote access to emergency obstetric care. Two such state run programs, Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and Chiranjeevi Yojana (CY), were designed and implemented to reduce financial access barriers that preclude women from obtaining emergency obstetric care. JSY, a conditional cash transfer, awards money directly {{to a woman who}} delivers in a public health facility. This will be studied in Madhya Pradesh province. CY, a voucher based program, empanels private obstetricians in Gujarat province, who are reimbursed by the government to perform deliveries of socioeconomically disadvantaged women. The programs have been in operation for the last seven years. Methods/designs The study outlined in this protocol will assess and compare the influence of the two programs on various aspects of maternal health care including trends in program uptake, institutional delivery rates, maternal and neonatal outcomes, quality of care, experiences of service providers and users, and cost effectiveness. The study will collect primary data using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, including facility level questionnaires, observations, a population based survey, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions. Primary data will be collected in three districts of each province. The research will take place at three levels: the state health departments, obstetric facilities in the districts and among recently delivered mothers in the community. Discussion The protocol is a comprehensive assessment of the performance and impact of the programs and an economic analysis. It will fill existing evidence gaps in the scientific literature including access and quality to services, utilization, coverage and impact.

40|$|Low {{and middle}} income {{countries}} have adopted targeting mechanisms {{as a means of}} increasing program efficiency in reaching marginalized people in the community given the available resources. Design of targeting mechanisms has been changing over time and {{it is important to understand}} implementers' experience with such targeting mechanisms since such mechanisms impact equity in access and use of maternal health care services. The case study approach was considered as appropriate method for exploring implementers' and decision-makers' experiences with the two targeting mechanisms. In-depth interviews in order to explore implementer experience with the two targeting mechanisms. A total of 10 in-depth interviews (IDI) and 4 group discussions (GDs) were conducted with implementers at national level, regional, district and health care facility level. A thematic analysis approach was adopted during data analysis. The whole process of screening and identifying poor pregnant women resulted in delay in implementation of the intervention. Individual targeting was perceived to have some form of stigmatization; hence beneficiaries did not like to be termed as poor. Geographical targeting had a few cons as health care providers experienced an increase in workload while staff remained the same and poor quality of information in the claim forms. However geographical targeting increase in the number of women going to higher level of care (district/regional referral hospital), increase in facility revenue and insurance coverage. Interventions which are using targeting mechanisms to reach poor people are useful in increasing access and use of health care services for marginalized communities so long as they are well designed and beneficiaries as well as all implementers and decision makers are involved from the very beginning. Implementation of demand <b>side</b> <b>financing</b> strategies using targeting mechanisms should go together with supply side interventions in order to achieve project objectives...|$|E

40|$|Improving {{financial}} {{access to}} services {{is an essential part}} of extending universal health coverage in low resource settings. In Cambodia, high out of pocket spending and low levels of utilisation have impeded the expansion of coverage and improvement in health outcomes. For twenty years a series of health financing policies have focused on mitigating costs to increase access particularly by vulnerable groups. Demand <b>side</b> <b>financing</b> policies including health equity funds, vouchers and community health insurance have been complemented by supply side measures to improve service delivery incentives through contracting. Multiple rounds of the Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey are used to investigate the impact of financing policies on health service utilisation and out of pocket payments both over time using commune panel data from 1997 to 2011 and across groups using individual data from 2004 to 2009. Policy combinations including areas with multiple interventions were examined against controls using difference-in-difference and panel estimation. Widespread roll-out of financing policies combined with user charge formalisation has led to a general reduction in health spending by the poor. Equity funds are associated with a reduction in out of pocket payments although the effect of donor schemes is larger than those financed by government. Vouchers, which are aimed only at reproductive health services, has a more modest impact that is enhanced when combined with other schemes. At the aggregate level changes are less pronounced although there is evidence that policies take a number of years to have substantial effect. Health financing policies and the supportive systems that they require provide a foundation for more radical extension of coverage already envisaged by a proposed social insurance system.

40|$|Abstract Background Cost of {{delivering}} reproductive health services to low-income populations will always require total or partial subsidization {{by the government}} and/or development partners. Broadly termed "Demand-Side Financing" or "Output-Based Aid", includes a range of interventions that channel government or donor subsidies to the service user rather than the service provider. Initial findings from the few assessments of reproductive health voucher-and-accreditation programs suggest that, if implemented well, these programs have great potential for achieving the policy objectives of increasing access and use, reducing inequities and enhancing program efficiency and service quality. At this point in time, however, there is a paucity of evidence describing how the various voucher programs function in different settings, for various reproductive health services. Methods/Design Population Council-Nairobi, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, intends to address the lack of evidence around {{the pros and cons}} of 'voucher and accreditation' approaches to improving the reproductive health of low income women in five developing countries. In Bangladesh, the activities will be conducted in 11 accredited health facilities where Demand <b>Side</b> <b>Financing</b> program is being implemented and compared with populations drawn from areas served by similar non-accredited facilities. Facility inventories, client exit interviews and service provider interviews will be used to collect comparable data across each facility for assessing readiness and quality of care. In-depth interviews with key stakeholders will be conducted to gain a deeper understanding about the program. A population-based survey will also be carried out in two types of locations: areas where vouchers are distributed and similar locations where vouchers are not distributed. Discussion This is a quasi-experimental study which will investigate the impact of the voucher approach on improving maternal health behaviors and status and reducing inequities at the population level. We expect a significant increase in the utilization of maternal health care services by the accredited health facilities in the experimental areas compared to the control areas as a direct result of the interventions. If the voucher scheme in Bangladesh is found effective, it may help other countries to adopt this approach for improving utilization of maternity care services for reducing maternal mortality. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Demand <b>side</b> <b>financing</b> (DSF) is {{a widely}} {{employed}} strategy to enhance utilization of healthcare. The impact of DSF on health care seeking in general and that of maternal care in particular is already known. Yet, its effect on financial access to care, out-of-pocket spending (OOPS) and provider motivations is not considerably established. Without such evidence, DSFs may not be recommendable to build up any sustainable healthcare delivery approach. This study explores the above aspects on India’s Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) program. Methods This study employed design and was conducted in three districts of Orissa, selected through a three-stage stratified sampling. The quantitative method was used to review the Health Management Information System (HMIS). The qualitative methods included focus groups discussions with beneficiaries (n[*]=[*] 19) and community intermediaries (n[*]=[*] 9), and interviews (n[*]=[*] 7) with Ministry of Health officials. HMIS data enabled to review maternal healthcare utilization. Group discussions and interviews explored the perceived impact of JSY on in-facility delivery, OOPS, healthcare costs, quality of care and performance motivation of community health workers. Results The number of institutional deliveries, ante-and post-natal care visits increased after the introduction of JSY with an annual net growth of 18. 1 %, 3. 6 % and 5 % respectively. The financial incentive provided partial financial risk-protection as it could cover only 25. 5 % of the maternal healthcare cost of the beneficiaries in rural areas and 14. 3 % in urban areas. The incentive induced fresh out-of-pocket spending for some mothers and it could not address maternal care requirements comprehensively. An activity-based community worker model was encouraging to augment maternal healthcare consumption. However, the existing level of financial incentives and systemic support were inadequate to motivate the volunteers optimally on their performance. Conclusion Demand side financial incentive could enhance financial access to maternal healthcare. However, it did not adequately protect households from financial risks. An effective integration of JSY with similar social protection or financial risk-protection measures may protect mothers substantially from potential out-of-pocket spending. Further, this integrated approach may help upholding more awareness on maternal health rights and entitlements. It can also address maternal health beyond ‘maternal healthcare’ and ensure sustainability through pooled financial and non-financial resources. </p...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} bank lending to SMEs with {{consideration}} {{of both the}} demand side and supply side. To this end, three distinctive lines of research are pursued in this thesis. We start with analyzing results from a regional survey of 20 banks and 180 SMEs conducted in 2012 in North Vietnam for {{new insights into the}} determinants of successful access to bank loans by SMEs. Secondly, we examine factors of the business environment that affect SME growth using original datasets obtained from surveys conducted in both Vietnam and the UK in 2012. Finally, we extend our research to the supply side with an important question about how banks in East Asia performed throughout the 2007 - 2008 global financial crisis. Following this, we analyze the impact of liberalization on banking soundness based on a secondary dataset of 10 East Asian countries (1997 - 2012). Using different econometric approaches and different samples, we present robust evidence that factors from the business environment drive SMEs’ loan access and their growth. On the demand <b>side,</b> <b>financing</b> is still the foremost determinant for SME growth. Furthermore, the industrial sector where firms operate has an influence on access to finance as well as growth. From the supply side, various sizes and ownership forms differently impact SME lending. In addition, a rise in comparative size (systemic size) significantly reduces bank risk. However, a growth in absolute size (total assets) is associated with greater bank vulnerability due to increasing leverage ratios and costs. Banks tend to favour SMEs who have a close relationship or have collateral to pledge. Importantly, institutional setting has a significant impact on behaviours of SMEs and banks. While larger SMEs have better regulatory perceptions, banks of different sizes and ownership structures, have very different perceptions about legal uncertainties and therefore produce various lending requirements which directly affect the availability and affordability of SME lending. The empirical results give rise to policy implications for transition (and possibly other) countries. Firstly, the robustly positive nexuses between the numbers of relationships with banks and loan access suggest that stimulating competition in the banking sector can help firms mitigate stringent terms and conditions for credit approvals. However, greater absolute market power (market share) reduces soundness in the banking sector while greater comparative market power (HHI) fosters it. Secondly, the fact that legal uncertainties go hand in hand with a high ratio of collateralized loans with any bank size emphasises the need for improving regulations on collateral and creditor- rights. Thirdly, given that the adoption of Basel capital standards is viewed as creating advantages for larger banks over smaller banks, and my results show liberalisation to also favour larger banks, suggests a distortion in financial markets and may produce further instabilities. My results may provide insights for policy makers when considering which areas of banking and finance they should or should not deregulate with a motivation to stimulate competition and enhance stability. Finally, this thesis reveals insights into sectors facing barriers to finance and growth, and therefore provides valuable information for policymakers in setting incentives targeted at and tailored to specific groups of SMEs...|$|E
