5|$|Numerous deities {{have been}} {{considered}} patrons of third-sex or homoerotically-inclined people. This patronage can originate in mythological <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> deity, or from religious practices and rituals. For example, Conner and Sparks argue that the goddess of fire, love and sexuality, Arani, {{has been linked to}} lesbian eroticism via rituals in her honor: for example two pieces of wood perceived as feminine, called the adhararani and utararani, are rubbed together, simulating a spiritual lesbian interaction.|$|E

5|$|American Philo McGiffin, who was {{on board}} Zhenyuan, {{reported}} after the battle {{that there had been}} a variety of <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up clinging to a piece of debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the decision to go down with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Tomás Eloy Martínez {{published}} Santa Evita, a fictionalized work propounding {{many new}} <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> escapades of the corpse. Allegations that {{her body was}} the object of inappropriate attentions are derived from his description of an 'emotional necrophilia' by embalmers, Coronel Koenig and his assistant Arancibia. Many primary and secondary references to his novel have inaccurately stated that her body had been defiled in some way resulting in the widespread belief in this myth. Also included are allegations that many wax copies had been made, that the corpse had been damaged with a hammer, {{and that one of}} the wax copies was the object of an officer's sexual attentions.|$|E

5|$|Less {{than three}} weeks before the primary, Comer's former girlfriend told the Courier-Journal in a letter that Comer had abused her {{physically}} and mentally in 1991 and that he had accompanied her to an abortion clinic. Other newspapers, including the Lexington Herald-Leader, which citied the Courier-Journal, then reported the allegations. The Lexington Herald-Leader had reported earlier that the Lexington-area blogger who had been publishing <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> allegations for months had been in contact with the husband of Heiner's running mate, K.

5|$|Maeda {{was born}} in Funazawa Village, Hirosaki City, Aomori Prefecture, Japan, on November 18, 1878. He {{attended}} Kenritsu Itiu high school (currently Hirokou—a Hirosaki school). As a child, {{he was known as}} Hideyo. He practiced sumo as a teenager, but lacked the ideal build for the sport. Because of the interest generated by <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> success of judo at contests between judo and jujutsu that were occurring at the time, he changed from sumo to judo. In 1894, at seventeen years of age, his parents sent him to Tokyo to enroll in Waseda University. He took up Kodokan judo the following year.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{histories}} {{describe the}} formation and destruction of the Bridge of the Gods, a land bridge that connected the Oregon and Washington sides of the river in the Columbia River Gorge. The bridge, which aligns with geological records of the Bonneville Slide, was described in some stories {{as the result of}} a battle between gods, represented by Mount Adams and Mount Hood, in their competition for the affection of a goddess, represented by Mount St.Helens. Native American <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> bridge differ in their details but agree in general that the bridge permitted increased interaction between tribes on the north and south sides of the river.|$|E

5|$|Responding to {{international}} pressures, in 1991 the Soviet government allowed a joint U.S.-British inspection team to tour {{four of its}} main weapons facilities at Biopreparat. The inspectors were met with evasion and denials from the Soviet scientists, and were eventually ordered out of the facility. In 1992 Soviet defector Ken Alibek alleged that the Soviet bioweapons program at Zagorsk had produced a large stockpile—as much as twenty tons—of weaponized smallpox (possibly engineered to resist vaccines, Alibek further alleged), along with refrigerated warheads to deliver it. Alibek's <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> former Soviet program's smallpox activities have never been independently verified.|$|E
5|$|The If Day event {{not only}} {{resulted}} in Victory Bond sales well over Greater Winnipeg's goal, but brought Winnipeg's innovative efforts {{to the attention}} of people throughout North America. Life Magazine ran a pictorial spread of the If Day activities in Winnipeg and in smaller centres across Manitoba, photographed by William Shrout. Reporters from several American publications, including Newsweek, The New York Times and The Christian Science Monitor, were also present for the event; cameraman Lucien Roy shot newsreel footage for BBC News. Newspapers as far away as New Zealand included <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> event. An estimated 40 million people worldwide saw coverage of If Day.|$|E
5|$|The Thraliana was a diary kept by Hester Thrale and {{is part of}} {{the genre}} known as table talk. Although the work began as Thrale's diary focused on her {{experience}} with her family, it slowly changed focus to emphasise various anecdotes and <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> life of Samuel Johnson. The work was used as a basis for Thrale's Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson, but the Thraliana remained unpublished until 1942. The anecdotes contained within the work were popular with Thrale's contemporaries but seen as vulgar. Among 20th century readers, the work was popular, and many literary critics believe that the work is a valuable contribution to the genre and for providing information about Johnson's and her own life.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} local {{traditional}} <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> megalithic complex. The best known tells how a wedding party was turned to stone: {{the party was}} held throughout Saturday, but a man clothed in black (the Devil in disguise) came and started to play his violin for the merrymakers after midnight, continuing into holy Sunday morning. When dawn broke, everybody had been turned to stone by the Demon: so the stone circles are the dancers, the avenues are the fiddlers and The Cove is the bride and the groom with the drunken churchman at their feet. They are still awaiting the Devil who promised to come back someday and play again for them.|$|E
