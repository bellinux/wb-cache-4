The seismic amplitudes generated in the moon by such comets impacting that body are calculated, and it is concluded that the proposed flux of comets is 100, 000 times greater than would be supported by either the seismic impact rate of the moon or the amplitude of its steady state reverberation.

40|$|The Earth's {{cumulative}} meteoroid flux, {{as found}} by Halliday et al. (1996), {{may have a}} shallower slope for meteoroid masses in the range 0. 1 - 2. 5 kg compared to those with masses greater than 2. 5 kg when plotted on a log flux vs. log mass graph. This would indicate a lack of low-mass objects. While others such as Ceplecha (1992) find no shallow slope, {{there may be a}} reason for a lack of 0. 1 - 2. 5 kg meteoroids which supports Halliday et al. 's finding. Simple models show that a few centimeters of space erosion in <b>stony</b> <b>meteoroids</b> can reproduce the bend in Halliday et al.

40|$|Mass spectroscopic {{analysis}} of neutron-irradiated targets of natural magnesium yields cross sections of 59 + or - 14, 160 + or - 8, and 11. 0 + or - 3. 3 mb for Ne- 20, Ne- 21 and Ne- 22, respectively, at 14. 1 MeV and of 94 + or - 8, 152 or - 12, and 13. 0 + or - 2. 0 mb at 14. 7 Mev. Using these cross sections, calculations modeling cosmic ray interactions in <b>stony</b> <b>meteoroids</b> of radii 20 and 26 cm predict {{that between the}} surface and the center the Ne- 22 /Ne- 21 ratio falls more than 10 % while the Ne- 21 production rate rises about 30 %.

40|$|Proton-induced {{production}} {{cross sections}} of I- 129 from Te and Ba are presented. Earlier assumptions that Te {{is the most}} important target element in meteoroids are confirmed. Based on this data set and the experimental production rates of I- 129 from thick-target experiments, the production of I- 129 in <b>stony</b> <b>meteoroids</b> is modeled using a GCR flux density of 4. 06 cm(- 2) s(- 1). The results of this modeling must be considered preliminary because the contribution from neutron capture on Te- 128 needs further investigation. We obtained modeled production rates that agree with experimental results for samples from two medium-sized meteorites (Abee and Knyahinya). However, we find that this model does not describe Ca- 41 in lunar rocks well and seems to overestimate I- 129 production in larger bodies, such as Allende. We present elemental production rates from Te and Ba based on our modeling as well as for a model that describes neutron capture products. For I- 129 analysis of Knyahinya, a novel method to separate Te and analysis using ICP-MS was used, enabling the use of experimental elemental concentrations obtained from the same meteorite to calculate I- 129 production...|$|R
40|$|The {{beginning}} {{height of}} a meteor varies by approximately 10 km depending on the rotation state of a spherical meteoroid {{as long as the}} body sustains a temperature gradient. Such gradients build up in friable <b>stony</b> <b>meteoroids</b> larger than approximately 0. 1 cm and in iron meteoroids that are approximately 1 cm or larger. The height where 100 microns or smaller zodiacal dust particles ablate is nearly independent of rotation. Stony particles in the 100 microns size range ablate near 120 km while both larger and smaller meteoroids penetrate deeper. All calculations were made with a nominal speed of 30 km/s and a zenithal distance equal to z(sub r) = 0 deg. Larger meteoroids cool their surface by conduction to the interior while smaller meteoroids decelerate significantly due to their large surface area to mass ratio so that the surface receives a lower energy flux. Some micro-meteoroids smaller than approximately 10 microns may escape abalation altogether at the nominal velocity. The effect of rotation on particle temperature during atmospheric flight is significant on meteoroids larger than 0. 1 cm but may be negligible on micro-meteorites that are typically 10 - 50 microns in diameter...|$|R
5000|$|Almost all meteoroids contain {{extraterrestrial}} {{nickel and}} iron. They have three main classifications: iron, stone, and stony-iron. Some stone meteoroids contain grain-like inclusions known as chondrules and are called chondrites. <b>Stony</b> <b>meteoroids</b> without these features are called [...] "achondrites", which are typically formed from extraterrestrial igneous activity; they contain {{little or no}} extraterrestrial iron. The composition of meteoroids can be inferred as they pass through Earth's atmosphere from their trajectories and the light spectra of the resulting meteor. Their effects on radio signals also give information, especially useful for daytime meteors, which are otherwise very difficult to observe. From these trajectory measurements, meteoroids {{have been found to}} have many different orbits, some clustering in streams (see meteor showers) often associated with a parent comet, others apparently sporadic. Debris from meteoroid streams may eventually be scattered into other orbits. The light spectra, combined with trajectory and light curve measurements, have yielded various compositions and densities, ranging from fragile snowball-like objects with density about a quarter that of ice, to nickel-iron rich dense rocks. The study of meteorites also gives insights into the composition of non-ephemeral meteoroids.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{origin of}} stony meteorites landing on Earth today is {{directly}} linked {{to the history of}} the main belt, which evolved both through collisional evolution and dynamical evolution/depletion. In this paper, we focus our attention on the main belt dynamical evolution scenario discussed in Petit et al. (2001). According to Petit et al., during the planet formation epoch, the primordial main belt contained several Earth masses of material, enough to allow the asteroids to accrete on relatively short timescales. After a few My, the accretion of planetary embryos in the main belt zone dynamically stirred the remaining planetesimals to high enough velocities to initiate fragmentation. After a short interval, perhaps as long as 10 My, the primordial main belt was dynamically depleted of> 99 % of its material via the combined perturbations of the planetary embryos and a newly-formed Jupiter. The small percentage of objects that survived in the main belt zone became the asteroid belt. It has been shown that the wavy-shaped size-frequency distribution of the main belt is a “fossil ” left over from this violent period (Bottke et al. 2004). Using a collisional/dynamical model of this scenario, we tracked the evolution of <b>stony</b> <b>meteoroids</b> produced by catastrophic disruption events over the last several Gy. We show that mos...|$|R
40|$|Results for {{neutron flux}} {{calculations}} in <b>stony</b> <b>meteoroids</b> (of various radii and compositions) and production rates for Cl- 36, Ni- 59, and Co- 60 are reported. The Ni- 59 /Co- 60 ratio is nearly constant with depth in most meteorites: {{this effect is}} consistent with the neutron flux and capture cross section properties. The shape of the neutron flux energy spectrum, varies little with depth in a meteorite. The size of the parent meteorite can be determined from one of its fragments, using the Ni- 59 /Co- 60 ratios, if the parent meteorite was less than 75 g/cm(2) in radius. If the parent meteorite was larger, a lower limit {{on the size of the}} parent meteorite can be determined from a fragment. In C 3 chondrites this is not possible. In stony meteorites with R less than 50 g/cm(2) the calculated Co- 60 production rates (mass less than 4 kg), are below 1 atom/min g-Co. The highest Co- 60 production rates occur in stony meteorites with radius about 250 g/cm(2) (1. 4 m across). In meteorites with radii greater than 400 g/cm(2), the maximum Co- 60 production rate occurs at a depth of about 175 g/cm(2) in L-chondrite, 125 g/cm(2) in C 3 chrondrite, and 190 g/cm(2) in aubrites...|$|R
40|$|Space erosion from dust impacts may set upper {{limits on}} the cosmic ray {{exposure}} (CRE) ages of <b>stony</b> meteorites. A <b>meteoroid</b> orbiting within the asteroid belt is bombarded by both cosmic rays and interplanetary dust particles. Galactic cosmic rays penetrate only the first few meters of the meteoroid; deeper regions are shielded. The dust particle impacts create tiny craters on the meteoroid's surface, wearing it away by space erosion (abrasion) at a particular rate. Hence a particular point inside a meteoroid accumulates cosmic ray products only until that point wears away, limiting CRE ages. The results would apply to other regolith-free surfaces {{in the solar system}} as well, so that abrasion may set upper CRE age limits which depend on the dusty environment. Calculations based on N. Divine's dust populations and on micrometeoroid cratering indicate that <b>stony</b> <b>meteoroids</b> in circular ecliptic orbits at 2 AU will record 21 Ne CRE ages of approx. 176 x 10 (exp 6) years if dust masses are in the range 10 (exp - 21) - 10 (exp - 3) kg. This is in broad agreement with the maximum observed CRE ages of approx. 100 x 10 (exp 6) years for stones. High erosion rates in the inner solar system may limit the CRE ages of Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) to approx. 120 x 10 (exp 6) years. If abrasion should prove to be approx. 6 times quicker than found here, then space erosion may be responsible for many of the measured CRE ages of main belt stony meteorites. In that case the CRE ages may not measure the drift time to the resonances due to the Yarkovsky effects as in the standard scenario, and that for some reason Yarkovsky is ineffective...|$|R
40|$|Compared to iron meteorites, large stony meteorites (less than 100 kg) are {{relatively}} rare. Most large <b>stony</b> <b>meteoroids</b> fragment during atmospheric entry, producing large meteorite showers. Interestingly, {{many of these}} large chondrites, such as Bur Gheluai, Gold Basin, Jilin and Tsarev {{appear to have a}} complex exposure history with a first-stage exposure on the parent body. The question is whether complex exposure histories are simply more readily detected in large objects or large objects are more likely to experience a complex exposure. Investigation of these two hypotheses is the motivation for this work in which we report on the exposure history of QUE 90201, a large L/LL 5 chondrite shower found near Queen Alexandra Range, Antarctica. Previous cosmogenic nuclide studies have led to the consensus that most of the approx. 2000 L 5 and LL 5 chondrites from the QUE area are derived from a single object with a pre-atmospheric radius of 1 - 2 m. The terrestrial age of the QUE 90201 shower was determined at 125 20 kyr. Here, we present a more complete set of cosmogenic radionuclide results in the metal and stone fractions of eleven L/LL 5 chondrites from the QUE stranding area, as well as noble gases in seven of these samples. The main goal of this work is to unravel the cosmic-ray exposure history of the QUE 90201 meteoroid. In addition, we will discuss the pre-atmospheric size and exposure history of QUE 93013 (H 5) and 93081 (H 4) with similar shielding conditions as the QUE 90201 shower and a terrestrial age of 145 +/- 25 kyr...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} by proton-induced reactions of stable and long-lived Kr-isotopes from Rb, Sr, Y, and Zr was investigated by using isotope dilution mass spectrometry of targets irradiated at PSI/CH, TSL/S and LNS/F. Cumulative cross sections were determined for energies between 81 and 1600 MeV, between 15. 4 and 1600 MeV, and between 70 and 1600 MeV for the target element Rb, Sr, and Y, respectively. For Zr, three energies of 156, 569 and 1200 MeV were investigated. As a by-product, cross sections {{for the production}} of short-lived radionuclides from Rb are reported which were measured by γ-spectrometry prior to mass spectrometry. Flux determination and absolute calibration of cross sections was done by the reaction 27 Al(p, 3 p 3 n) 22 Na. The new experimental data are consistent with a large database established during recent years for describing the interactions of cosmic ray protons with matter. They provide a first complete basis for model calculations of cosmogenic krypton in <b>stony</b> <b>meteoroids</b> and planetary surfaces. For the target element Rb we report the first measurements at all. For Sr, only one earlier measurement existed. For Y, our data confirm earlier measurements up to 200 MeV and extend the data set up to 1600 MeV, while for Zr three new energy points complement and check the consistency of the new investigations with earlier work from Bordeaux. The new experimental data are compared with theoretical excitation functions calculated on an a priori basis using the hybrid model of preequilibrium reactions, an intranuclear cascade/evaporation model in form of the HET/KFA 2 code and the semi-empirical systematics by Silberberg, Tsao and coworkers. The differences between theories and experiments demonstrate severe shortcomings of the predictive power of existing models and emphasize the importance of experimental determinations if high-quality data are required for applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{fragmentation}} {{of a small}} asteroid in the atmosphere greatly increases its cross sections for aerodynamic braking and energy dissipation. At a typical impact velocity of 22 km/s, the atmosphere absorbs {{more than half the}} kinetic energy of <b>stony</b> <b>meteoroids</b> with diameters, D(sub m), less than 220 m and iron meteoroids with D(sub m) less than 80 m. The corresponding diameter for comets with impact velocity 50 km/s is D(sub m) less than 1600 m. Most of the atmospheric energy dissipation occurs in a fraction of a scale height, so large meteors appear to 'explode' or 'flare' {{at the end of their}} visible paths. This dissipation of energy in the atmosphere protects the earth from direct impact damage (e. g., craters), but it produces a blast wave that can do considerable damage. The area of destruction around the impact point in which the over-pressure in the blast wave exceeds 4 lb/sq in = 2. 8 x 10 (exp 5) dynes/cu cm, which is enough to knock over trees and destroy buildings, increases rapidly from zero for chondritic meteoroids less than 56 m in diameter (15 megatons) to about 200 sq km for those 80 m in diameter (48 megatons); the probable diameter of the tunguska impactor of 1908 is about 80 m. Crater formation and earthquakes are not significant in land impacts by stony asteroids less than about 200 m in diameter because of the air protection. A tsunami is probably the most devastating type of damage for asteroids 200 m to 1 km in diameter. An impact by an asteroid this size anywhere in the Atlantic would devastate coastal areas on both sides of the ocean. An asteroid a few kilometers across would produce a tsunami that would reach the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in the upper half of the East Coast of the United States. Most of Florida is protected from a tsunami by the gradual slope of the ocean off its coast, which causes most of the tsunami energy to be reflected back into the Atlantic. The atmosphere plume produced by asteroids with diameters exceeding about 120 m cannot be contained by the atmosphere, so this bubble of high-temperature gas forms a new layer on top of the atmosphere. The dust entrapped in this hot gas is likely to have optical depths exceeding tau = 10 for asteroids with diameters exceeding about 0. 5 to 1 km. The optical flux from asteroids 60 m or more in diameter is enough to ignite pine forests. However, the blast wave from an impacting asteroid goes beyond the radius in which the fire starts. The blast wave tends to blow out the fire, so it is likely that the impact will char the forest, as at Tunguska, but the impact will not produce a sustained fire. Because comets dissipate their energy much higher in the atmosphere than asteroids, they illuminate a much larger region and their blast wave is weaker. So they are much more effective in producing large fires. This suggests that the KT impactor was a comet rather than an asteroid...|$|R
40|$|Thick spherical targets made of gabbro (R = 25 cm) and {{of steel}} (R = 10 cm) were {{irradiated}} isotropically with 1. 6 GeV protons at the Saturne synchrotron at Laboratoire National Saturne (LNS) /CEN Saclay {{in order to}} simulate the interaction in space of galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) protons with <b>stony</b> and iron <b>meteoroids.</b> Proton fluences of 1. 32 x 10 (14) cm(- 2) and 2. 45 x 10 (14) cm(- 2) were received by the gabbro and iron sphere, respectively, which corresponds to cosmic-ray exposure ages of about 1. 6 and 3. 0 Ma. Both artificial meteoroids contained large numbers of high-purity target foils of up to 28 elements at different depths. In these individual target foils, elementary production rates of radionuclides and rare gas isotopes were measured by x- and gamma-spectrometry, by low-level counting, accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), and by conventional rare gas mass spectrometry. Also samples of the gabbro itself were analyzed. Up to now, {{for each of the}} experiments, similar to 500 target-product combinations were investigated of which the results for radionuclides are presented here. The experimental production rates show a wide range of depth profiles reflecting the differences between low-, medium-, and high-energy products. The influence of the stony and iron matrices on the production of secondary particles and on particle transport, in general, and consequently on the production rates is clearly exhibited by the phenomenology of the production rates as well as by a detailed theoretical analysis. Theoretical production rates were calculated in an a priori way by folding depth-dependent spectra of primary and secondary protons and secondary neutrons calculated by Monte Carlo techniques with the excitation functions of the underlying nuclear reactions. Discrepancies of up to a factor of 2 between the experimental and a priori calculated depth profiles are attributed to the poor quality of the mostly theoretical neutron excitation functions. Improved neutron excitation functions were obtained by least-squares deconvolution techniques from experimental thick-target production rates of up to five thick-target experiments in which isotropic irradiations were performed. A posteriori calculations using the adjusted neutron cross sections describe the measured depth profiles of all these simulation experiments within 9 %. The thus validated model calculations provide a basis for reliable physical model calculations of the production rates of cosmogenic nuclides in stony and iron meteorites as well as in lunar samples and terrestrial materials...|$|R
