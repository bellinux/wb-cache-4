40|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) {{is a critical}} physical attribute of coastal ecological systems. Water temperature directly affects process rates, water column stability, and the species of plants (such as algae, seagrasses, marsh plants, and mangroves) and animals (microscopic animals, larger invertebrates, fish, and mammals) that live in a particular region. Increases in temperature {{are thought to be}} associated with the degradation of coral reefs (bleaching) and may increase the frequency or extent of blooms of harmful algae. On longer time scales (decades to centuries), such changes may be related to decreases in the supply of nutrients to surface waters from the deep sea and a cascade of effects from decreases in primary production to declines in fish production. Changes in temperature may result from long-term cycles in ocean circulation or <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> <b>climate</b> (Committee on the Bering Sea Ecosystem et al., 1996). This indicator, developed by the National Ocean Service of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (The Heinz Center 2002) describes whether SST is above or below average. The indicator tracks how much regional average temperatures in any given year deviate from the average for a 14 -year period of record for waters within 25 miles of the coast...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} idea that climate may affect forest fire {{severity}} independent of fire intensity. Pervasive warming can lead to chronic stress on forest trees (McDowell et al. 2008; Raffa et al. 2008), resulting in higher sensitivity to fire-induced damage (van Mantgem et al. 2003). Thus, there may be ongoing increases in fire severity (the number of trees killed), even {{when there is no}} change in fire intensity (the amount of heat released during a fire). We examined this question at a subcontinental scale by synthesizing existing information from plot-based prescribed fire monitoring databases across the western United States of America (USA). Prescribed fire data are particularly well suited to exploring the relationship between climate and fire severity because prescribed burns are conducted over a relatively narrow range of fire weather but over a potentially wide range of inter-annual climatic conditions. Specifically, we considered two topics, (i) quantifying the contribution of climate to fire severity (as measured by post-fire tree mortality), and (ii) detecting any <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> fire in the climate/fire severity relationship. Statistical models based on data from 3 ̆e 330 forest plots showed that across regions and major taxa, probabilities of fire-caused tree mortality were strongly sensitive to pre-fire changes in climatic water deficit, an index of drought. Our downscaled climate data indicated that changes in the climatic water deficit were due to increasing temperatures, without detectable <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> precipitation. These climatic trends were correlated with increasing probabilities of fire-caused mortality over time. Results from this study demonstrate that incorporating measures of pre-fire climatic stress and/or tree health into models of post-fire mortality used by prescribed fire managers may substantially improve their predictive capabilities. The relationships developed here will help managers predict changes in fire severity from large-scale climatic anomalies (e. g., ENSO, PDO) and from <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> <b>climate...</b>|$|R

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to analyse the impact of energy under-reporting on dietary patterns and <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> dietary patterns defined by cluster analysis. Two cross-sectional population-based surveys were conducted in Spain, in 2000 and 2005, with 3058 and 6352 participants, respectively, aged 25 to 74 years. Validated questionnaire was used to collect dietary data. Cluster analysis was run separately for all participants, plausible energy reporters (PER), and energy under-reporters (EUR) to define dietary patterns. Three clusters, "healthy", "mixed" and "western", were identified for both surveys. The "mixed" cluster was the predominant cluster in both surveys. Excluding EUR reduced the proportion of the "mixed" cluster up to 6. 40 % in the 2000 survey; this caused <b>secular</b> <b>trend</b> increase <b>in</b> the prevalence of the "mixed" pattern. Cross-classification analysis of all participants and PER' data showed substantial agreement in cluster assignments: 68. 7 % in 2000 and 84. 4 % in 2005. Excluding EUR did not cause meaningful (≥ 15 %) changes in the "healthy" pattern. It provoked changes in consumption of some food groups in the "mixed" and "western" patterns: mainly decreases of unhealthy foods within the 2000 and increases of unhealthy foods within the 2005 surveys. <b>Secular</b> <b>trend</b> effects of EUR were similar to those within the 2005 survey.

We used cross-sectional data from the baseline survey of the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) study, conducted in 2002 - 2005. The study examined 24, 012 men and women born between 1933 and 1957, randomly selected from the general populations of Novosibirsk (Russia), Krakow (Poland) and six towns of the Czech Republic. To allow for age-related height loss we estimated maximum attained height. Parental education and household item ownership at age 10 were used as markers of childhood socioeconomic conditions. In all 5 -year birth cohorts, Novosibirsk men and women were shortest. There were positive and statistically significant <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> childhood conditions and in maximum adult height.

40|$|One {{might expect}} that {{differences}} in income elasticities in trade and/or differences in growth rates among countries would give rise to strong <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> real exchange rates; for example, fast-growing countries might need steady depreciation to get the world to accept their growing exports.

The net effect of this relationship between elasticities and growth rates is that <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> real exchange rates are much smaller than one might otherwise have expected: relative PPP holds fairly well.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the <b>secular</b> <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> pubertal development {{in relation to}} the <b>secular</b> <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> height. Methods: Literature review of cross-sectional, longitudinal and twin studies. Results: Globally, there is a <b>secular</b> <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> adolescent growth for an increased mean final height at adulthood. To a lesser extent, there is also a <b>secular</b> <b>trend</b> towards earlier puberty. However, it seems that the two trends are not strongly connected. The increase in average height over the generations can, to a large extent, be explained by an earlier onset of the growth hormone-dependent phase of growth in early life. The age when this growth 'spurt' occurs in childhood strongly correlates with final height, but is not related to the age at peak height velocity during puberty. There is a large variation in the timing of the onset of puberty; it is largely influenced genetically, as implied by studies in twins. The single environmental factor that stands out as most significant - possibly explaining as much as 25 % of the variation in the timing of puberty - is simply nutritional status in childhood; overnutrition and obesity seem to trigger pubertal onset. However, recent studies have identified that both shortness and thinness at birth are also associated with earlier pubertal maturation - a reverse of their impact during childhood years. Conclusions: More longitudinal studies are needed to understand the short- and long-term consequences of secular changes in both final height and pubertal development before we know how important the trends are.

RESULTS: Large differences were observed between birth cohorts in mortality from stomach cancer. In each country, these cohort differences were closely related to IMR/GDP levels at birth time.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate ancestry differences and secular changes in stature and limb proportions of South African population groups and to assess how these variables differ between individuals from southern and northern hemispheres. The sample comprised of osteometric and anthropometric data from modern black and white South Africans (17 and 68 years), North American and white European (Dutch and Swiss) populations. The sample was divided into birth cohorts of 5 years or 10 years to observe <b>secular</b> <b>trends.</b> Ancestry differences and <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> stature and limb proportions between South African population groups were compared. Also, differences and <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> stature and limb proportions were compared between white North American and European groups to determine whether differences exist between the southern and northern hemisphere groups. Additionally, the differences in stature between black and white South African and North American groups were compared. It was found that white South Africans were significantly taller than their black South African counterparts. Significant positive <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> stature were observed in black South African males while non-significant increases were observed in white South African males and white and black South African females. The <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> European samples are significantly greater than those observed in white South African males. Black South African groups had greater limb and distal limb lengths than white South African groups. Proximal limb ratios increased while the distal limb ratios decreased which suggests that regression formulae to estimate stature need to be regularly updated. The upper limb ratio and arm ratios were significantly higher in white South African groups compared to white North American groups. Secular changes are constantly taking place due to a combination of various factors such as climate, nutrition. Overall, secular changes in limb proportions indicate a trend where South African groups are becoming more similar to each other. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.
