50|$|In the United States, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 {{substantially}} curtailed {{the issue}} of debt <b>in</b> <b>bearer</b> <b>form.</b> The Act disallowed a tax-deduction of interest paid on any such bonds issued after 1982 by the issuer {{in the case of}} corporate bonds, and removed the tax-exemption of the interest to the holder in the case of municipal bonds. In contrast, registered bonds retained the tax-exempt treatment. A challenge to this tax treatment by the U.S. state of South Carolina was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of South Carolina v. Baker (1988), which upheld the law and brought to an end the further issue of virtually all U.S. municipal bearer bonds.|$|R

Usually, no official records were kept. The word Eurobond was originally created by Julius Strauss.|$|R
50|$|In the Republic of Ireland {{stamp duties}} are levied on various items {{including}} (but not limited to) credit cards, debit cards, ATM cards, cheques, property transfers, and certain court documents. Stamp duty was formerly a graduated progressive tax with more expensive the house bought {{the greater the}} stamp duty rate. The top rate slowly increased from 0.5% in 1882 to 3% in 1947, 5% in 1973, 6% in 1975, reaching its peak at 9% in 1997. The budget of 2008 inaugurated a series of rate reductions. After 2011 the stamp duty tax is set at 1% for residential properties up to €1 million and 2% on the remaining amount. Non-residential real property, building, insurance policies, the intangible business property goodwill are taxed at 2%. A lease for property of any type is taxed according to the lease duration, 1% of the average annual rent, or the market rate whichever is greater, if 35 years or less, 6% up to 100 years, and 12% for a lease of more than 100 years duration. Counterparts (duplicate copies) of documents are taxed the lesser of €12.50 or the duty on the original document. The value of property for stamp duty excludes VAT. Gifts are taxed at market value. Several exemptions including those for gifts between close relatives and first time home buyers expired in 2010. The transfer of stocks and marketable securities is taxed at 1% if over €1,000 or if a gift.
