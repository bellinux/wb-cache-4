5|$|The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and Macau's Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau both hoisted <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> signal 1 on August1 as {{the system}} was located within 800km (497mi) of their {{respective}} cities. As Prapiroon neared the southern coast of China, the signal was raised to <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> signal 3 as strong winds were expected to strike the area. In Macau in particular this was further increased to <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> signal 8 SE on August3, as gale-force winds were expected in the southeastern areas. All signals were cancelled the next afternoon as Prapiroon moved inland.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{being named}} Nancy on February13, a gale warning {{was put in}} place for American Samoa. Later that day, four {{additional}} countries were placed under watches and warnings. A gale watch was declared for Samoa and <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> warnings were raised in Tuvalu, Tokelau and the Cook Islands. On February14, a tropical cyclone alert was declared for the southern Cook Islands. Additionally, Niue was placed under a <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> warning. Later that day, Wallis and Futuna were placed under a <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> warning. On February15, a hurricane warning was issued for the southern Cook Islands as Nancy tracked through the archipelago.|$|E

5|$|While {{passing through}} the Bahamas, David brought 70–80 mph (115–130 km/h) winds to Andros Island as the eye crossed the archipelago. David, though still disorganized, {{produced}} heavy rainfall in the country peaking at 8 inches (200 mm). <b>Strong</b> <b>wind</b> gusts uprooted trees, and overall damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Strong</b> <b>winds</b> {{in southwestern}} Haiti from the {{hurricane}} {{damaged or destroyed}} hundreds of trees. The path of Flora over the area was best determined by the trajectory of fallen trees across the peninsula. The <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> left entire villages roofless, with many buildings entirely destroyed. The combination of rough waves and <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> destroyed three entire communities. Many {{of those who died}} in southwestern Haiti suffered from intense burns from <b>strong</b> <b>winds.</b> In most areas, crops were entirely destroyed. The coffee crop was harvested prior to the arrival of the hurricane, though heavy rainfall and severe flooding ruined the crop for later years. Additionally, <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> downed shading trees for the coffee crop on the southern peninsula. One official estimated it would require three years for the coffee crop to be replanted and regrown.|$|R

5|$|On January 27, RSMC Nadi issued <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> {{warnings}} for Fiji, as 12F {{was expected}} to affect Fiji but not develop into a tropical cyclone until it had {{moved out of the}} archipelago. However, as 12F rapidly developed into a tropical cyclone during that day, RSMC Nadi was forced to issue gale force wind warnings for various parts of Fiji including Vanua Levu, Viti Levu, Beqa, Vatulele, Lomaiviti, Yasawa and Mamanuca.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, a {{circulation}} {{associated with an}} area of disturbed weather acquired convection and was designated Tropical Depression Nineteen-E. Upon formation, the depression was forecast to dissipate because of <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> shear. Moving little, its development was constantly hindered by wind shear. The depression had difficulty organizing, and on October 9, it became so disorganized that advisories were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|September 16, 1999– Hurricane Floyd {{crosses the}} entire state as a {{tropical}} storm, unleashing torrential rainfall amounting {{to a maximum of}} 13.34inches (33.88cm) in Somerville. Cape May reports a storm surge of 2.6feet (.79m). Five rivers, including the Raritan River, withhold too much water and exceed flood stages. <b>Strong</b> <b>wind</b> gusts leave over 650,000citizens without power during the storm's passage. Floyd caused great damage in the state and six casualties.|$|E
50|$|A major storm {{affected}} Newfoundland with <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> gusting to 100 km/h in some areas. Bitterly cold conditions, <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> {{and heavy}} snowfall caused a blizzard through parts of Newfoundland. Some areas of Newfoundland received between 20-40 cm. Local areas and local drifts were locally higher.|$|R
50|$|Nonetheless, {{the climate}} is severe with mean {{temperatures}} that rarely rise above 0 C {{and the presence of}} <b>strong</b> <b>winds.</b> The <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> produce a wind chill that makes the temperatures feel colder.

50|$|The only runway stays quite busy {{during the}} days when <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> blow perpendicularly to the runway axis. <b>Strong</b> <b>winds</b> are typical of this area, much {{stronger}} than nearby airports, sometime in excess of 40 km/h. Crosswinds of this strength rattle the hangars and keep almost everybody grounded.|$|R
5|$|<b>Strong</b> <b>wind</b> gusts left 700,000people {{without power}} from Miami to West Palm Beach, {{including}} the National Hurricane Center. The center briefly lost power, but during {{an hour and}} a half delay to reboot the computers, they obtained information from computers in the Mid-West and Washington, D.C. Officials from the Florida Power & Light Company were unable to repair power lines due to <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> gusts, while Irene's flooding submerged underground lines, preventing repairs until the waters subsided. Five people, including three in one family, were killed when they walked through electrified waters due to downed power lines. The rains from Irene flooded roads and canals, stalling numerous cars. Three people drowned when they drove their vehicles into the canals. The floodwaters persisted for nearly a week in areas, displacing hundreds from their homes and isolating thousands. Property damage in southeastern Florida totalled to $262million.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakening}} trend {{continued through}} the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong southerly shear. Josephine became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid-afternoon and the storm weakened to 40mph (65km/h), barely holding on to tropical storm status. Josephine regained {{a small amount of}} convection in the late night hours, but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm. Due to the lack of convection, Josephine was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at 11p.m. (EDT) with winds of 35mph (55km/h). Since there was no convection around the system, it would have normally been classified a remnant low but, due to the possibility of the storm regenerating over the next several days, it was considered a tropical depression. The next morning, Josephine was downgraded to a remnant low as <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm. No redevelopment was expected with Josephine as it began to move over colder waters and remain under <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> shear until it dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression One-C {{formed on}} July 26 from a {{disturbance}} {{that had been}} showing signs of organization {{for the past three}} days. It moved west to southwest through an unfavorable environment. On the morning of July 27, it dissipated due to <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> shear caused by an upper-level trough. The system never impacted land, thus no damage was reported.|$|E
