40|$|A {{dramatic}} {{decrease in}} the ratio of chloride to boron was observed in the liquid discharge of a well proposed for EGS development in the Coso geothermal field. The decrease appears {{to be related to}} the transformation of some <b>feed</b> <b>zones</b> in the well from liquid-dominated to vapor-dominated. High concentrations of boron are transported to the wellbore in the steam, where it fractionates to the liquid phase flowing in from liquid-dominated <b>feed</b> <b>zones.</b> The high-boron steam is created when the reservoir liquid in some of the <b>feed</b> <b>zones</b> boils with a steam fraction greater than 90 %.

40|$|Permeable <b>feed</b> <b>zones</b> in {{geothermal}} wells {{are commonly}} identified using well profiles of temperature, pressure and fluid velocity measured at different injection rates during well completion testing and heat-up. While this data gives {{some indication of}} the depth and relative strength of the <b>feed</b> <b>zones</b> it does not give any information {{on the nature of}} the permeability in those zones, be it primary or secondary. Fracturing is thought to contribute to permeability in areas targeted for deep reinjection in the Wairakei geothermal system, within the Tahorakuri and Waikora Formations. By characterizing those deep fractures in terms of orientation, density and aperture, as well as determining the orientation of the horizontal stress field it is possible to interpret the fracture component of the well permeability. This has implications both for well targeting and reservoir modelling. The recent use of high temperature acoustic formation imaging technology (AFIT) can provide the necessary fracture and stress data to assess the contribution of fractures to <b>feed</b> <b>zone</b> permeability. As part of an ongoing AFIT logging program at Wairakei, data has been collected from the open hole of a number of deep wells in the southern part of the field. The location of <b>feed</b> <b>zones</b> in these wells has been interpreted from the completion test data and then correlated with AFIT fracture density and aperture data to provide more accurate <b>feed</b> <b>zone</b> depths and to characterise the nature of the permeability. Only fractures with optimal orientation within the local stress field are considered as potentially open to fluid flow. While the correlation between <b>feed</b> <b>zones</b> and fracture density is poor, good correlation is observed with the location of individual wide-aperture fracture zones.

40|$|Abridged] We {{present an}} {{extensive}} suite of terrestrial planet formation simulations that allows quantitative {{analysis of the}} stochastic late stages of planet formation. We quantify the <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> width, Delta a, as the mass-weighted standard deviation of the initial semi-major axes of the planetary embryos and planetesimals {{that make up the}} final planet. The size of a planet's <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> in our simulations does not correlate with its final mass or semi-major axis, suggesting there is no systematic trend between a planet's mass and its volatile inventory. Instead, we find that the <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> of any planet more massive than 0. 1 M_Earth is roughly proportional to the radial extent of the initial disk from which it formed: Delta a~ 0. 25 (a_max-a_min), where a_min and a_max are the inner and outer edge of the initial planetesimal disk. These wide stochastic <b>feeding</b> <b>zones</b> have significant consequences for the origin of the Moon, since the canonical scenario predicts the Moon should be primarily composed of material from Earth's last major impactor (Theia), yet its isotopic composition is indistinguishable from Earth. In particular, we find that the <b>feeding</b> <b>zones</b> of Theia analogs are significantly more stochastic than the planetary analogs. Depending on our assumed initial distribution of oxygen isotopes within the planetesimal disk, we find a ~ 5 % or less probability that the Earth and Theia will form with an isotopic difference equal to or smaller than the Earth and Moon's. In fact we predict that every planetary mass body should be expected to have a unique isotopic signature. In addition, we find paucities of massive Theia analogs and high velocity moon-forming collisions, two recently proposed explanations for the Moon's isotopic composition. Our work suggests that there is still no scenario for the Moon's origin that explains its isotopic composition with a high probability event.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of coal-fired power station operations, elevated selenium concentrations {{have been reported in}} the sediments and biota of Lake Macquarie (New South Wales, Australia). In the present study, an ecosystem-scale model has been applied to determine how selenium in a seagrass food web is processed from sediments and water through diet to predators, using stable isotopes (δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N) to establish the trophic position of organisms. Trophic position, habitat, and <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> were examined as possible factors influencing selenium bioaccumulation. Selenium concentrations ranged from 0. 2 [*]μg/g dry weight in macroalgae species to 12. 9 [*]μg/g in the carnivorous fish Gerres subfasciatus. A mean magnification factor of 1. 39 per trophic level showed that selenium is biomagnifying in the seagrass food web. Habitat and <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> influenced selenium concentrations in invertebrates, whereas <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> was the only significant factor influencing selenium concentrations in fish. The sediment–water partitioning coefficient (Kd) of 4180 showed that partitioning of selenium entering the lake to particulate organic material (POM) is occurring, and consequently availability to food webs from POM is high. Trophic transfer factors (invertebrate[*]=[*] 1. 9; fish[*]=[*] 1. 2) were similar to those reported for other water bodies, showing that input source is not the main determinant of the magnitude of selenium bioaccumulation in a food web, but rather the initial partitioning of selenium into bioavailable POM. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Last {{year the}} first {{robotized}} milking machines {{were introduced in}} Latvia. Their main peculiarity {{lies in the fact}} that cows are milked without the help of people. The animals can go to the milking place independently at their own will and at any time of the day. After milking they can move to the <b>feeding</b> <b>zones</b> as well as to the recreation zones. For trafficking of animals from one functional zone to another several solutions have been elaborated. On the training and research h farm “Vecauce ” of the Latvia University of Agriculture where the research was carried out the cows are milked by two robots and the feed first cow traffic system is applied. In this case the cows can get to the concentrated <b>feed</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> going through the sorting gate. Here the animals are identified and the necessity for milking is evaluated and depending upon it the cows are directed to the pre-milking area or to the zone where the concentrated feed distribution stands are located. In Vecauce also another innovation is introduced – the cows after leaving the first robot get back to the pre-milking area and only after that through a separate sorting gate they can get into the <b>feeding</b> <b>zone.</b> The aim of our research was to state how often the cows attend robots during a day and to evaluate the cow traffic system applied in Vecauce. In the research it was stated that the cows are milked in robots in the average 2. 9 times a day. But the trafficking of cows milked in the first robot to the <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> through the pre-milking area is not rational as a part of the milked cows return to the robot repeatedly so increasing the load of this robot. In order to eliminate this disadvantage proposals have been developed for reconstruction of the pre-milking area and for improvement of the animal trafficking system.

40|$|We {{examined}} how {{the volume and}} temporal heterogeneity of water supply changed the vertical distribution and mortality of a belowground herbivore, and consequently affected plant biomass. Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae) seedlings were grown at one per pot under different combinations of water volume (large or small volume) and heterogeneity (homogeneous water conditions, watered every day; heterogeneous conditions, watered every 4 days) in {{the presence or absence}} of a larva of the belowground herbivorous insect, Anomala cuprea (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae).

With a large water volume, plant biomass was lower in free treatment than in control treatment regardless of heterogeneity. Plant biomass in free treatment was as low as in top treatment. With a small water volume and in free treatment, plant biomass was low (similar to that under top treatment) under homogeneous water conditions but high under heterogeneous ones (similar to that under middle or bottom treatment). Therefore, there was little effect of belowground herbivory on plant growth under heterogeneous water conditions. In other watering regimes, herbivores would be distributed in the shallow soil and reduced root biomass. Herbivore mortality was high with homogeneou...|$|R

40|$|A {{planetesimal}} {{moving in}} the solar nebula experiences an aerodynamic drag which causes its orbit to circularize and shrink. However resonant perturbations from a protoplanet interior to the planetesimal's orbit can counteract both the orbital decay and the damping of the eccentricity: the planetesimal can be captured into an orbital resonance and its eccentricity pumped up to an equilibrium value. The resonance trapping phenomenon is sensitive to several factors and we elaborate on these below. Orbital resonances form (partial) barriers to the transport of planetesimals into the <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> of the protoplanet.

40|$|Albatrosses exhibit {{extremely}} low reproductive rates, each pair brooding only one egg and subsequent chick at a time. Furthermore, {{in several of}} the species, the majority of successful pairs breed only once every second year (termed 'biennial' breeding). Thus, on average, these latter species have an annual fecundity of about half an offspring per year, while other albatrosses produce an egg and chick every year. Using our 40 -year bank of demographic data, we compared 12 species of albatrosses according to these two breeding strategies to examine potential causes of biennial breeding. Biennial breeding could be due to physiological constraints, larger animals breeding more slowly, or ecological constraints, more distant pelagic feeding trips being energetically costly, or both. We tested these hypotheses by looking for predicted associations between the duration of the rearing period, the distance to the oceanic <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> and breeding frequency. We also looked for associations of these variables with other life-history traits. Body size had a strong influence on the duration of the rearing period, but not on the distance that birds travelled to the <b>feeding</b> <b>zone.</b> Both the duration of the rearing period and distance to the <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> appeared to have direct influences on breeding frequency, as revealed by a path analysis, and thus both hypotheses to explain biennial breeding were supported. Finally, breeding frequency exhibited a strong trade-off with adult survival and age at maturity, indicating that slower breeders live through more breeding seasons, perhaps mitigating their lower annual reproductive output...|$|R

First fluid losses and main <b>feed</b> <b>zone</b> were found {{at a depth of}} 1226  m. Immediately after drilling, geothermal fluids with a flow rate of 35  l/s, flowed up the annulus between casing and drill string. This rather unexpected incident had to be quenched with cold water. After a temperature survey, accompanied with pumping 44  l/s of cold water into the well, interzonal flow and possible underground blow-out conditions occurred. It was observed that potentially supercritical fluids, with pressures above 220 bars and temperatures of more than 380  °C were entering the main <b>feed</b> <b>zone</b> at 1226  m. High temperatures damaged the float valve in the drill string and fluid leakage was observed on top of the lubricator at the wellhead assembly. Controlling the well after drilling operations with cold water proved to be immensely difficult and unsuccessful. The NJ- 11 well was partially abandoned by inserting a 200  m plug made from gravel and the well was eventually completed with a slotted liner down {{to the top of the}} gravel plug. The well was later produced from upper aquifers (Steingrimsson et al. 1986). The experience gained from the NJ- 11 well led to the creation of the Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) to further investigate supercritical geothermal fluids.
