In experiment 1, addition of 1. 1 g/kg methionine alone to SGM-based diet had no significant effect on weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio. However, addition of 9. 6 g/kg lysine alone or with 1. 1 g/kg methionine to SGM-based diet improved (P< 0. 05) weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio. In experiment 2, weight gain (Y) of the birds decreased as dietary <b>sorghum</b> <b>gluten</b> level (X) increased such that Y= 697. 35 - 11. 77 X. A similar relationship between feed intake (Y) and SGM level (X) was also observed (Y= 1405 - 14. 22 X).

40|$|Although sorghum {{has been}} used for centuries as a food-crop in Africa and India, {{researchers}} in the United States and Europe have only relatively recently become interested in the potential of this unique cereal. Much of this interest focuses on the potential use of sorghum in food product development for individuals with allergies to foods containing wheat-based flours. Because it lacks <b>gluten,</b> <b>sorghum</b> is considered safe for people diagnosed with celiac disease, a condition marked by intolerance to gluten. Recent studies have shown that certain sorghum varieties, tan-plant sorghums, can be used to produce high-quality food and beverage products including cookies, waffles, flour, bread, noodles and beer. The intention is to promote the use and marketing of these sorghums in the Italian Campania Region for sorghum flours suitable as food for celiac patient...|$|R

There are thousands of sorghum lines that have not been characterized for grain, flour or end product quality. The objective of the research was to gain an understanding among grain sorghum quality factors and Chinese egg noodles quality. Four sorghum hybrids were characterized and evaluated for kernel characteristics, proximate analysis, flour composition and end product in a Chinese egg noodle system. Kernel size and weight affected the flour particle size and the amount of starch damage. Flour with fine particle size and high starch damage conferred noodles with high firmness and high tensile strength. Water uptake was highest for flour with smaller particle size (38 μm at 50...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sorghum</b> is a <b>gluten</b> free {{cereal and}} forms the staple diet of a {{majority}} of the populations living in the semi-arid tropics dough. It is usually consumed in the form of bread made from the grain flour. Dough made with sorghum flour has poor viscoelastic properties compared to wheat dough and mechanical methods for production of sorghum roti are scarce. This study was conducted to elucidate the rheological and thermal properties of sorghum dough to establish its behavior. The temperature and amount of water used for preparation of the dough and the composition of the flour were varied. Wheat, soya and black gram flours were used to prepare the composite doughs. Sensory characteristics of roti made with these dough samples by the traditional method and mechanical compression were studied. The results are presented and their implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to evaluate the effects of particles sizes on contents of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) by using nylon bags F 57 (Ankom®) and non-woven textile (NWT 100 g/m²). In the first experiment, to check contents of NDF obtained with {{each one of the}} textilles, quantitative filter paper (purified cellulose) was used as analytical standard. The material was processed in a 1 or 2 mm and put in the bags in a ratio of 20 mg of dry matter/cm² of surface. The analyses were performed in a fiber analyser (Ankom 220) and using a heat-stable a-amylase. No effects of particles sizes were found. In the second experiment, it was used samples of forage (signal grass hay, sugar cane, coastcross hay, corn straw, corn silage, and elephant grass at 50 and 250 days of growing after cutting), concentrate feeds (<b>sorghum</b> grain, <b>gluten</b> meal, citrus pulp, cottonseed meal, soybean meal, wheat bran, corn grain, whole soybean, and soybean hulls), and feces of cattle of animals fed diets containing 15 or 50 % of concentrate. The samples were prepared, put in bags, and analyzed as described in the previous experiment. In both experiments, the smallest contents of NDF were found by using nylon bags, indicating loss of particles through the bag porosity. It is suggested grind of samples by using 1 -mm screen sieve, which provides efficient extraction of cell content by the action of neutral detergent and a greater specific surface by the action of the heat-stable a-amylase enzyme. The use of particles ground at 2 -mm overestimates NDF contents...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} {{balanced}} diets, which may elicit improved growth of fish, requires appropriate selection of available protein sources. This study aims at clustering feedstuffs according to amino acid profile, determining which ones show {{essential amino acids}} (EAA) profiles closer to the ideal dietary amino acids requirements of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and studying the relationship among amino acids feedstuffs groups. Tabled data on EAA more cystine and tyrosine, in relation to lysine contents, of 40 feedstuffs ordinarily used to formulate fish diets were studied. Feedstuffs were grouped according to amino acids profile by cluster analysis of Euclidean distances. The principal components {{analysis was used to}} determine the relationship among amino acids in each feedstuff group. Three groups of ingredients were parted and two ingredients, low tannin <b>sorghum</b> and corn <b>gluten</b> meal 60 %, did not go with any group. Dietary amino acids requirements of Nile tilapia were similar to the amino acid profile of 22 feedstuffs. The principal component analysis explained with three principal components more than 75 % of total variance of amino acids in three feedstuff groups. Therefore, until additional, detailed information on amino acids availability of different ingredients is consolidated, total amino acids profiles will continue to be important information to select and use conventional or surrogate ingredients for formulating and processing feeds for tilapia...|$|R
40|$|Grain sorghum is {{generating}} new excitement on {{the health}} food scene. Why? For one reason, flour milled from grain <b>sorghum</b> has NO <b>GLUTEN!</b> That’s important to those people with an intolerance to gluten-containing products (Celiac disease). Sorghum is high in antioxidants (cancer prevention) and insoluble fiber (slowly digested), with relatively small amounts of soluble fiber. The protein and starch in sorghum endosperm are more slowly digested than other cereals. The slower rate of digestibility of sorghum products may be beneficial to diabetics. So how is sorghum flour used in baking? It can be substituted for wheat, rice or soybean flour {{in a wide variety}} of baked goods. Its bland flavor and light color does not alter the taste of finished products. The value of sorghum flour in baking has been known for many years in El Salvador. In fact, Clemencia Barrera (in photo below) is one of about 150 small village bakers in El Salvador who uses sorghum flour as a substitute for wheat flour. According to Clemencia, “I use sorghum flour as a substitute for wheat in my bakery because it increases my profit. ” Clemencia’s profits are about US$ 40 per week which is good in El Salvador villages. In addition, sorghum flour is versatile and can be used for a wide range of baked products, is nutritional and has excellent physical qualities. It is also about 24 % cheaper and the price is more stable than wheat flour. But most importantly, it is a 100 % salvadoreña product, thus minimizing the need for wheat which is not locally grown and must be imported...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryRebecca A. ReganSorghum {{is unique}} {{in terms of its}} {{resistance}} to drought and heat and is grown and consumed around the globe. Moreover, sorghum does not contain gluten and has potential in the gluten-free market. A blend of non-wheat flour, starch and hydrocolloid typically provide the structure of gluten-free products. Most research on sorghum bread uses a yeast leavened process, HPMC gum, rice flour and corn, potato, or tapioca starch. Little is known about the functionality or interactions of different starches and hydrocolloids in sorghum batter. The objectives of this study were to examine starch-hydrocolloid interaction in chemically leavened <b>gluten</b> free <b>sorghum</b> bread; to evaluate the effects of different ingredients on gluten free bread quality made with sorghum flour: starch (tapioca starch, rice flour and potato starch) : hydrocolloid (HPMC, locust bean gum and xanthan) and to develop a chemically leavened <b>gluten</b> free <b>sorghum</b> bread method. Bread was baked as pup loaves. Volume index was measured using the AACCI Method 10 - 91. 01 template, crumb grain was evaluated using the C-Cell Imaging System and texture was determined with the TA. XT Plus Texture Analyzer. The base formula was commercial sorghum flour, water, starch, hydrocolloid, sugar, salt, shortening and double acting baking powder. Sorghum flour: starch (tapioca starch, rice flour and potato starch) ratios of 70 : 30, 80 : 20 and 90 : 10 were tested. Loaves containing all levels of rice flour had the same volume index (~ 165) as 100 % sorghum flour (168) while all levels of tapioca starch and potato starch produced significantly smaller loaves (~ 150). The ratio of 90 % sorghum flour and 10 % starch (tapioca starch, rice flour and potato starch) was selected. The type and level of hydrocolloid significantly impacted loaf volume, grain and texture. Starch-hydrocolloid combinations which produced the best loaves were tapioca starch + 3 % HPMC, rice flour + 3 % xanthan and potato starch + 4 % xanthan. Following initial optimization experiment, egg ingredients, fat, baking powder and water were added and evaluated individually to develop an optimized formulation. In general, addition of egg ingredients, shortening and oil did not improve the overall quality of sorghum based bread and were not added to the formula. However, emulsified shortening was effective. The best level of emulsified shortening was determined to be 3 % for the breads with sorghum flour: tapioca starch or sorghum flour: potato starch and 5 % for bread made with sorghum flour: rice flour. The best baking powder (SALP and MCP) levels were 5, 8 and 5 % for sorghum flour: tapioca starch bread, sorghum flour: rice flour bread and sorghum flour: potato starch bread, respectively. Optimum levels of water for sorghum flour: tapioca starch bread, sorghum flour: rice flour bread, and sorghum flour: potato starch bread were 120, 110 and 120 %, respectively. This research showed that different starch sources have different interactions with other ingredients in chemically leavened <b>sorghum</b> based <b>gluten</b> free bread...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. White, brown, and black sorghum brans, wheat bran, and a waxy barley flour were each substituted for 0 - 30 % of wheat flour in a bread formula. Each of the brans were then combined with the barley flour and substituted for a total of 20 - 25 % of the wheat flour in the bread formula. The brans and barley flour were analyzed for dietary fiber, phenols, tannins, anthocyanins, and ORAC values. Effects of substitutions on bread qualities were evaluated and optimum levels of use were determined. All the brans contained similar levels of dietary fiber (41 - 48 %). The brown sorghum bran was highest in tannins, phenols, and ORAC value, and the black sorghum bran was highest in anthocyanins. The barley flour contained significantly less dietary fiber (13. 9 %) and higher levels of ?-glucans (4. 4 %) than the brans. More than 15 % brown or black sorghum bran in the bread formula significantly reduced specific volumes. Interactions between tannins in the brown <b>sorghum</b> bran and <b>gluten</b> proteins, and puncturing of air cells by sharp glume fragments in the black sorghum bran were determined to adversely affect dough structure. The optimum usage level of 15 % was chosen for the brans based on bread qualities and dietary fiber levels (~ 3 g/serving). Brown and black sorghum brans added significant levels of antioxidants/phenolic compounds to the bread and gave a dark brown color. The optimum level of 20 % barley flour in the bread added significant levels of soluble fiber (0. 9 g/serving), minimally affected color, and did not contribute excessive chewiness. Acceptability scores for 20 % barley flour bread were not significantly different from those for wheat bran or non-waxy barley flour bread. Breads containing the optimum combinations of 10 % barley flour/ 10 % bran had specific volumes similar to those for 15 % bran and 20 % barley flour breads, and were good sources of total (~ 3 g/serving) and soluble dietary fiber (0. 7 g/serving). Those with brown or black sorghum bran were significantly higher in phenolic compounds. The use of sorghum brans and barley flour in bread adds soluble and insoluble dietary fiber as well as antioxidants. Breads containing these beneficial ingredients could be promoted as nutraceuticals or functional foods...|$|R
