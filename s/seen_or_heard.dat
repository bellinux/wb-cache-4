5|$|By the 1920s, the kakapo was {{extinct in}} the North Island and its range and {{numbers in the}} South Island were declining. One of its last refuges was rugged Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, it was often <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard,</b> and {{occasionally}} eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of kakapo were becoming scarce.|$|E
5|$|Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) informs Black that, {{before his}} escape, Fabricant {{had married a}} {{correspondent}} he met through a prison pen-pal service. Watts and Black interview the woman, Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), at her home. Butler is adamant she has not <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> from Fabricant since his escape. However, Black finds information on Butler's computer which he believes is linked to his own home address; and photographs of a judge who he recognizes as having been murdered.|$|E
5|$|The really curious part of {{this story}} is that, after {{everything}} had been explained, and all had been restored to their normal courses of action, none of the personages involved in it married each other. They were all so annoyed at having made such fools of themselves that they {{walked out of the}} inn in different directions, and were never <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> of again.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan and her Zerg forces became the dominant faction in the Koprulu Sector, having annihilated the United Earth Directorate's Expeditionary Force, defeated the Terran Dominion, and invaded the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. However, after {{the conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan retreats to Char, despite having more than enough power to crush all remaining resistance in the Koprulu Sector. In the four {{years leading up to}} the events of StarCraft II, she has not been <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> from by any of the other characters.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{toured the}} Philippines in July 1966, playing two {{shows at the}} Rizal Memorial Football Stadium in Manila. Epstein unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady Imelda Marcos when {{presented}} with {{an invitation to a}} breakfast party. He had politely declined on behalf of the group, as it was their policy never to accept such official invitations. The Beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel on the same day and given a police escort to the airport, even though Epstein had publicly apologised for the misunderstanding in a televised statement, which was not <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> because of static. The entourage boarded the plane for home, but Epstein and Beatles' assistant Mal Evans were ordered off, both believing {{that they would not be}} allowed back on the plane. Epstein was forced to give the tax authorities £6,800 worth of Philippine peso notes earned from the Manila shows and to sign a tax bond verifying the exchange before being allowed back on the plane with Evans.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the group {{dispersed}} after the events. Peter the Painter was never <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> from again. It was assumed he left the country, and there were several possible sightings in the years afterwards; none were confirmed. Jacob Peters returned to Russia, rose to be deputy head of the Cheka, the Soviet secret police, and was executed in Joseph Stalin's 1938 purge. Trassjonsky had a mental breakdown and was confined for a time at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum. Her eventual fate and date of death are unknown. Dubof, Federoff and Hoffmann disappeared from the records; Vassilleva remained in the East End for the remainder of her life and died at Brick Lane in 1963. Smoller left the country in 1911 and travelled to Paris, after which he disappeared; Milstein later emigrated to live in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Four years later, Raynor's rebel {{movement}} is contracted {{by a group}} called the Moebius Foundation to recover pieces of a Xel'Naga artifact which is ultimately used on Char by a combined force of Raynor's Raiders and Terran Dominion expeditionary fleet to deinfest the Queen of Blades, restoring Sara Kerrigan's humanity. After her deinfestation, Kerrigan is relentlessly pursued by Arcturus Mengsk; during one such raid Arcturus's Dominion forces capture and allegedly summarily execute the rebel commander. It is later revealed that Raynor was not in fact executed, but held prisoner as a hostage to keep Kerrigan in line. After being freed from his prison Raynor assists Kerrigan as she storms the Dominion capital of Augustgrad on the planet Korhal After a showdown with Arcturus Mengsk inside his Palace, Kerrigan manages to gain the upper hand with help from James Raynor, and kills Arcturus by overloading his body with psychic energy, causing him to explode spectacularly. In Legacy of the Void, Raynor and his Raiders are now part of the Dominion military under the new Emperor Valerian, and (with the aid of Artanis and his protoss forces) defend Korhal from an attack by Amon. Joining with Artanis and Kerrigan later on, Raynor watches as Kerrigan ascends to become a Xel'naga and destroys Amon once and for all; two years later, Kerrigan – in human form – visits Raynor at the bar on Mar Sara where he began in Wings of Liberty, and he leaves with her. He is not <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> from again.|$|E

25|$|The strip focuses {{entirely on}} a social circle of young children, where adults exist but are rarely <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard.</b> The main character, Charlie Brown, is meek, nervous, and lacks self-confidence.

25|$|Philip {{was thus}} officially {{declared}} the 2,751st {{victim of the}} Twin Towers' collapse. The decision leaves only one missing person whose possible death at the World Trade Center is unresolved. Fernando Molinar, a Mexican immigrant, has not been <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> from since September 8, 2001, when he told his mother on the telephone that he was starting a new job at a pizzeria near the building. A similar petition to Surrogate's Court on his behalf also was rejected.|$|E
50|$|However, the fog was {{so thick}} that nearby {{residents}} were unaware of the crash.

25|$|Jessica Lynn Heeringa was an engaged {{mother of}} a young son who {{disappeared}} from her job at an ExxonMobil station in Norton Shores, Michigan, on April 26, 2013 {{and has not been}} <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> from since. She left behind her purse, jacket, cigarettes, money and car. Investigators also found a few drops of blood outside the gas station. Through a DNA analysis the blood was matched to Heeringa. They also found accessory parts to a gun near the blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{new channel}} {{was to be}} funded by a {{combination}} of government subsidies and commercial sponsorship. The presence of commercials, not previously <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> on the ABC, resulted in the creation of an updated edition of the ABC Editorial and Programme Practices stipulating that the 'Australia Television service will retain editorial control and independence in all programming'. Paul Keating launched Australia Television International on 17 February 1993 – televised live to 50 countries in the southeast Asian region, from the ABC's television studios in Gore Hill.|$|E
25|$|As a {{nurse in}} a {{hospital}} ward, Lavinia speaks to wounded soldiers and prisoners of war in Washington, specifically asking about her brother, Isaac, who was imprisoned for assaulting a fellow government official. She had hoped that they had <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> from him {{while they were in}} the prison camps. The Washington officials ignore her plea to free Isaac. Lavinia is only able to speak to the president on Isaac's behalf because of the intervention of a man, Dr. Norval's friend, Mr. Sinclair. Lavinia then realizes that her belief in being able to voice her opinions equally with men is unrealistic.|$|E

25|$|Alexander {{was finally}} {{identified}} {{as the result of}} efforts to locate her in the 2010s by a school friend of hers from Brooksville, Florida. Unable to find her on social media or through other conventional means, she turned to Alexander's family who told her that Tammy, who often ran away from home, had not been <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> from since the late 1970s. In 2014 they filed a missing persons report with the Hernando County, Florida sheriff's office; shortly afterwards a CPA and artist who had painted one of the reconstructions of the unidentified girl's face saw the report online and, noting the similarities, contacted the Livingston County sheriff. A mitochondrial DNA match with one of Alexander's living relatives was made early in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Ro Leap was Ung's {{home for}} the next {{eighteen}} months. Cut off from all outside communication and constantly in fear of soldiers who patrolled the village, the Ungs were forced by the Khmer Rouge to work long hours with very little food. Near-starvation and physical exhaustion became a way of life. A few months after their arrival, Loung's oldest brothers, eighteen-year-old Meng and sixteen-year-old Khouy, and her oldest sister, fourteen-year-old Keav, were sent away to work in different camps. Six months later, in August 1976, Keav died of food poisoning at the teenagers’ work camp at Kong Cha Lat. In December, two soldiers came to the Ungs' hut and demanded the help of Loung's father to free a stuck wagon; he was never <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> from again.|$|E
25|$|Bizarre {{deaths and}} {{unresolved}} disappearances became more commonplace {{at the house}} throughout the years. Several female servants disappeared and one of John Rimbauer's friends died of a bee sting in the solarium, while his business partner (whom Rimbauer had cheated out of {{his share of the}} oil company's profits) hanged himself in front of Rimbauer's children in the parlour room of Rose Red. Six-year-old April also vanished while playing in the kitchen, never to be <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> <b>heard</b> from again. Sukeena, who was babysitting April, was the last person to see her alive and was tortured mercilessly by the local police after being suspected of April's murder. During April's disappearance eight-year-old Adam was sent off to attend boarding school and kept away from the house as much as possible. John Rimbauer committed suicide without warning by throwing himself from an upper stained-glass window (although viewers of the miniseries later learn that he was murdered by Ellen and Sukeena).|$|E
