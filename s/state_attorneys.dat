5|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an unlawful wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the electronic transfer of funds from unlawful gambling as defined under state laws. A number of <b>state</b> <b>attorneys</b> general have issued opinions concluding that DFS {{is a form of}} illegal gambling, while the state of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed as a sports pool. The New York State ruling, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. The state has since joined other states, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, in choosing to legalize and regulate DFS rather than prohibit it.|$|E

50|$|The {{institution}} {{of a public}} attorney's office (<b>Attorney</b> General - <b>State</b> <b>Attorney)</b> {{has a long tradition}} in Serbia. Since the year of 1842, in, then existing, Principality of Serbia, the State Financial Manager (Правитељствени фишкал) was established as a separate organ of the state, with the competence to perform the duty of a <b>state</b> <b>attorney.</b> This separate organ of the state was abolished only after a year, and the function of a <b>state</b> <b>attorney's</b> office was sent back within the competence of the Ministry of finance. However, within that Ministry, the function of the <b>state</b> <b>attorney's</b> office was always performed by particular employees - <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> (Правитељствени правобранитељ / Државни правобранитељ), of which fact we can find a trace in the Manual for a <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> from the year of 1848. In this form, the <b>State</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Office existed in Serbia until the year of 1934, when a Law on the <b>State</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Office came to power. By this Law, for the first time, the position and organization of the <b>State</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Office as a separate organ of the state within the Ministry of finance, was established in whole details. After World War II, the name was changed to the <b>State</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Office in the Public Attorney's Office, without essential change of competencies of this organ.|$|R

He decided to support a New Jersey lawsuit in 2000 against the Boy Scouts of America, in an attempt to require the Boy Scouts to accept homosexual scout leaders. The Supreme Court ruled against Edmondson's position, ruling that the Boys Scouts of America had the authority to set the criteria for leadership within their organization.|$|E
25|$|Edmondson {{was elected}} as Oklahoma Attorney General in 1994.

Notable cases investigated during his tenure as Attorney General have included the August, 2003 indictment of WorldCom and its former CEO Bernard Ebbers on charges of violating state securities laws although the charges were later dropped following Ebbers's federal sentencing.

25|$|As Attorney General, Spitzer {{stepped up}} {{the profile of}} the office. Traditionally, <b>state</b> <b>attorneys</b> general have pursued {{consumer}} rights cases, concentrating on local fraud while deferring national issues to the federal government. Breaking with this traditional deference, Spitzer took up civil actions and criminal prosecutions relating to corporate white-collar crime, securities fraud, Internet fraud, and environmental protection. The New York Attorney General's office has Wall Street (and thus many leading corporate and financial institutions) within its jurisdiction. Also, the New York Attorney General wields greater than usual powers of investigation and prosecution of corporations under New York State's General Business Law. In particular, under the Martin Act of 1921, the New York Attorney General has the power to subpoena witnesses and company documents pertaining to investigations of fraud or illegal activity by a corporation. Spitzer used this statute to allow his office to prosecute cases which have been described as within federal jurisdiction. Spitzer used this authority in his civil actions against corporations and criminal prosecutions against their officers. It proved useful in the wake of several U.S. corporate scandals that began with the collapse of Enron in 2001. Several of these corporations, as well as the brokerage houses that sold their stock, were accused of having inflated stock values by unethical means throughout the 1990s. When inquiries into these allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Congress failed, Spitzer's office used its subpoena power to obtain corporate documents, building cases against the firms both in courtrooms and in public opinion.|$|E
