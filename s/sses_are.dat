5000|$|Slow slip events (<b>SSEs)</b> <b>are</b> long lived {{shear slip}} events at {{subduction}} interfaces {{and the physical}} processes responsible for the generation of slow earthquakes. They are slow thrust-sense displacement episodes that can have durations up to several weeks, and are thus termed [...] "slow". In many cases, the recurrence interval for slow slip events is remarkably periodic and accompanied by tectonic tremor, prompting seismologists to term episodic tremor and slip (ETS). In the Cascadia, the return period for SSEs is approximately 14.5 months, but varies along {{the margin of the}} subduction zone. In the Shikoku region in southwest Japan, the interval is shorter at approximately 6 months, as determined by crustal tilt changes. Some SSEs have durations in excess of several years, like the Tokai SSE that lasted from mid-2000 to 2003.|$|E

5000|$|Low {{frequency}} earthquakes {{were first}} classified in 1999 when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began differentiating LFE's seismic signature in their seismicity catalogue. The discovery {{and understanding of}} LFEs at subduction zones {{is due in part}} to the fact that the seismic signatures of these events were found away from volcanoes. Prior to their discovery, tremor events of this style were mainly associated with volcanism where the tremor is generated by partial coupling of flowing magmatic fluids. Japanese researchers first detected [...] "low-frequency continuous tremor" [...] near the top of the subducting Philippine Sea plate in 2002. After initially interpreting this seismic data as dehydration induced tremor, researchers in 2007 found that the data contained many LFE waveforms, or LFE swarms. Prior to 2007, tremor and LFEs were believed to be distinct events that often occurred together, but contemporarily LFEs are known to be the largest constituent forming tectonic tremor. LFEs and <b>SSEs</b> <b>are</b> frequently observed at subduction zones in western North America, Japan, Mexico, Costa Rica, New Zealand, as well as in shallow strike slip faults in California.|$|E

This study explores the premises for managing health-promoting workplaces from a leadership perspective in eight Norwegian and ten Swedish SSEs. A stepwise qualitative approach and analysis were used to analyze data. The analysis shows two main categories: corporative health promotion workplaces and cultivating health-promoting leadership. The leader’s experience of solidarity and flexibility, self-steered task management, safety, trust and care, job satisfaction, loyalty, humor and recruitment indicates these as important components related to a health-promoting workplace. They point to the importance of being a process-oriented communicator, an all-rounder, and the need to make use of a dedicated and distinct leadership style. However, they also indicate problems with being a lonely problem solver, high and conflicting work demands and work-family conflicts. One conclusion is that leaders exhibit an awareness of the importance of applying a holistic approach for creating health-promoting workplaces. Another conclusion, which is not in line with previous research, is that the leaders exhibit a maturity about the importance of combining individual and organizational health promotion measures and that they have a high motivation to work with these areas...|$|E

30|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{various types of}} slow {{earthquake}} have been detected in the Ryukyu Trench. Slow slip events (SSEs), which are geodetically slow earthquakes with rupture durations of approximately one month, have been detected in the southern Ryukyu Trench. These SSEs occur repeatedly at intervals of six to seven months (Heki and Kataoka 2008) with magnitudes of 6.4 – 6.7. However, Nishimura (2014) found the occurrence of short-term SSEs with durations of two weeks or less to be distributed heterogeneously along the Ryukyu Trench. The major clusters of these short-term <b>SSEs</b> <b>are</b> located in the east of Amami Island, southeast of Okinawa Island, and beneath Iriomote Island.|$|E

Lack of such recognizable increase in seismicity associated with this particular SSE was also observed by Todd and Schwartz (2016). They explain that as the SSE occurred far away from the shore, the associated increase in seismicity, if any, was not recorded by the onshore network. Employing a better catalog with a lower magnitude cutoff could possibly help identify more earthquake swarms associated with SSEs.|$|E

30|$|The overall {{distribution}} of SSEs (Figure  4) suggests that short-term <b>SSEs</b> <b>are</b> common phenomena {{throughout the area}} from Shikoku to the Yaeyama Islands. It also indicates a degree of spatial heterogeneity, that is, short-term SSEs frequently occur in some areas but not in others. Although the observed heterogeneous SSE distribution is partly artificial due to inhomogeneous levels of detectability resulting from the GNSS network used, it must also reflect the true distribution of short-term SSEs. The total slip and number of SSEs vary along {{the east coast of}} Kyushu and the southeastern coast of Okinawa Island (Figure  4), even under a similar station distribution (Figure  1), which suggests that the true distribution of SSEs is not spatially equal. Most short-term SSEs occur at a depth of ≤ 50  km, but some exceptionally deep events occur along the Ryukyu Trench.|$|E
3000|$|We {{found that}} the {{estimated}} short-term <b>SSEs</b> <b>are</b> distributed heterogeneously.

The SSE band extends from west Shikoku to mid-Kyushu across the Bungo Channel, whereas the LFEs and LFTs disappear at Kyushu.

30|$|The {{location}} of shallow earthquakes along the plate interface varies along strike: earthquakes occur shallower {{and closer to}} the trench in the CNS crust than in the EPR crust (Protti et al. 1994; Newman et al. 2002). In June 2002, a Mw 6.4 earthquake occurred at a depth as shallow as ~ 9  km along the Costa Rica margin offshore the Osa Peninsula (Arroyo et al. 2009). The subduction zone beneath the Caribbean plate is also characterized by strong variations in fault-slip behavior. Recently, the network of GPS stations around the Nicoya Peninsula has detected SSEs accompanied by seismic tremors in the Costa Rica subduction zone, not only at depths of 25 to 30  km near the down-dip limit of the seismogenic zone but also at depths of ~ 6  km near the up-dip limit (Outerbridge et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2012). However, <b>SSEs</b> <b>are</b> not observed around the Osa Peninsula.|$|E
40|$|The discovery, {{primarily}} at subduction zones,of spontaneous aseismic slip events (slow-slip events, SSEs) {{has led to}} the recognition that SSEs represent behavior between steady sliding and dynamic earthquake rupture. Furthermore, slow slip, down dip of plate boundary seismicity (30 - to 45 -km depth), may delineate the lower boundary of the locked plate interface and constrain the fault ge-ometryof greatmagnitude (M) 8 to 9 earthquakes (1). SSEs have also been found recently at depths shal-lower than ~ 10 km on the decollement (or related faults) underlying the mobile south flank of Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano (2, 3). The Kilauea SSEs occur in a different tectonic setting and rheological context: up dip of the region of decollement seismicity, although potentially within the locked portion that can rupture in earthquakes greater thanM 7 (4, 5). Within a rate-state–dependent friction theoretical context, <b>SSEs</b> <b>are</b> believed tooccur at the transitionbetweenunstable and stable sliding.

30|$|An {{individual}} SSE {{represents a}} transient release of strain {{that occurs in}} the transition zone between locked and stable sliding zones, characterized by low rupture velocity (approximately 1 to 10  km/day), long duration (days to years), and no measurable radiating seismic energy (e.g., Ide et al. 2007). In southwest Japan, short-term SSEs and tremors have been observed to occur preferentially along the plate interface directly beneath the hydrated mantle wedge (Kato et al. 2010). This is attributed to the regional development of a substantially weak shear zone (101 to 103  m thick) along {{this portion of the}} plate interface caused by the presence of hydrous minerals such as serpentines and talc (Hirauchi et al. 2010 b; Kawano et al. 2011; Hirauchi et al. 2013).
