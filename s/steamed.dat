5|$|Guam then {{returned}} to Task Force 58, assigned to Cruiser Division 16, part of Task Group 58.4, and <b>steamed</b> to Okinawa. On the night of 2728 March, Guam {{and the rest of}} Cruiser Division 16 bombarded the airfield on Minamidaitō. After concluding the bombardment, Guam returned to the carrier screen while they conducted operations off Nansei Shoto until 11 May. The ship then <b>steamed</b> to Ulithi for periodic maintenance and to replenish ammunition and supplies. She {{then returned}} to Okinawa, assigned to Task Group 38.4 of William Halsey's Third Fleet. She continued to provide anti-aircraft defense for the carriers while they launched fighter sweeps of Kyushu. Guam and Alaska bombarded Oki Daitō {{for an hour and a}} half on 9 June, after which they <b>steamed</b> to San Pedro Bay in the Leyte Gulf, arriving on 13 June.|$|E
5|$|In early September, Idaho <b>steamed</b> to Guadalcanal, {{where she}} {{took part in}} amphibious assault training. On 12 September, she <b>steamed</b> to Peleliu and joined the preparatory {{bombardment}} of the island. In the ensuing Battle of Peleliu, dug in Japanese defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the assaulting Marines, with Idaho providing artillery support until 24 September, when she withdrew for an overhaul. She <b>steamed</b> to Manus and then to Bremerton, Washington, arriving on 22 October. During the refit, the 5-inch /25 cal. guns were replaced by ten 5-inch /38 cal. guns in single enclosed mounts; {{she was the only}} ship of her class to receive this modification. The installation of these guns required the removal of the last of the old 5-inch /51 guns, as the new weapons required continuous ammunition hoists. After completion of the work, she conducted training off California. On 28 January 1945, Idaho departed San Diego, bound for Pearl Harbor. There, she joined the bombardment group, which proceeded to the Marianas and then on 14 February <b>steamed</b> north to Iwo Jima, the target of the next major amphibious assault. The ship bombarded the Japanese defenders on 19 February as the Marines went ashore; Idaho remained there for nearly a month before withdrawing on 7 March to replenish at Ulithi.|$|E

50|$|The {{genesis of}} the idea of vapour quality was derived from the origins of thermodynamics, where an {{important}} application was the <b>steam</b> engine. Low quality <b>steam</b> would contain a high moisture percentage and therefore damage components more easily. High quality <b>steam</b> would not corrode the <b>steam</b> engine. <b>Steam</b> engines use water vapour (<b>steam)</b> to drive pistons or turbines which create work. The quality of <b>steam</b> can be quantitatively described by <b>steam</b> quality (<b>steam</b> dryness), the proportion of saturated <b>steam</b> in a saturated water/steam mixture. I.e., a <b>steam</b> quality of 0 indicates 100% water while a <b>steam</b> quality of 1 (or 100%) indicates 100% <b>steam.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhen {{the unit}} is under normal operating, the <b>steam</b> source of plant-steam is from the fourth <b>steam</b> {{extraction}} of turbine. But at the low load operating condition, during the process that the <b>steam</b> source of plant <b>steam</b> switches to reheat cold section from the fourth <b>steam</b> extraction, <b>steam</b> power capability in the turbine is further reduced. In this paper, {{in order to improve}} the economy when the turbine is operating under the low load, reheat cold section <b>steam</b> is used as high-pressure <b>steam</b> to extract the fourth <b>steam</b> by the <b>steam</b> technology, which turns the low-pressure <b>steam</b> into the medium-pressure <b>steam</b> for recycling. This paper, taking 300 MW unit as an example, discusses the influence on the thermal economy of unit after putting the <b>steam</b> ejector into the plant <b>steam</b> system of thermal power plant...|$|R
50|$|In a <b>steam</b> engine, the {{superheater}} re-heats the <b>steam</b> {{generated by}} the boiler, increasing its thermal energy and decreasing the likelihood that it will condense inside the engine. Superheaters increase the thermal efficiency of the <b>steam</b> engine, and have been widely adopted. <b>Steam</b> which has been superheated is logically known as superheated steam; non-superheated <b>steam</b> is called saturated <b>steam</b> or wet <b>steam.</b> Superheaters were applied to <b>steam</b> locomotives in quantity from the early 20th century, to most <b>steam</b> vehicles, and to stationary <b>steam</b> engines.

5|$|Following {{her return}} from the North Sea sortie, Admiral Hipper was {{assigned}} to the forces tasked with the invasion of Norway, codenamed Operation Weserübung. The ship was assigned as the flagship of Group 2, along with the destroyers Paul Jakobi, Theodor Riedel, Friedrich Eckoldt, and Bruno Heinemann. KzS Heye was given command of Group 2 during the operation. The five ships carried a total of 1,700 Wehrmacht mountain troops, whose objective was the port of Trondheim; the ships loaded the troops in Cuxhaven. The ships <b>steamed</b> to the Schillig roadstead outside Wilhelmshaven, where they joined Group 1, consisting of ten destroyers, and the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, which were assigned to cover Groups 1 and 2. The ships <b>steamed</b> out of the roadstead at midnight on the night of 6–7 April.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other parts}} of the country, {{everyday}} meals generally include plain <b>steamed</b> rice as staple food with fish, meat, vegetable curries and lentil soup is common accompaniment. Plain rice is often replaced by roti or parata. Curry is the most popular style of preparing dishes.|$|E
50|$|A <b>steam</b> {{generator}} iron is {{a modified}} version of a standard <b>steam</b> iron. Like traditional <b>steam</b> irons, <b>steam</b> generator irons use a combination of heat and <b>steam</b> power to remove wrinkles while ironing, they usually have a water reservoir either fully attached or detachable and a boiler that converts the water into <b>steam.</b> A high volume of pressurised <b>steam</b> can be released either continuously or in burst mode. The main difference between a <b>steam</b> generator iron and a regular <b>steam</b> iron is the amount of <b>steam</b> they produce.|$|R
50|$|Superheaters heat {{saturated}} <b>steam</b> to {{a temperature}} above saturation point to ensure dry <b>steam</b> is being produced. Superheaters {{are necessary for}} when <b>steam</b> is being discharged to a turbine. Moisture in <b>steam</b> can damage the turbine blades, therefore superheated <b>steam</b> (very dry <b>steam)</b> is necessary.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>steam</b> {{generator}} irons, pressurised and non-pressurised. A non-pressurised <b>steam</b> generator iron will produce a lot of <b>steam</b> but the <b>steam</b> is released at a lower speed, typically around 80-100 grams per minute. A pressurised <b>steam</b> generator iron, on the other hand, creates a highly pressurised environment that helps the <b>steam</b> penetrate fabric more efficiently. A pressurised <b>steam</b> generator iron will typically have a <b>steam</b> output of 100-120 grams per minute. The amount of pressure a <b>steam</b> generator iron has is measured in bars, with a higher bar number meaning the <b>steam</b> has more pressure. <b>Steam</b> generator irons typically have 3-6 bars of pressure.|$|R

40|$|<b>Steam</b> is an {{essential}} medium used in the industrial process. To ensure <b>steam</b> quality, small and middle scale boilers are often adopted. However, because a higher <b>steam</b> pressure (compared to the necessary <b>steam</b> pressure) is generated, the boiler’s <b>steam</b> pressure will be reduced via a pressure regulator before the <b>steam</b> is directed through the process. Unfortunately, pressure is somewhat wasted during the reducing process. Therefore, {{in order to promote}} energy efficiency, a pressure regulator is replaced by a <b>steam</b> expander. With this <b>steam</b> expander, the pressure will be transformed into mechanical energy and extracted during the expansion process. A new type of isothermal <b>steam</b> expander for an industrial <b>steam</b> supplying system will be presented in the paper. The isothermal <b>steam</b> expander will improve the energy efficiency of a traditional <b>steam</b> expander by replacing the isentropic process with an isothermal expansion process. With this, <b>steam</b> condensation will decrease, energy will increase, and <b>steam</b> quality will be improved. Moreover, the mathematical model of the isothermal <b>steam</b> expander will be established by using the Schmidt theory, the same principle used to analyze Stirling engines. Consequently, by verifying the correctness of the theoretical model for the isothermal <b>steam</b> expander using experimental data, a prototype of 100 [*]c. c. isothermal <b>steam</b> expander is constructed...|$|R
50|$|The <b>steaming</b> area {{is covered}} with a special <b>steaming</b> sheet and {{weighted}} all around as with sheet <b>steaming.</b> The <b>steam</b> is injected underneath the sheet through an injector and protection tunnel. While with short areas up to 30 m length <b>steam</b> is frontally injected, with longer areas <b>steam</b> is induced {{in the middle of the}} beet using a T-connection branching out to both sides. As soon as the sheet is inflated to approximately 1 m by the <b>steam</b> pressure, the suction turbine is switched on. First, the air in the soil is removed via the suction hoses. A partial vacuum is formed and the <b>steam</b> is pulled downward. During the final phase, when the required <b>steaming</b> depth has been reached, the ventilator runs non-stop and surplus <b>steam</b> is blown out. To ensure that this surplus <b>steam</b> is not lost, it is fed back under the sheet. As with all other <b>steaming</b> systems, a post-steaming period of approximately 20-30 minutes is required. <b>Steaming</b> time is approximately 1 hour per 10 cm <b>steaming</b> depth.
