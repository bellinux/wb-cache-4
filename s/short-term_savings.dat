5000|$|Employment of {{registered}} nurses and nurse practitioners {{is expected to}} increase immensely in the next ten years through legislation and the idea of <b>short-term</b> <b>savings.</b> Much of the growth is expected to come as a result of legislation and proliferation of online schools, leading to the idea of better health care and a greater variety of solutions for health problems which have not been proven through appropriate research. Also, life expectancy is getting longer; therefore more patients are living longer and living more active lives. It is further anticipated that the need for NPs will increase because of the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Growth is also expected to be much faster in outpatient centers, where the patients do not stay overnight. Moreover, the increasing number of procedures that were once only available in hospitals are now in physicians' offices. The need for NPs is expected to be greatest in places where people have long-term illnesses such as dementia or head trauma patients that are in need of extensive rehabilitation. [...] "Nurse practitioners really are becoming a growing presence, particularly in primary care," [...] said David I. Auerbach, PhD, the author and a health economist at RAND Corp. In addition, this site says that nurse practitioners are expected to double by 2025. Auerbach also told American Medical News, [...] "There’s a lot of experimentation going on looking at different ways of working together, and there’s {{a lot of interest in}} collaborative team-based models. The new care models, such as the patient-centered medical home and accountable care organizations, really depend on nurse practitioners and physician assistants." [...] As a result of the PPACA, hospitals and medical care facilities are forced to rethink the demand for nurses and non-physician providers. This is mainly because this new Act drew millions of people the opportunity at medical attention that did not have it before, and because there are so many new people in need of medical attention, the need for medical professionals also grows. With the combination of this new Act, and the aging Baby Boomer population, there is expected to be a large increase in the need for medical staff, especially physicians. Unfortunately, the Act did not account for the need for increased physician residency expansion thus creating an artificial shortage of physicians in an already-overloaded system. According to a study published in American Medical News (an online publication that no longer exists), nurse practitioners' jobs are expected to grow up to 130 percent from 86,000 in 2008 to 198,000 in 2025 through aggressive lobbying. Though there is some skepticism to these vast figures, they are backed up by many studies and the opinions of very well known medical professionals.As a result of this extreme need for NPs, they are also expected to receive more autonomy through lobbying for legislation, meaning that nurse practitioners would be able to fill the traditional primary care role like a physician would despite not having had to train like one. For an example, a nurse practitioner would be able to prescribe medication without the oversight of a doctor, which would be dangerous without appropriate pharmacology courses and examinations. Many states are passing laws that allow for independent practice of nurse practitioners due to the aggressive nurse lobby. [...] "Currently there are 12 states with active legislation looking at utilizing nurse practitioners at the top of their education to meet patient care needs," [...] said Dr. Tayin Kopanos with the American Association of Nurse Practitioners. Many nurses and other leaders in healthcare are advocating for overturning laws that require physicians to look over the work of NPs.|$|E

In this paper, we explore the new communication services enabled by the Internet, including examples of new and potential services.

SIP is an open, non-proprietary standard modeled after HTTP that seamlessly integrates with the Internet. Because of its easy integration and ability to inter-operate with other protocols and vendors, SIP is the foundation for flexible and scalable VoIP (Voice over IP) solutions. Present telecommunication networks and services provide adequate and universal telephone service at affordable rates.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this {{doctoral}} thesis we analyse changes in old-age income risk in Germany using micro-simulation model due to changes in employment patterns and institutional reforms. We focus on the statutory pension scheme and we analyse the old-age income risk of individuals as well as of households with respect to the skill level. Our findings help to clarify the risk of post-retirement poverty for specific household constellations We find that the risk of old-age poverty will increase for almost all new pensioners in 2020 - 2022 compared to new pensioners in 2004 - 2006. Due to the characteristics of a PAYG pension system, political decision-makers have to improve labour market participation, e. g. by support the improvement of skill level. Moreover we take a closer look at the impact of the Hartz-Reforms on wages. We use panel data to estimate the effect of the structural break on wages and find strong evidence that the decrease in unemployment benefit lowered wages. Our findings show that the Hartz-Reform induced wage restraint and may also be partly responsible for the favourable labour market situation in Germany. After analysing the effect of institutional reforms on old-age income and wage, we examine whether households adjust their savings behaviour to a change in their individual unemployment, income and health expectations. We use survey panel data on German household savings and expectations. The findings suggest, in contrast to the theory of textbook models, that a higher unemployment expectation significantly decreases the (<b>short-term)</b> <b>saving</b> rate.

40|$|Background: In {{the wake}} of a {{national}} economic downturn, the state of California, in 2009 – 2010, implemented budget cuts that eliminated state funding of HIV prevention and testing. To mitigate the effect of these cuts remaining federal funds were redirected. This analysis estimates the impact of these budget cuts and reallocation of resources on HIV transmission and associated HIV treatment costs. Methods and Findings: We estimated the effect of the budget cuts and reallocation for California county health departments (excluding Los Angeles and San Francisco) on the number of individuals living with or at-risk for HIV who received HIV prevention services. We used a Bernoulli model to estimate the number of new infections that would occur each year {{as a result of the}} changes, and assigned lifetime treatment costs to those new infections. We explored the effect of redirecting federal funds to more cost-effective programs, as well as the potential effect of allocating funds proportionately by transmission category. We estimated that cutting HIV prevention resulted in 55 new infections that were associated with $ 20 million in lifetime treatment costs. The redirection of federal funds to more cost-effective programs averted 15 HIV infections. If HIV prevention funding were allocated proportionately to transmission categories, we estimated that HIV infections could be reduced below the number that occurred annually before the state budget cuts.

40|$|Background: Companies {{have often}} relinquished {{the control of}} {{important}} business functions to outside suppliers {{for the sake of}} <b>short-term</b> <b>savings</b> and {{because of the lack of}} use of proper decision-making methods within the business. Objectives: This article identified three methods of decision-making and applied it to a logistics outsourcing problem. The logistics outsourcing problem consisted of a make-or-buy decision as well as a supplier selection process. The purpose of the study was to determine the most suitable method in the case of logistics outsourcing. Method: The decision-making methods were applied to a South African case study within the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. The logistics functions considered in the case study included secondary distribution and warehousing of finished goods. Each method considered the same evaluation criteria and the results were analysed and compared. Results: Each method produced different results to the logistics outsourcing problem. The method developed by Platts, Probert and Canez (2000) suggested that the logistics functions be insourced. The decision tree method suggested outsourcing both functions, with a unit rate cost model. The results from the linear programming (LP) method indicated that the secondary distribution function should be insourced and the warehousing function outsourced, with a fixed and variable cost model pending further analysis of the demand trends. Conclusion: The study provides empirical evidence that proven outsourcing decision-making methods, such as the method developed by Platts et al. (2000), the LP method and the decision tree method traditionally applied to a manufacturing outsourcing decision problem, can be adapted and applied to a logistics outsourcing decision problem of a South African FMCG company. </div...|$|E

To find out, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, Office of Financial Empowerment (OFE) developed the SaveUSA program, a tax-time matched savings program, which is being replicated in additional sites by the New York City Center for Economic Opportunity (CEO) and OFE. SaveUSA focuses on tax-time savings because tax refunds, supported by the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and other credits, typically constitute the largest source of cash that low- and moderate-income individuals receive at any one time. SaveUSA encourages eligible tax filers to deposit a portion of their tax refund directly into a matched savings account that they can later use to pay for unexpected or emergency expenses or for any other purpose. Does this strategy work? To find out, MDRC is conducting a randomized control trial to test the effects of SaveUSA on a variety of outcomes. The evaluation will show whether short-term incentivized savings can lead to longer-term savings habits, reduce material hardships, and improve the overall financial well-being of participants. If the results are positive, they will support ongoing efforts to implement similar savings incentives, such as a current policy proposal to embed a “Financial Security Credit ” in the federa...|$|E

40|$|Context: The cost of {{anesthetic}} {{technique has}} three main components, i. e., disposable supplies, equipments, and anesthetic drugs. Drug budgets are an easily identifiable area for <b>short-term</b> <b>savings.</b> Aim: To assess and estimate {{the amount of}} anesthetic drug wastage in the general surgical operation room. Also, to analyze the financial implications to the hospital due to drug wastage and suggest appropriate steps to prevent or minimize this wastage. Settings and Design: A prospective observational study conducted in the general surgical operation room of a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: Drug wastage was considered {{as the amount of}} drug left unutilized in the syringes/vials after completion of a case and any ampoule or vial broken while loading. An estimation of the cost of wasted drug was made. Results: Maximal wastage was associated with adrenaline and lignocaine (100 % and 93. 63 %, respectively). The drugs which accounted for maximum wastage due to not being used after loading into a syringe were adrenaline (95. 24 %), succinylcholine (92. 63 %), lignocaine (92. 51 %), mephentermine (83. 80 %), and atropine (81. 82 %). The cost of wasted drugs for the study duration was 46. 57 % (Rs. 16, 044. 01) of the total cost of drugs issued/loaded (Rs. 34, 449. 44). Of this, the cost of wastage of propofol was maximum being 56. 27 % (Rs. 9028. 16) of the total wastage cost, followed by rocuronium 17. 80 % (Rs. 2856), vecuronium 5. 23 % (Rs. 840), and neostigmine 4. 12 % (Rs. 661. 50). Conclusions: Drug wastage and the ensuing financial loss can be significant during the anesthetic management of surgical cases. Propofol, rocuronium, vecuronium, and neostigmine are the drugs which contribute maximally to the total wastage cost. Judicious use of these and other drugs and appropriate prudent measures as suggested can effectively decrease this cost...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: General {{practitioners}} (GPs) in the United Kingdom {{have recently}} begun to adopt the use of telephone consultation during daytime surgery {{as a means of}} managing demand, particularly requests for same-day appointments. However, it is not known whether the strategy actually reduces GP workload. AIM: To investigate how the use of telephone consultations impacts on the management of requests for same-day appointments, on resource use, indicators of clinical care, and patient perceptions of consultations. DESIGN OF STUDY: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: All patients (n = 388) seeking same-day appointments in each surgery in two urban practices (total population = 10, 420) over a four-week period. METHOD: The primary outcome measure was use of doctor time for the index telephone or face-to-face consultation. Secondary outcomes were subsequent use of investigations and of services in the two-week period following consultation, frequency of blood pressure measurement and antibiotic prescriptions, and number of problems considered at consultation. Patient perceptions were measured by the Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI) and reported willingness to use telephone consultations in the future. RESULTS: Telephone consultations took less time (8. 2 minutes versus 6. 7 minutes; diff = 1. 5, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 6 to 2. 4, P = 0. 002). Patients consulting by telephone reconsulted the GP more frequently in the two weeks that followed (0. 6 consultations versus 0. 4 consultations; diff = 0. 2, 95 % CI = 0. 0 to 0. 3, P = 0. 01). Blood pressure was measured more often in the group of patients managed face-to-face (25 / 188 [13. 3 %] versus 12 / 181 [6. 6 %]; diff = 6. 7 %, 95 % CI = 0. 6 % to 12. 7 %).
