40|$|<b>Step-and-repeat</b> UV nanoimprinting for {{large-scale}} nanostructure fabrication under atmospheric pressure was realized using high-viscosity photocurable resin {{and a simple}} nanoimprinting system. In <b>step-and-repeat</b> UV nanoimprinting under atmospheric pressure using low-viscosity resin, large-scale nanostructure fabrication is very difficult, due to bubble defects and nonuniformity of the residual layer. To minimize bubble defects and nonuniformity of the residual layer, we focused on the damping effects of photocurable resin viscosity.

30|$|Nanoimprint {{lithography}} (NIL) {{has been}} well recognised as a mechanism capable of facilitating the accurate replication of etched electron beam lithography (EBL) patterns at high speed, by transferring millions of nanofeatures in unison [1 – 8]. Nanoimprint boasts financial benefits as the set-up, maintenance and running costs involved are {{a fraction of the}} EBL equivalent. The technology can be split in two directions: wafer-scale imprints to replicate a single complex design [1, 9] and <b>step-and-repeat</b> processing whereby a smaller stamp is tiled to replicate devices and scale processing to the wafer level [10 – 12]. Despite the increase in speed for large area patterning in contrast to EBL, a commercial nanoimprint <b>step-and-repeat</b> machines may costs in the region of US$ 10 million [13, 14]. However, a commercial computer numerical control machine (CNC machine) may be purchased for less than US$ 650.

The two resists were the commercially available AMO NIL MMS 4 and a novel resist under development by Delo Industrial Adhesives presently known as DELO-KATIOBOND OM VE 110707 (referred to here after as Delo-Katiobond). Both resists were selected because they may be cured with 365 -nm wavelength radiation in an air atmosphere.

Such tool versatility is not available on conventional photolithography tools. The reason photolithography upon a <b>step-and-repeat</b> machine is interesting is primarily because a small mask may move {{the entire length of}} a 6 -in. wafer (or even further). The majority of mask aligning lithography tools do not facilitate more than around 7  mm of displacement.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{research}} {{is to build a}} compact, high performance lightstripe rangefinder using a Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) smart photosensor array. Rangefinding, the measurement of the three-dimensional profile of an object or scene, is a critical component for many robotic applications, and therefore many techniques were developed. Of these, lightstripe rangefinding {{is one of the most}} widely used and reliable techniques available. Though practical, the speed of sampling range data by the conventional light stripe technique is severely limited. A conventional light stripe rangefinder operates in a <b>step-and-repeat</b> manner. A stripe source is projected on an object, a video image is acquired, range data is extracted from the image, the stripe is stepped, and the process repeats. Range acquisition is limited by the time needed to grab the video images, increasing linearly with the desired horizontal resolution. During the acquisition of a range image, the objects in the scene being scanned must be stationary. Thus, the long scene sampling time of <b>step-and-repeat</b> rangefinders limits their application. The fast range sensor proposed is based on the modification of this basic lightstripe ranging technique in a manner described by Sato and Kida. This technique does not require a sampling of images at various stripe positions to build a range map. Rather, an entire range image is acquired in parallel while the stripe source is swept continuously across the scene. Total time to acquire the range image data is independent of the range map resolution. The target rangefinding system will acquire 1, 000 100 x 100 point range images per second with 0. 5 percent range accuracy. It will be compact and rugged enough to be mounted on the end effector of a robot arm to aid in object manipulation and assembly tasks...|$|E

40|$|A piezoworm <b>step-and-repeat</b> type {{actuator}} {{is being}} developed which uses complementary configurations for the two clamping sections.

A diode-shunted delay circuit that causes unclamping to occur more slowly than clamping can be added in series with each clamp. This increases the overall force drive capability of the actuator. The performance is also influenced by the timing of the common clamp signal relative to the extender signal as well as the signal waveform shapes.

The curing dose was determined by exposing resist for different durations and correlating it to the output power detected under the stamp. The maximum number of iterations per soft-PDMS stamp and radiation bleed was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) inspection of the imprinted nanofeatures. When the examination by SEM indicated that the texture had deviated from discrete circular nanopillars, the stamp was considered soiled and no longer effective as a stamp. Using the calibrated scale of the SEM tool, the inter-pattern distance between two consecutive overlapping imprints was measured.|$|E

After two decades of development, the convention for FEC synthesis involves coating with very high tolerances for thickness uniformity using a planetary substrate fixture and a long source-to-substrate distance. A further reduction in the operating voltage results by increasing the density of emitters through a reduction of cathode size and spacing. In addition, the objective of scaling the substrate size from small to large areas has compounded the manufacturing requirements to a point beyond that which is obtainable through modifications to the conventional FEC deposition process.

Current and future device applications for semiconducting polymers include light-emitting diodes, thin-film transistors, photovoltaic cells, chemical and biological sensors, photodetectors, lasers, and memories. The performance of conjugated polymer devices depends on two major factors: the chain conformation in polymer film and the device architecture. Highly ordered chain structure usually leads to much improved performance by enhancing interchain interaction to facilitate carrier transport. The goal {{of this research is}} to improve the performance of organic devices with the nanoimprint lithography. The work begins with the controlling of polymer chain orientation in patterned nanostructures through nanoimprint mold design and process parameter manipulation, and studying the effect of chain ordering on material properties. After that, <b>step-and-repeat</b> thermal nanoimprint technique for large-scale continuous manufacturing of conjugated polymer nanostructures is developed. The actual chain orientation of molecular groups in polymer micro- and nanostructures patterning by nanoimprint is complicated. However, this information is crucial for intelligently controlling the electrical and photophysical properties of conjugated polymers by nanoimprint. Systematic investigation of polymer chain configuration by Raman spectroscopy is carried out to understand how nanoimprint process parameters, such as mold pattern size, temperature, and polymer molecular weight, affects polymer chain configuration. The results indicate that chain orientation in nanoimprinted polymer micro- and nanostructures is highly related to the nanoimprint temperature and the dimensions of the mold structures. The ability to create nanoscale polymer micro- and nanostructures and manipulate their internal chain conformation establishes an original experimental platform that enables studying the properties of functional polymers at the micro- and nanoscale and understanding their fundamental structure-property relationships. In addition to the impact on basic research, the techniques developed in this work are important in applied research and development. Large-area conjugated polymer micro- and nanostructures can be easily fabricated by thermal <b>step-and-repeat</b> nanoimprint for organic flat-panel displays, organic circuits and organic solar panels. The ability to manipulate chain orientation through nanoimprint presents a new route to fine-tune the electrical and photophysical properties of conjugated polymers, which can lead to improved performance for all organic electronics. The techniques developed here also allow for easy incorporation of other micro- and nanoscale soft functional polymers in miniaturized devices and systems for new applications in electronics, photonics, sensors and bioengineering...|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, we {{demonstrate}} the versatile pattern generation of wafer-scale, highly uniform, well-ordered Si nanostructures with sub- 50 -nm resolution {{using a combination}} of <b>step-and-repeat</b> nanoimprint lithography and metal-catalyzed electroless etching. The long-range order and variability of nanoscale patterning offered in this approach cannot be achieved by self-organized methods of nanopatterning such as AAO templating, nanosphere lithography, and block copolymer self-assembly. Versatility in nanoimprint mould patterns allows this combinatory method to overcome the shortcomings of interference lithography and yet produce nanoscale features, previously limited to research-scale E-beam lithography or deep UV photolithography, on a wafer scale. The Si nanostructures produced in our approach show a high degree of fidelity as the user-defined SRNIL patterns, and retain non-porous top surfaces due to the substrate adherent, and chemically resistant SRNIL resin mask. This method is capable of producing high aspect ratio structures through a simple inexpensive wet etching setup. Minor lateral sidewall etching which arises from prolonged immersion in the etching solution reduces the dimensions of the Si nanostructures and should be taken into account in the design and fabrication process. Bearing these in mind, our approach could be very useful for large-scale nanostructured device production.|$|E
30|$|Most of {{the other}} studies, however, use a simpler {{approach}} for fabrication of flexible molds for the R 2 R and R 2 P NIL processes, where a replica of a master mold is used as the flexible mold for the roller imprint process. In general, the desired structures are first patterned onto a silicon or quartz substrate using conventional nanolithography techniques such as EBL and followed by the RIE process, similar to its P 2 P variant. The replication of the master mold can then be conducted using several methods. One of the common techniques involves deposition of an anti-stick layer onto the master mold, followed by a layer of metal such as nickel directly onto the master mold, where it will then be peeled off {{to be used as}} a flexible mold in the roller nanoimprint process as observed in [32, 43, 46]. In some cases such as in [30], an imprint replica of the master mold is first obtained using nanoimprint lithography (<b>step-and-repeat</b> technique) onto a resist-coated wafer, where a nickel layer is then deposited onto the imprint and peeled off to be used as the flexible mold in the imprint process published in [42].|$|E

The capability of the machine {{to work as a}} photolithography tool with several commercially available resists which are frequently utilised by microfabricators was explored. The resists examined were Microposit S 1800 G 2 series positive tone resist, Clariant AZ 4500 series positive tone resist and MicroChem Nano SU- 8 negative tone resist. As stated in the introduction, the motivation for performing photolithography with a <b>step-and-repeat</b> tool is that it reduces the area of any EBL-defined photomask and facilitates greater pattern flexibility during the lithography stage.

For photolithography, the head was brought into hard-contact (at minimum load) and the exposure dose (forward current across the UV LED and exposure duration) was varied for each tested resist to determine the optimum curing conditions. In all of the aforementioned tests, the base plate was kept at room temperature.|$|E
30|$|We {{report on}} a method of {{fabricating}} variable patterns of periodic, high aspect ratio silicon nanostructures with sub- 50 -nm resolution on a wafer scale. The approach marries <b>step-and-repeat</b> nanoimprint lithography (NIL) and metal-catalyzed electroless etching (MCEE), enabling near perfectly ordered Si nanostructure arrays of user-defined patterns to be controllably and rapidly generated on a wafer scale. Periodic features possessing circular, hexagonal, and rectangular cross-sections with lateral dimensions down to sub- 50 nm, in hexagonal or square array configurations and high array packing densities up to 5.13 [*]×[*] 107 structures/mm 2 not achievable by conventional UV photolithography are fabricated using this top-down approach. By suitably tuning the duration of catalytic etching, variable aspect ratio Si nanostructures can be formed. As the etched Si pattern depends largely on the NIL mould which is patterned by electron beam lithography (EBL), the technique {{can be used to}} form patterns not possible with self-assembly methods, nanosphere, and interference lithography for replication on a wafer scale. Good chemical resistance of the nanoimprinted mask and adhesion to the Si substrate facilitate good pattern transfer and preserve the smooth top surface morphology of the Si nanostructures as shown in TEM. This approach is suitable for generating Si nanostructures of controlled dimensions and patterns, with high aspect ratio on a wafer level suitable for semiconductor device production.|$|E
