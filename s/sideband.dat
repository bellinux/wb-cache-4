5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single <b>sideband</b> suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one <b>sideband</b> can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the <b>sideband</b> of interest and maximum rejection of the other <b>sideband</b> with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted <b>sideband</b> it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the <b>sideband</b> being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E

40|$|We have {{experimentally}} observed {{three types}} of <b>sidebands</b> in a passively mode-locked soliton fiber laser with large anomalous dispersion {{for the first time}} to our best knowledge. By appropriately adjusting the polarization state of laser cavity, the conventional peak <b>sidebands,</b> peak-dip <b>sidebands,</b> and dip <b>sidebands</b> appear in the soliton spectra, respectively. The peak-dip and dip <b>sidebands</b> exhibit distinct characteristics from the conventional peak <b>sidebands.</b> The formation mechanism of the new type <b>sidebands</b> can be attributed to the periodic power variation. This work could help to a deeper insight of the spectrum shaping mechanism of conventional solitons...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of 2005 Particle Accelerator Conference, Knoxville, Tennessee Recently, we have {{observed}} vertical betatron <b>sidebands</b> in the transverse beam spectra of positron bunches at the KEKB LER which {{are associated with}} the presence of electron clouds. [1] When the LER is operating in single-beam mode (no colliding bunches in the HER), these <b>sidebands</b> are sharply peaked. When the bunches are in collision for physics running, the <b>sidebands</b> are still present but are found to be smeared out. The bunch-by-bunch specific luminosity is lower for bunches with <b>sidebands</b> than for those without <b>sidebands.</b> In this paper, the behavior of the <b>sidebands</b> in collision and the effects on luminosity are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical <b>sideband</b> frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcast}} or {{transport channel}} for TV {{in countries that}} use NTSC or ATSC has a bandwidth of 6MHz. To conserve bandwidth, SSB would be desirable, but the video signal has significant low-frequency content (average brightness) and has rectangular synchronising pulses. The engineering compromise is vestigial-sideband transmission. In vestigial <b>sideband,</b> the full upper <b>sideband</b> of bandwidth W2 = 4.75MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 1.25MHz of the lower <b>sideband</b> is transmitted, along with a carrier. This effectively makes the system AM at low modulation frequencies and SSB at high modulation frequencies. The absence of the lower <b>sideband</b> components at high frequencies must be compensated for, and this {{is done by the}} RF and IF filters.|$|E
25|$|If we {{just look}} at the {{short-term}} spectrum of modulation, changing as it would for a human voice for instance, then we can plot the frequency content (horizontal axis) as a function of time (vertical axis) as in Fig. 3. It can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies, at any point in time there is an upper <b>sideband</b> generated according to those frequencies shifted above the carrier frequency, and the same content mirror-imaged in the lower <b>sideband</b> below the carrier frequency. At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total <b>sideband</b> power.|$|E
40|$|Broadband {{coherent}} Raman generation {{emerges as}} a successful method to produce multicolored femtosecond pulses and time-shaped laser fields. In our study, coherent Raman <b>sidebands</b> are generated in a Raman-active crystal, driven by two-color femtosecond laser pulses. An interferogram of the <b>sidebands</b> based on coherent Raman scattering is produced in a novel reflection scheme. The relative spectral phases of the <b>sidebands</b> are obtained from the interferogram using a numerical simulation.

Suppose that we limit ourselves to only those <b>sidebands</b> that have a relative amplitude of at least 0.01.

25|$|When single-sideband {{is used in}} amateur radio voice communications, it {{is common}} {{practice}} that for frequencies below 10MHz, lower <b>sideband</b> (LSB) is used and for frequencies of 10MHz and above, upper <b>sideband</b> (USB) is used. For example, on the 40 m band, voice communications often take place around 7.100MHz using LSB mode. On the 20 m band at 14.200MHz, USB mode would be used.|$|E

Temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements reveal a deviation from a Lorentzian profile with the appearance of lateral <b>sidebands.</b> We obtain an excellent agreement with calculations done in the framework of the Huang-Rhys formalism. We conclude that the only relevant parameter for the observation of acoustic phonon <b>sidebands</b> is the linewidth of the central zero-phonon line.

40|$|All {{breadboards}} for the LTP interferometer {{showed an}} extra noise term that was, until recently, not fully understood. In this report that noise term is investigated in detail. It {{turns out that}} it is caused by <b>sidebands</b> on the light. In our lab, these <b>sidebands</b> were caused by nonlinear mixing processes in the power amplifiers that drive the AOM, if electromagnetic interference at a frequency near the operating frequency (≈ 80 MHz) is picked up by the power amplifier. The disturbing nearby frequency is the frequency of the other AOM, with a difference of exactly fhet, causing multiple <b>sidebands</b> at integer multiples of fhet from the carrier. They appear as pairs with a phase relationship that corresponds to phase-modulation (PM). Experiments with a very different electrical setup (in Glasgow) also showed <b>sidebands</b> which demonstrates that they are not caused by peculiarities of the Hannover setup. While the effect of a pair of first-order PM <b>sidebands</b> cancels and causes no harm, only one of the second-order <b>sidebands</b> produces noise which cannot be cancelled by its second-order mirror image. Hence the second-order <b>sidebands</b> are the dominant noise source...|$|R

25|$|Amplitude-companded single <b>sideband</b> (ACSSB) is a {{narrowband}} modulation method using {{a single}} <b>sideband</b> with a pilot tone, allowing an expander in {{the receiver to}} restore the amplitude that was severely compressed by the transmitter.

50|$|To {{understand}} how a balanced modulator works {{it is necessary to}} understand amplitude modulation and how it works. Most people describe amplitude modulation as a method of changing the strength of the carrier (amplitude) in sync with the modulating audio. This is true, the power output does change with modulation, but it changes because any AM modulator generates two <b>sidebands,</b> one above and one below the carrier. As power goes into these <b>sidebands,</b> the power output increases. The amplitude modulated signal, then, consists of a constant strength carrier and two <b>sidebands.</b> The <b>sidebands</b> carry the information and the carrier just goes along for the ride. The carrier can be removed at the transmitter and reinserted at the receiver to allow the transmitter to put all the power in the <b>sidebands.</b>|$|R
40|$|When {{a quantum}} dot is {{suffering}} an AC gate voltage, the <b>sidebands</b> turn up beside the static {{levels of the}} dot. We formularized the conductance and current when the effective coupling between levels in the quantum dot induced by the hybrid terms is included using a bi-unitary transform method, and we investigated the interference of the photon <b>sidebands</b> of deferent levels. The interference occurs if the same <b>sidebands</b> of deferent levels overlap, which is possible only when the static levels lie close to and overlap with each other. The overlap of different photon <b>sidebands</b> leads to a simple non-coherent superposition. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|For {{the case}} of a carrier {{modulated}} by a single sine wave, the resulting frequency spectrum can be calculated using Bessel functions of the first kind, {{as a function of the}} <b>sideband</b> number and the modulation index. The carrier and <b>sideband</b> amplitudes are illustrated for different modulation indices of FM signals. For particular values of the modulation index, the carrier amplitude becomes zero and all the signal power is in the sidebands.|$|E
25|$|Another {{improvement}} over standard AM is obtained through reduction or {{suppression of the}} carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus {{there is a great}} advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one <b>sideband</b> (single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) or with both sidebands remaining (double <b>sideband</b> suppressed carrier). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower <b>sideband,</b> includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one <b>sideband</b> and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|E
25|$|Amateur radio {{operators}} use various {{modes of}} transmission to communicate.

40|$|AbstractGradients of {{absolute}} binocular disparity across a slanted surface are often considered {{the basis for}} stereoscopic slant perception. However, perceived stereo slant around a vertical axis is usually slow and significantly under-estimated for isolated surfaces. Perceived slant is enhanced when surrounding surfaces provide a relative disparity gradient or depth step {{at the edges of}} the slanted surface, and also in the presence of monocular occlusion regions (<b>sidebands).</b> Here we investigate how different kinds of depth information at surface edges enhance stereo slant about a vertical axis. In Experiment 1, perceived slant decreased with increasing surface width, suggesting that the relative disparity between the left and right edges was used to judge slant. Adding monocular <b>sidebands</b> increased perceived slant for all surface widths. In Experiment 2, observers matched the slant of surfaces that were isolated or had a context of either monocular or binocular <b>sidebands</b> in the frontal plane. Both types of <b>sidebands</b> significantly increased perceived slant, but the effect was greater with binocular <b>sidebands.</b> These results were replicated in a second paradigm in which observers matched the depth of two probe dots positioned in front of slanted surfaces (Experiment 3). A large bias occurred for the surface without <b>sidebands,</b> yet this bias was reduced when monocular <b>sidebands</b> were present, and was nearly eliminated with binocular <b>sidebands.</b> Our results provide evidence for the importance of edges in stereo slant perception, and show that depth from monocular occlusion geometry and binocular disparity may interact to resolve complex 3 D scenes...|$|R

25|$|SSB takes {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} entire original signal is encoded in either one of these sidebands. It is not necessary to broadcast the entire mixed signal, a suitable receiver can extract the entire signal from either the upper or lower <b>sideband.</b> This means that the amplifier can be used much more efficiently. A transmitter can choose to send only the upper or lower <b>sideband,</b> the portion of the signal above or below the carrier. By doing so, the amplifier only has to work effectively on one half the bandwidth, which is generally easier to arrange. More importantly, with the carrier suppressed before it reaches the amplifier, it can amplify the signal itself to higher energy, it is not wasting energy amplifying a signal, the carrier, that can (and will) be re-created by the receiver anyway.|$|E

50|$|In FMS, {{the light}} is {{modulated}} {{at a much higher}} frequency but with a lower modulation index. As a result, a pair of <b>sidebands</b> separated from the carrier by the modulation frequency appears, giving rise to a so-called FM-triplet. The signal at the modulation frequency is a sum of the beat signals of the carrier with each of the two <b>sidebands.</b> Since these two <b>sidebands</b> are fully out of phase with each other, the two beat signals cancel in the absence of absorbers. However, an alteration of any of the <b>sidebands,</b> either by absorption or dispersion, or a phase shift of the carrier, will give rise to an unbalance between the two beat signals, and therefore a net-signal.|$|R
