40|$|Ultrasonic {{diagnostic}} method of <b>screw</b> behavior during extrusion has been designed, developed, {{and carried out}} on a 63. 5 -mm single <b>screw</b> extruder, equipped with either a basic conveying <b>screw</b> or a mixing <b>screw.</b> It {{was found that the}} <b>screw</b> behavior depends on the <b>screw</b> speed and the die pressure. Whereas initially at low speed, the <b>screw</b> centered by the hydrodynamic forces rotates smoothly in the axial position, at higher <b>screw</b> speeds and high die pressures the <b>screw</b> starts vibrating. Thus, (1) the <b>screw</b> tip vibrated with the amplitude of 102 ̆ 013210 3 ̆bcm as the <b>screw</b> speed varied from 5 to 100 revolutions per minute; (2) the <b>screw</b> vibrations in the vertical and horizontal directions were asymmetrical; (3) the vibration pattern repeated itself at every two revolutions; (4) the vibrations originated in the poorly aligned engagement in the gearbox sleeve when the <b>screw</b> was pushed deeply into it by backpressure; (5) once pushed in the <b>screw</b> oscillated at any <b>screw</b> speed or die pressure.

5|$|After {{the ship}} arrived in Invergordon, Baden was {{carefully}} examined by Royal Navy technicians.

5000|$|The sliding <b>screw</b> plate (dynamic {{compression}} <b>screw,</b> dynamic hip <b>screw)</b> {{may be used}} {{to treat}} intertrochanteric fractures as well as other injuries. This device consists of a lag <b>screw</b> and a side plate with a barrel.

Among the complications of sliding <b>screw</b> plate fixation are [...] "cutting out" [...] of the nail, penetration of the <b>screw</b> into the joint, bending or breaking of the nail, and disengagement of the <b>screw</b> from the barrel and even protrusion of the <b>screw</b> into the vertebrae.|$|R

50|$|The {{three main}} {{elements}} of a typical planetary roller <b>screw</b> are the <b>screw</b> shaft, nut and planetary roller. The <b>screw,</b> a shaft with a multi-start V-shaped thread, provides a helical raceway for multiple rollers radially arrayed around the <b>screw</b> and encapsulated by a threaded nut. The thread of the <b>screw</b> is typically identical to the internal thread of the nut. The rollers spin in contact with, and serve as low-friction transmission elements between <b>screw</b> and nut. The rollers typically have a single-start thread with convex flanks that limit friction at the rollers' contacts with <b>screw</b> and nut. The rollers typically orbit the <b>screw</b> as they spin (in the manner of planet gears to sun gear), and are thus known as planetary, or satellite, rollers. As with a lead <b>screw</b> or ball <b>screw,</b> rotation of the nut results in <b>screw</b> travel, and rotation of the <b>screw</b> results in nut travel.|$|R
