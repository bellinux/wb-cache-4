40|$|The {{spectrum}} of baroclinic basin modes is investigated in a two-layer wind-driven quasigeostrophic model through weakly nonlinear multiple time-scale {{expansion in the}} Burger number. The baroclinic basin modes are mainly advected by a barotropic steady Sverdrup flow. Emphasis {{is given to the}} regularizing influence of dispersion rather than to dissipation. In the inviscid large-scale limit, that is, for basin scale considerably larger than the Rossby radius of deformation, all of the basin modes are neutral. Their typology is then numerically examined (with some necessary dissipation), and their frequency and spatial properties are discussed. Three types of modes arise for some wind forcing strong enough to produce a recirculating gyre with closed geostrophic contours: the classical Rossby basin modes deformed by the mean flow (<b>shadow</b> <b>modes),</b> stationary modes, and recirculating pool modes, the two latter being trapped in the closed-contours pool. Focus is made here on the recirculating modes that could have very low frequencies for moderate recirculating gyres. Strong gyres lead to higher frequencies, and recirculating modes resonate with deformed Rossby basin modes. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{study used}} a hybrid {{analytical}} and numerical method to analyze three-dimensional (3 D) elastic bodies with sharp-V notches. The proposed method separates the 3 D equilibrium equation into primary and shadow parts, where {{the solution of}} the primary part is the analytical solution under the generalized plane-strain theory, and the shadow part is solved numerically using a weak form based on the finite element theory. A least-squares method is then used to find the multiplication factors of these primary and <b>shadow</b> <b>modes</b> using 3 D finite element results. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed method can accurately simulate the singularities near a sharp V-notch. The major advantage of this method is that a 3 D whole displacement field with the singular effect based on the theoretical solution near the notch can be obtained for anisotropic materials under arbitrary loads...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{breadcrumb}} trail sensor networks is to transmit in real-time users' physiological parameters that measure life critical functions to an incident commander through reliable multihop communication. In applications using breadcrumb solutions, there are often many users working together, and this creates a well-known body shadowing effect (BSE). In this paper, we first measure the characteristics of body shadowing for 2. 4 GHz sensor nodes. Our empirical {{results show that the}} body shadowing effect leads to severe packet loss, and consequently very poor real-time performance. Then we develop a novel Intentional Forwarding solution. This solution accurately detects the <b>shadowing</b> <b>mode</b> and enables selected neighbors to forward data packets. Experimental results from a fully implemented testbed demonstrate that Intentional Forwarding is able to improve the end-to-end average packet delivery ratio (PDR) from 58 % to 93 % and worst-case PDR from 45 % to 85 %, and meet soft real-time requirements even under severe body shadowing problems. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} serious safety {{concerns}} in air traffic control are runway incursions. Traditional Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control Systems level 2 safety systems detect runway incursions and potential collisions.

This new safety net detects if controllers give a conflicting clearance to an aircraft or vehicle contradictory to another clearance already given to another mobile. The new safety net concept was developed in context of SESAR. It was tested in a <b>shadow</b> <b>mode</b> validation exercise at the operational environment of Hamburg Airport (Germany).

Free market reforms in private health insurance in the late 1980 s have been reversed by the new democratic government since 1994 with the re-introduction of open enrolment, community rating and minimum benefits.
