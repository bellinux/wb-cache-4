The impression the people gave him jarred altogether with his preconceptions of the struggle and confirmed the old man's faith in Ostrog. It was only slowly he could bring himself to believe that all these people were rejoicing at {{the defeat of the}} Council, that the Council which had pursued him with such power and vigour was after all the weaker of the two sides in conflict.

So I told Dingaan that whoever died you must be spared, or he would bring up the 'people of George' [i.e. the English] to avenge you, and your ghost would enter into him and pour out a curse upon him. He believed me who did not understand that already so many curses were gathered about his head that one more or less made no matter. So you see you were spared, Macumazahn, and afterwards you helped to pour out a curse upon Dingaan without becoming a ghost, which is the reason why Panda likes you so well to-day, Panda, the enemy of Dingaan, his brother.

"The {{success of}} Flow helped make Pell Mell {{one of the}} more {{intriguing}} major-label signings of the 1990s — who could have imagined Geffenbeing interested in an all-instrumental group?" [...] —Trouser Press Interstate was released by major label DGC on 25 April 1995 in the United States as their first and only album on a major label. Many have commented on the unlikeliness of the albums release on DGC; Ned Raggett wrote: [...] "the idea that Pell Mell would have ended up on a company run by David Geffen must have seemed truly bizarre when the band first started, but thats what a little Nirvana can do for bands (and so it must have seemed for many an alternative outfit in the early 90s)." [...] Similarly, in 2013, Spin ranked the album at number 13 in its list of the [...] "40 Weirdest Post-Nevermind Major Label Albums," [...] with Andrew Earles of the magazine saying: [...] "Put simply, this music never exactly presented itself as a radio-friendly unit-shifter. <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> these gentlemen end up on DGC?

5000|$|In 2003, {{producer}} Louise Berridge negotiated for Leslie Grantham to reprise {{the role}} of Sharons father Den, 14 years after his last appearance. Part of her motive for doing so was to bring Sharon, whom she described {{as one of her}} favourite characters, [...] "right back where she belonged, {{at the very heart of}} the show." [...] The character Den had supposedly been killed in 1989 and a body found the following year had been identified as his, so the programme makers needed to make certain that his return could be plausibly explained. A research team was employed to scour over past episodes of EastEnders to make certain that his return storyline would not have been going against anything that had been shown prior, or that could not have been [...] "faked". In an interview with Walford Web, Berridge discussed how her researchers discovered that there were inconsistencies in the episodes that aired during 1989 and 1990, that could account for Dens death being staged. She commented, [...] "A great deal was made in the show of Dens signet ring turning up proof that he died—but if you watch the episode of the shooting youll see he isnt even wearing it at the time of his supposed death. <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> it get in the canal?". Berridges writers concocted a story whereby the body that was recovered in 1990 was misidentified as Dens; Den fled to Spain to escape the mobsters and allowed his family to believe he was dead until he was traced in 2003.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are also}} some points of {{interest}} in the quoted text itself. There are many simple spelling alterations from the printed editions of Titus, but what is especially interesting is that some of them correspond to the first quarto text published in 1594 (Q1); some to the second quarto text, published in 1600 (Q2); some to the third, published in 1611 (Q3); and some to the First Folio text of 1623 (F1). For example, in Q1, the word [...] "Haystacks" [...] is spelt [...] "Haystalks", in Q2 it is [...] "haystakes" [...] and in Q3 and F1, [...] "haystackes". In the quoted text, the Q3/F1 spelling of [...] "haystackes" [...] is used, suggesting the text was transcribed no earlier than 1611. However, another change is [...] "But" [...] altered to [...] "Tut". This was a change introduced into the text in Q2, and maintained in Q3 and F1, and some take it as evidence that the illustration cannot be earlier than Q2 (1600). Another change is the alteration of [...] "sonne" [...] to [...] "sonnes" [...] twice during Tamora's speech (line 106 and 108), although the singular [...] "sonne" [...] is maintained later. The invented stage direction also uses the plural [...] "sonnes". Only F1 uses the plural form at line 106, in what is obviously a compositors error; but why did Peacham use it, as he must have noticed the error. Was he copying from F1, and if <b>so,</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> his other alterations have come about? If the drawing was made in 1595, how is it that some of the alterations to the text correspond exactly to later editions of the play? These questions remain unanswered.|$|E
