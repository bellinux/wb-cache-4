30|$|A {{new class}} of {{corrosion}} inhibitors, namely, polyethyleneiminemethylene phosphonic acid (PEIMPA), was synthesized and its inhibiting action on the corrosion of C 38 steel in 1  M HCl at 30  °C was investigated by various corrosion monitoring techniques such as weight loss measurements, potentiodynamic polarization, linear polarization resistance (Rp), and surface analysis (SEM and EDX) which are used to characterize the steel <b>surface.</b> <b>Weight</b> <b>loss</b> measurements revealed {{that the presence of}} PEIMPA increases the inhibition efficiency by decreasing the corrosion rate. Tafel polarization study showed that the inhibitor acts as a mixed-type inhibitor. Adsorption of PEIMPA on the carbon steel surface was found to obey the Langmuir isotherm. Some thermodynamic functions of dissolution and adsorption processes were also determined and discussed. The SEM results showed the formation of protective film on the mild steel surface in the presence of PEIMPA. The results obtained from different tested techniques were in good agreement.|$|E

The cyclic oxidation {{behavior of the}} coated beta gamma alloy was investigated between room temperature and 1000 0 C for up to 800 cycles. During cyclic oxidation testing, a TiN layer formed at the interface between NiCrAlY and TiAl 2 ̆ 0134 Nb 2 ̆ 0133 Mn and {{the thickness of the}} TiN layer increased with the number of cycles. The outward Ti diffusion also resulted in the formation of titanium oxides on the coating top surface after 630 cycles. Inward diffusion of Ni {{led to the formation of}} an inner diffusion zone containing NiAlTi and a mixture of NiAlTi + TiAl. Due to the spallation of coating scales on the circumferential <b>surface,</b> <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> was observed after 120 cycles although both the top and bottom surfaces of the specimens remain in contact with the substrate until 800 cycles. Due to inward and outward diffusion, half of the NiCrAlY coating was consumed after 800 cycles suggesting the need for diffusion barrier coating at the interface between the NiCrAlY coating and the TiAl 2 ̆ 0134 Nb 2 ̆ 0133 Mn alloy.

The <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> of specimens is above 5 percent; Water-binder ratio has decisive influence on the frost-salt resistance of concrete; concrete with suitable volume of fly ash can also increase the standard of frost-salt resistance; there is a critical air-entraining content which can improve the frost-salt resistance by the greatest extent.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} and kinetics of pickling of high-temperature oxidized {{304 stainless steel}} in HF-H 2 SO 4 electrolyte were investigated by <b>surface</b> finish, <b>weight</b> <b>loss,</b> corrosion potential, and dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. A three-stage pickling mechanism was proposed. In the first pickling stage, the low-frequency resistance is low because the chromium-depleted layer exposed is active, and thus a significant <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> takes place. Corrosion kinetics {{is related to the}} duration of the active state and the corresponding corrosion potential. Both are influenced by composition of the electrolyte. The oxide scales become undercut by the removal of the underlying metal. While the exposed alloy becomes enriched in chromium, an active-to-passive transition initiates the second stage. A dense passive layer that develops on the surface during that second stage increases the low-frequency resistance. A local attack at grain boundaries and at honeycombed recesses proceeds during the third stage while the remaining exposed area is cathodically protected.

The selected polymeric coatings were commercially supplied safety films, which are nowadays extensively applied on glass in the automotive and construction industry. One of their main failures is the degradation of their properties due to wear. In this work, the frictional behaviour of these coatings on glass were evaluated and compared to those of bare soda-lime glass. Correlations have been also made between the worn <b>surfaces</b> and <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> in order to investigate the effect of wear conditions (speed, load) on the wear behaviour of these tribosystems.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to obtain a characterization of the self-generated environment of a spacecraft and its variation with time, angular position, and distance. The density, pressure, outgassing flux, total <b>weight</b> <b>loss,</b> and other important parameters were obtained from data provided by two mass measuring crystal microbalances, mounted back to back, at distance of 1 m from the spacecraft equivalent surface. A major outgassing source existed at an angular position of 300 deg to 340 deg, near the rocket motor, while the weakest source was at the antennas. The strongest source appeared {{to be caused by}} a material diffusion process which produced a directional density at 1 m distance of about 1. 6 x 10 to the 11 th power molecules/cu cm after 1 hr in vacuum and decayed to 1. 6 x 10 to the 9 th power molecules/cu cm after 200 hr. The total average outgassing flux at the same distance and during the same time span changed from 1. 2 x 10 to the minus 7 th power to 1. 4 x to the minus 10 th power g/sq cm/s.

The corrosion degree of Mg– 7 Gd– 5 Y– 1 Nd– 0. 5 Zr alloys in Ca(NO 3) 2 salt spray was very shallow by corrosion morphology and the corrosion route was extended along the surface in texture-like shape, while the alloy in NaCl and (NH 4) 2 SO 4 salt spray were major local corrosion and there were serious corrosion pits on the <b>surface.</b> The <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> rates in (NH 4) 2 SO 4, NaCl and Ca(NO 3) 2 salt spray was respectively 0. 4147, 0. 1618 and 0. 0725  mg/(cm 2  d− 1). The results of residual mechanical properties indicated that the corrosion order in salts spray of Mg– 7 Gd– 5 Y– 1 Nd– 0. 5 Zr alloys is NH 4 SO 4  > NaCl > Ca(NO 3) 2, which {{was consistent with the}} results of potentiodynamic polarization tests.

Enzymatic degradability by cutinase {{of the three}} kinds of polyesters was studied, {{as well as their}} solid-state properties. The biodegradation behavior relied heavily on the distance between ester groups, crystallinity, and the hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity balance of polyester <b>surfaces.</b> The <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> through degradation of the three kinds of polyesters with different hydroxyl monomers took place in the order PHS > PBS > PES.

The decrease in relative intensity at 1800 – 1650 estedpolyesters were degraded simultaneously. The frequencies of the crystalline and amorphous bands were almost identical before and after degradation. Thus, enzymatic degradation did not change the crystalline structure but destroyed it, and the degree of crystallinity markedly decreased.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{analyzed}} the <b>surface</b> roughness and <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> in Plex Glass specimens caused by dentifrices, one conventional (Sorriso) and three specific for dentures. Materials and Methods: Specimens (n = 6) of Plex Glass {{were divided into}} 5 groups including: negative control (water); positive control 1 (Sorriso) and 2 (Corega Brite); Experimental 1 (containing Chloramine T, antimicrobial agent); and Experimental 2 (containing Zonyl, detergent). Brushing was performed in a toothbrushing machine (Pepsodent) with a soft brush and a suspension of toothpaste and distilled water for 300 minutes, representing 6 years of brushing. Weight was measured initially and after the trial period; roughness was measured after the trial period only. The results of roughness and <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey tests at 5 %. Results: The negative control (2. 82 +/- 4. 41 mg) showed the lowest <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> Experimental 1 (13. 62 +/- 4. 29 mg) and Experimental 2 (15. 4 +/- 5. 80 mg) were equal statistically, and Sorriso (23. 22 +/- 7. 23 mg) and Corega (28. 83 +/- 6. 34 mg) produced the greatest <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> Concerning roughness, the negative control group (0. 03 +/- 0. 01 mu m) showed the lowest value.

The unreinforced matrix, and the composites containing 2, 4 and 6 weight percent of TiO 2 particulates were prepared by liquid metallurgy route using the vortex technique. Their corrosion behaviour was evaluated by <b>weight</b> <b>loss,</b> potentiodynamic polarisation, scanning electron micrograpaph (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) methods. The studies show that corrosion current density (I Corr) and the corrosion rate were highest {{in the case of}} corrodent 0. 1 N HCl. The rate of corrosion of both the matrix alloy and the composites decreased with increase in time of exposure in acid medium, possibly due to the formation of a passive oxide layer. Corrosion current (I Corr), corrosion potential (E Corr) and pitting potential (E Pit) were obtained from potentiodynamic polarisation studies. In all the media, the I Corr values of unreinforced matrix alloy and composites were found to increase as the TiO 2 content increased from 0 % to 6 %, which could be attributed to the microgalvanic coupling between the reinforcement or conducting interfacial products and the matrix alloy. Insulator TiO 2 particulates are perceived to act as inert material and degrade the integrity of the protective oxide layer on the Al matrix alloy. The presence of reinforcement in the matrix increases cathode to anode ratio in the composites, resulting in the formation of pits during localised corrosion. Moreover, the pitting effect was more pronounced in the presence of aggressive Cl- ions compared to mild NO 3 - and SO 4 (2 -) ions.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 The Compression After Impact (CAI) {{strength}} of polymeric composites after long term elevated temperature aging is studied. Aging temperatures range from 149 ∘C to 204 ∘C (300 ∘F to 400 ∘F). Two types of matrix material are studied, a thermoset bismaleimide (5260) and a thermoplastic polyimide (K 3 B). Glass transition temperature (Tg) and fracture toughness are measured after aging. Microscopy and Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) {{are used to}} evaluate the aged composites. Out-of-plane bending of the CAI specimens during compression is measured by shadow moire. Moire interferometry is used to determine in-plane displacement and strain fields around the impact damage. Results show that the CAI strength degrades with aging for both K 3 B and 5260. The 5260 matrix suffers from thermo-oxidative degradation at higher temperatures. <b>Surface</b> decomposition causes <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> and reduces mechanical properties. The CAI {{strength of}} the K 3 B matrix composite also decreases after aging. Evidence of an oxidation reaction is found in the K 3 B polymer by SIMS, but no <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> is associated with this chemical reaction. Measured changes in fracture toughness and Tg do not correlate with CAI strength degradation. Stiffness changes due to aging are insignificant in this study. The degradation region is measured by microscopy near the surface of composites after long aging times. The depth of the degradation zone is dependent on aging time. Degradation growth is modeled with finite elements using diffusion/reaction governing equations. Finite element results agree well with the experimental data...|$|R

Examining the processes occurring within {{the individual and the}} family context, this study investigated the potential differences between <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> and <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> maintenance processes. A grounded theory approach guided the study design, transcription coding, and data analysis. The results revealed four categories (cycles and patterns, fluctuations and thresholds, defining self, and contextual connections) emerging from the research participants’ narratives describing their <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> and <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> maintenance experiences. An analytical framework, consisting of the examination of clustered categories using a multifocal lens and a toggling procedure, facilitated the development of multidimensional descriptions of the women’s experiences and guided the process of analysis. The process of analysis was isomorphic to the process the women used to formulate their narratives. The women incorporated multiple dimensions of their experiences to create narratives that described and informed their <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> and <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> maintenance efforts.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{link between}} {{dyspepsia}} symptoms and <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> is controversial. We aimed {{to determine whether}} or not <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> is a marker of dyspepsia. METHODS: Independent community-based cross-sectional studies. Subjects were randomly selected from the general population in Sydney, Australia. All subjects completed validated community health surveys. Two distinct data collections were used; the first as a training sample (N = 888) and the second as a validation sample to confirm the findings of the first (N = 2, 907). The study was focused on <b>weight</b> <b>loss,</b> which was categorized as (a) any <b>weight</b> <b>loss,</b> (b) substantive <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> (≥ 3 kg), and (c) <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> expressed as percentage of body weight. RESULTS: All dyspepsia symptoms studied were positively associated with <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> although the strength of association did vary. Nausea and vomiting were most strongly associated with <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> as were meal-related complaints such as postprandial fullness. Similarly, clusters formed based on symptoms were strongly differentiated in terms of <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> with clusters characterized by nausea, vomiting, and early satiety/postprandial fullness reporting 25 – 30 % <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> prevalence over the previous 3 months compared with around 10 % prevalence in clusters characterized by low dyspepsia symptom burden. <b>Weight</b> <b>loss</b> ≥ 3 kg followed a similar pattern but with a prevalence approximately half that of any <b>weight</b> <b>loss,</b> while <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> expressed as percentage of body weight followed the same pattern.

40|$|Blogging {{is a form}} {{of online}} {{journaling}} that has been increasingly used to document an attempt in <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> Despite the prevalence of <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> bloggers, few studies have examined this population. We examined characteristics of <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> bloggers and their blogs, including blogging habits, reasons for blogging, like and dislikes of blogging, and associations between blogging activity and <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> Participants (N = 194, 92. 3 % female, mean age = 35) were recruited from Twitter and Facebook to complete an online survey. Participants reported an average <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> of 42. 3 pounds since starting to blog about their <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> attempt. Blogging duration significantly predicted greater <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> during blogging (beta = - 3. 65, t(185) = - 2. 97, p =. 003). Findings suggest that bloggers are generally successful with their <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> attempt. Future research should explore what determines <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> success/failure in bloggers and whether individuals desiring to lose weight would benefit from blogging...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Guidelines {{recommend}} gradual <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> for {{the treatment}} of obesity, indicative of a widely held opinion that weight lost rapidly is more quickly regained. We aimed to investigate the effect of the rate of <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> on the rate of regain in obese people. METHODS: For this two phase, randomised, non-masked, dietary intervention trial in a Melbourne metropolitan hospital, we enrolled 204 participants (51 men and 153 women) aged 18 – 70 years with a BMI between 30 and 45 kg/m 2. During phase 1, we randomly assigned (1 : 1) participants with a block design (block sizes of 2, 4, and 6) to account for sex, age, and BMI, to either a 12 -week rapid <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> or a 36 -week gradual programme, both aimed at 15 % <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> We placed participants who lost 12 · 5 % or more weight during phase 1 on a weight maintenance diet for 144 weeks (phase 2). The primary outcome was mean <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> maintained at week 144 of phase 2. We investigated the primary outcome by both completers only and intention-to-treat analyses. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN 12611000190909. FINDINGS: 200 participants were randomly assigned to the gradual <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> (n= 103) or rapid <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> (n= 97) programme between Aug 8, 2008, and March 9, 2010. After phase 1, 51 (50 %) participants in the gradual <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> group and 76 (81 %) in the rapid <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> group achieved 12 · 5 % or more <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> in the allocated time and started phase 2. At the end of phase 2, both gradual <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> and rapid <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> participants who completed the study (n= 43 in gradual <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> and n= 61 in rapid <b>weight</b> <b>loss)</b> had regained most of their lost <b>weight</b> (gradual <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> 71 · 2 % regain, 95 % CI 58 · 1 – 84 · 3 vs rapid <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> 70 · 5 %, 57 · 8 – 83 · 2). Intention-to-treat analysis showed similar results (gradual <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> 76 · 3 % regain, 95 % CI 65 · 2 – 87 · 4 vs rapid <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> 76 · 3 %, 65 · 8 – 86 · 8). In phase 1, one participant in the rapid <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> group developed cholecystitis, requiring cholecystectomy. In phase 2, two participants in the rapid <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> group developed cancer. INTERPRETATION: The rate of <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> does not affect the proportion of weight regained within 144 weeks. These findings are not consistent with present dietary guidelines which recommend gradual over rapid <b>weight</b> <b>loss,</b> {{based on the belief that}} rapid <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> is more quickly regained.

40|$|This paper reviews {{previous}} research that used ICT intervention for <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> management to overcome obesity. The {{aim of this}} review is to identify ways that ICT contribute towards effective <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> management and the opportunities that ICT can provide towards successful <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> This paper not only includes review of journal papers but also review of various available online <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> management systems. Main finding from this review is, ICT's usage for <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> management can be classified into: Diet Plan and Guideline, Online Community and Mobile Applications. In addition to this, ICT namely the Internet and mobile applications offer vast opportunities towards effective <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> through self-monitoring which is a key success factor for <b>weight</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|R
40|$|P>Lifestyle {{interventions}} {{can reduce}} body weight, but weight regain is common and may particularly occur with higher initial <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> If so, one may argue whether the 10 % <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> in clinical guidelines is preferable above a lower <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> This systematic review explores {{the relation between}} <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> during an intervention and weight maintenance after at least 1 year of unsupervised follow-up. Twenty-two interventions (during at least 1 month) in healthy overweight Caucasians were selected and the mean percentages of <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> and maintenance were calculated in a standardized way. In addition, within four intervention groups (n > 80) maintenance was calculated stratified by initial <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> (0 - 5 %, 5 - 10 %, > 10 %). Overall, mean percentage maintenance was 54 %. <b>Weight</b> <b>loss</b> during the intervention was not significantly associated with percentage maintenance (r = - 0. 26; P = 0. 13). Percentage maintenance also not differed significantly between interventions with a <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> of 5 - 10 % vs. > 10 %. Consequently, net <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> after follow-up differed between these categories (3. 7 vs. 7. 0 %, respectively; P < 0. 01). The analyses within the four interventions confirmed these findings. In conclusion, percentage maintenance does not clearly depend on initial <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> From this perspective, 10 % or more <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> can indeed be encouraged and favoured above lower <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> goals...|$|R
