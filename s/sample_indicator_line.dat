40|$|Growing soybean cultivars {{that are}} {{resistant}} to the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is {{an effective way to}} preserve soybean yield and limit increases in population densities of the nematode. The ability of SCN populations to reproduce on germplasm lines that are used in soybean breeding programs to develop SCN-resistant cultivars was measured and classified originally by the race test (Golden et al. 1970; Riggs and Schmitt 1988) and more recently by the HG type test (Niblack et al. 2002). The “HG” represents the first letters in the genus and species names of SCN, Heterodera glycines. Seven different soybean germplasm lines or cultivars that have been registered in a scientific journal currently are the <b>indicator</b> <b>lines</b> in the HG type test. The <b>indicator</b> <b>lines</b> are assigned index numbers 1 through 7, and the ability of an SCN population to reproduce on each of the HG type <b>indicator</b> <b>lines</b> is determined by calculating a female index. The female index is the average number of SCN females produced on the HG type <b>indicator</b> <b>line</b> relative to the number produced on a standard, susceptible soybean cultivar in a 30 -daylong HG type test conducted in a greenhouse (Niblack et al. 2002) ...|$|R

The curves are measured downstream from the position of an injector, which labels uniformly the streamlines of a steady, laminar power law fluid flow. The system impulse response function is shown to be the weighted sum of a Dirac delta function and a completely monotonic function. A numerical example employing data from a physical experiment involving a vertically orientated, perfused glass tube is presented, illustrating the characterization of the impulse response function between cross-sectionally sampled upstream and downstream measurement sites...|$|R

Thus the global optimal coordination needs comprehensive consideration of all indicators. The indicators of peak current (I_r,rise and I_r,off) show {{that the combination of}} premature switching-off schemes and small crowbar resistance values are not practical due to the high inrush current. The indicator of the DC-link voltage (U_dc,max) puts both upper and lower limits on resistance values, and indicates that dangerous high voltage can be caused by premature switching off schemes, and the indicator for reactive consumption (Q_csm) supports the combination of the switch off crowbar before recovery and high resistance values. The differences of optimal combinations for each indicator are listed in Table  1.|$|R

However, challenges exist regarding employee workload and turnaround times in the histopathology laboratory. This paper proposes a decomposed planning and scheduling method for the histopathology laboratory using (mixed) integer linear programming ((M) ILP) to improve the spread of workload and reduce the diagnostic turnaround times. First, the batching problem is considered, in which batch completion times are equally divided over the day to spread the workload. This reduces the peaks of physical work available in the laboratory. Thereafter, the remaining processes are scheduled to minimize the tardiness of orders. Preliminary results show that using this decomposition method, the peaks in histopathology workload in UMC Utrecht, a large university medical center in the Netherlands, are potentially reduced with up to 50 % by better spreading the workload over the day. Furthermore, turnaround times are potentially reduced with up to 20 % compared to current practices...|$|R
