5|$|His {{rigorous}} {{mathematical analysis}} {{of the structure of}} <b>self-replication</b> (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. Beginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} life on Earth is not well understood, but it {{is known to have}} {{occurred}} at least 3.5billion years ago, during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present. These life forms possessed the basic traits of <b>self-replication</b> and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.|$|E
25|$|Space {{manufacturing}} {{could enable}} <b>self-replication.</b> Some think it {{the ultimate goal}} because it allows an exponential increase in colonies, while eliminating costs to and dependence on Earth. It {{could be argued that}} the establishment of such a colony would be Earth's first act of <b>self-replication.</b> Intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from Earth (science, engineering, entertainment) and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects, such as integrated circuits, medicines, genetic material and tools.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle {{published}} {{the first comprehensive}} review {{of the field of}} <b>self-replication,</b> in their book , which includes 3000+ literature references.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{complexity}} {{could have}} been reached from at least three possible starting points: <b>self-replication,</b> an organism's ability to produce offspring {{that are similar to}} itself; metabolism, its ability to feed and repair itself; and external cell membranes, which allow food to enter and waste products to leave, but exclude unwanted substances.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle {{published}} {{the first comprehensive}} review {{of the field of}} <b>self-replication</b> (from which much of the material in this article is derived, with permission of the authors), in their book Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines, which includes 3000+ literature references. This book included a new molecular assembler design, a primer on the mathematics of replication, and the first comprehensive analysis of the entire replicator design space.|$|E
25|$|As {{amino acids}} {{gradually}} {{appeared in the}} RNA world under prebiotic conditions, their interactions with catalytic RNA would increase both the range and efficiency of function of catalytic RNA molecules. Thus, the driving force {{for the evolution of}} the ribosome from an ancient self-replicating machine into its current form as a translational machine may have been the selective pressure to incorporate proteins into the ribosomeâ€™s self-replicating mechanisms, so as to increase its capacity for <b>self-replication.</b>|$|E
25|$|Given a lambda {{term with}} first {{argument}} representing recursive call (e.g. G here), the fixed-point combinator FIX will return a self-replicating lambda expression representing the recursive function (here, F). The function {{does not need}} to be explicitly passed to itself at any point, for the <b>self-replication</b> is arranged in advance, when it is created, to be done each time it is called. Thus the original lambda expression (FIX G) is re-created inside itself, at call-point, achieving self-reference.|$|E
25|$|While {{features}} of self-organization and <b>self-replication</b> are often considered {{the hallmark of}} living systems, there are many instances of abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper conditions. Stan Palasek suggested based on a theoretical model that self-assembly of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules can occur spontaneously due to physical factors in hydrothermal vents. Virus self-assembly within host cells has implications {{for the study of}} the origin of life, as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of multicellularity was a pivotal {{point in the}} evolution of life on Earth. Shortly after multicellularity arose, there was an immense increase in the diversity of living organisms {{at the beginning of the}} Cambrian Era, called the Cambrian Explosion. Multicellularity is believed to have evolved multiple times on Earth because it was a beneficial life strategy for organisms. For multicellularity to occur, cells need to be capable of <b>self-replication,</b> cell-cell adhesion and cell-cell communication. There also must have been available oxygen and selective pressures in the environment.|$|E
25|$|The von Neumann {{model of}} <b>self-replication</b> envisages {{that the mother}} {{automaton}} should construct all portions of daughter automatons, without exception and prior to the initiation of such daughters. Partial construction alters the construction relationship between mother and daughter automatons, such that the mother constructs but {{a portion of the}} daughter, and upon initiating this portion of the daughter, thereafter retracts from imparting further influence upon the daughter. Instead, the daughter automaton is left to complete its own development. This is to say, means exist by which automatons may develop via the mechanism of a zygote.|$|E
25|$|The {{ribosome}} {{may have}} first originated in an RNA world, appearing as a self-replicating complex that only later evolved {{the ability to}} synthesize proteins when amino acids began to appear. Studies suggest that ancient ribosomes constructed solely of rRNA could have developed the ability to synthesize peptide bonds. In addition, evidence strongly points to ancient ribosomes as self-replicating complexes, where the rRNA in the ribosomes had informational, structural, and catalytic purposes because it could have coded for tRNAs and proteins needed for ribosomal <b>self-replication.</b> Hypothetical cellular organisms with self-replicating RNA but without DNA are called ribocytes (or ribocells).|$|E
25|$|The hypercycle is a {{cycle of}} connected, {{self-replicating}} macromolecules. In the hypercycle, all molecules are linked such that each of them catalyses the creation of its successor, with the last molecule catalysing the first one. In such a manner, the cycle reinforces itself. Furthermore, each molecule is additionally a subject for <b>self-replication.</b> The resultant system is {{a new level of}} self-organization that incorporates both cooperation and selfishness. The coexistence of many genetically non-identical molecules makes it possible to maintain a high genetic diversity of the population. This can be a solution to the error threshold problem, which states that, in a system without ideal replication, an excess of mutation events would destroy the ability to carry information and prevent the creation of larger and fitter macromolecules. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} hypercycles could originate naturally and that incorporating new molecules can extend them. Hypercycles are also subject to evolution and, as such, can undergo a selection process. As a result, not only does the system gain information, but its information content can be improved. From an evolutionary point of view, the hypercycle is an intermediate state of self-organization, but not the final solution.|$|E
25|$|It was {{suggested}} that the problem with building and maintaining larger, more complex, and more accurately replicated molecules can be circumvented if several information carriers, each of them storing {{a small piece of}} information, are connected such that they only control their own concentration. Studies of the mathematical model describing replicating molecules revealed that to observe a cooperative behaviour among self-replicating molecules, they have to be connected by a positive feedback loop of catalytic actions. This kind of closed network consisting of self-replicating entities connected by a catalytic positive-feedback loop was named an elementary hypercycle. Such a concept, apart from an increased information capacity, has another advantage. Linking <b>self-replication</b> with mutual catalysis can produce nonlinear growth of the system. This, first, makes the system resistant to so-called parasitic branches. Parasitic branches are species coupled to a cycle that do not provide any advantage to the reproduction of a cycle, which, in turn, makes them useless and decreases the selective value of the system. Secondly, it reinforces the self-organization of molecules into the hypercycle, allowing the system to evolve without losing information, which solves the error threshold problem.|$|E
25|$|Factors {{supporting}} {{an important}} role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store information and to catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression of and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least {{the components of the}} RNA molecule under the conditions that approximated the early Earth. Relatively short RNA molecules have been synthesized, capable of replication. Such replicase RNA, which functions as both code and catalyst provides its own template upon which copying can occur. Jack W. Szostak has shown that certain catalytic RNAs can join smaller RNA sequences together, creating the potential for <b>self-replication.</b> If these conditions were present, Darwinian natural selection would favour the proliferation of such autocatalytic sets, to which further functionalities could be added. Such autocatalytic systems of RNA capable of self-sustained replication have been identified. The RNA replication systems, which include two ribozymes that catalyze each other's synthesis, showed a doubling time of the product of about one hour, and were subject to natural selection under the conditions that existed in the experiment. In evolutionary competition experiments, this led to the emergence of new systems which replicated more efficiently. This was the first demonstration of evolutionary adaptation occurring in a molecular genetic system.|$|E
500|$|His {{analysis}} {{of the structure of}} <b>self-replication</b> preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. In a short list of facts about his life he submitted to the National Academy of Sciences, he stated, [...] "The part of my work I consider most essential is that on quantum mechanics, which developed in GÃ¶ttingen in 1926, and subsequently in Berlin in 1927â€“1929. Also, my work on various forms of operator theory, Berlin 1930 and Princeton 1935â€“1939; on the ergodic theorem, Princeton, 1931â€“1932." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even the {{simplest}} {{members of the}} three modern domains of life use DNA to record their [...] "recipes" [...] and a complex array of RNA and protein molecules to [...] "read" [...] these instructions and use them for growth, maintenance, and <b>self-replication.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 Zellig Harris {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{metalanguage}} {{is in the}} language," [...] suggesting that <b>self-replication</b> is part of language. In 1977 Niklaus Wirth formalized this proposition by publishing a self-replicating deterministic context-free grammar. Adding to it probabilities, Bertrand du Castel published in 2015 a self-replicating stochastic grammar and presented a mapping of that grammar to neural networks, thereby presenting {{a model for a}} self-replicating neural circuit.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{feel that}} {{molecular}} nanotechnology would have daunting risks. It conceivably could enable cheaper and more destructive conventional weapons. [...] Also, molecular nanotechnology might permit {{weapons of mass}} destruction that could self-replicate, as viruses and cancer cells do when attacking the human body. Commentators generally agree that, in the event molecular nanotechnology were developed, its <b>self-replication</b> should be permitted only under very controlled or [...] "inherently safe" [...] conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Some clays, notably montmorillonite, have {{properties}} {{that make them}} plausible accelerators {{for the emergence of}} an RNA world: they grow by <b>self-replication</b> of their crystalline pattern, are subject to an analog of natural selection (as the clay [...] "species" [...] that grows fastest in a particular environment rapidly becomes dominant), and can catalyze the formation of RNA molecules. Although this idea has not become the scientific consensus, it still has active supporters.|$|E
2500|$|Program-based {{simulations}} contain organisms with {{a complex}} DNA language, usually Turing complete. [...] This language {{is more often}} {{in the form of}} a computer program than actual biological DNA. [...] Assembly derivatives are the most common languages used. An organism [...] "lives" [...] when its code is executed, and there are usually various methods allowing <b>self-replication.</b> Mutations are generally implemented as random changes to the code. Use of cellular automata is common but not required. Another example could be an artificial intelligence and multi-agent system/program.|$|E
2500|$|The classic Millerâ€“Urey {{experiment}} and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, the basic chemical constituents of the proteins used in all living organisms, can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions intended to replicate {{those of the}} early Earth. Various external sources of energy that may have triggered these reactions have been proposed, including lightning and radiation. Other approaches ("metabolism-first" [...] hypotheses) focus on understanding how catalysis in chemical systems on the early Earth might have provided the precursor molecules necessary for <b>self-replication.</b> Complex organic molecules {{have been found in}} the Solar System and in interstellar space, and these molecules may have provided starting material for the development of life on Earth.|$|E

Production and degradation rates are expressed in numbers of molecules per time unit at unit concentration (xi = 1). Assuming that at high concentration x the term ki can be neglected, and, moreover, in the hypercycle, a template can be replicated only by itself and the previous member of the cycle, {{the equation}} can be simplified to: ...|$|E
2500|$|His 2007 book There is a God (see below) {{revisited}} the question, however, {{and questioned}} contemporary models: [...] "the latest work I have seen {{shows that the}} present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis {{to get the job}} done." [...] He added: [...] "The philosophical question that has not been answered in origin-of-life studies is this: How can a universe of mindless matter produce beings with intrinsic ends, <b>self-replication</b> capabilities, and 'coded chemistry'? Here we are not dealing with biology, but an entirely different category of problem," [...] Geneticists, Evolutionary Biologists, and Astrophysicists wholly deny the idea that any current holes in modern theories and models of abiogenesis directly point to any primordial replicative DNAs needing to be designed by specific or vague postulated [...] "powerful intelligences".|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of an}} {{automated}} spacecraft capable of constructing copies of itself was first proposed in scientific literature in 1974 by Michael A. Arbib, but the concept had appeared earlier in science fiction such as the 1967 novel Berserker by Fred Saberhagen or the 1950 novellette trilogy The Voyage of the Space Beagle by A. E. van Vogt. The first quantitative engineering analysis of a self-replicating spacecraft was published in 1980 by Robert Freitas, in which the non-replicating Project Daedalus design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for <b>self-replication.</b> The design's strategy was to use the probe to deliver a [...] "seed" [...] factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site, have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity, and then use the resulting automated industrial complex to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each.|$|E
2500|$|Norbert Wiener {{regarded}} the automatic serial {{identification of a}} black box and its subsequent reproduction as self-organization in cybernetics. The importance of phase locking or the [...] "attraction of frequencies", as he called it, is discussed in the 2nd edition of his [...] K. Eric Drexler sees <b>self-replication</b> as a key step in nano and universal assembly. By contrast, the four concurrently connected galvanometers of W.

Ashby used his state counting measure of variety to describe stable states and produced the [...] "Good Regulator" [...] theorem which requires internal models for self-organized endurance and stability (e.g. Nyquist stability criterion). Warren McCulloch proposed [...] "Redundancy of Potential Command" [...] as characteristic {{of the organization of}} the brain and human nervous system and the necessary condition for self-organization. Heinz von Foerster proposed Redundancy, R=1âˆ’H/Hmax, where H is entropy. In essence this states that unused potential communication bandwidth is a measure of self-organization.|$|E
2500|$|Stanislaw Ulam, {{while working}} at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1940s, studied the growth of crystals, using a simple lattice network as his model. At the same time, John von Neumann, Ulam's {{colleague}} at Los Alamos, {{was working on the}} problem of self-replicating systems. Von Neumann's initial design was founded upon the notion of one robot building another robot. This design is known as the kinematic model. As he developed this design, von Neumann came to realize the great difficulty of building a self-replicating robot, and of the great cost in providing the robot with a [...] "sea of parts" [...] from which to build its replicant. Neumann read a paper entitled [...] "The general and logical theory of automata" [...] at the Hixon Symposium in 1948. Ulam was the one who suggested using a discrete system for creating a reductionist model of <b>self-replication.</b> Nils Aall Barricelli performed many of the earliest explorations of these models of artificial life.|$|E
2500|$|Rise of Iron was {{released}} on September 20, 2016, for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One only, and {{marked the end of}} [...] "Year Two". It focuses on the Fallen race as they have breached the Wall that surrounds the Cosmodrome and have acquired the SIVA virus, a Golden Age nanotechnology characterized by <b>self-replication</b> and self-assembly. Lord Saladin guides players as they set out to become the new generation of the Iron Lords and wipe out SIVA. New additions include a new PvP game mode, a significant light level increase (385 at launch, 400 with hard raid), a new Patrol zone on Earth (The Plaguelands), a new social space (Iron Temple), and a new raid, [...] "Wrath of the Machine". The final update to Destiny released on March 28, 2017.

2500|$|Several models {{reject the}} <b>self-replication</b> of a [...] "naked-gene", {{postulating}} instead {{the emergence of}} a primitive metabolism providing a safe environment for the later emergence of RNA replication. The centrality of the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle) to energy production in aerobic organisms, and in drawing in carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions in biosynthesis of complex organic chemicals, suggests {{that it was one of}} the first parts of the metabolism to evolve. Concordantly, geochemist Michael Russell has proposed that [...] "the purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide" [...] (as part of a [...] "metabolism-first," [...] rather than a [...] "genetics-first," [...] scenario). Physicist Jeremy England of MIT has proposed that [...] life was inevitable from general thermodynamic considerations: [...] "... when a group of atoms is driven by an external source of energy (like the sun or chemical fuel) and surrounded by a heat bath (like the ocean or atmosphere), it will often gradually restructure itself in order to dissipate increasingly more energy. This could mean that under certain conditions, matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with life." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{self-replicating}} {{machine is}} a type of autonomous robot that is capable of reproducing itself autonomously using raw materials found in the environment, thus exhibiting <b>self-replication</b> in a way analogous to that found in nature. The concept of self-replicating machines has been advanced and examined by Homer Jacobsen, Edward F. Moore, Freeman Dyson, John von Neumann and in more recent times by K. Eric Drexler in his book on nanotechnology, Engines of Creation (coining the term clanking replicator [...] for such machines) and by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle in their review Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines which provided the first comprehensive analysis of the entire replicator design space. The future development of such technology {{is an integral part of}} several plans involving the mining of moons and asteroid belts for ore and other materials, the creation of lunar factories, and even the construction of solar power satellites in space. The possibly misnamed von Neumann probe is one theoretical example of such a machine. Von Neumann also worked on what he called the universal constructor, a self-replicating machine that would operate in a cellular automata environment.|$|E
