500|$|... "Good Vibrations" [...] {{became the}} band's most popular hit {{after it was}} {{released}} on October 10, 1966. The A.V. Club Noel Murray theorized that its success helped turn around the perception of Pet Sounds; that the [...] "un-hip orchestrations and pervasive sadness baffled some longtime fans, who didn't immediately get what Wilson was trying to do." [...] In the final quarter of 1966, the Beach Boys became the strongest selling album act in the UK, ending the three-year reign of native bands such as the Beatles. Love believes that if the lyrics did not have [...] "anything to connect to people intellectually or emotionally, then {{it would have been}} a brilliant piece of music, but perhaps not gone to No 1." [...] According to songwriter-producer Jonathan King, the single drew some criticism for its elaborate production; [...] "Computerized pop, mechanized music.

I've often played Pet Sounds and cried. It's that kind of an album for me." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was quoted in the 1960s as saying, [...] "'Good Vibrations' was probably a good record but who's to know? You had to play it about 90 bloody times to even hear what they were singing about." [...] Townshend feared that the single would lead to a trend of overproduction. In a 1966 issue of Arts Magazine, Jonathan King said: [...] "With justification, comments are being passed that 'Good Vibrations' is an inhuman work of art. Computerized pop, mechanized music.
