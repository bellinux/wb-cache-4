50|$|Chemical Waste Management, Inc had {{an on-site}} well-check system {{designed}} to test for any hazardous material leakage. It had a two part <b>system</b> <b>check,</b> although the EPA at the time had raised this requirement to three checks. Chemical Waste Management was in an interim stage where it had not installed the third check yet, but had not reached the required date of installment yet.

40|$|The Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the inner <b>checking</b> <b>systems</b> within {{educational}} institutions, particularly the leisure time centres. The goal was to map and analyze the use of <b>checking</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>checked</b> areas, check frequency, the people who provide checks, the way checks are carried out, whether a report is taken about the check and if the results are, used for further work. Theoretical part is based on specialised literature and other available resources. The research part is based on set questionnaire research and its follow up analysis. The goal is to map the inner <b>checking</b> <b>system</b> in an educational institution and designing the inner <b>checking</b> <b>system</b> of the individual parts. The Bachelor thesis brings summary from the area of checking. It draws the attention {{to the importance of}} inner and outer checking. At the same time it points out that the outer checking is becoming {{an important part of the}} checking activity of an organisation. Regrettably many checks are more vindicatory than methodical...|$|R
