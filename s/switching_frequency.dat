40|$|Abstract- Three phase {{rectifiers}} with <b>switching</b> <b>frequencies</b> of 500 kHz or more require {{high speed}} current controllers. At such high <b>switching</b> <b>frequencies</b> analog controllers {{as well as}} high speed DSP-systems have limited performance. In this paper, two high speed current controller implementations using two different FPGAs- one for <b>switching</b> <b>frequencies</b> up to 1 MHz and one for <b>switching</b> <b>frequencies</b> beyond 1 MHz- are presented to overcome this performance limitation. Starting with the digital system design all the blocks of the signal chain, containing A/D interface, digital controller implementation using HW-multipliers and implementation of a novel high speed, high resolution PWM are discussed and compared. Final measurements verify {{the performance of the}} controllers. I...|$|R

The balancing of the FC voltages, {{a challenge in}} applications with small capacitors and low <b>switching</b> <b>frequencies,</b> is done without any modulation, simply using tables calculated offline. These allow the realization of fast-dynamics output currents with reduced dv/dt in the output voltages and reduced <b>switching</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Moreover, no interharmonics are created when operating at low <b>switching</b> <b>frequencies</b> and with reference currents containing multiple harmonic components, which is a key feature for active power filters. Simulations and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the excellent performance of the direct control strategy in comparison with a conventional pulsewidth-modulation control technique, mostly for operation at low <b>switching</b> <b>frequencies...</b>|$|R

Research suggests that intrinsic switching time of a QCA cell is at best in the order of terahertz.

50|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{high-power}} semiconductors such as the {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT), it is now possible to build a switched-mode power supply capable of coping with the high loads of arc welding. These designs are known as inverter welding units. They generally first rectify the utility AC power to DC; then they switch (invert) the DC power into a stepdown transformer to produce the desired welding voltage or current. The <b>switching</b> <b>frequency</b> is typically 10 kHz or higher. Although the high <b>switching</b> <b>frequency</b> requires sophisticated components and circuits, it drastically reduces the bulk of the step down transformer, as the mass of magnetic components (transformers and inductors) that is required for achieving a given power level goes down rapidly as the operating (<b>switching)</b> <b>frequency</b> is increased. The inverter circuitry can also provide features such as power control and overload protection. The high frequency inverter-based welding machines are typically more efficient and provide better control of variable functional parameters than non-inverter welding machines.|$|E

It is shown that the transfer function of uniformly sampled modulators is a bessel function associated with the inherent sampling process. Naturally sampled modulators have a flat transfer function, but multiple switchings per switch cycle will occur unless the input is slew-rate limited. Lower sideband harmonics of the effective carrier frequency and, in uniform converters, harmonics of the input signal also limit the useful bandwidth.
