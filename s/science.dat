5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as <b>science,</b> how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of <b>science</b> is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape <b>science.</b> Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of <b>science,</b> sociologists of <b>science,</b> and others explore how social values affect <b>science.</b>|$|E

5|$|Malawi’s first <b>science</b> and {{technology}} policy dates from 1991 and was revised in 2002. The National <b>Science</b> and Technology Policy of 2002 envisaged {{the establishment of}} a National Commission for <b>Science</b> and Technology to advise the government and other stakeholders on <b>science</b> {{and technology}}-led development. Although the <b>Science</b> and Technology Act of 2003 made provision for the creation of this commission, it only became operational in 2011, with a secretariat resulting from the merger of the Department of <b>Science</b> and Technology and the National Research Council. The <b>Science</b> and Technology Act of 2003 also established a <b>Science</b> and Technology Fund to finance research and studies through government grants and loans but, as of 2014, this was not yet operational. The Secretariat of the National Commission for <b>Science</b> and Technology has reviewed the Strategic Plan for <b>Science,</b> Technology and Innovation (2011–2015) but, as of early 2015, the revised policy had not yet met with Cabinet approval.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy of <b>science</b> is a {{sub-field}} {{of philosophy}} {{concerned with the}} foundations, methods, and implications of <b>science.</b> The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as <b>science,</b> the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of <b>science.</b> This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between <b>science</b> and truth.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{consensus}} among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of <b>science,</b> including whether <b>science</b> can reveal the truth about unobservable things and whether scientific reasoning can be justified at all.

5|$|Academic Decathlon was {{originally}} organized {{differently than the}} current competition. The original ten events were aesthetics (music and visual arts), conversation, essay writing, mathematics, practical arts, formal speech, physical <b>science,</b> social <b>science,</b> current events, extracurricular activities, and English literature, grammar, and reading. Over time, those events evolved into: economics, essay, fine arts, interview, language and literature, math, <b>science,</b> social sciences, speech and Super Quiz. It was not until 1998 that fine arts was split into its two constituent tests: art and music. Due to this division, the Super Quiz took the place {{of one of the}} other subjects each year. In 1998, Super Quiz replaced economics; from 1999 until 2012, it replaced either <b>science</b> or social <b>science</b> and alternated replacing the two from 2003 to 2012. Beginning with the 2013 season, the Super Quiz consisted of a relay portion only, encompassing questions from the respective year's <b>Science,</b> Language and Literature, Music, Social <b>Science,</b> Art, and Economics curriculum.|$|E
5|$|According to Kuhn, <b>science</b> is an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between <b>science</b> and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in <b>science</b> and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate <b>science</b> from other disciplines. On this account, <b>science</b> is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E
