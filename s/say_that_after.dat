25|$|Ahmadiyya Muslims {{see this}} episode as {{reminiscent}} of the prophecy of the Biblical Prophet Jonah {{to the city of}} Nineveh. They answer the critics by claiming that the original prophecy which was published in the book Jang e Muqaddas was conditional upon Atham not inclining towards 'truth' as was stated: provided he does not incline towards truth. They argue that Atham was in constant fear and backed out of his Anti-Islamic stance for the 15 months of the prophecy. Ahmadiyya Muslims <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> much jubilation was shown by the opponents of Ahmad upon Atham being alive once the time limit of the original prophecy expired, Ghulam Ahmad invited him to swear on oath that he did not entertain the least thought of the truth of Islam and the falsehood of Christianity, later offering him a promise of 4,000 rupees if he did. Atham never took an oath, which Ahmadiyya Muslims see as Atham admitting that he retracted his beliefs against Islam.|$|E

Bachué sat down at the bank of the lake and waited for her son to grow up. When he was old enough, they married and had many children, who were the Muisca. Bachué taught them to hunt, to farm, to respect the laws, and to worship the gods. Bachué was so good and loved that the Muisca referred to her as Furachoque (Good woman in Chibcha). When they became old, Bachué and her son and husband {{decided to go back to}} the deep of the lagoon.

Usha took birth as behula and married him. Manasa killed him but Behula floated on water for nine months with the dead body of her husband and finally brought back the lives of the seven sons and the lost prosperity of Chand.
