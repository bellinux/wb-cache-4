He revealed that the book was created {{in order to show}} the events of that promotional era, and while he did not envision the project as a [...] "diary", he described it as a [...] "picture book of everything that happens when you're building [...] like this, <b>so</b> <b>things</b> people had not seen of her."

500|$|Guitar Hero {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon release. It received {{a score of}} 91.96% on GameRankings and 91/100 on Metacritic. IGN praised the [...] "fantastic soundtrack" [...] and [...] "great peripheral", further commenting that mini-Gibson SG controller [...] "is what makes Guitar Hero, rather than what breaks it". GameSpot echoed these sentiments, stating Guitar Hero had a [...] "great guitar controller" [...] and [...] "killer soundtrack" [...] and was possibly the [...] "best rhythm game ever made". Many reviews praised the game's gradual learning curve and difficulty approach through the song tier progression and the difficulty setting for each song. Play said the game [...] "gives bedroom air guitarists {{a chance to live}} out their rock 'n' roll fantasies". GameSpys review commented on the length of the songs, in that [...] "once you hit the three minute mark or <b>so,</b> <b>things</b> start to feel 'too long'". Eurogamer said, [...] "the lack of international star quality about the roster of songs and the absence of the original artists is perhaps the only thing that may detract from the package from an importer's perspective" [...] and [...] "it would have been truly amazing with a better track list".|$|E
2500|$|Mike Langberg of Knight Ridder {{was less}} positive, writing {{in his review}} that [...] "At first glance, the CD-ROM {{provides}} a lot of raw material. There are 350 brief animations, running two or three seconds each, showing 17 characters from the show in numerous poses. The CD-ROM delivery, unfortunately, falls flat." [...] He explained that [...] "Simpsons Cartoon Studio is awkward to operate and limited in what it can accomplish, producing animated sequences that are jerky and out of sync. The CD-ROM comes with 15 cartoons created by the developers, running from 10 seconds to 55 seconds. None flow smoothly or tell funny stories. There's no reason to expect {{the rest of us}} will do any better." [...] Similarly, Nancy Malitz of The Detroit News wrote that [...] "you move the characters around and invent the scenarios, but in the end you might feel your creativity wasn't heavily challenged. The whole deal is essentially a cut-and-paste operation. You can't create characters of your own, and the kind of automatic synchronization of sounds with movement that you see in a simple product like Video Jam isn't available, <b>so</b> <b>things</b> look sort of choppy no matter how hard you try." ...|$|E
