30|$|The orthometric heights are {{normally}} obtained through <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling,</b> {{which is a}} very tedious and expensive process. The application of GNSS for height determination using a precise geoid model is desired. The current application involves warping the gravimetric geoid model to fit onto the local vertical datum. The problem with this method is that the surface realised after fitting is not an equipotential surface hence its physical applications are limited.|$|E
30|$|The Helmert orthometric heights are {{currently}} being {{used to assess the}} accuracy of local, regional and global gravimetric geoid models. For example, the difference between ellipsoidal height (obtained from GPS) and Helmert orthometric height (obtained from <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling</b> and gravity data) at a control point is compared with the gravimetric geoid undulation in the assessment of a geoid model. This comparison is affected by inherent errors in the gravimetric geoid model, ellipsoidal heights and orthometric heights.|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} of soil {{vertical}} movements, one of the techniques most commonly used is the <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling,</b> now flanked by satellite SAR interferometry and by the analysis of time series acquired through permanent GNSS stations. The reliability of control points monuments varies depending both on the geological context and on the structure being representative of the investigated phenomenon. Often due to {{the high number of}} desired points or to the need of maintaining a specific areal distribution, they are fixed on existing structures (as in the common case of <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling</b> networks). This aspect is even more evident in the case of SAR interferometric analysis, where the permanent scatterers are identified on the basis of consistency in the radar response, but the points display movements measured by structures with different foundations at different depths. Starting from repeated precision levelling measurements, we verified which is the order of magnitude of movements of control points characterized by shallow foundations in cohesive soils, observing their behaviours at different depths, under simple and very common conditions such as the presence of periods of drought or rainfall.

40|$|The {{need for}} a new {{vertical}} datum in Canada dates back to 1976 when a study group at the Geodetic Survey Division (GSD) of Natural Resources Canada investigated problems related to the existing vertical reference system (CGVD 28) and recommended a redefinition of the vertical datum. The US National Geodetic Survey and GSD cooperated {{in the development of a}} new North American Vertical Datum (NAVD 88). Although the USA adopted NAVD 88 as its datum in the early 90 s, Canada did not follow suit because unexplained discrepancies of about 1. 5 m were still present between east and west coasts. GSD continued to maintain and expand the vertical datum using the <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling</b> technique; however related cost and inherent deficiencies to this technique has forced GSD to rethink its approach for the delivery of the height reference system in Canada. Meanwhile, advances in space-based technologies and new developments in geoid modelling have emerged and now offer an alternative to <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling.</b> A new project to modernize the vertical datum is currently in progress in Canada. GSD is planning the adoption of a geoid model as the new vertical datum, which will allow users of space-based positioning technologies access to an accurate and uniform vertical datum everywhere across the Canadian landmass and surrounding oceans. Furthermore, this new vertical datum will be less sensitive to geodynamic activity, local crustal uplift and subsidence, and deterioration of benchmarks...|$|E
30|$|There are {{basically}} two different categories of height systems used in geodetic positioning. These are gravity field related (gravimetric) height system and ellipsoidal height system. The gravity field related heights {{are based on}} <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling</b> and gravity data along the levelling lines while the ellipsoidal heights are realised through satellite techniques. Gravimetric heights are obtained by dividing geopotential number by mean gravity between the geoid and the Earthâ€™s surface. The way in which mean gravity is defined therefore determines the type of gravimetric height system. Orthometric height {{is one of the}} gravimetric height systems used in mapping, engineering works, navigation and other geophysical applications.|$|E

An analysis of these data shows that the altitudevariations of bench marks in the considered triennial period seem to originate fromthe collective rotation of an inclined plane, which intersects the geoid surface withan azimuth of 43 Â° to the North. This is in accordance with the orientation of the fault pattern given by localgeology. The fact that the existing bench marks were sited along the coastline, and thelack of a comparison with data relative to motion on more compact geologicalstructures, lead necessarily to provisional conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Orthometric heights are {{normally}} derived using conventional <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling</b> techniques. Such techniques {{have always been}} one of the more laborious, timeconsuming and costly exercises in surveying. However, with the advent of GPS, ellipsoidal heights can be derived very accurately over a short period. Thus, for many applications, the GPS technique can replace the spirit level method in determining Orthometric height. This is accomplished by converting the GPS derived ellipsoidal height into Orthometric height. This paper describes three method that can be employed for such conversion process. They comprise of a local geoid surface fitting solution, a local gravimetric solution and a global geoid solution. A test network located in the north-east of England was used in this study...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{describes}} the procedure of vertical datum establishment and related practical challenges. From the practical challenges, the usual straightforward {{relationship between the}} vertical datum (obtained through <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling)</b> and the reference ellipsoid (obtained through GPS levelling) is modified by adding another variable called an offset (distance between the geoid and a local vertical datum). It then compares two methods (planar fitting and offsets) for orthometric height recovery from a regionally defined gravimetric geoid model over Japan. An improved geoid model over Japan (Odera and Fukuda 2014) and rigorous orthometric heights over Japan (Odera and Fukuda 2015) {{have been used in}} this study. To avoid unnecessary repetitions of rigorous orthometric heights, they are simply referred to as orthometric heights in the subsequent sections.|$|E

Different parametric models are employed to describe the datum inconsistencies and systematic distortions inherent among the various height data sets.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{traditional}} <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling,</b> as a method for precise vertical positioning, suffers from a number of practical limitations caused by terrain roughness, harsh environmental conditions and restricted line-of-sight. In Canada, this is most evident {{when we look at the}} spatial distribution of vertical control stations, since the remote northern parts of the country are very poorly surveyed. A method that has been proven to be a useful and efficient alternative for vertical positioning in such environments is GPS-based levelling. A major advantage of GPS observations is that they are not affected (as much) by the practical limitations of <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling.</b> The achievable accuracy of this method, however, is still under question mainly because of datum inconsistencies and systematic errors inherent in the data. In this paper, a number of investigations are conducted to estimate the achievable accuracy of orthometric height determination in the northwestern parts of Canada, using GPS and geoid information in conjunction with various auxiliary parametric models (corrector surfaces) for describing datum offsets and systematic distortions. Specifically, the covariance (CV) matrix of the estimated parameters in the corrector surface model, and the combined relative accuracy of GPS and geoid data, are used to infer the accuracy of the orthometric height differences of newly established baselines in remote northern parts of Canada. A large test network consisting of the GPS benchmarks in western Canada is used for the computation of the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters in the corrector surface models, through a combined least-squares adjustment of GPS, levelling and geoid data. The results provide valuable insight into the role of the accuracy for the parameters in the corrector surface model for precise vertical positioning via GPS/geoid levelling. ...|$|E
