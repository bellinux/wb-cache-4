Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, {{the area around the}} bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton & Watts (later Royal Doulton) stoneware factory at Vauxhall, and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class tenements to house the factory's workers. Meanwhile, the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. Consequently, toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the dividends paid to investors were low.|$|E

The flow is mildly heated so that temperature {{serves as a}} passive scalar. For three different grids, the dissipation rates and spectra of velocity and temperature fluctuations are obtained from simultaneous hot-wire and cold-wire measurements.

The scale borrows heavily from the Torino Scale, which is used to categorize the hazard of impact of near-earth objects (NEOs).
