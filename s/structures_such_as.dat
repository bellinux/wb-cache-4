5|$|A few {{jumping spider}} species, {{including}} M. inclemens, {{have been able}} to establish themselves in man-made structures. Most often these spiders are found on outbuildings or <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> fences, rather than in permanently inhabited houses.|$|E
5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the optic nerve and {{the contents of}} the cavernous sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood supply to the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply.|$|E
5000|$|In biology, a lumen ( [...] ; plural lumina) is {{the inside}} {{space of a}} tubular <b>structure,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> an artery or intestine.

50|$|DNA {{replication}} {{begins at}} sites called origins of replication. In organisms with small genomes and simple chromosome <b>structure,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> bacteria, {{there may be}} only a few origins of replication on each chromosome. Organisms with large genomes and complex chromosome <b>structure,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> humans, may have hundreds, or even thousands, of origins of replication spread across multiple chromosomes.|$|R
5|$|Ctenophores have no brain {{or central}} nervous system, but instead have a nerve net (rather like a cobweb) that forms a ring round {{the mouth and}} is densest near <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the comb rows, pharynx, tentacles (if present) and the sensory complex furthest from the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Defensive <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> spines may be {{used both}} to ward off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight back against a predator. Methods of {{fighting}} back include chemical defences, mobbing, defensive regurgitation, and suicidal altruism.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{focuses on}} forming nucleic acid systems with designed dynamic functionalities {{related to their}} overall <b>structures,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> computation and mechanical motion. There is some overlap between structural and dynamic DNA nanotechnology, as structures can be formed through annealing and then reconfigured dynamically, or {{can be made to}} form dynamically in the first place.|$|E

5|$|Flint {{and brown}} or yellow brick is used extensively, both for {{buildings}} within the conservation area and in associated <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> boundary walls and pavements. Some kerbs are of granite, limestone and flint, while some high-quality Yorkstone paving slabs survive, {{along with some}} red-brick pavements.|$|E
5|$|High-rise {{buildings}} were first {{built in the}} late nineteenth century when <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the current Commodore Maury Hotel and the Royster Building were constructed to form the initial Norfolk skyline. Past styles were revived during the early years of the 20th century. Bungalows and apartment buildings became popular for those living in the city.|$|E
5|$|In A Theory of Content and Other Essays (1990), Fodor {{takes up}} {{another of his}} central notions: the {{question}} of the reality of mental representations. Fodor needs to justify representational realism to justify the idea that the contents of mental states are expressed in symbolic <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> those of the LOT.|$|E

5|$|The Romans made durable {{concrete}} {{strong enough}} for load-bearing walls. Roman concrete contains a rubble of broken bricks and rocks set in mortar. The mortar included lime and pozzolana, a volcanic material that {{contributed significantly to}} its strength. Roman concrete <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Colosseum, completed in 80 AD, still stand.|$|E
5|$|The {{diversity}} of Runcorn's buildings increased during the Industrial Revolution. <b>Structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Bridgewater House {{were associated with}} industry, while large domestic buildings such as Halton Grange were financed by the new wealth created. The enlarged town required new civic buildings such as the Old Police Station (originally a Town Hall) and transport infrastructure such as the railway bridge and the tide dock, while {{the needs of the}} growing population were met by <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Norton Water Tower. All of the listed churches were built in the 19thcentury; architects include John Douglas, Anthony Salvin, Sir George Gilbert Scott, and Edmund Sharpe. The most recent listed structure is the Silver Jubilee Bridge, constructed in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The power {{stations}} {{were among the}} last remaining heavy industrial buildings in modern Tyneside, and their demolition was felt by many Tynesiders to have {{marked the end of}} industrial Tyneside.

5|$|There exist data {{structures}} that may improve on binary search {{in some cases}} for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. However, while these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys, such data structures are usually only faster because they exploit the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. Some <b>structures,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Judy arrays, {{use a combination of}} approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.|$|E
5|$|Transient global amnesia is a dramatic, sudden, temporary, near-total loss of {{short-term}} memory. Various causes have been hypothesized including ischemia, epilepsy, migraine and disturbance of cerebral venous blood flow, leading to ischemia of <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the hippocampus {{that are involved}} in memory.|$|E

5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of pure water is poorly understood, due {{to the ability of}} water to form <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> water clusters through hydrogen bonds.|$|E
5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of {{defensive}} <b>structures,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E
5|$|Both {{in water}} and on land, the newts are largely nocturnal. In their aquatic habitats, they hide under vegetation, and on land, they use <b>structures</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> logs, rocks, or small animal burrows for cover. They feed mainly on {{different}} invertebrates, but in the water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts. Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E
