40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{the first study}} {{on the impact of}} noise barriers on the price of adjacent houses based on a repeat <b>sale</b> <b>analysis</b> (RSA). RSA allows us to empirically examine the differential between the prices of houses sold before and after an event that may have affected their value, and after other relevant variables such as the evolution of the real estate market and major renovations performed on the house are controlled. This paper focuses on the neighborhood of Laval, a suburb of Montreal, where a large noise barrier was built in 1990 along a highway. The data set contains transaction information on 134 houses that were sold at least twice from 1980 – 2000. The empirical result will show that the noise barrier induced a decrease of 6 % in the house prices in our sample in the short run, while it had a stronger negative impact of 11 % in the long run. noise barriers; housing market; repeat <b>sale</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{the first study}} {{on the impact of}} noise barriers on the price of adjacent houses based on a repeat <b>sale</b> <b>analysis</b> (RSA), arguably the best methodology to address this question. Essentially, a repeat <b>sale</b> <b>analysis</b> examines the differential between the prices of houses sold before and after an event that may have affected their value. If there is a significant change of price between the two transactions, it may be attributed to the event. Of course, for that to be true, the researcher must have controlled for other changes that may have had an effect on the house price between two sales, like the evolution of the real estate market and major renovations done to the house. We collected our data in a neighbourhood of Laval, a suburb of Montreal, where an important noise barrier has been built in 1990 along a highway. We were able to obtain information on 134 houses that have been sold at least twice during the period 1980 – 2000. In addition, {{we were able to get}} data on the real estate market in the area during the whole period, as in most RSA, but also on the demographic composition of the area and on major renovations that were done in these houses throughout the time span. To our knowledge, this is the first time that information on major renovations was available for a RSA. We conclude that the noise barrier has induced an increase of 10 %, on average, of the price of adjacent houses in our sample. noise barriers, housing market, repeat <b>sale</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|R

There are 3 main considerations that may have influenced {{the form of the}} asset sales: 1. extent of ownership, 2. costs of sale, and 3. disruption to markets.

There appears to be a simple way to avoid high costs by staggering the sales, which would also reduce disruptions to the equity markets.

In particular, win propensity prediction, which involves quantitatively estimating the likelihood that on-going sales opportunities will be won within a specified time window, is a fundamental building block for sales management and lays the foundation for many applications such as resource optimization and <b>sales</b> gap <b>analysis.</b> With the proliferation of big data, the use of data-driven predictive models {{as a means to}} drive better sales performance is increasingly widespread, both in business-to-client (B 2 C) and business-to-business (B 2 B) markets. However, the relatively small number of B 2 B transactions (compared with the volume of B 2 C transactions), noisy data, and the fast-changing market environment pose challenges to effective predictive modeling. This paper proposes a machine learning-based unified framework for sales opportunity win propensity prediction, aimed at addressing these challenges.
