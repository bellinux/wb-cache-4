5|$|In August 1945, {{with the}} war ended, Bohr {{returned}} to Denmark, where he resumed his university education, graduating with a master's degree in 1946, with a thesis concerned with some aspects of atomic <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> problems. In early 1948, Bohr {{became a member of}} the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. While paying a visit to Columbia University, he met Isidor Isaac Rabi, who sparked in him an interest in recent discoveries related to the hyperfine structure of deuterium. This led to Bohr becoming a visiting fellow at Columbia from January 1949 to August 1950. While in the United States, Bohr married Marietta Soffer on 11 March 1950. They had three children: Vilhelm, Tomas and Margrethe.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compare {{individual}} striations, examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known bullet exemplars {{are created by}} firing the weapon into a water tank. The spent bullet can be recovered, intact, as the water slows down the bullet before it can reach the tank walls, allowing {{for it to be}} recovered. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> for the projectiles. To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E
5|$|About {{half the}} {{potential}} prey that hit orb webs escape. A web has to perform three functions: intercepting the prey (intersection), absorbing its momentum without breaking (stopping), and trapping the prey by entangling it or sticking to it (retention). No single design {{is best for}} all prey. For example: wider spacing of lines will increase the web's area and hence its ability to intercept prey, but reduce its <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> and retention; closer spacing, larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention, but {{would make it easier}} for potential prey to see and avoid the web, at least during the day. However, there are no consistent differences between orb webs built for use during the day and those built for use at night. In fact, there is no simple relationship between orb web design features and the prey they capture, as each orb-weaving species takes a wide range of prey.|$|E

25|$|The City Turbo's {{suspension}} {{was more}} refined {{than that of}} the ordinary City. The four-wheel independent system used progressive rate coil springs, with stabilizers at both the front and the rear. Tires were the 165/70HR12 radials, and <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> was provided by ventilated disc brakes at the front and semi-metallic shoes at the rear.

25|$|The next {{development}} of the bicycle, the penny-farthings, were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling. During its development from 1870 to 1878, there were various designs for brakes, most of them operating on the rear wheel. However, as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller, {{with more of the}} rider's weight over the front wheel, braking on the rear wheel became less effective. The front brake, introduced by John Kean in 1873, had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater <b>stopping</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

25|$|Later, {{during the}} early stages of the Moro Rebellion in the Philippines, the 6mm round was criticized by some Marines for failing to stop the frenzied charges of bolo-wielding Moro juramentados at very close ranges. The {{possibility}} a 6mm bullet might lack shocking power (<b>stopping</b> <b>power)</b> had been raised as far back as 1895 when the cartridge was in the process of being developed for adoption. On the other hand, the Marine Legation Guard, which used the 6mm Lee in the defense of the foreign legations in Peking during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, together with marines and navy bluejackets serving in the expedition relieving the besieged legations, apparently had no such criticisms.|$|E

500|$|Certain objects, such as {{cars and}} some buildings, are destructible. This makes {{distinguishing}} cover from concealment important, as the protection provided by {{objects such as}} wooden fences and thin walls do not completely protect players from harm.

The game makes use of a dynamic physics engine, not implemented in previous Call of Duty titles. Death animations are a combination of pre-set animations and ragdoll physics. Console versions of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare run at a consistent 60 frames per second, and the Wii version runs at 30 frames per second. Code was included to determine spawning points based on the nearby weapons and the relationship between enemy positions and line of sight to the points. The various criteria are meant to minimize players dying immediately after rejoining a match, or being [...] "spawn-killed" [...] due to players simply waiting for others to [...] "respawn". However, enemies may still respawn infinitely, a notable feature in Call of Duty game engines.|$|E
40|$|The <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> of 12 solids and 10 {{gases and}} the {{associated}} energy loss straggling have been measured at GANIL for 16 - 17 O, 40 Ar, 40 Ca, 84 - 86 Kr, 100 Mo and 129 - 132 Xe ions in the energy domain 24 to 35 MeV/u. After {{a brief description of}} the experimental method, the set of data are presented and discussed. As far as <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> are concerned, a scaling law in Z 2 relative to the 4 He <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> at the same velocity becomes applicable when the projectile tends to be fully stripped. At the same time, the solid-gas effect, observed at low energy, vanishes. The energy loss straggling is compared to that deduced from Bohr model and some of its refinements. The theoretical value appears to be too small, by a factor 2, when the projectile is fully stripped. For partially stripped ions, the charge exchange straggling might explain the experimental observation...|$|R

40|$|The <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> in silicon {{of heavy}} ions, with atomic numbers ranging from 4 to 29, have been {{determined}} using a time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF ERDA) set-up. In transmission geometry, the energy loss of heavy elastic recoils in the self-supporting silicon foil of known thickness is measured over a continuous range of recoil energies using time-of-flight (TOF) spectrometry. By essentially calibrating the Si detector {{for each channel}} over the measured energy region using the TOF spectrometer, an uncertainty of less than 4 % is achieved. The <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> are parameterized using a sixth order polynomial and compared with the limited experimental data in the literature. In the energy regimes Where experimental data exist, the present data exhibit good agreement with most data. <b>Stopping</b> <b>powers</b> predicted by SRIM (the stopping and range of ions in matter) are in reasonable agreement {{with much of the}} experimental data, and SRIM- 2003 predictions are in somewhat better agreement than SRIM- 2000.

40|$|The energy-loss straggling of {{partially}} ionized heavy ions {{is determined}} by the stochastic fluctuations of the energy loss in atomic collisions remaining in a fixed charge state, (collisional straggling) and by the influence of charge-state fluctuations (charge-exchange straggling) [1, 2].
