25|$|Activated sludge is {{a common}} suspended-growth method of {{secondary}} treatment. Activated sludge plants encompass a variety of mechanisms and processes using dissolved oxygen to promote growth of biological floc that substantially removes organic material. Biological floc is an ecosystem of living biota subsisting on nutrients from the inflowing primary clarifier effluent. These mostly carbonaceous dissolved solids undergo aeration to be broken down and either biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide or converted to additional biological floc of reproducing micro-organisms. Nitrogenous dissolved solids (amino acids, ammonia, etc.) are similarly converted to biological floc or oxidized by the floc to nitrites, nitrates, and, in some processes, to nitrogen gas through denitrification. While denitrification is encouraged in some treatment processes, denitrification often impairs the settling of the floc causing poor quality effluent in many suspended aeration plants. Overflow from the activated sludge mixing chamber is sent to a secondary clarifier where the suspended biological floc settles out while the treated water moves into tertiary treatment or disinfection. Settled floc is returned to the mixing basin to continue growing in primary effluent. Like most ecosystems, population changes among activated sludge biota can reduce treatment efficiency. Nocardia, a floating brown foam sometimes misidentified as <b>sewage</b> <b>fungus,</b> is {{the best known of}} many different fungi and protists that can overpopulate the floc and cause process upsets. Elevated concentrations of toxic wastes including pesticides, industrial metal plating waste, or extreme pH, can kill the biota of an activated sludge reactor ecosystem.|$|E

I have had my differences with the British Field Sports Society, but I have nothing but admiration for the excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for that Society... and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar survey of the Rivers Irwell and Roach. These two rivers were covered by the third report; and very sorry reading it made. There are two passages in that report which I should like to read. The first says: [...] "The banks are lined with factories, large and small, many of which take their water from the drainage of the hills forming the slopes of the river's valley, and discharge it as a polluted effluent, either into the small feeders, or the main river itself, so it may be said that no natural water normally enters the river from its cradle in the moors to its grave in the Manchester Ship Canal." [...] The second quotation is one which I find still more appalling than the first. It is: [...] "There are no fish in these rivers (apart from a very occasional tributary), no insects, no weeds, no life of any kind except <b>sewage</b> <b>fungus,</b> nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to profitable use. Sewage effluents (and, being usually very good, they are the most encouraging feature of the appalling situation) are hailed with delight as being the purest water which the rivers hold."

40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was to study the application of ultrasound reactor technology (USRT) as a disinfectant for reduction of <b>fungi</b> from <b>sewage</b> effluent. <b>Fungi</b> are carbon heterotrophs that require preformed organic compounds as carbon sources. USRT is an attractive means to improve water quality because of the system simplicity and no production of toxic by-products. An ultrasound reactor produces strong cavitation in aqueous solution causing shock waves and reactive free radicals by the violent collapse of the cavitation bubble. These effects should contribute to the physical disruption of microbial structures and inactivation of organisms. There was significant reduction in fungal growth, with decreased fungal growth with increasing USRT. In this study, ultrasound irradiation at a frequency of 42 kHz was used to expose suspensions of fungi to evaluate the disinfection efficacy of the ultrasound reactor.

40|$|Due to {{the content}} of {{pathogenic}} organisms, including <b>fungi,</b> <b>sewage</b> sludge land application poses risks to both human health and the environment. One of the ways for reducing pathogens in sludge is liming. This study aims to determine the effect of sludge liming on the composition of keratinolytic and keratino-philic fungi in model experiments. The fungi were examined using the hair baiting method and the dilu-tion method with incubation on a Wiegand medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 mg/L) and actidione (500 mg/L). The sludge liming considerably decreased the number of actidione-resistant fungi propagules and eliminated many fungal species, including Pseudallescheria boydii. The influence of this process on hair-baited fungi was that the liming eliminated keratinolytic and keratinophilic fungi at 37 oC. In the range of 23 - 33 oC, the liming considerably restricted the growth of keratinolytic fungi, including Mi-crosporum gypseum, but only slightly affected keratinophilic fungi, including Pseudallescheria boydii. The sludge liming decreases the risk posed by geophilic dermatophytes and other keratinolytic fungi, as well as by keratinophilic fungi to humans and the environment. The process affected more keratinolytic fungi than keratinophilic ones...|$|R

Coir pith is a lignocellulosic waste material obtained from coir processing factories which causes major disposal problem and thereby causes environmental hazard. Recent studies, prove coir pith waste as a source of agricultural manure. But, when coir pith is treated biologically using micro-organisms, studies reveal its significance as organic manure and shows good results in plant growth. In the present study, an attempt was made to biodegrade coir pith using suitable microbes, fungi, isolated from the municipal <b>sewage.</b> The isolated <b>fungi,</b> Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus tubingensis, were identified and using coir pith,compost were prepared from both the fungi, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus tubingensis.

Compost of various mixtures and various compositions were used as growing media and the efficiency of compost was judged. The efficiency of both the compost individually and in combination were identified at various intervals of plant growth and at various ratios of culture. Aspergillus tubingensis was identified to be more efficient in all growth media and in all the study.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} aimed at {{investigating}} {{to what extent the}} production of the microbial reserve substances polyphosphate and polyhydroxybutyrate can be enhanced and whether they can be isolated. In addition, the possibility of utilising these substances beyond their biological function in the field of environmentally friendly products and technologies is addressed. Owing to the comprehensive method development and the examination of both reserve substances, the present paper consists of three parts, namely methods of detecting the polymer compounds polyphosphate and polyhydroxybutyrate, the microbial production of polyphosphate and the microbial production of polyhydroxybutyrate. Laboratory-scale test series were performed to produce the reserve substances polyphosphate and polyhydroxybutyrate through selective enrichment of microorganisms. The methods for the isolation as well as the qualitative and quantitative detection of the reserve substances were developed and/or established. The produced polyphosphates were detected qualitatively and quantitatively by means of microscopy, fluorescence photometry and gel electrophoresis. The polyphosphates were quantified after extraction by measurement as orthophosphate. Due to a lack of uniform standards, however, the detection methods involve methodological difficulties regarding the determination of the individual chain lengths of the polyphosphates and their quantification, which is why the results should be seen with a critical eye and the detection methods require optimisation. Nevertheless, a simultaneous look at the process flow of all employed detection methods reveals consistent results, which is why the combination of the employed methods can be regarded as purposeful. The produced polyhydroxybutyrate was isolated from the cell and detected qualitatively and quantitatively. The employed detection methods included microscopy, enzyme-mediated assay and gas chromatography. The detection methods for polyhydroxybutyrate yielded satisfactory results, given the availability of suitable standard substances. The phosphate uptake and phosphate accumulation was examined {{on the basis of the}} microorganisms in sewage sludge, giving special regard to the fungus species Cunninghamella elegans. It was found that phosphate is accumulated in the cell predominantly as polyphosphate through the activity of microorganisms. At unfavourable culture conditions, such as a change in the pH value, directly or indirectly induced precipitation reactions, such as the chemical precipitation of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) occurred additionally. The carbon/nitrogen/phosphorus ratio in the employed medium was taken as a basis for the assessment of the test results. Compared to the microorganisms in the <b>sewage</b> sludge, the <b>fungus</b> species Cunninghamella elegans was found to be capable of removing from the medium and accumulating in the cell as polyphosphate the tenfold amount of phosphate. Cunninghamella elegans was able to fix a maximum of 10 % phosphate in the biomass, whereas the sewage sludge biocoenosis only fixed 3 % of phosphate at maximum. Cunninghamella elegans produced a promising biomass yield and accumulated large amounts of phosphate within a short period of time. However, the technical utilisation of polyphosphate production is impracticable due to the necessity of separating the polyphosphates from the biomass, which is not possible without hydrolysis. The microbial production and accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate was examined on the basis of the bacterial species Paracoccus denitrificans and Cupriavidus necator. Despite varying culture conditions and very high carbon consumption, it was not possible to achieve a high yield of biomass and polyhydroxybutyrate, which is why the method requires optimisation. The highest yield of 3 -hydroxybutyrate with Paracoccus denitrificans and Cupriavidus necator amounted to 50 % of the dry weight at maximum. In view of the test results achieved at laboratory scale, a transfer to industrial scale should be considered and investigated. The economical utilisation of the reserve substances requires a high cell density of microorganisms as well as a high yield. The tested microorganisms were therefore selected individually for each reserve substance. The further processing of industrial wastewater appears to be a starting point for reducing the production costs of polymers. As part of the tests, industrial process water was added to the employed media as a source of phosphate. Despite some progress in the research into reserve substances, the isolation of the produced reserve substances from microorganisms and their quantification is still difficult, since losses may occur in the course of hydrolysis. At present, the production and extraction of the microbial reserve substances polyphosphate and polyhydroxybutyrate is not yet economical and the method’s technical feasibility is limited...|$|R

40|$|Epilithon development, in {{relation}} to the discharge of domestic sewage, dairy factory and meatworks wastewaters, and its effects on water quality were studied in laboratory channels and in the Manawatu River. During the three year period of the study the organic material inputs to this river were progressively reduced to meet the requirements of water rights designed to limit the in-river BOD 5 to 5 g. m- 3 {{at the end of a}} defined mixing zone with the objective of maintaining adequate oxygen levels and controlling <b>sewage</b> <b>fungus</b> growth. Laboratory channel studies demonstrated that, for a given BOD 5 addition, untreated dairy factory wastewater increased the heterotrophic growth 2 - 3 times more than primary treated meatworks wastewater. Similar observations were made in the Manawatu River. These varied growth responses could be accounted for by the different relative contributions of dissolved and low molecular weight (< 1000 daltons) organic compounds in the different wastewaters. The dissolved or low molecular weight (determined after sample ultrafiltration) BOD 5 therefore provide more reliable general <b>sewage</b> <b>fungus</b> control parameters than BOD 5. Current velocity and spates had marked influences on the development of benthic communities. Maximum <b>sewage</b> <b>fungus</b> biomasses on the natural bed were observed at current velocities of 0. 2 to 0. 45 m. s- 1. Short heterotrophic fronds occurred at the maximum current velocity investigated of 1. 16 m. s- 1. Small spates of up to 50 to 70 m. s- 3 caused preferential sloughing of heterotrophs over epilithic phototrophs which had developed on concrete plates at river flows of approximately 25 m 3. s- 1. Flows in excess of approximately 150 m 3. s- 1 removed growths of Cladophora glomerata which had developed at sites where the pre-spate current velocity was 0. 3 to 0. 4 m. s- 1. Much higher flows, in excess of 400 m 3. s- 1, were required to remove the dense growths of the macrophyte Potamogeton crispus. Observations of <b>sewage</b> <b>fungus</b> biomass at various depths in the Manawatu River and growth rates on both upper, sunlight exposed, and lower, shaded, surfaces of concrete plates suspended in the water column indicated that solar radiation inhibition of heterotrophic growth is not important in the Manawatu River. These heterotrophic growths in the river were replaced by heavy phototroph-dominated epilithon as organic concentrations were reduced. Both communities had significant impacts on the suspended biomass and dissolved oxygen levels in the river. A computer model simulating summer low flow conditions in the Manawatu River predicted that the river can sustain average respiration rates of 20 and 24 g 02 m- 3 d- 1 at mean river temperatures of 21 °C to 12 °C respectively without breaching the statutory minimum permissable dissolved oxygen concentration of 5 g. m- 3. A multiple regression model of the factors influencing epilithon respiration was developed from in situ chamber studies of a range of epilithic community types. This gave adequate predictions when tested against measurements over reaches below the discharges and predicted that the benthic biomass resulting in the maximum permissible respiration rates decreased from approximately 143 g AFDW m- 2 at 12 °C to 34 g AFDW m- 2 at 21 °C. A management strategy limiting the organic, but not the nutrient, inputs to the Manawatu River was shown to be unlikely to ensure consistent maintenance of the statutory minimum dissolved oxygen concentration.

40|$|Investigations in {{the period}} 1966 to 1969 showed {{that the bulk of}} the waste {{discharged}} to the Blackwater and Martin is of an organic nature and arises mainly from industries processing milk, sugar-beet and other foods and to a smaller extent from domestic sewage. Pollution, indicated by increases in the biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids and depletion in dissolved oxygen, was detected below the towns of Rathmore and Mallow on the main Blackwater, Mitchelstown, on a tributary of the Blackwater, the R. Funcheon, and Rathduff on the R. Martin. Depletion of dissolved oxygen sufficiently large to constitute lethal conditions for fish and other aquatic life was recorded only at Mitchelstown and it appears that the high rates of reaeration operating in most cases prevented more widespread deoxygenation and also reduced the extent of diurnal variation. The concentrations of suspended solids recorded in polluted reaches were well below those which are directly injurious to fish but the accumulation of this material as sludge in slow flowing stretches below outfalls constitutes an extra demand on dissolved oxygen which in combination with the B. O. D. of the water may lead to lethal conditions. In the Funcheon, the presence of this material and of <b>sewage</b> <b>fungus</b> on the substratum invalidates the application of the standard theoretical method for predicting the variation of dissolved oxygen. The partial or complete elimination of the normal flora and invertebrate fauna from riffles below the main waste outfalls, and replacement of these by biocoenoses typical of slow flowing silted reaches were recorded in each area. The extent of such changes seemed to be related more to the intensity of <b>sewage</b> <b>fungus</b> growth on the substratum than directly to the chemical quality of the water. Complete elimination of fish was only recorded at Mitchelstown, the stretch affected being half a mile in length. Trout and coarse fish were present in all af the other polluted stretches investigated though in some of these young salmon were absent and trout very few in number. Trout appeared to make better growth in polluted than in unpolluted water, especially at Rathmore, and this {{is due in part to}} a greater food supply in the former reaches. Short surveys of the Blackwater estuary indicated that this reach may be slightly polluted.
