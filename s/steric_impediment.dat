The Vitis vinifera genes O-methyltransferase 1 and 2 (VvOMT 1 and VvOMT 2) have been isolated in the grapevine cultivar Carmenere. These genes encode S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) -dependent O-methyltransferases, which have the ability to methylate 3 -alkyl- 2 -hydroxypyrazines (HPs) -the putative final step in MPs production. Atomic studies were performed in order to explain the differences in these VvOMT activities through their structural/functional relationship in MPs biosynthesis. Differences in enthalpy energy observed between the proteins maybe due to changes of equivalent residues in the active sites of VvOMT 1 (F 319, L 322) and VvOMT 2 (L 319, V 322). However, docking simulations and QM/MM analyses described how residues H 272 and M 182 could explain the main functional differentiation observed between VvOMT 1 and VvOMT 2 through <b>steric</b> <b>impediment,</b> which limits the formation of the transition state in enzymes encoded by VvOMT 2.

Classical {{studies have}} {{explored}} {{the possibilities of}} transforming natural humic acids (HAs) into modified products for agronomic and industrial applications. Likewise, it has been widely reported that the colloidal character of such complex materials, {{as well as their}} functional groups and ability to form organo-mineral derivatives are important factors regarding their beneficial effect on the physico-chemical processes involved in soil fertility and crop yields. Although some empirical approaches showing the effect of the structural characteristics of the HA on soil fertility and biogeochemical processes of environmental relevance have been done, those are limited by the complex HAs composition; chaotic, dynamic macromolecular system which properties cannot be deterministically expressed in terms of their various independent units. In particular, the <b>steric</b> <b>impediments</b> in the macromolecular structure affects external exposure of functional groups. This is reflected in HA¿s colloidal properties in soil and in most cases, when using wet chemical methods, leads to meaningless laboratory determinations about reactive functional groups. In the present study the HA from a sapric peat has been subjected to an array of physical and chemical treatments (derivatization reactions or partial degradation), and to methods to selectively enhance specific functional groups or discrete structural domains, as well as to introduce different classes of N-containing groups into the HA macromolecule. A grand total of 12 new HA preparations, with severe structural modifications as regards the original HA, as well as changes into its functionality and in N content and quality were obtained. In order to monitor, at a molecular level, how the original peat HA was transformed by the various treatments, modified HAs were characterized by routine analyses, as well as by spectroscopic (FT-IR, NMR) and degradation methods (Pyrolysis-GC/MS). This research also tackles complementary issues: (i) correlating structural information with parameters of crop productivity or environmental relevance, (ii) evaluating the transformation of native HAs into materials of agronomic interest, and (iii) revisiting previous works showing that laboratory-controlled modifications may lead to materials suitable for studying processes of environmental relevance such as sorption mechanisms of agrochemicals on soil organic colloids, 1 or the resistance to degradation of humic materials. 2 The modifications introduced should produce concomitant changes {{in the nature of the}} different intramolecular interactions affecting the structural arrangement of the HA, and consequently its original properties. Therefore it is necessary to achieve experiments to understand possible environmental issues provoked by their addition to agricultural soils, and also the crop response to these applications. This was performed in two soils (neutral and calcic), where physical and chemical properties, as well as plant growth were evaluated in greenhouse experiments. Among the conclusions of this multidisciplinary research was that most of the positive effects of the modified HAs properties in the soil are correlated better with the aliphatic structures than with other classical maturity indicators based on its structural stability.

40|$|Plant {{oils and}} {{terpenes}} are ubiquitous natural renewable compounds. The double bonds contained {{in most of}} these monomers can be utilized via the photo-induced free-radical thiol–ene reaction to create novel bio-derived polymer thermosets representing a valuable ‘green’ alternative to petrochemical olefins and resulting synthetic plastic materials. Nevertheless, there are several factors limiting their applicability, the first one being the relatively slow reaction rates towards thiol–ene coupling and many times the need to modify these natural olefins to make them more reactive. The latter process necessarily introduces additional pre-synthesis steps which has implications related both to cost and synthetic routes employed thereafter, those of {{which may or may not}} follow the principles of Green Chemistry. Therefore, this thesis intends to gain primary insight about the thiol–ene mechanism, kinetics and reactivity involving these multi-substituted olefins and then use the resulting knowledge to design semi-synthetic thermosets by incorporating these natural monomers into thiol–ene networks in the most environmentally friendly way possible. Mechanistic kinetic results show that internal 1, 2 -disubstituted enes found in mono-unsaturated vegetable oils and some macrolactones undergo a fast reversible cis/trans-isomerization process in favour of trans-isomer formation coupled with the thiol–ene mechanism. The slow reactivity of these enes has been accredited not just to the isomerization itself, but predominantly to the chain-transfer hydrogen-abstraction step. This rate-limiting step, however, does not seem to compromise their use in the creation of thiol–ene networks as demonstrated by photopolymerization in the melt of a series of linear globalide/ε-caprolactone-based copolyesters differing in amount of unsaturations along the backbone crosslinked with a tri-functional thiol propionate ester monomer. The resulting thermoset films were amorphous elastomers exhibiting different thermal and mechanical properties depending on the comonomer feed ratio. D-limonene, a renewable diolefinic substrate, proved to be an important terpene in free-radical thiol–ene additions. Empirical results show that the 1, 1 -disubstituted exo-vinylidene bond is about 6. 5 times more reactive than the endocyclic 1, 1, 2 -trisubstituted 1 -methyl-cyclohexene moiety when reacting with mercapto propionate esters in organic solution conditions. Kinetic modeling results suggest that the differences in double bond reactivity are partially ascribed to <b>steric</b> <b>impediments</b> coupled with differences in electron-density controlling thiyl-radical insertion onto the two unsaturations but predominantly to differences in relative energy between the two tertiary insertion carbon-centered radical intermediates. Off-stoichiometric manipulations in the thiol–limonene mole ratio, assisted by numerical model simulations, offer a convenient method to visualize and assess the overall reaction system kinetics irrespective of time, thus being regarded as an important guiding tool for organic and polymer chemists aiming at designing thiol–ene reaction systems based on limonene. Multifunctional limonene-terminated thiol–ene macromonomer resins were synthesized in ethyl acetate solution and then reacted in different combinations with polyfunctional mercapto propionate esters to afford semi-synthetic thiol–ene networks with different thermo-viscoelastic properties depending on functionality, crosslink density, homogeneity and excess ofthiol occluded into the networks. The bulky cycloaliphatic ring structure of limonene locked between thioether linkages introduce a certain degree of rigidity to the final networks and increase the glass-transition temperature when compared tomore standard thiol–allyl systems. In all cases evaluated, high thiol–ene conversions were achieved with minimum or no side-reactions such as chain-growth homopolymerization and at reasonable reaction rates. QC 20131002 </p...|$|R
40|$|MutS, {{a member}} of the ABC ATPases superfamily, is a {{mismatch}} DNA-binding protein constituent of the DNA post-replicative mismatch repair system (MMRS). In this work, it is shown that the ATPase activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli MutS is inhibited by ortho- and decavanadate. Structural comparison of the region involved in the ATP binding of E. coli MutS with the corresponding region of other ABC ATPases inhibited by vanadate, including the myosin– orthovanadate–Mg complex, showed that they are highly similar. From these results it is proposed that the orthovanadate inhibition of MutS ATPase can take place by a similar mechanism to that described for other ATPases. Docking of decavanadate on the ATP-binding region of MutS showed that the energetically more favorable interaction of this compound would take place with the complex MutS– ADP–Mg, suggesting that the inhibitory effect could be produced by a <b>steric</b> <b>impediment</b> of the protein ATP/ADP exchange. Besides the effect observed on the ATPase activity, vanadate also affects the DNA-binding capability of the protein, and partially inhibits the oligomerization of MutS and the temperature-induced inactivation of the protein. From the results obtained, and considering that vanadate is an intracellular trace component, this compound could be considered as a new modulator of the MMRS...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSnake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) {{belonging}} to P-I class {{are able to}} hydrolyze extracellular matrix proteins and coagulation factors triggering local and systemic reactions by multiple molecular mechanisms that are not fully understood. BmooMPα-I, a P-I class SMVP from Bothrops moojeni venom, was active upon neuro- and vaso-active peptides including angiotensin I, bradykinin, neurotensin, oxytocin and substance P. Interestingly, BmooMPα-I showed a strong bias towards hydrolysis after proline residues, which is unusual for most of characterized peptidases. Moreover, the enzyme showed kininogenase activity similar to that observed in plasma and cells by kallikrein. FRET peptide assays indicated a relative promiscuity at its S 2 –S′ 2 subsites, with proline determining the scissile bond. This unusual post-proline cleaving activity was confirmed by the efficient hydrolysis of the synthetic combinatorial library MCA-GXXPXXQ-EDDnp, described as resistant for canonical peptidases, only after Pro residues. Structural analysis of the tripeptide LPL complexed with BmooMPα-I, generated by molecular dynamics simulations, assisted in defining the subsites and provided the structural basis for subsite preferences such as the restriction of basic residues at the S 2 subsite due to repulsive electrostatic effects and the <b>steric</b> <b>impediment</b> for large aliphatic or aromatic side chains at the S 1 subsite.

The current procedure for investigating macromolecules consists of examining simple molecules that exhibit properties {{similar to those of the}} larger ones, whose functionality is totally related to the atomic structure. The detailed study of the bonding structure formed by zinc and histidine amino acids is motivated by the fact that this material serves as a model for metalloproteins, such as in metalloproteinase, acting as active sites in enzymatic or structural functions. For XAS modeling, Zn-histidine complexes were dissolved in several aqueous solutions, over a wide pH range. Correlations among the degree of protonation, the <b>steric</b> <b>impediment,</b> and the multiple combinations of the histidine amino acid have been found. For the diffraction study, high-quality crystals grown by the seeding method in a supersaturated solution have been studied, and the samples for the surface diffraction study were mounted on a cell specially designed for solid-liquid or solid-gas interface analysis. The surface structural model was built from XAS results. In both cases, the obtained structures are compared with the bulk one, showing atomic differences and highlighting the importance of the environment in which the complex is studied. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

40|$|DNA in eukaryotes is {{packaged}} into nucleosomes, which present <b>steric</b> <b>impediments</b> {{to many of}} {{the factors}} and enzymes that act on DNA, including DNA repair enzymes. Within the nucleosome, DNA remains vulnerable to oxidative damage that can result from normal cellular metabolism, ionizing radiation, and various chemical agents. Oxidatively damaged DNA is repaired in a stepwise fashion via the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Other DNA repair pathways, including Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), Mismatch Repair (MMR), Homologous Recombination (HR), and Non-homologous End-Joining (NHEJ) are all thought to require nucleosome remodeling or disruption. In contrast, it was reported that the first step of BER does not require or induce nucleosome disruption. For example, the human DNA glycosylase hNTH 1 (human Endonuclease III) was discovered to excise thymine glycol lesions from nucleosomes without nucleosome disruption, and could excise optimally oriented lesions with an efficiency approaching that seen for naked DNA (Prasad, Wallace, and Pederson 2007). To determine if the properties of hNTH 1 are shared by other human DNA glycosylases, we compared hNTH 1 with NEIL 1, a human DNA glycoylase that also excises thymine glycol from DNA, with respect to their activities on nucleosome substrates. We found that the cellular concentrations and apparent kcat/KM ratios for hNTH 1 and NEIL 1 are similar. However, NEIL 1 and hNTH 1 differ in that NEIL 1 binds undamaged DNA far more avidly than hNTH 1. After adjustment for non-specific DNA binding, hNTH 1 and NEIL 1 proved to have similar intrinsic activities towards nucleosome substrates. We next wanted {{to examine the effects of}} nucleosomes on enzymes that catalyze the remaining steps in BER. We therefore assembled the entire four-step BER reaction with model, lesion-containing nucleosomes. The rates of substrate processing during the first three steps in BER, catalyzed by a DNA glycosylase, AP endonuclease, and DNA Polymerase Pol), varied with the helical orientation of the substrate relative to the underlying histone octamer. In contrast, the rate of action by DNA Ligase III- (in association with XRCC 1) was independent of lesion orientation. These results are consistent with structural studies of BER enzymes and the previously proposed DNA unwrapping model for how BER enzymes gain access to lesions in nucleosomes (Prasad, Wallace, and Pederson 2007). During these investigations, we also discovered a synergistic interaction between Pol and Ligase III- complexed with XRCC 1 that enhances the repair of lesions in nucleosomes. Together, our results support the hypothesis that DNA glycosylases have evolved to function in specific cellular environments (e. g. NEIL 1 may function exclusively during DNA replication), but also possess DNA binding motifs and mechanisms of substrate recognition that impart a similar intrinsic activity on nucleosomes. In addition to hNTH 1 and NEIL 1, we have discovered that lesion orientation is also an important factor to the activities of APE and Pol and that the complete BER reaction can occur without requiring or inducing nucleosome disruption. Finally, protein-protein interactions between XRCC 1 and Pol may be important for the efficient in vivo repair of lesions in nucleosomes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article {{reports a}} {{theoretical}} study {{to explain how}} the intrinsic property of chirality is retained throughout the radical cascade rearrangement of an enantiopure chiral enyne-allene (bearing one stereogenic center) selected as a model for this family of reactions. Calculations at the MRPT 2 / 6 - 31 G(d) //CASSCF(10, 10) / 6 - 31 G(d) level of theory were used to determine the entire reaction pathway which includes singlet state diradicals and closed-shell species. The cascade process involves three elementary steps, i. e., by chronological order: Myers–Saito cycloaromatization (M-S), intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), and recombination of the resulting biradical. The enantiospecificity of the reaction results from a double transmission of the stereochemical information, from the original center to an axis and eventually from this axis to the final center. The first two steps lead to a transient diradical intermediate which retains the chirality via the conversion of the original static chirogenic element into a dynamic one, i. e., a center into an axis. The only available routes to the final closed-shell tetracyclic product imply rotations around two σ bonds (σ(C–C) and σ(C–N), bonds β and α respectively). The theoretical calculations confirmed that the formation of the enantiomerically pure product proceeds via the nonracemizing rotation around the σ(C–C) pivot. They ruled out any rotation around the second σ(C–N) pivot. The high level of configurational memory in this rearrangement relies on the <b>steric</b> <b>impediment</b> to the rotation around the C–N bond in the chiral native conformation of the diradical intermediate produced from tandem M-S/ 1, 5 -HAT...|$|E
40|$|Adsorption of Cu and the {{cationic}} herbicide chlordimeform {{was carried}} out on two acidic soils (S- 48 and LM). Chlordimeform adsorption occurred by cationic exchange and was higher on LM soil due to its higher CEC, partly associated {{to the presence of}} vermiculite. Cu adsorption was also higher on LM soil and was related to its higher iron and manganese oxides content. The presence of the herbicide in solution always decreased Cu adsorption on S- 48 soil, but on LM soil the amount of Cu adsorbed only decreased at the highest concentrations used. This together with the lower amounts of Cu desorbed from LM soil after five successive desorptions in comparison to S- 48 soil, indicates that Cu was being mostly adsorbed on oxides which exhibit a very high affinity for the heavy metal. The maximal amount of Cu desorbed on both soils only reached up to 13 % of the amount adsorbed. Chlordimeform adsorption decreased in the presence of Cu {{as a result of its}} competition for the adsorption sites on both soils. Cu competition on LM soil was not so strong as on S- 48 soil due to the higher adsorption of the heavy metal on oxides, for which the herbicide's affinity is not so high. The lower the amounts of chlordimeform adsorbed on both soils the higher its desorption percentage. This was attributed to <b>steric</b> <b>impediment</b> of chlordimeform molecule itself for the desorption from lamellar silicates.

The parent CPI alkylation subunit lacks the C 7 methyl substituent of the CC- 1065 alkylation subunit and the C 6 methoxycarbonyl group of duocarmycin SA, and their examination permitted {{the establishment of}} the impact of these natural product substituents. The studies revealed a CPI stability comparable to the CC- 1065 alkylation subunit but which was 6 x more reactive than the (+) -duocarmycin SA alkylation subunit, and it displayed the inherent reaction regioselectivity (4 : 1) of the natural products. The single-crystal X-ray structure of (+) -N-BOC-CPI depicts a near identical stereoelectronic alignment of the cyclopropane accounting for the identical reaction regioselectivity and a slightly diminished vinylogous amide conjugation relative to (+) -N-BOC-DSA suggesting that the stability distinctions stem in part from this difference in the vinylogous amide as well as alterations in the electronic nature of the fused pyrrole. Establishment of the DNA binding properties revealed that the CPI-based agents retain the identical DNA alkylation selectivities of the natural products. More importantly, the C 6 methoxycarbonyl group of duocarmycin SA was found to increase the rate (12 - 13 x) and efficiency (10 x) of DNA alkylation despite its intrinsic lower reactivity while the CC- 1065 C 7 methyl group was found to slow the DNA alkylation rate (4 x) and lower the alkylation efficiency (ca. 4 x). The greater DNA alkylation rate and efficiency for duocarmycin SA and related analogues containing the C 6 methoxycarbonyl is proposed to be derived from the extended length that the rigid C 6 methoxycarbonyl provides and the resulting increase in the DNA binding-induced conformational change which serves to deconjugate the vinylogous amide and activate the alkylation subunit for nucleophilic attack. The diminished properties resulting from the CC- 1065 C 7 methyl group may be attributed to the <b>steric</b> <b>impediment</b> this substituent introduces to DNA minor groove binding and alkylation. Consistent with this behavior, the duocarmycin SA C 6 methoxycarbonyl group increases biological potency while the CC- 1065 C 7 methyl group diminishes it...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial iron {{acquisition}} by {{the means}} of enterobactin (ENT) is constrained in mammalian hosts due to ENT-binding proteins such as siderocalin and serum albumin. To evade sequestration by these proteins, ENT can be modified by the C glycosyltransferase IroB, which {{is located in the}} iroA locus of Salmonella and certain extraintestinal E. coli strains such as uropathogenic E. coli CFT 073. The glycosylation of ENT has been reported to be a bacterial evasion mechanism to restore the iron scavenging ability of ENT in the presence of mammalian ENT-binding proteins by the installation of a <b>steric</b> <b>impediment.</b> The C glycosyltransferase IroB catalyses the transfer of a glucose moiety to the DHB subunit of ENT under formation of a C-C bond between the anomeric C 1 of the glucose moiety and the C 5 of the 2, 3 -DHB subunit of ENT. The formation of mono-, di- and triglycosylated Ent (MGE/DGE/TGE) products where observed in vitro. The formation of a C-C bond is remarkable because of its chemical stability and resilience against enzymatic degradation. In this M. Sc. thesis, we initially identified the iroB gene product in the iroA harbouring E. coli strain Nissle 1917 on transcriptional and translational level and expressed and purified IroB recombinant. Then, we investigated the mechanism of the C-C bond formation catalysed by IroB in vitro. Based on the hypothesis that deprotonation of the catechol 2 hydroxyl renders the catechol C 5 para to the 2 -hydroxyl nucleophilic, the C-C bond would then be formed in a general SN 2 reaction between the attacking nucleophile and the anomeric carbon of glucose, which is further facilitated by the excellent phosphate leaving group of the UDP-glucose donor. By {{the means of}} homology modelling and superposition strategies, we were able to identify the binding sites of the glycosyl donor UDP-glucose and the glycosyl acceptor ENT and to locate residues that could potentially act as base catalysts to increase the phenolate anionic character of the 2, 3 -DHB subunit during catalysis. We established an activity assay for IroB, separated products arising from IroB activity by reversed phase chromatography and compared so the activity of wild-type IroB and several variants. Additionally, all variants were characterized biophysically, mainly to confirm that the structural integrity was not impaired by mutations. Ultimately, our results enable us to propose a mechanism for C-glycosylation of IroB that is consistent with other glycosyltransferases found in nature. ...|$|E
