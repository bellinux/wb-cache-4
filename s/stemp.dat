40|$|These {{are three}} quite {{different}} papers, from very different perspectives. John Quiggin adopts a micro approach; Warwick McKibbin’s views are informed by research on optimal policy regimes in large-scale macro models, while Peter <b>Stemp’s</b> comments are mainly {{based on the}} literature which deals with institutional structure and incentives for monetary policy. I {{want to respond to}} a couple of points raised by each author, and then end by suggesting three questions – one from each of the papers – on which discussion might focus. I am {{going to talk about the}} three papers in the order in which I read them, which is not the order in which you have heard them today. John Quiggin’s paper has a micro framework. He starts with a representative agent maximising a lifetime utility function subject to the usual constraints. If I understand this analysis correctly, John makes two points: • People care about volatility in consumption streams. If you give them two streams of income and consumption which have identical discounted present value, but one is much more volatile from period to period than the other, they will prefer the less volatile one, if they are risk averse.
