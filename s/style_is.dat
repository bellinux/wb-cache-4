5|$|His writing <b>style</b> <b>is</b> best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E

40|$|As one of {{the factors}} {{influencing}} consumers purchase behavior, decision-making <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> crucial for understanding consumer shopping behavior and for developing successful marketing strategies. Decision-making <b>styles</b> have <b>been</b> mainly viewed as a relatively enduring consumer personality that seldom changes even when applied to different goods and situations. Recently, a study showed that consumer decision-making <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> influenced by product type, suggesting that decision-making <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> individual response patterns in a specific decision context rather than personality trait based. Despite extensive research regarding consumer decision making styles, relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} identify whether consumer decision-making <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> truly personality trait based or context-dependent. Thus, this work challenged the theory that decision-making <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> personality trait based and investigated whether decisionmaking <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> context dependent. Three independent studies, focusing on extending our knowledge regarding consumer decision-making <b>styles,</b> <b>were</b> conducted. The first study examined whether consumer decision-making styles depend on channel type (online versus offline channels). In addition, it explored new types of decision-making styles which better represent current consumer needs and preferences. Study results supported previous arguments suggesting that decision-making <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> not personality trait based but vary across contexts. Results also demonstrated the need to continuously observe consumers? decision-making styles and capture emerging new styles. The second study explored whether product characteristics, specifically intangibility and non-standardization, influence consumer decision-making styles in an online context. At the same time, this study examined whether there is any interaction effect between product type and product involvement. The results showed that certain types of online decision-making <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> influenced by product type. The results also showed that product involvement has an important role in influencing online decision-making styles. The third study investigated whether consumer online decision-making styles influence loyalty toward online travel agencies. The results of the study provide support for five out of eleven hypotheses, indicating that consumers? online decision-making styles significantly influence loyalty toward online travel agencies. Finally, the overall findings, limitations of the studies, agenda for future research, and practical and theoretical implications were discussed...|$|R
