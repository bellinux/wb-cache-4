40|$|AbstractPostgraduate design {{research}} {{has received more}} attention {{over the last two}} decades. Two of the major objectives of research in recent years are serving the <b>society</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry.</b> Due to the time constraint and the physical resource provision and setting of research, most students’ research cannot serve the objectives inclusively. Instead, sometimes these two objectives are mutually exclusive. From 2007 to 2009, a case study on postgraduate design research was conducted. The methods included in-depth review on the details of the students’ study objectives and activities. Students were interviewed at different stages of their studies in order to understanding their progress, difficulties and achievements. This paper briefly reviews and advocates the importance and needs of serving both the <b>society</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> by postgraduate design research. Based on the case study in a postgraduate design research programme, the paper discusses how a balance of the two objectives can be obtained. The paper also identifies the difficulties, limitations, opportunities and possibilities for researchers and educators as reference for programme implementation and further investigation in order to bring a better quality of postgraduate design research...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a {{promising}} and fast growing area of technologies {{and services to}} assist people with special needs (e. g. elderly or disabled) in managing more independently their everyday life. AAL is founded on increasing needs for welfare technologies, {{as well as on}} significant effort from many scientific disciplines, the <b>society,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry.</b> The research has so far been primarily concentrated on elicitation of the functional aspects and on providing the technical solutions for the AAL systems and services. The problem of eliciting non-functional requirements and quality characteristics that are specific and critical for AAL, however, has been addressed to a much lesser extent. Failing to ensure the necessary system and service quality regarding critical characteristics may represent a significant obstacle to the wider acceptance of AAL in the society. There is hence a need to increase awareness of quality of AAL systems and services by providing the necessary supplement to the established state of the art. This paper reports on the process and the results from elicitation of AAL specific quality characteristics. The approach is based on established reference architectures and roadmapping material, as well as the ISO/IEC 9126 software product quality standard. The paper demonstrates how to do the elicitation in practice, and proposes the set of quality characteristics that are most important in the AAL context...|$|E

40|$|Interactive online {{games are}} {{increasingly}} popular in today's <b>society,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> is growing fast. Games {{take place in}} a virtual world and involve interaction with other players. Some online games connect millions of people, and the game studios enjoy enormous revenue utilising different business models. The interactive game market has changed a lot over the years, and player demands have increased concerning functionality, content, and price. As a result, the costs related to development and operation of these games are very high. To justify this price, it is essential that the games become successful, and that they contribute to income even after the initial purchase. In this paper, factors concerning player behaviour are studied. Factors include finding reasons why people join or leave a particular game, what events contribute to extending the lifetime of a game, how competition and cooperation affect the market evolution, and how game studios can react to change the market outcome. In particular, network effects, Word-of-Mouth (WOM), critical mass, churning, and cooperation are studied, as well as some history to get {{a better understanding of how}} the interactive game market has evolved, how it works, and how popular games have gained their position. System Dynamics (SD) is utilised to simulate and measure different market factors. A model called Buyer Player Quitter (BPQ) model is developed. This model is used to simulate different market scenarios, including a one supplier market, a market with two competing games, and a market with three games including competition and cooperation. Each scenario highlights different effects. In addition, two models specifically designed to recreate empirical data from two existing games are created. These models prove the impact of the discussed market factors in actual Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG). Finally, simulation scenarios are created and conducted, and the results are analysed and discussed. The main findings involve the importance of generating initial adoption to reach critical mass. Once critical mass is reached, network effects and WOM becomes essential to generate a significant player base. Also, updates and expansions help a game reach a bigger audience while competition and cooperation have a major impact on growth and the lifetime of games...|$|E

40|$|Introducción y antecedentes El concepto de desarrollo sostenible surgió como idea {{principal}} tras la reunión de la comisión Brundtland en 1987. Esta reunión fue organizada por Naciones Unidas con el fin de tratar el deterioro del medio ambiente, originado por el desarrollo descontrolado de la humanidad. El desarrollo sostenible fue definido como un avance social y económico que asegure una vida sana y productiva al ser humano, pero que no comprometa las posibilidades de desarrollo de las generaciones venideras. Entre las conclusiones alcanzadas, se resaltó la necesitad de disponer de una mayor variedad de fuentes de energía. La filosofía de esta cumbre fue recogida en Agenda 21, un documento que pretendía servir como guía general de actuación para alcanzar un desarrollo sostenible a todos los niveles. Respecto a las ciencias, Agenda 21 subrayaba la necesidad de emplear todo el conocimiento científico en la consecución de los objetivos del desarrollo sostenible. En este sentido, la Environmental Protection Agency acuñó en 1998 un término, Green Chemistry, que reunía estas ideas y las aplicaba a la química a través de 12 principios que debían ser cumplidos en {{el camino}} hacia una química sostenible. Entre estos principios, el uso de fuentes renovables para la obtención de materias primas ha adquirido gran relevancia debido a las previsiones de agotamiento de una de las fuentes de energía y materias primas más importantes: el petróleo. Los aceites vegetales se incluyen entre estas fuentes renovables de materias primas, siendo actualmente una de las fuentes renovables más utilizadas por la industria química. Los aceites vegetales están básicamente compuestos por triglicéridos, que son moléculas formadas por glicerol y tres ácidos grasos. En general los ácidos grasos pueden ser completamente saturados o contener varios dobles enlaces que en algunos casos pueden encontrarse conjugados, pero también existen ácidos grasos que contienen grupos hidroxilo o epóxido. Cada aceite vegetal posee una distribución característica de ácidos grasos que determina sus propiedades físicas y químicas. En lo que respecta a la química de los polímeros, los aceites vegetales constituyen una atractiva materia prima debido a la amplia gama de transformaciones químicas que pueden llevarse a cabo para sintetizar monómeros de diversa naturaleza. La epoxidación de los dobles enlaces internos es la transformación más común, ya que permite, a través de la apertura del anillo oxiránico con diferentes reactivos, la introducción de una gran variedad de grupos funcionales. Los dobles enlaces internos pueden polimerizarse directamente en condiciones térmicas, con iniciadores de radicales o por polimerización catiónica. Introducction The sustainable development concept {{came out of}} the United Nations Commision on Environment and Development in 1987 (Bruntland Commission) and it is defined as "the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". From this point, both the <b>society</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> have considered what a sustainable development really means and the best ways to start to achieve it from their own standpoints. The principles of the United Nations Conference on environment and Development (UNCED) held in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, and Agenda 21, were formulated with the aim of preparing the world for the challenges of the 21 st century. In this context, during the early 1990 s the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) coined the phrase Green Chemistry "To promote innovative chemical technologies that reduce or eliminate the use of generation of hazardous substances in the design, manufacture and use of chemical products". The main challenges of Green Chemistry and Engineeiring can be summarized as: ·	utilizing renewable instead of scarce resources. ·	avoiding toxic/dangerous chemicals in safer processes to obtain safer products. ·	minimizing energy use. ·	minimizing waste and resource use, re-using products, recovering and recycling materials. So making processes globally more efficient. Plant oils {{are one of the most}} widely applied renewable raw materials in the chemical industry for non-fuel applications. Vegetable oils are triglycerides (tri-esters of glycerol with long-chain fatty acids) with varying composition of fatty acids depending on the plant they are extracted from. Depending on the composition of plant oils, their Chemicals and physical properties are different. Vegetable oils are very used in polymer chemistry. Triglycerides have different reactive points through which we can obtain polymers from plant oils. There are two main approaches:The first one is the chemical modification of the triglycerides obtaining a large number of polymerizable monomers like expoxides or alcohols. The second approach is the direct polymerization of the carbon-carbon doubles bonds of plant oils through a free radical or a cationic mechanism. The free radical polymerization of double bonds has received less attention than cationic mechanism which has been very studied by Larock's group. In both cases thermosetting polymers with comparable properties to those of industrial can be obtained. Because of increasing use of synthetic polymeric materials during the lasts decades and the large fraction of the fire load in homes, it is necessary the use of fire retardants to reduce combustibility of the polymers, and smoke or toxic fume production. To get these requirements, the development of effective flame retardant materials is a key factor. To reduce the flammability, flame retardants can act in the gas phase or in condensed phase. In the gas phase fire retardants act as scavengers of the highly reactive radical species that propagate the combustion. In the condensed-phase fire retardants interfere in the thermal degradation processes modifying the reaction pathways and promoting the formation of char instead of volatile degradation products. Finally some flame retardants can act in both phases. Objectives The main objective of this Thesis was to develop new fire retardant biobased thermosets from vegetable oils as renewable resources. To achieve this goal it was carried out the cationic copolymerization of soybean oil, styrene and divinylbenzene with different silicon-or boron-or phosphorus containing comonomers...|$|E
