50|$|The two {{markets that}} {{currently}} {{make use of}} MDDPD are the handset and the satellite communications (SATCOM) market. In handsets {{it is important to}} keep power consumption low and size minimal which is what brought about the initial investigations into MDDPD as the reduction of the feedback sampling rate means a reduction in power and size of the ADC portion of the IC being used. In SATCOM it is important to run transmitter power amplifier as close to its <b>saturation</b> <b>power</b> as possible in order to minimize operational expenditure (OPEX) and capital expenditure (CAPEX) but often more than one modem is being used in conjunction with the same transmitter. Multi-dimensional DPD allows the application of DPD in multi-source systems and therefore enables the transmitter to be kept closer to <b>saturation</b> <b>power</b> in multi-modem installations.|$|E
5000|$|Power {{supplies}} can be broadly {{divided into}} linear and switching types. Linear power converters process the input power directly, with all active power conversion components operating in their linear operating regions. In switching power converters, the input power {{is converted to}} AC or to DC pulses before processing, by components that operate predominantly in non-linear modes (e.g., transistors that {{spend most of their}} time in cutoff or <b>saturation).</b> <b>Power</b> is [...] "lost" [...] (converted to heat) when components operate in their linear regions and, consequently, switching converters are usually more efficient than linear converters because their components spend less time in linear operating regions.|$|E

The powerful and expensive CAD systems provide approximate behaviors of <b>power</b> <b>saturation</b> that do not always coincide with the realistic scenario. The state-of-the-art quasi-linear transistor model that is a logical development of the small-signal hybrid-p model has been initially applied for oscillation analysis. In this thesis we investigate the quasi-linear model for <b>power</b> <b>saturation</b> prediction in bipolar junction transistors. The efficiency of the modeled <b>power</b> <b>saturation</b> is verified by comparing it with the simulation in Agilent Advanced Deign System 2009 and measurement results. According to the extensive computational analysis the quasi-linear modeling presents high accuracy in the linear region of <b>power</b> <b>saturation</b> {{in the range of}} 0. 01 – 0. 35 dBm, whereas the simulated curves lag behind in the range of 2 dBm – 7 dBm.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem in multi-user multiple input single output downlink channels. The optimization {{problem in this}} system model is difficult to solve in general, since it is in non-convex fractional form. Hence, conventional algorithms have addressed the problem in an iterative manner for each channel realization, which leads to high computational complexity. To tackle this complexity issue, we propose a new simple method by utilizing {{the fact that the}} EE maximization is identical to the spectral efficiency (SE) maximization for the region of the power below a certain transmit power referred to as <b>saturation</b> <b>power.</b> In order to calculate the <b>saturation</b> <b>power,</b> we first introduce upper and lower bounds of the EE performance by adopting a maximal ratio transmission beamforming strategy. Then, we propose an efficient way to compute the <b>saturation</b> <b>power</b> for the EE maximization problem. Once we determine the <b>saturation</b> <b>power</b> corresponding to the maximum EE in advance, we can solve the EE maximization problem with SE maximization schemes with low complexity. The derived <b>saturation</b> <b>power</b> is parameterized by employing random matrix theory, which relies only on the second order channel statistics. Hence, this approach requires much lower computational complexity compared to a conventional scheme which exploits instantaneous channel state information, and provides insight on the <b>saturation</b> <b>power.</b> Numerical results validate that the proposed algorithm achieves near optimal EE performance with significantly reduced complexity.

Micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy shows a ∼ 2. 4 × increase of intensity, which is attributed to spatial far-field redistribution of the emission from the quantum dot-antenna system. Power-dependent studies show similar <b>saturation</b> <b>powers</b> of 2. 5 μ W for both coupled and uncoupled quantum dot emission in polarization-resolved measurements. Moreover, time-resolved spectroscopy reveals the absence of Purcell-enhancement of the quantum dot coupled to the antenna as compared to an uncoupled dot, yielding comparable exciton lifetimes of τ∼ 0. 5 ns. This observation is supported by numerical simulations, suggesting only minor Purcell-effects of 25 nm.

40|$|The {{semiconductor}} {{optical amplifier}} (SOA) is a versatile component {{that can be}} deployed to meet the expanding applications associated {{with the introduction of}} additional functionalities at the optical level in wavelength division multiplexed systems. The future network requires low cost, small footprint, directly controllable amplification throughout the different application layers from long haul through to metro; the intrinsic size and integration capability advantages will ensure that the SOA {{plays a key role in}} this evolution. In multi-wavelength gating/amplification applications the gain dynamics, oscillating at timescales comparable to that of the data which is being amplified, introduce issues of pattern dependent waveform distortion (patterning) in single channel, and inter-channel cross-talk in multi-wavelength cases which require management through careful SOA design and understanding of the network application scenarios.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model for two-, three-, and four-level system rare-earth-doped fiber amplifiers and lasers is presented. Fiber amplifier gain {{is expressed in}} terms of easily measured attenuation coefficients, intrinsic <b>saturation</b> <b>powers,</b> and cross <b>saturation</b> <b>powers</b> at the pump and signal wavelengths. System-independent formulas are given for the slopes and thresholds of ring and linear fiber lasers. Good agreement between theory and experiment is shown for erbium-doped fiber amplifiers and lasers and thulium-doped fiber lasers. Approximate system-independent solutions are also given for fiber amplifiers with excited state absorption at either the pump or signal wavelengths. A novel technique, requiring only one tunable light source, is proposed for finding the best pump wavelength when pump ESA is present. Analysis of erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) gain and noise yields a new expression for the amplifier signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) {{as a function of the}} fiber length. This leads to a new expression for the fiber length that optimizes the output SNR. Optical gain switching of EDFAs with short pulses at wavelengths within the amplifier bandwidth is modelled to determine how the pump and signal powers, pulse energy, fiber length, and dopant concentration affect the switching time and gain compression. Greater than 20 dB gain compression with nanosecond switching times is demonstrated with good agreement between theory and experiment. Remote EDFA switching from as far as 50 km away is demonstrated. The distance is limited by spontaneous Raman scattering of the switching pulses. These limitations are experimentally and theoretically investigated. Novel configurations are proposed for bidirectional amplification in both single-mode fiber and polarization maintaining fiber. New frequency dependent optical isolators are demonstrated for OTDR testing of amplified fiber links. The new bidirectional amplifier design is much better at attenuating backreflections than a standard EDFA. Polarization separated bidirectional fiber local area networks are proposed. Point-to-point and reflective N-star coupler networks where N = M 2 or 2 M 2 are considered for an integer M.
