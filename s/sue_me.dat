500|$|The {{possibility}} that the lyrics to [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] contained antisemitism was first raised publicly by The New York Times on June 15, 1995, one day before the album's release. The publication highlighted the lyrics, [...] "Jew me, <b>sue</b> <b>me,</b> everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me" [...] and labeled them [...] "slurs".

The countersuit stated that Activision had dropped the game after its merger with Vivendi and a failed attempt to convert the game into a Guitar Hero sequel. Schafer was infamously quoted as saying, in commenting on their actions, [...] "Hey, if Activision liked it, then they should have put a ring on it.

500|$|On June 17, Jackson issued another public {{apology to}} anyone {{offended}} by {{his choice of}} words and promised that future copies of the album would include an apology, Jackson concluded, [...] "I just want you all to know how strongly I am committed to tolerance, peace and love, and I apologize to anyone {{who might have been}} hurt". The next day, in his review of HIStory, Jon Pareles of The New York Times alleged, [...] "In... 'They Don't Care About Us', he gives the lie to his entire catalogue of brotherhood anthems with a burst of anti-Semitism: 'Jew me, <b>sue</b> <b>me,</b> everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me'".|$|E
500|$|By 1970, Northrup and Hollister {{had moved}} to Maui, Hawaii. Northrup's {{daughter}} Alexis, who was by now twenty-one years old, attempted to contact her father but was rebuffed in a handwritten statement in which Hubbard denied that he was her father: [...] "Your mother was with me as a secretary in Savannah in late 1948 [...] [...] [...] In July 1949 I was in Elizabeth, New Jersey, writing a movie. She turned up destitute and pregnant." [...] He said that Northrup had been a Nazi spy {{during the war and}} accused her and Hollister of using the divorce case to seize control of Dianetics: [...] "They obtained considerable newspaper publicity, none of it true, and employed the highest priced divorce attorney in the US to <b>sue</b> <b>me</b> for divorce and get the foundation in Los Angeles in settlement. This proved a puzzle since where there is no legal marriage, there can't be any divorce." [...] Despite clearly being written by Hubbard, who spoke in the first person in the letter, it was signed [...] "Your good friend, J. Edgar Hoover". Even his own staff were shocked by the contents of Hubbard's letter; he ended his instructions to them with the statement, [...] "Decency is not a subject well understood".|$|E

2500|$|The USR's public {{expression}} of regret over having tolerated [...] "a text with antisemitic content" [...] caused Goma to threaten with a lawsuit on libel grounds. In reaction, Gârbea stated: [...] "What {{we are interested}} in is Viaţa Românească, a press organ edited by the USR. Paul Goma may believe whatever he likes. It is not him that we are discussing, but the magazine. I see no reason why he would <b>sue</b> <b>me</b> personally." [...] According to an overview of the episode by journalist Ovidiu Şimonca, Horia Gârbea had unwittingly prompted Goma to state his intention of suing the Jewish-Romanian community league, or Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania (FCER). This was because, during the scandal, Gârbea had explained that the FCER's reaction was an incentive in the USR's internal investigation. Goma's claim for reparations from FCER leaders, Şimonca noted, ignored the fact that Gârbea had not disclosed any names.|$|E
2500|$|Davis and Wyler {{frequently}} fought during filming, {{about everything}} from her appearance (Wyler thought {{she looked like a}} Kabuki performer, but Davis wanted to look older than her age as the part was written for a 40-year-old) to the set design (which Davis thought was far too opulent for a family supposedly struggling financially) to her interpretation of the role (Wyler wanted a more feminine and sympathetic Regina, akin to Tallulah's interpretation). Davis had yielded to Wyler's demands during production of The Letter, but this time she held her ground. Not helping the situation was the fact Los Angeles was experiencing its worst heat wave in years, and the temperature on the soundstages regularly rose above 100 degrees. Davis finally walked off the picture. [...] "It was the only time in my career that I walked out on a film after the shooting had begun," [...] she later recalled. [...] "I was a nervous wreck {{due to the fact that}} my favorite and most admired director was fighting me every inch of the way ... I just didn't want to continue." [...] The actress retreated to her rented house in Laguna Beach and [...] "flatly refused to come back to work. It took a little courage, to say the least. Goldwyn had it in his power to <b>sue</b> <b>me</b> for the entire cost of the production." [...] A week later she returned to the set after rumors she would be replaced by Katharine Hepburn or Miriam Hopkins began to circulate, although Goldwyn was not about to bear the expense of scrapping all the footage with Davis and refilming the scenes with a new actress. Even though the film was a critical and commercial success and nominated for nine Academy Awards, she and Wyler never worked together again.|$|E

5000|$|Whatever {{the merits}} of the argument, the {{pictorial}} demonstration is compelling. The Great Man pounces quickly on its subject matter and, from first image to last, never lets go. Aiming a screenful of bile at the industry in general, it releases its most acidulous contempt at a single personality, an [...] "American idol." [...] Is it a roman a clef?

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with celebrity columnist Michael Musto of The Village Voice, Brown recalled how Madonna first reacted when saw the film: [...] "At first I heard she really liked it.

Then she didn't like the scene with the dancers <b>suing</b> <b>me,</b> because that really happened to her." ...|$|R

Long. [...] "It’s {{hard to believe that}} I was involved in it. It was a mess. He (Long) could have easily <b>sued</b> <b>me,</b> but that never occurred to me.

60|$|As soon as {{the loss}} of the waggons and horses was {{generally}} known, all the owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bond to pay. Their demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquainting them that the money was ready in the paymaster's hands, but that orders for paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley, and my assuring them that I had apply'd to that general by letter; but, he being at a distance, an answer could not soon be receiv'd, and they must have patience, all this was not sufficient to satisfy, and some began to <b>sue</b> <b>me.</b> General Shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims, and ordering payment.

Of course, there are blacks everywhere, of all shades, from pure jet up to the lightest yellow. Some of these niggers have money, and are quite independent.

60|$|While strolling around, we {{kept the}} run of the moon all the time, and we still kept an eye on her after we got back to the hotel portico. I had a theory that the {{gravitation}} of refraction, being subsidiary to atmospheric compensation, the refrangibility of the earth's surface would emphasize this effect in regions where great mountain ranges occur, and possibly so even-handed impact the odic and idyllic forces together, the one upon the other, as to prevent the moon from rising higher than 12,200 feet above sea-level. This daring theory had been received with frantic scorn by some of my fellow-scientists, and with an eager silence by others. Among the former I may mention Prof. H----y; and among the latter Prof. T----l. Such is professional jealousy; a scientist will never show any kindness for a theory which he did not start himself. There is no feeling of brotherhood among these people. Indeed, they always resent it when I call them brother. To show how far their ungenerosity can carry them, I will state that I offered to let Prof. H----y publish my great theory as his own discovery; I even begged him to do it; I even proposed to print it myself as his theory. Instead of thanking me, he said that if I tried to fasten that theory on him he would <b>sue</b> <b>me</b> for slander. I was going to offer it to Mr. Darwin, whom I understood to be a man without prejudices, but {{it occurred to me that}} perhaps he would not be interested in it since it did not concern heraldry.|$|E
