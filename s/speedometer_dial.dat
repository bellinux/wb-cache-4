50|$|The series two Horizon {{launched}} in July 1982 had a 5 speed gearbox, and badged series II 5 speed. The bumpers were painted {{black and the}} rear windscreen was smaller, because the parcel shelf was raised to {{increase the size of}} the boot. Some models had an electronic LED 'econometer' which lit up several lights {{around the edge of the}} <b>speedometer</b> <b>dial,</b> There was also an LED tachometer on top of the range models which was a row of green,yellow and red LEDs and was positioned atop the steering column.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} Vios {{was adapted from}} the Platz with modified body panels, which created a significantly different appearance, although portions of the car feature design cues from the E120 Corolla. In September 2005, the Vios received minor cosmetic changes to its exterior and interior for the 2006 model year. The front bumper, headlights and tail lights were freshened; also new were the wheels, <b>speedometer</b> <b>dial</b> design and interior trim.In other uses, the {{first generation}} Vios is adopted as a racing vehicle in Touring Car Championships in Indonesia and One Make Races in Thailand. The car is also in use as taxicabs in Indonesia but features lesser equipment and is specially rebadged as the Toyota Limo. This {{is not to be}} confused with certain taxis with the same name in Thailand, which use Toyota Corollas.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explains}} {{the historical development of}} analogue and digital <b>speedometer</b> <b>dial</b> designs using the linguistics theory base of pragmatics, which asks researchers {{to explain a}} visual design by describing its purpose as well as how its various visual features meet people¿s needs, how people read dials and how people use dials to coordinate with one another or machines. The paper is useful for researchers interested in methodologies for studying the development of language-like visual communication, and for those interested in the history of information graphics, machine interfaces or speedometer dials in particular. A range of dial designs from the early 1900 s to the current day are described and analyzed. In this paper, results show that drivers read speedometers to avoid fines, keep safe, change gears, set cruise control or record high speeds. Designs also, however, serve marketing and aesthetic purposes. Features of analogue displays are described with the paper concluding with a taxonomy of dial features. The entire system of speed containment could be improved since even with easy-to-read dials, drivers continue to speed. Dials that work with satellite systems to continually display the current speed limit may be the way of the future...|$|E
50|$|In 2015 for the 2016 model year, Toyota {{released}} a facelift for the XA40 series. The facelift debuted with the RAV4 Hybrid {{shown at the}} April 2015 New York International Auto Show. The facelift includes redesigned LED front and rear lamps and updated <b>speedometer</b> <b>dials</b> with full color TFT multi information display.|$|R
50|$|Honda Atlas (Pakistan) resumed the {{production}} of Honda City on May 1, 2012 after it was halted due to supply chain disruption caused by massive flooding in Thailand. This resumption of production is marked by Honda as it comes with the range of facelifted Honda City {{under the banner of}} Honda City Aspire. In October, 2014 Honda Atlas launched the facelifted Honda City, with new features including new taillights, revamped chrome grille, blinkers on side mirrors, rear window brake light, keyless entry system and new bumpers. The interior also received some changes. The <b>speedometer</b> <b>dials</b> were changed from orange to blue optitron.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2006, {{the station}} became {{involved}} in controversy when motorists on the coast road blamed the station for causing car engines and lights to cut out. <b>Speedometer</b> <b>dials</b> swung up to 150 mph as motorists drove past, and a local garage owner who runs the nearest garage at Mundesley, said he had dealt with 30 calls {{over a couple of}} months. Eventually the Ministry of Defence admitted that the Type 93 radar spinning inside the dome had been out of alignment between November 2005 and February 2006, Having previously denied problems, the MoD said it would consider claims for compensation after an inquiry found the radar was [...] "out of alignment".|$|R
5000|$|Trimingham {{is home to}} {{the remote}} air defence radar station RAF Trimingham, a {{satellite}} station of RAF Neatishead, which has a structure shaped like a giant golf ball located {{on the edge of the}} cliff on the coastal road. In November 2006 the Ministry of Defence admitted that the Type 93 radar spinning inside the dome had been out of alignment between November 2005 and February 2006, causing car engines and lights to cut out, and <b>speedometer</b> <b>dials</b> to swing up to 150 mph as motorists drove past.

5000|$|The pointer shaft is held toward zero by a fine torsion spring. The torque on the cup {{increases}} {{with the speed}} of rotation of the magnet. Thus an increase in the speed of the car will twist the cup and speedometer pointer against the spring. The cup and pointer will turn until the torque of the eddy currents on the cup is balanced by the opposing torque of the spring, and then stop. Given the torque on the cup is proportional to the car's speed, and the spring's deflection is proportional to the torque, the angle of the pointer is also proportional to the speed, so that equally spaced markers on the dial can be used for gaps in speed. At a given speed the pointer will remain motionless and pointing to the appropriate number on the <b>speedometer's</b> <b>dial.</b>|$|R
50|$|A more {{detailed}} facelift for 1972 {{brought a new}} all-plastic dashboard with deeply hooded round dials (earlier versions had either a strip <b>speedometer</b> or round <b>dials</b> in a flat dashboard for more expensive models like the Vogue), new steering wheel, plastic instead of metal air cleaner, reshaped squarer headlamps in a new grille and some engine tuning changes.|$|R
40|$|The GKPI {{procedure}} is new in SAS 9. 2 SAS/Graph. This new procedure {{can be used}} to create graphical key performance indicator (KPI) charts which include sliders, bullet graphs, <b>dials,</b> <b>speedometers,</b> and traffic lights. This paper is intended to serve as an introduction to the GKPI procedure by discussing the syntax and demonstrating examples. In addition, this paper will discuss how results from the GKPI procedure can be integrated into existing SAS environments...|$|R
50|$|The bike's {{production}} run lasted from November 1985 to March 2006. The model {{was followed by}} the 132cc RXG, (11.8BHP). This model was the reply to the Stricter Emission Norm. RXG Had an Econominded Engine configuration with the Ports Tuned To get more Fuel-Efficieny And lesser exhaust gas. But It came at a cost, robbing RXG of the signature RX-100 Exhaust Beat and Top End Power, the bike failed in the market. The Japanese Responded in Late 1997 with Yamaha RX-135 and The RX-Z which had a Tachometer, Sportier Headlamp and Body. Both were Mechanically same and saw Lukewarm Response. The market Also Saw 5 Speed Versions of RX-135s & RX-Z. The final variant was a four-speed RX135 with a Small type catalytic converter, sporting a fuel gauge and <b>speedometer</b> with white <b>dials</b> which was sold very briefly in 2003-2005.|$|R
40|$|Research on {{interventions}} {{aimed to}} promote energy savings has shown support for direct feedback using in-home displays (IHDs) to reduce energy consumption. These displays are electronic devices that provide real-time energy information and are emerging {{as an effective}} tool to communicate with people about their energy consumption. How feedback is presented to people and how they {{understand the meaning of}} such feedback largely depends on the design of the display, yet there are relatively few studies that investigate {{the way in which the}} display can best be designed to present energy information and motivate energy-saving behaviour. Further, even though there is a wide range of variations in the visual presentation of feedback, there is a lack of focus on the process of optimising the IHD design. This thesis aims to address the need for designing IHDs at the display component level, by examining three types of display design (numerical displays, analogue displays using <b>speedometer</b> <b>dials,</b> and ambient displays using emotional faces) in both laboratory-based computer-simulated experiments and field-based experiments: participants’ abilities to detect changes in energy information shown on the computer-simulated displays were measured by means of accuracy rate and response time, and their subjective preferences for display types were assessed against experimental data; live energy data were displayed using the three design types in a student residence at the University of Bath to see how they would influence energy-use behaviour. Results from the laboratory experiments demonstrated that both accuracy rate and response time for seeing changes in the information displayed were strongly associated with the type of display design. Participants preferred numerical display and were better at detecting changes in information with this display than with the other two. Conversely, the student residence experiments showed that when participants’ attention was divided in a household setting, there was no difference in energy consumption among experimental groups who received information from any of the three display types. However, these experimental groups used significantly less energy compared with control groups, who had no displays installed. It was concluded that 1) the mere presence of a display device could influence people’s behaviour, regardless of the type of display design, people’s preferences or the level of user engagement with the display, although there was a strong indication that the ambient design worked better than the other two designs at an arbitrary statistical significance level of 0. 95, and 2) subjective preferences and computer-simulated studies are poor guides to the actual performance of IHDs in real-world settings. This work helps establish how IHDs can be designed and the influence that they may have on people’s energy-consumption behaviour. It also contributes to the literature of exploring people’s perceptibility of energy information. The method used is replicable and can be applied in similar studies on energy display design. Lastly, the improved understanding gained through this work will facilitate the development of effective smart meter display technology that may help people adopt conscious energy behaviour in the long term...|$|R
50|$|The {{model was}} {{followed}} by the 11.8 BHP, 132CC RXG, with a taller primary and secondary reduction. It the same light flywheel of RX100 that causes a jerky ride. It was replaced with a heavier one by the manufacturer on the following year. Next came the RXZ in 1997, in a new chassis with shorter wheelbase and with the same primary reduction ratio as RX100 but a taller final reduction. The RXZ was launched with a sportier bodywork and produced 12bhp@6500rpm. Following the RXZ, in 1998 the RX135 was launched with the same engine of RXZ in the chassis of RX100 or RXG. RX135 saw a moderate success due to its refined power output and better fuel economy. Finally, in 2000 were launched the 14bhp@7500rpm RX135 5speed with a catalytic converter silencer. It failed in the market due to its poor fuel economy and discontinued in two years. But later it was recognised as the quickest RX and has a cult status due to its rarity. A 5-speed variant of the RXZ with front disc brakes also had a limited release in 2001 at a premium price tag.The final variant was a 4-speed RX135 with a catalytic converter silencer, sporting a fuel gauge and <b>speedometer</b> with white <b>dials</b> which was sold very briefly from 2003-2005.|$|R
