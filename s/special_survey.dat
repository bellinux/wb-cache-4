25|$|The {{papers of}} the day {{described}} the new ship as 320ft long, 44ft broad, and 28ft 8.5 in deep. On deck there was accommodation for 90 saloon and 40 second saloon passengers. This was later reported as 150 saloon and 46 second saloon passengers. She {{was to have a}} speed of 12.5 knots at sea on a draught of 12ft. The total capacity on a draught of 21ft will be 3500 tons, including bunker coal. She was built of steel of the highest class of the British Corporation Registry and under their <b>special</b> <b>survey.</b> The propulsion was two triple-expansion engines. The vessel was built under the supervision of Captain Cameron, Marine Superintendent of the company. At her sea trials near Skelmorlie on the Firth of Clyde she attained 15 knots.|$|E
25|$|In 1846 a {{group of}} speculators from Scotland formed the Bon Accord Mining Company, {{purchasing}} a section of land on the northern boundary of the <b>special</b> <b>survey,</b> hoping that the ore body extended under the boundary. Due {{to the lack of}} success in mining company, land near the mine was subdivided in 1849 forming Aberdeen (named after the east coastal city of Aberdeen in Scotland), with the company seeking to recoup some of their investment. Streets were named to honour directors of the Bon Accord Mining Company and the retention of mineral rights by the company prevented SAMA from acquiring the land, as they had in Redruth. New Aberdeen was subdivided after 1872 arrival of the railway line from Kapunda, and most of the early buildings in the two townships were constructed in the three years following.|$|E

2500|$|The Paris {{flood of}} 1910 reached {{the height of}} 8.5 meters on the scale {{measuring}} the river's level on the Pont de la Tournelle. The Seine rose above its banks and flooded along the course it had followed in prehistoric times; the water reached {{as far as the}} Gare Saint-Lazare and the Place du Havre. It was the second-highest flood recorded in the history of Paris (the highest was in 1658), and was the third major flood of the Belle Époque (the others were in 1872 and 1876). Nonetheless, it received much more attention than earlier floods, largely because of the advent of photography and the international press. Postcards and other images of the flood spread around the world. The municipal authorities made a <b>special</b> <b>survey</b> of the city to measure exactly its extent. It also demonstrated the vulnerability of the city's new infrastructure: the flood stopped the Paris Metro and shut down the city's electricity and telephone system. Afterwards, new dams were constructed along the Seine and its major tributaries. No comparable floods have taken place since.|$|E
