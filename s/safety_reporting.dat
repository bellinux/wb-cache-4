2500|$|As {{the west}} began {{to learn about}} the Chernobyl incident, fear and anxiety about nuclear energy swelled in U.S. public opinion. Even as early as 1975, anti-nuclear {{movement}} coalitions were making strides in reducing the power of the nuclear industry. The coalitions were able to instill fear in the population over the many errors in the daily operations of nuclear energy plants, causing them to be constantly shut down, and exposing the ineffectiveness in their energy production. By this point, in the late 1980s, most U.S. plants were either at or close to completion, so the Chernobyl incident did not prevent plants from coming online. However, after 1986, anti-nuclear messages were reinforced by media pictures of deformed babies and other atrocities from the fallout in the Soviet Union after Chernobyl. Citizen pressure forced the NRC to address many issues alarming the public, resulting in [...] "improved reactor <b>safety,</b> <b>reporting</b> abnormal occurrences at power plants, revised radiation standards, protecting nuclear plants from sabotage, safeguarding nuclear materials from theft, licensing the export of nuclear equipment and fuel, authorizing steps to use plutonium as fuel for nuclear power, and other matters." [...] Shortly after the 1979 Three Mile Island incident, a poll by The New York Times and CBS found that public approval for building new nuclear plants dropped from 69% to 49% and opposition increased from 21% to 41%. Similarly, after the Chernobyl incident, a CBS news poll showed that 55% of those questioned believed a similar meltdown was likely to happen in the U.S.|$|E

40|$|This {{expert report}} {{reflects}} conclusions and key points from two surveys and a workshop involving Seveso inspectors from around Europe {{on the role}} of <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> in preventing major chemical accidents. The Seveso Directive requires operators of so-called “upper-tier” major hazard sites to submit <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> detailing the major risks associated with the site and how they are controlled. <b>Safety</b> <b>reports</b> are the documents in which the operator of such a site demonstrates that the major accident prevention policy and a safety management system are in effect, that major accident hazards and risk have been identified and are adequately prevented and potential consequences limited, that adequate safety and reliability is incorporated in all aspects of the plant, and an effective internal emergency plan has been drawn up and implemented. A good <b>safety</b> <b>report</b> allows the authorities to get a clear overview of what could happen, how accidents are prevented and what is being done to ensure that if an accident occurred, the consequences can be minimised and a clear mitigation plan is in place. Ideally, the <b>safety</b> <b>report</b> should also be a dynamic, living document that helps companies control and take into account the potential for major accident hazards in various operational decisions. In many cases, the <b>safety</b> <b>report</b> is, however, still only a report compiled for the authorities. The report indicates that while there are many practical differences in how the Seveso II Directive <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> are evaluated and used in inspections within the EU and its Seveso partner countries, the challenges are almost universal. Most challenges appear to be related to whether the <b>safety</b> <b>report</b> presents a coherent and convincing case that justifies the risk management decisions taken. The report describes the key challenges, providing several examples of good practice for improving <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> (operators) and verifying <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> during inspections (authorities). It also identifies a number of specific areas where it could be useful to develop common tools and solutions to improve overall effectiveness of <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> as an active and useful mechanism for site risk management.

40|$|Since {{the coming}} into force of the Seveso II Directive, {{considerable}} experience has been acquired in regard to preparation of <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> for establishments that fall under the requirements of this Directive. In light of this experience, the Amendment of the Seveso II Directive adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 16 December 2003, gave the European Commission the mandate "to review by 31 December 2006 in close cooperation with the Member States, the existing Guidance on the Preparation of a <b>safety</b> <b>Report</b> (EUR 17690) ". As a result, a technical working group of Member States representing the Seveso competent authorities and the European Commission's Major Accident Hazards Bureau was established to review and re-examine the guidance. This paper describes {{the results of this}} effort. The new guidance maintains the high-level and overarching character of the older version, but improves the document through better definition of conceptual elements of the <b>safety</b> <b>report</b> and greater alignment with annex II of the Directive which describes the essential elements of the <b>safety</b> <b>report.</b> For example, the document elaborates explanations of certain key principles, such as: (i) roles and responsibilities of the operator and the competent authorities, the central purpose and focus of the report, (ii) the relevance of the <b>safety</b> <b>report</b> {{in the context of the}} Seveso II Directive, and (iii) some specific obligations of the Directive. It also provides assistance in understanding what kind of content and analysis are generally expected in this kind of report. In particular, the guidance suggests the level of detail that might be necessary to characterise the risk at the facility as well as identifies the various approaches to risk assessment that are commonly used as a basis for <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> in the European Union. Overall, the aim of the guidance is to provide concrete advice to operators and competent authorities on the logic and expectations underlying the <b>safety</b> <b>report,</b> so as to make both preparation and review of the report a more efficient and useful exercise for all parties involved.

40|$|The railway {{signaling}} {{system is the}} key system to ensure the safe operation of railway traffic. It is therefore {{important to have a}} safe and reliable railway {{signaling system}}. The railway authority defines requirements that should be complied with. The technical <b>safety</b> <b>report</b> is a vital documentation for the demonstration of fulfillment of requirements to the railway authority. A literature review of the signaling system is presented first. It describes the different technologies used for railway signaling system. Moreover, challenging problems in the design of two track station, based on the situations in Norway, were discussed. In addition, some relevant regulations and standards were introduced. Further, safety-critical functions performed by a signaling system were presented. The methods for determination of tolerable hazard rate, which is the safety requirements for safety-critical functions, were introduced. These methods distinguished two different demand modes, i. e., low-demand mode and high-demand mode. It described different roles and responsibilities involved for the whole signaling system life cycle. As a safety case is a product from one phase of system life cycle, a brief introduction to safety case was presented. The discussion of differences among three categories of safety cases was followed. The structure of technical <b>safety</b> <b>report</b> and the different categories of technical <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> were described. Two technical <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> from Norwegian National Rail Administration were evaluated {{in the light of the}} requirements from EN 50129.
