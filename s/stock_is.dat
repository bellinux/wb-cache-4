5|$|The <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} made by boiling meat, bones, or both. Beef, pork or {{a combination}} of both are most commonly used, with brisket, ribs, shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. Marrow bones are considered best for the bone stock. Meat <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> usually cooked for about two hours, whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for smoked meats, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. Fasting varieties are typically made with fish stock to avoid the use of meat, while purely vegetarian recipes often substitute forest mushroom broth for the stock.|$|E

40|$|When {{weak and}} strong fish <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> {{caught in the}} same fishery, {{managing}} {{for the protection of}} the weak stock may result in foregone economic benefits from harvest of the strong stock, while managing for the strong stock may result in overfishing of the weak stock.

5|$|Because {{it was a}} {{self-contained}} section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and the branch line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes set on the Tube even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate signage, as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are maintained in operational condition, and a train of ex-Northern line 1972 tube <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> permanently stabled on the branch.

5|$|Deckham {{is an area}} {{of social}} and {{economic}} deprivation, in the top ten per cent of such areas according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation. Housing <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> predominantly council housing and is, in many places, outdated and in need of modernisation.

5000|$|Before Facebook's IPO, {{the book}} {{building}} process {{was used to}} determine how much the <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> worth before it was sold to the public. Morgan Stanley was the lead investor for Facebook's IPO. Initially, the <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> thought to be determined between $28 and $35 a share. The week before the <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> sold, the demand for the <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> sufficient to increase the price between $34 to $38 a share. Once the <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> offered Morgan Stanley tried to prevent the stock from falling below $38 a share in order to prevent the IPO from being considered a failure. Since Facebook stock initially had a high demand, but this demand fell and its price consequently fell it was considered that Facebook was overvalued when it was sold at its initial public offering.|$|R

5|$|Hydraulic mining, which Pliny {{referred}} to as ruina montium ("ruin of the mountains"), allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale. The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500tonnes. Copper was produced {{at an annual rate}} of 15,000t, and lead at 80,000t, both production levels unmatched until the Industrial Revolution; Hispania alone had a 40% share in world lead production. The high lead output was a by-product of extensive silver mining which reached 200t per annum. At its peak around the mid-2nd century AD, the Roman silver <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> estimated at 10,000t, five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800AD.

5|$|Though Line A ran on a {{different}} voltage {{to the rest of}} the network, it was converted to the 1500v used on the rest of the network when the 200 Series trains began to arrive. On the other hand, Line B has traditionally been the most troublesome of the network given its different voltage and the fact that it uses third rail electrification as opposed to the overhead lines used on the rest of the network, making it in effect a separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1960's rolling stock acquired from Tokyo's Eidan Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining third rail <b>stock,</b> <b>is</b> being converted to overhead lines at 1500v, after which the entire network will be standardised.|$|E
