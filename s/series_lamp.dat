According to Marcus Binney [...] "the gilded detail of the room has the lustre and crispness of gilt bronze, even the egg-and-dart in the boldly modelled cornice". Floral motifs are a common feature of the room, given the namesake, Marie Antoinette, and represents the flowers at one of her feasts. Over the overmantel is a basket of flowers, with [...] "flowers spilling out over the frames of the oval lunettes". [...] In the small entrance lobby of the suite are two terracotta statues of Spring and Summer, with [...] "drum-shaped pedestals ornamented with gilt-bronze flowers and ribbons". The ventilation grilles, of considerable size, are decorated in bronzed lattice. On the walls are a <b>series</b> <b>lamp</b> holders held by miniature Apollo lyres, with each bulb holder containing around 25 leaves opened out. The lights, according to Binney, are hung on [...] "cords from ribbons tied in bows, entwined at intervals with flowers, descending to a cluster of tassels". [...] The panels of the walls are treated like picture frames, with inner and outer mouldings, {{in contrast to the}} window frames and the wall mirrors which are surrounded by [...] "clusters of reeds, with an inset behind which a curtain could hang without obscuring the moulding", according to Binney.|$|E

25|$|Mechanical strobe tuners have a <b>series</b> of <b>lamps</b> or LEDs {{powered by}} amplified audio from the instrument; they flash (or strobe) {{at the same}} {{frequency}} as the input signal. For instance an 'A' played on a guitar's 6th string at the 5th fret has the frequency of 110 Hz when in tune. An 'A' played on the 1st string at the 5th fret vibrates at 440Hz. As such, the lamps would flash either 110 or 440 times per second in the above examples. In front of these flashing lights is a motor-driven, translucent printed disc with rings of alternating transparent and opaque sectors.|$|R
50|$|Hybrid {{systems are}} also common. The MIM-72 Chaparral was fired optically, but {{normally}} operated {{with a short}} range early warning radar that displayed targets to the operator. This radar, the FAAR, was taken into the field with a Gama Goat and set up behind the lines. Information was passed to the Chaparral via a data link. Likewise, the UK's Rapier system included a simple radar that displayed the rough direction of a target on a <b>series</b> of <b>lamps</b> arranged in a circle. The missile operator would point his telescope in that rough direction and then hunt for the target visually.|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} account of how failure can lead to success. Through my attempts to design a chair, I developed a method of bending plywood using Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) routing. Ultimately, I considered my chair a failure. The method I had developed to wood was not suitable for my chair because it left the material too flexible. Determined to find another application for my wood bending method, I applied it to a new <b>series</b> of <b>lamps.</b> Bending thin plywood with a similar cut pattern on the CNC Laser cutter gave the perfect balance of flexibility and strength for lamp shades. Simple as the new lamps may be, they leave numerous possibilities for development in scale and shape...|$|R

50|$|The items {{produced}} by replica furniture companies are typically produced to the same, or very similar, designs {{as the original}} products. Sometimes there will be differences with materials and dimensions.

This is usually because many replica companies are solely online businesses, hence do not pay showroom costs and many also manufacture their furniture abroad.
