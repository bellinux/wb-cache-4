30|$|The {{conclusions}} about efficiency {{depend on the}} choice of outputs included in the analysis. For instance, enlarging the set of species for which habitat areas are calculated would most probably increase the efficiency of <b>silvicultural</b> <b>systems</b> which allow both even-aged and uneven-aged management, especially if the weights of the outputs are constrained to reflect the importance of outputs. Tikkanen et al. (2007) presented habitat suitability models for 27 red-listed saproxylic boreal species, of which 7 prefer warm and sunny sites and 11 prefer moist and shady environments (the remaining 9 species being indifferent). Therefore, creation of habitats for many species calls for diversified forest management, which {{can be obtained by}} using a mixture of different <b>silvicultural</b> <b>systems</b> (Boncina 2011).|$|R
50|$|Clearcutting with {{reserves}} is {{a variation}} of the clearcutting <b>silvicultural</b> <b>system</b> in which trees are retained, either uniformly or in small groups, for purposes other than regeneration.

50|$|The term stand {{conversion}} {{refers to}} a change from one <b>silvicultural</b> <b>system</b> to another and includes species conversion, i.e., a change from one species (or set of species) to another. Such change can be effected intentionally by various silvicultural means, or incidentally by default e.g., when high-grading has removed the coniferous content from a mixedwood stand, which then becomes exclusively self-perpetuating aspen. In general, such sites as {{these are the most}} likely to be considered for conversion.|$|E

5000|$|Continuous cover {{forestry}} (commonly {{referred to}} as [...] "CCF") is an approach to the sustainable management of forests whereby forest stands are maintained in a permanently irregular structure, which is created and sustained through the selection and harvesting of individual trees. The term [...] "continuous cover forestry" [...] does not equate exactly to any one particular <b>silvicultural</b> <b>system,</b> but is typified by selection systems. For example coppice with standards and Reiniger's Target diameter harvesting are also continuous cover forestry. Different existing forest stands may require different silvicultural interventions to achieve a continuously productive irregular structure.|$|E
50|$|Shelterwood cutting {{refers to}} the {{progression}} of forest cuttings leading {{to the establishment of}} a new generation of seedlings of a particular species or group of species without planting. This <b>silvicultural</b> <b>system</b> is normally implemented in forests that are considered mature, often after several thinnings. The desired species are usually long-lived and their seedlings would naturally tend to start under partial shade. The shelterwood system gives enough light for the desired species to establish without giving enough light for the weeds that are adapted to full sun. Once the desired species is established, subsequent cuttings give the new seedlings more light and the growing space is fully passed to the new generation.|$|E
50|$|Selection cutting or {{systems are}} {{generally}} considered to be more challenging to implement and maintain than even-aged silviculture, due to the difficulty of managing multiple age classes in a shared space, but there are significant ecological benefits associated with it. Uneven-aged stands generally exhibit higher levels of vertical structure (key for many species of birds and mammals), have higher levels of carbon sequestration, and produce a more constant flow of market and non-market forest resources than even-aged stands.. Although a forest composed of many stands with varied maturity ages maybe comparable, this would be at the forest rather than the stand level. This silvicultural method also protects forest soils from the adverse effects of many types of even-aged silviculture, including nutrient loss, erosion and soil compaction and the rapid loss of organic material from a forested system. Selection silviculture is especially adept at regenerating shade-tolerant species of trees (those able to function under conditions of low solar energy, both cooler and less light), but can also be modified to suit the regeneration and growth of intolerant and mid-tolerant species. This is one of many different ways of harvesting trees. Selection cutting as a <b>silvicultural</b> <b>system</b> can be modified in many ways and would be so done be a forester to take into account varied ownership goals, local site conditions and the species mix found from past forest conditions.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} different <b>silvicultural</b> <b>systems</b> for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)

This was done using the forest genetics, ecology, management and wind model (ForGEM-W), which combines a distant dependent tree growth simulator with a mechanical¿empirical wind damage module. Six different <b>silvicultural</b> <b>systems</b> were evaluated: normal yield table management, free thinning from above in a monospecies and a mixed stand (50 per cent mixture of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.)), uneven-aged system, no thinning regime with low initial stand density of Douglas-fir with and without admixture of beech. <b>Silvicultural</b> <b>systems</b> leading to low height¿diameter (h/d) ratios were most successful in avoiding damage. Low h/d ratios were obtained in the system with low stand density and no thinning and in the uneven-aged system by systematically removing trees with the highest ratios during thinning. In particular, the uneven-aged system combined a high timber production with low risk. The use of Douglas-fir¿beech mixtures changed the competition pressure on Douglas-fir, and thus the h/d ratio and the wind risk. Results from this study indicate that the current trend towards more nature-oriented management could lead to lower wind risks and even to an increase in overall productivity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUneven-aged {{management}} of conifer plantations is proposed {{as a way}} to increase the value of these forests for the conservation of bird diversity. To test this assumption, we compared the impact of four common silvicultural systems on bird communities, defined by cutblock size (large in even-aged silvicultural systems/smaller in uneven-aged silvicultural systems) and tree species composition (spruce/beech) in the Belgian Ardenne where beech forests have been replaced by spruce plantations. The abundances of bird species were surveyed in young, medium-aged and mature stands in 3 – 5 forests per <b>silvicultural</b> <b>system</b> (66 plots in all). The effect of silvicultural systems on bird species richness, abundance and composition were analysed both at the plot and at the <b>silvicultural</b> <b>system</b> levels. In plots of a given age, beech stands were richer in species. The composition of bird species at the plot level was explained by stand age and tree composition, but weakly so by stand evenness. For the silvicultural systems, bird species richness was significantly higher in even-aged and in beech forests, and bird species composition depended on the <b>silvicultural</b> <b>system.</b> This study emphasises the importance of maintaining native beech stands for birds and suggests that uneven-aged {{management of}} conifer plantations does not provide a valuable improvement of bird diversity comparatively with even-aged systems...|$|E

40|$|Silviculture to {{maintain}} old-growth forest attributes {{appears to be}} an oxymoron since the late developmental phases of forest dynamics, described by the term old-growth, represent forests that have not experienced human intervention or timber removal for a long time. In the past, <b>silvicultural</b> <b>systems</b> applied to old-growth aimed to convert it into simplified, more productive regrowth forests substantially different in structure and composition. Now it is recognised that the maintenance of biodiversity associated with structural and functional complexity of late forest development successional stages cannot rely solely on old-growth forests in reserves. Therefore, in managed forests, <b>silvicultural</b> <b>systems</b> able to develop or maintain old-growth forest attributes are being sought. The degree to which oldgrowth attributes are maintained or developed is called ‘‘old-growthness’’. In this paper, we discuss silvicultural approaches that promote or maintain structural attributes of old-growth forests at the forest stand level in (a) current old-growth forests managed for timber production to retain structural elements, (b) current old-growth forests requiring regular, minor disturbances {{to maintain}} their structure, and (c) regrowth and secondary forests to restore old-growth structural attributes. While the functions of different elements of forest structure, such as coarse woody debris, large veteran trees, etc., have been described in principle, our knowledge about the quantity and distribution, in time and space, of these elements required to meet certain management objectives is rather limited formost ecosystems. The risks and operational constraints associated with managing for structural attributes create further complexity, which cannot be addressed adequately through the use of traditional <b>silvicultural</b> approaches. <b>Silvicultural</b> <b>systems</b> used in the retention and restoration of old-growthness can, and need, to employ a variety of approaches for managing spatial and temporal structural complexity. We present examples of silvicultural options that have been applied in creative experiments and forestry practice over the last two decades. However, these largely comprise only short-term responses, which are often accompanied by increased risks and disturbance. Much research and monitoring is required still to develop and optimise new <b>silvicultural</b> <b>systems</b> for old-growthness {{for a wide variety of}} forest ecosystem types...|$|R
