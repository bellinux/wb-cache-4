50|$|The <b>spot-breasted</b> <b>ibis</b> is {{most closely}} related to the four other members of the genus Bostrychia, olive ibis, São Tomé ibis, hadada ibis and wattled ibis, which are also all {{restricted}} to sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, the <b>spot-breasted</b> <b>ibis</b> is {{closely related to}} the olive ibis and São Tomé ibis, and these three species are sometimes placed into their own genus, Lampribis. There are no recognized subspecies of the <b>spot-breasted</b> <b>ibis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The call of {{the olive}} ibis also sounds harsh but measured, unlike the {{clamorous}} three-syllable shrieking of the Hadada ibis. [...] The {{call of the}} <b>spot-breasted</b> <b>ibis</b> lacks the honking timbre of that of the olive ibis and the olive ibis does not emphasise the second note of its call as does the <b>spot-breasted</b> <b>ibis.</b> The pattern of the call is therefore a more reliable feature than superficial appearance by which to distinguish the olive ibis and spo-breasted ibis in the field.|$|E

50|$|The <b>spot-breasted</b> <b>ibis</b> (Bostrychia rara) is {{a species}} of bird {{and is a member}} of the order Pelecaniformes and the family Threskiornithidae. It is a wading bird which lives is swampy forested areas and is found in {{tropical}} regions. Its preference for dense rainforests in tropical Africa means that it is seldom seen and is vulnerable to deforestation.|$|E
50|$|Spot-breasted ibises are {{omnivorous}} {{and feed}} on some plant material, along with various small crustaceans and insects. Invertebrates consumed include grubs, worms, aquatic snails, larvae {{and a variety}} of beetles. Usually diurnal, although they occasionally feed at night by moonlight. Away from roosting sites, most individuals feed alone or in pairs. Like other ibises, the <b>spot-breasted</b> <b>ibis</b> probes through the mud in swamps and along banks of forest rivers and streams.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{many other}} {{birds in the}} Guineo-Congolian region the <b>spot-breasted</b> <b>ibis</b> is subject to habitat loss and fragmentation. Deforestation has {{destroyed}} much of the dense rain forest these birds prefer. [...] Hunters have also had {{a negative impact on}} the success of this species. The database entry includes justification for why this species is Least Concern. For example, fishermen are known to take nestlings. Nonetheless, the species is considered not globally threatened.|$|E
50|$|The olive ibis has a {{distinctive}} brown crest which is purple near {{the neck and}} clearly distinguishes it at close range from the similar Hadada and spot-breasted ibises. The purple is more extensive {{on the crest of}} rothschildi. This crest is not usually seen in flight because of the flying ibis’s extended neck. The olive ibis and <b>spot-breasted</b> <b>ibis</b> are reportedly impossible to distinguish superficially in the field, but the akeleyorum subspecies appears heavier than the Hadada ibis and has a thicker neck.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spot-breasted</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is found}} in Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda. Although it is found across {{a wide range of}} {{territory}} is it not common and considered to be rare. In the areas where it is found it is a resident of that area, this means as a species they do not migrate and they live there all year long. Its habitat is in wooded swamps or forested areas near streams.|$|E
50|$|The nests of the <b>spot-breasted</b> <b>ibis</b> {{are usually}} found about on tree {{branches}} one to six meters above ground or water. They are solitary nesters and generally lay two eggs at a time. Reproduction occurs throughout the year, except during long dry seasons when water levels are too low. For example, in Gabon birds laid in all months except July and August, with peaks in March-May and September-December. The peaks {{corresponded to the}} local rainy seasons. Incubation takes about 20 days. Chicks are independent about forty days after hatch. As with other ibises, chicks are semi-altricial; they are born with blackish-brown down that is replaced at six days by thicker white down.|$|E
5000|$|Ibises {{are known}} to have a rounded body with long legs and a long S-shaped neck. There are 30 {{different}} species worldwide and they all show variations on the same body form. [...] Some are crested and some are bald behind their heads.The <b>spot-breasted</b> <b>ibis,</b> like other ibises, has long legs and a long bill. [...] They also have a crest at the back of their head. Unlike other ibises they have a short neck. Their wing length is 270-290 mm, their bill length is 115-130 mm and their tarsus length is 56-65 mm. Their plumage varies but appears to be most commonly brownish - blue. A small, dark ibis, the best distinguishing feature is suggested by its name; the buff-spotted neck and breast is diagnostic. Otherwise, the upperparts are uniformly dark, with blue skin surrounding the eyes (smaller in females). Flying birds can be distinguished by their broad wings and short tail. The juvenile is duller, and has a shorter crest.|$|E
