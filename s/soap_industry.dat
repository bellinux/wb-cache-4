5|$|After {{the city}} was {{captured}} by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into the British Mandate of Palestine in 1922. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, {{the city was}} captured and occupied by Transjordan, which subsequently annexed it unilaterally, until its occupation by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities. Since 1995, {{the city has been}} governed by the Palestinian National Authority. In the Old City, {{there are a number of}} sites of archaeological significance, spanning the 1st to 15th centuries. Culturally, the city is known for its kanafeh, a popular sweet throughout the Middle East, and its <b>soap</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus {{factory that}} {{produces}} refined vegetable oils, especially olive oil, and vegetable butter {{from the factory}} is exported to Jordan. The al-Huda Textiles factory is also located in Nablus. In 2000, the factory produced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production plummeted to 150–200 pieces daily in 2002. Al-Huda mainly imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel. There are eight restaurants {{in the city and}} four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. Nablus' once thriving <b>soap</b> <b>industry</b> has been largely isolated due to difficult transportation conditions stemming from West Bank closures and IDF incursions. Today, there are only two soap factories still operating in the city.|$|E
500|$|The <b>soap</b> <b>industry</b> in Nablus {{began to}} decline in the mid-20th century, caused in part by natural disasters, {{especially}} a 1927 earthquake which destroyed much of the Old City of Nablus, and in part by Israeli military occupation. Israeli military raids during the Second Intifada destroyed several soap factories in the historic quarter of Nablus. Several soap factories remain in Nablus; currently, products are sold primarily in Palestine and the Arab countries, with some fair-trade exports to Europe and beyond.

2500|$|An early 20th century {{industry}} manual {{states that}} while the opium poppy was grown extensively in Eurasia, {{most of the world}} production of poppyseed oil occurred in France and Germany, from poppy seeds imported from other countries. [...] From 1900 to 1911, France and Germany together produced on the order of 60,000,000 kilograms per year. [...] At that time, poppyseed oil was used primarily to dress salads and frequently was adulterated with sesame oil and hazelnut oil to improve the taste of oil from stored (rancid) seeds. [...] Poppyseed oil was used to adulterate olive oil and peach kernel oil. [...] Poor quality poppyseed oil was valuable in the <b>soap</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

[...] As the name implies, the registered office, along with a smaller manufactury at Botany, was at Sydney, {{the capital city of}} the colony, but the biggest works by far were at Tighes Hill, Newcastle. Probably their most famous product, one which stood the test of time, was Siren soap, which was later renamed Velvet. It was still being marketed in N.S.W., by Unilever {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century. Many argued that it was superior to Lever Bros famous Sunlight soap.|$|E

2500|$|The Hubbard House {{was built}} {{the year after}} Elbert was born when the Hubbards moved to Hudson, north of Bloomington. The Hubbards first {{occupied}} a farm house {{on the outskirts of}} Hudson but occupied the east portion of the Hubbard House, in town, by the next year. Elbert grew up in the house and attended school in the small village of Hudson. Later on in his life his writing would contain many scenes drawn from his boyhood experiences there. Around 1872, at the age of 16, Elbert Hubbard left Hudson for Buffalo and a job as a partner in a soap company where he earned a [...] "modest fortune." [...] The same year the additional west portion of the house was constructed. It was in 1892 that Hubbard suddenly gave up the <b>soap</b> <b>industry</b> and decided to become a writer. In 1899 Hubbard published the famous and widely reprinted essay, [...] "A Message to Garcia," [...] by 1913 an estimated 40 million copies had been published.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{an amusing}} and I think a fair {{comment on the}} {{arguments}} of Mr. Lever that {{a year or so}} ago he was actually concerned--no doubt in the interests of the public as well as his own--in organizing the production and distribution of soap so as to economize the waste and avoid the public disservice due to the extreme competition of the soap dealers. He wanted to do in the <b>soap</b> <b>industry</b> just exactly what Socialism wants to do in the case of all public services, that is to say he wanted to give it the economic advantages of a Great Combine. In some directions the saving to the soap interest would have been immense; all the vast expenditure upon newspaper advertisements, for example, all the waste upon competing travellers would have been saved. Whether the public would have benefited greatly or not is beside the present question; Mr. Lever and other great soap proprietors would certainly have benefited enormously. They would have benefited by working as a collective interest instead of as independent private owners. But in this little experiment in what was really a sort of voluntary Socialism for particular ends, Mr. Lever reckoned without another great system of private adventurers, the halfpenny newspaper proprietors, who had hitherto been drawing large sums from soap advertisement, and who had in fact been so far parasitic on the public soap supply. One group of these papers at once began a campaign against the [...] "Soap Trust," [...] a campaign almost as noisy and untruthful as the anti-Socialist campaign. They accused Mr. Lever of nearly every sort of cheating that can be done by a soap seller, and anticipated every sort of oppression a private monopolist can practise. In the end they paid unprecedented damages for libel, but they stopped Mr. Lever's intelligent and desirable endeavours to replace the waste and disorder of our existing soap supply by a simple and more efficient organization. Mr. Lever cannot have forgotten these facts; they were surely in the back of his mind when he wrote his [...] "Socialism and Business" [...] paper, and it is a curious instance of the unconscious limitations one may encounter in a mind of exceptional ability that he could not bring them forward and apply them to the problem in hand.|$|E

He proceeded to use the knowledge he had obtained during his travels and quickly buillt a reputation for skill and reliability. The factory initially produced tools and implements for agriculture and construction. During the industrial revolution production was diversified to wind mills, trains and steam engines.

40|$|Abstract: The {{measurement}} of various parameters such as viscosity, density, temperature, bulk modulus of {{materials that are}} undergoing rhealogical changes is important for process control {{in most of the}} industrial processes. Ultrasonic NDE methods have been employed here to make measurements of these properties under potentially difficult industrial processes. The key ultrasonic parameters that are measured include velocity, attenuation, and reflection-factor of both the shear and longitudinal waves. Several aspects such as temperature gradients, properties gradients, etc., will influence the accuracy of these reading. In this research work, two prototype devices have been constructed and tested. This includes (a) an ultrasonic interferometer, and (b) a rhealogy cell. Probes to implement the above techniques were fabricated and experiments were conducted to measure the density, viscosity, and bulk modulus of liquids. Glycerin-water mixtures were used as the test material. The application of these techniques may be extended to industrial needs of high temperature process such as glass, metal forming and normal temperature applications such as lubrication oil and <b>soap</b> <b>industries.</b> Introduction: Density, Adiabatic bulk modulus and Viscosity form a set of important mechanical properties of liquids, especially when they are varying transiently as encountered during man...|$|R
