40|$|We {{undertook}} a prospective {{controlled clinical trial}} of 109 patients to determine whether postoperative blood salvage in patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty decreased the need for transfusion with banked blood. The average amount of blood collected in our series was 493 ml, most of which was collected {{in the first four}} postoperative hours. In patients undergoing bilateral total knee arthroplasty, there was a 54 % reduction in banked blood utifisation. None of our patients developed adverse effects from the reinfused material. The cost of collecting and processing wound drainage using the Haemolite cell washer was $ 175 per patient, regardless of the volume processed, compared to $ 125 for a unit of banked blood. By reducing the requirement for homologous transfusion, blood salvage diminishes the risks of transmission of HIV and hepatitis viruses. In those cases where the equivalent of two units of blood are reinfused, blood <b>salvage</b> saves <b>money.</b> However, due to the small amounts of blood collected in unilateral hip or knee arthroplasty, we do not recommend its routine application in these cases. The risks ofhomologous blood transfusion, which include the transmission of HIV and hepatitis viruses, have led to an increased interest in autologous transfusion and blood salvage techniques. Intra-operative autotransfu-sion is widely used in cardiac, vascular, and orthopaedi...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] In what {{direction}} will all these pressures—the Reagan challenge, employer hostility, and rank-and-file sentiment for a fight—push trade union leadership? One road—a few simple {{steps from the}} Mall site of September 2 ̆ 7 s impressive Solidarity Day rally—leads east to Capitol Hill, {{to a position of}} renewed strength and influence in the Democratic Party and in Congress. From there, the route is familiar: save the Davis-Bacon Act, fight tight <b>money,</b> <b>salvage</b> social programs without cutting military spending, and elect the likes of Walter Mondale, Ted Kennedy, or John Glenn as President in 1984. Another road leads north and west and south, toward a position of real strength in poor, working-class, and middle-class neighborhoods around the country. The same alliance of labor, minority, and community forces that built Solidarity Day can turn that single event into an enduring movement for political action at the grassroots level...|$|R
5000|$|On 1 June 1773, Plettenberg {{presided over}} a platoon of 30 {{soldiers}} charged {{with the task of}} <b>salvaging</b> goods and <b>money</b> from the De Jonge Thomas wrecked in a storm in Table Bay. During the salvage operation, the father of one of the soldiers, Wolraad Woltemade heroically rescued men from the ship, unaided by the soldiers. The French-influenced Patriotic Movement ("Patriotte beweging") became a strong opposition to him.
