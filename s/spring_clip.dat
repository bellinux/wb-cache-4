2500|$|Although {{the general}} {{arrangement}} of the aircraft was conventional for the time, being a pusher biplane with a front-mounted elevator and a rear-mounted horizontal stabiliser and rudder, it {{had a number of}} extremely unorthodox constructional details. [...] The most obvious was the construction of the wings, which had a single spar forming the leading edges of the wings which was an exposed warren truss of a type designed and patented by Fabre. [...] The ribs were cantilevered from this spar, each rib being enclosed in a pocket in the covering, which was laced to the leading edge and attached to the trailing edge end of each rib by a <b>spring</b> <b>clip.</b> [...] The other flying surfaces were similar. [...] The wings were connected by four single interplane struts, the central pair attached to booms (also Fabre girders) bearing the forward-mounted elevator and a rear-mounted rudder mounted in front of an adjustable horizontal stabilising surface. [...] The aluminium-covered nacelle, in which the pilot and passenger were seated side by side) in front of the [...] Gnome Omega rotary engine, was suspended between the wings by steel cables which were attached {{to the ends of the}} central pair of interplane struts. [...] The undercarriage consisted of a pair of long skids mounted on extensions of the inner interplane struts and connected to the forward extremities of the fuselage booms, each bearing a pair of wheels on a short axle. A tailskid which could be moved by the pilot to act as a brake was carried on the lower end of the rudder mounting.|$|E

5000|$|The grip/trigger housing {{assembly}} {{is held in}} place with a rather fragile leaf <b>spring</b> <b>clip</b> instead of the captive pins used in other designs. The <b>spring</b> <b>clip</b> {{has been known to}} be prone to breakage since the first trials at Aberdeen Proving Ground. Duct tape and cable ties have been seen on M60s in the field, placed there by their crews in case the <b>spring</b> <b>clip</b> breaks.

A second sear notch was eventually added to the operating rod to reduce the chance of this happening.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of agronomic practices on forage production and chemical composition of grass-legume pasture mixture was {{studied at the}} Utah State University Dairy Farm, North Logan, Utah, during spring and summer, 1970. The soil is a well-drained Millville silt loam that has about a 1 percent slope. It is high in potash, phosphorus, and lime, having a pH of 7. 9. Analysis of the clipping management showed that the early <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> decreased the yield of forage. The losses in total yield due to <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> were approximately {{four to five times}} the yields received in early <b>spring</b> <b>clipping.</b> The grasses were affected more than the legumes. The yields of dry forage increased with the increase in fertilizer rates from 0 through 300 pounds of nitrogen per acre. There was no advantage to splitting the nitrogen fertilizer of 300 pounds per acre into three applications. Most of the effects of spring clipp 1 ng and nitrogen fertilization were re fleeted in the first summer harvest. The plots fertilized with nitrogen produced a higher yield and nitrate content than the check plots. Legumes were higher in nitrate on the unfertilized plots than the grasses, but lower on the fertilized plots...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the influence of cutting treatments on the yield and quality of non-irrigated alfalfa in western Oregon. <b>Spring</b> <b>clipping</b> treatments included (1) not clipped, (2) clipped when 6 inches high and (3) clipped when 12 inches high. The hay harvest criteria were (1) near full light interception by the vegetative canopy, (2) crown bud stage and (3) one-tenth bloom stage. Combinations of these criteria included first hay harvest based on light interception followed by either of the other criteria at subsequent harvests, and first harvest based on crown bud development in combination with one-tenth bloom criterion for subsequent harvest. Two alfalfa varieties, Vernal and Du Puits, were subjected {{to each of the}} 18 treatments (6 x 3 in all combinations). Results of one growing season indicated that the influence of <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> was not reflected in yield of dry matter (hay) except at the relatively small third harvest when <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> showed a deleterious effect. The yields obtained by the <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> were sufficient to offset the reduction at the third hay harvest. It was observed that the total yields for the season did not differ. Cutting at the one-tenth bloom stage showed an advantage in yield but with a greatly reduced crude protein percentage. Cutting on the basis of nearly complete light interception resulted in harvest at an immature stage in early May and at a very mature stage in late season. Highest yields, with leafiness and crude protein suitable for high quality hay, were obtained by cutting at the crown bud stage throughout the season, or by taking the first harvest on the basis of light interception and subsequent harvests on the basis of either crown buds or one-tenth bloom. The varieties produced approximately the same total for the season. Vernal was slightly leafier than Du Puits at the second and third hay harvests. A highly significant negative correlation was found between yield of dry matter and percentage protein and between yield of dry matter and leaf-stem ratio. The correlation between percentage protein and leaf-stem ratio was significant and positive...|$|R

50|$|The oldest type {{of master}} link, {{available}} for decades, has two pins {{connected to the}} same plate. (Refer to Figure 1). It has been in use mainly in single-speed, hub-geared, or other bicycle drivetrain systems with straight chainlines or widely spaced sprockets. In this assembly, the outside plate with the two pins protruding from it are spaced at the same pitch as the chain, one half-inch, and the free ends of the pins are grooved. The other plate fits over {{the ends of the}} pins and is secured with a <b>spring</b> <b>clip</b> to make the connection, and this type of master link comes closest to being re-usable.|$|E
5000|$|A {{crocodile}} clip (also alligator clip or <b>spring</b> <b>clip)</b> is a sprung metal clip with long, serrated jaws {{which is used}} for creating a temporary electrical connection. This simple mechanical device gets {{its name from the}} resemblance of its jaws to that of an alligator's or crocodile's. It is used to connect an electrical cable to a battery or some other component. Functioning much like a spring-loaded clothespin, the clip's tapered, serrated jaws are forced together by a spring to grip an object. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~4 mm female banana jack, enabling quick non-permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another electrical circuit. The clip is typically covered by a plastic shroud or [...] "boot" [...] to prevent accidental short-circuits.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the work}} of {{maintaining}} the track was at the joints, especially as the stiff rails became dipped, and the joint sleepers took a hammering. Pre-war experiments with long welded rail lengths were built upon, and in the years from 1960 long rail lengths were installed, at first on hardwood sleepers but soon on concrete sleepers. For example, the first long welded rail (almost 1 mi) on the UK's East Coast Main Line was laid in 1957, just south of Carlton-on-Trent, resting on rubber pads to resist rail creep. In this pioneering stage, some catastrophic mistakes in detailed design were made, but from about 1968 continuous welded rail became a reliable standard for universal installation on main and secondary routes. The form adopted used pre-stressed concrete sleepers and a 110A rail section - a slight improvement on the 109 rails previously used - the A was to distinguish it from the British Standard 110 lb/yd rail section, which was unsuitable. Rail fastenings eventually converged onto a proprietary <b>spring</b> <b>clip</b> made by the Pandrol company which was the exclusive form of fastening in Britain for about 30 years.|$|E
