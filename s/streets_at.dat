5|$|Business US Highway 23 (Bus. US23) was a {{business}} loop through downtown Bay City. It started {{at the intersection of}} where US23 turned off Broadway Street westward onto Lafayette Avenue. From this point, Bus. US23 ran east on Lafayette Avenue for two blocks and then turned northward onto Garfield Avenue, running parallel to, but inland from, the Saginaw River into downtown Bay City. As it approached downtown, the business loop jogged off Garfield onto Washington Avenue. At the intersection with 7th Street, Bus. US23 turned westward to cross the Saginaw River. On the opposite side, the business loop followed Jenny Street westbound and Thomas Street eastbound along a one-way pairing of <b>streets.</b> <b>At</b> the intersection with US23 (Euclid Avenue), the business loop terminated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, NY31 was rerouted west {{of what is}} now NY429 to follow Ridge Road to Lewiston, where it ended at then-NY34. The former routing of NY31 into {{downtown}} Niagara Falls was redesignated as NY31A. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY31 was realigned east of Oneida Valley to continue east to Utica by way of its modern alignment plus Spring and Lowell Roads and several city <b>streets.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, NY3 was realigned to continue west to Niagara Falls over modern NY31, overlapping NY31A west of Sanborn. Two other portions of NY3—from the modern junction of NY31 and NY77 east of Lockport to Gasport and between Middleport and Medina—were also realigned at this time to use modern NY31 and the old routing of legislative Route30 Spur along modern NY31E, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Returning to a {{previous}} setting offered the artists new {{challenges and opportunities}} to expand {{the scope of the}} city. Having the player walk through the <b>streets</b> <b>at</b> night inspired a film noir ambiance. Color shifts and a high degree of contrast pushed the game's look beyond what previous Halo games had offered, but the team had to make sure that even dark portions of the city were playable. The entire core development team looked at commissioned concept paintings to decide how lighting schemes would affect the gameplay. The genre also influenced the character names and archetypes. The player character, for example, fits the concept of a lone, hardboiled detective. To increase the depth of the surroundings, Bungie added touches such as advertisements, trash collectors, and civilian versions of previously seen military hardware.|$|E

Among the many shops are two large modern supermarkets, both in Edith Walk, formerly a steep and unmade lane that served the rear entrances of the shops in Church Street. Most of the traditional high street shops such as butchers, bakers, grocers etc., are now health food shops, art and craft shops, charity shops, law firms, and estate agents.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav {{remained}} well offshore, the difference in pressure between it and a high pressure area over the central United States caused strong winds in areas of New Jersey on September 11. Wind gusts ranged from 35–45mph (55–70km/h), with stronger winds reported near the coast. A maximum wind gust of 60mph (100km/h) was reported at Keansburg. The strong winds downed trees and power lines throughout {{the eastern half of}} the state, damaging homes and blocking <b>streets.</b> <b>At</b> least 14,000 homes in the vicinity of Burlington and Ocean Counties were left without power. In West Windsor Township, a man was killed when the upper section of a concrete wall he was working on blew over and crushed him. The other death occurred in West Amwell Township, where a tree limb fell on two elderly women, killing one and injuring the other. Elsewhere, while there were reports of trees falling on vehicles, no other serious injuries or deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|North of Artesia Boulevard, {{the rail}} line descends into the 10-mile (16km) Mid-Corridor Trench, with two streets {{straddling}} it at ground level: Alameda Street {{to the west}} and a local frontage road to the east. All cross streets are thus grade-separated from the rail line while intersecting the <b>streets</b> <b>at</b> grade, except for Rosecrans Avenue, which bridges over all three. Crossings along this segment include the Century Freeway (I-105, no access), Imperial Highway, Firestone Boulevard (former SR 42), and Slauson Avenue. Just south of 25th Street, the rail line curves northeast out of the trench, and the two roadways join to become a single Alameda Street, which soon interchanges with the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10), {{at the north end of}} what is legislated as Route 47. The street continues north through the east side of downtown Los Angeles, crossing the Santa Ana Freeway (US 101) just west of Union Station, and ending soon after at Elmyra Street, where it becomes Spring Street.|$|E

5|$|The {{western end}} of NY33 has been located in {{downtown}} Buffalo since 1930; however, {{the exact location of}} its terminus has varied over time. In the mid-1970s, the northbound and southbound directions of NY5 were split and rerouted to follow a series of streets through downtown Buffalo. Northbound NY5 left the southbound direction {{at the north end of}} the Skyway and followed Church, South Division, Ellicott, and Chippewa Streets around downtown to Main Street, where both directions converged and continued north on Main Street. As a result, NY33 was truncated eastward to the junction of Genesee and Ellicott <b>Streets.</b> <b>At</b> some point between 1979 and 1985, a pair of ramps were constructed between the west end of the Kensington Expressway and Oak and Elm Streets, a pre-existing one-way couplet one block to the west of Michigan Avenue. NY33 initially followed the new ramps to Genesee Street; however, the route was altered in the latter half of the 1980s to connect to Ellicott Street (by this point part of NY5 north) by way of Goodell and East Tupper Streets, another pre-existing one-way couplet.|$|E
