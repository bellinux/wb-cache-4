30|$|Transnational companies, {{operating}} in extremely competitive global markets, always seek to lower different operating costs, such as inventory holding costs in their intra- supply chain system. This paper incorporates a cost reducing product distribution policy into an intra-supply chain system with multiple <b>sales</b> <b>locations</b> and quality assurance studied by [Chiu et al., Expert Syst Appl, 40 : 2669 – 2676, (2013)]. Under the proposed cost reducing distribution policy, an added initial delivery of end items is distributed to multiple <b>sales</b> <b>locations</b> {{to meet their}} demand during the production unit’s uptime and rework time. After rework when the remaining production lot goes through quality assurance, n fixed quantity installments of finished items are then transported to <b>sales</b> <b>locations</b> at a fixed time interval. Mathematical modeling and optimization techniques are used to derive closed-form optimal operating policies for the proposed system. Furthermore, the study demonstrates significant savings in stock holding costs for both the production unit and <b>sales</b> <b>locations.</b> Alternative of outsourcing product delivery task to an external distributor is analyzed to assist managerial decision making in potential outsourcing issues {{in order to facilitate}} further reduction in operating costs.|$|R

5000|$|Data is {{collected}} on recent sales of properties {{similar to the}} subject being valued, called [...] "comparables". Only SOLD properties {{may be used in}} an appraisal and determination of a property's value, as they represent amounts actually paid or agreed upon for properties. Sources of comparable data include real estate publications, public records, buyers, sellers, real estate brokers and/or agents, appraisers, and so on. Important details of each comparable sale are described in the appraisal report. Since comparable sales are not identical to the subject property, adjustments may be made for date of <b>sale,</b> <b>location,</b> style, amenities, square footage, site size, etc. The main idea is to simulate the price that would have been paid if each comparable sale were identical to the subject property. If the comparable is superior to the subject in a factor or aspect, then a downward adjustment is needed for that factor. Likewise, if the comparable is inferior to the subject in an aspect, then an upward adjustment for that aspect is needed. The adjustment is somewhat subjective and relies on the appraiser's training and experience. From the analysis of the group of adjusted sales prices of the comparable sales, the appraiser selects an indicator of value that is representative of the subject property. It is possible for various appraisers to choose a different indicator of value which ultimately will provide different property value.|$|E

40|$|Bulls are an {{important}} investment for commercial beef cattle producers since, over time, bulls introduce {{most of the new}} genetic attributes into typical beef cow herds. Therefore, heritable bull traits determine bull prices. Bulls possess a large number of traits to consider in pricing. In recent years, new measures of both qualities have been introduced in the form of expected progeny differences (EPDs). This study estimates market values associated with specific bull attributes, recently introduced EPDs, and bull sale marketing efforts. Important bull price determinants include bull color, polled, conformation, muscling, disposition, age, birth weight, weaning weight, milk EPD, birth and weaning weight EPDs, <b>sale</b> <b>location,</b> order bull was sold, whether the bull had a picture in the sale catalog, and whether a percentage of semen rights were retained by the seller.

40|$|Natural gas and {{petroleum}} are non-renewable and scarce energy sources. Although, it is {{well known}} that hydrocarbon reserves are depleting through the years, oil and gas remain the principal source of energy upon which our society is strongly dependent. Hence, optimization and accurate planning of hydrocarbon production are the main keys to making it safer, more efficient, and cheaper. One of the tools commonly used to evaluate the optimization of oil/gas production system is the process simulation modeling. A hydrocarbon production system typically consists of at least one underground reservoir where several wells have been drilled into the hydrocarbon-bearing rock to form a fixed topology network. Wells are interconnected with manifolds to transport the gas or oil to a storage or <b>sale</b> <b>location.</b> The process simulation consists of calculating the total hydrocarbon production for the given production system. The pressure in the wellbore is the main variable in determining the hydrocarbon production process. When oil/gas is produced, the pressure decreases until production cannot be sustained. If the well is shut down, the pressure at the wellbore increases because of the natural gas flow coming from the reservoir. In addition, artificial lift techniques, such as water injection, gas lift and pump systems can be incorporated into the simulation program. The oil/gas production has been also modeled as a multi-period optimization case to incorporate the possibility of different demands, cost and overall time behavior. The current field optimization approaches take in account the availability in a general way, adding to the planning a lot of uncertainty. The proposed study includes a suitable analysis of the likelihood of equipment failure, which will predict the availability of the equipment in a certain period of time to perform a more accurate planning. In this work, we have integrated the availability analysis to the model described above. The availability of a system is analyzed by Monte Carlo simulation, which involves the modeling of the probabilities of failure, the type of failure, the time to repair associated with each failure, and time of occurrence for a field system. The availability model performed reduces significantly the uncertainties on a multi-period planning production of either oil or gas, predicting the probability of failure and the downtime related to the hydrocarbon production through its lifetime. In this study, the unavailability of the equipment was quantified, reporting a subsea equipment downtime of approximately 7 %. As a result, new production planning is accomplished in the effective work period, which will be beneficial in financial risk decisions such as a government?s deliverability contracts...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} the study is the {{merchant}} of cloisters in the Malang town square and Pamong Praja Police as the corrector. The correction has been done because of the merchant of cloisters were not discipline and make the Malang town square not comfortable and not save for the visitors. This make the government applied the policy by giving information and guidance to Market Department and Pamong Praja Police. The government determined that every merchant cloisters have to follow the procedures in the Region Law number 1 year 2000 about Control and Gudance of Merchant Cloisters in the Malang area and the decision of Cityman of Malang number 580 year 2000 about the Decision of Merchant of Cloisters’ Location in Malang. According to the law made by the Regional Government about control and guidance of merchant of cloisters, so in this case there are three statement of problems. First, the execution of control by the Pamong Praja Police, problems faced by the Pamong Praja Police in controling the merchant of cloisters, and the efforts of the execution of control done by Pamong Praja Police in Malang town square, because by knowing these problems so it can be define whether the control has been done based on the procedures applied by the government or not. Method used in this research is juridical sociology research in which the definition is based on the determination of ordinance and related to the law theory and the reality of the society at this time. From the observation on the field, the execution of control merchant of cloisters has been done everyday to create savety and comfort, while the information and guidance from the Market Department is based on the Regional Law of Malang and the Decision of Cityman of Malang. For the development of merchant of cloisters, Regional chief or pointed government has the responsibility to census and giving the information to the merchant of cloisters continously with two ways. There formal and non formal ways to develop merchant of cloisters so the government can manage the <b>sale</b> <b>location,</b> time, type, shop or accessories based on the Region Chief. The purpose of those is to make the visitor can enjoy and feel save. It can increase the region income (PAD/Pendapatan Asli Daerah) and develop the economy of society. Problems faced by the Pamong Praja Police are the limited personnel and facilities and it can decrease the Pamong Praja Police’s movement because they only controlling and processing by giving the tipiring trial for the merchant of cloisters who broke the law. To avoid that, Pamong Praja Police control the merchant of cloisters everyday. Pamong Praja Police got the permittion from Market Department and Paguyuban of society so Market Department has no longer authorithy to control the merchant of cloisters. In 1999, the government relocated merchant of cloisters in Malang town square to move to Jl. Kyai Tamin, Jl. Tendean, and Jl. Sultan Sahrir. Then in 2005, again the government relocated them to the Comboran market. So that is why the merchant of cloisters are not allowed in Malang town square and must be controlled by the Pamong Praja Police. The purpose is to make the town square beautiful and clea...|$|E
