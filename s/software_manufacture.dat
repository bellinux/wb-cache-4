40|$|Development {{processes}} in which software is integrated in hardware products are explored {{with the aim}} of finding obstacles to the development process and hypothesising how they can be dealt with. Empirical data are based on case studies in nine manufacturing companies chosen to have a varied amount of software in their products and experience of technology integration. Results indicate that obstacles in experienced companies concern processes, structures and resources but few culture-related issues. In companies with short experience of software integration in hardware development, cultural aspects were important. Where new technology played a strategic role in the product function, organisational issues such as structures, processes and cultural differences formed obstacles. Where technology only had a supporting role, resource-related obstacles such as lack of competencies were more important. Managerial measures tended to be partly related to the different types of obstacles, partly to the strategic situation of the company.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an applicative method {{for evaluating the}} global axis deformation of a sweep object caused by the manufacturing process with respect to its ideal CAD model. Object and CAD shapes are given in form of point clouds, the former derived from a laser-scanning measurement, the latter from sampling the original surface by a dense and uniform point grid. After an initial rigid registration, approximated centroidal axes of both shapes are extracted, compared and processed in order to evaluate macroscopical translation errors occurring in any scanned object's section. This method has been applied and tested {{to the analysis of}} a helical Darrieus blade prototype, parametrically designed and modelled with McNeel Rhinoceros and Grasshopper <b>software,</b> <b>manufactured</b> with a three-axes CNC machine and reinforced by a carbon fibre composite laminate. The point cloud obtained from the subsequent laser scanning has been processed and compared to the original NURBS model in order to build the global contour map of the mutual difference. The application of this procedure is able to check the conformity of the manufactured airfoil to the theoretical one and, therefore, to establish the efficiency of the final prototype of the blade turbine...|$|R
