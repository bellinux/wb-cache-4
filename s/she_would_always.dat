5|$|Vorazun {{had accused}} Zeratul of treasion against the Nerazim {{for his role}} in the death of her mother. Despite Artanis' protests {{regarding}} Raszagal's corruption by Kerrigan, she stated <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> hold Zeratul in contempt. It wasn't until following Zeratul's prophecy's that lead to Ulnar, she admitted that he was closer to the truth than anyone and after finally realizing that Zeratul's dedication to the Xel'naga prophecy's gave the protoss hope, she vowed to honor him with Artanis.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{precautions}} against further resistance, Darius sent {{soldiers to}} seize Intaphernes, {{along with his}} son, family members, relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves. Darius believed that Intaphernes was planning a rebellion, {{but when he was}} brought to the court, there was no proof of any such plan. Nonetheless, Darius killed Intaphernes's entire family, excluding his wife's brother and son. She was asked to choose between her brother and son. She chose her brother to live. Her reasoning for doing so was that she could have another husband and another son, but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> have but one brother. Darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother's and her son's life.|$|E
25|$|When Fenty {{announced}} {{his support of}} Bowser, some critics claimed that, if elected, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> vote as Fenty wished, ignoring the needs of her constituents.|$|E

60|$|Strangely enough, {{after this}} {{confession}} she felt far more sorry for poor Béla {{than she had}} done before, and she cried her eyes out {{both before and after}} the funeral because, do what <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> saw him before her as he was that last day of his life--quarrelsome, dictatorial, tyrannical--and she remembered how she had almost hated him for his bullying ways and compared him in her mind with Andor's kindness and chivalry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{title is}} drawn from this passage in the story: [...] "'He {{used to be so}} different. I don’t {{understand}} how a person can change so suddenly. It's just hell-heaven, the difference,' <b>she</b> <b>would</b> say, <b>always</b> using the English words for her self-concocted, backward metaphor." ...|$|R
25|$|With this {{commission}} Manon, the third trophy, {{slipped out of}} the room, as untouched as she had come; her errand didn't seem to trouble her. I was greatly relieved at the thought that nothing could touch her, that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> remain as she was and never become like her mother, the poisoner on the wall, the glassy, blubbery old woman on the sofa.|$|E
25|$|In November 2015, Windsor {{secretly}} filmed {{a return}} EastEnders, which {{was shown in}} January 2016. After this, {{it was confirmed that}} the character would be killed off later in the year. This was Windsor's decision, as she said that as long as Peggy was alive, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be drawn back to playing her. Her last appearance aired on BBC One on 17 May 2016.|$|E
25|$|In later stories, Lamia was cursed {{with the}} {{inability}} to close her eyes so that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> obsess over {{the image of her}} dead children. Some accounts (see Horace, below) say Hera forced Lamia to devour her own children. Myths variously describe Lamia's monstrous (occasionally serpentine) appearance as a result of either Hera's wrath, the pain of grief, the madness that drove her to murder, or—in some rare versions—a natural result of being Hecate's daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... [In broken tones.] Don't you {{understand}} that we could never respect ourselves again if we did that poor creature such a fearful wrong? <b>She</b> <b>would</b> be <b>always</b> between us with her tears and her sorrows. I tell you I couldn't bear it. Have mercy on me--if you love me at all.|$|R
60|$|Agatha fell in {{with the}} suggestion. It {{was a relief to}} talk, and she had a certain respect, which <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>always</b> admit, for her friend's shrewdness. She meant to go, but she desired to {{ascertain}} how a less interested person would regard the course that she had decided on.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I {{do believe}} that if the whole family are {{unanimous}} in scouting the very idea, she will give it up. She is proud of Mohun blood, and the Rotherwood connection and all, {{and if there were}} a desperate opposition---well, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be rather flattered, and give in; but I am not sure that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>always</b> regret it, and pine after what she might have had.' ...|$|R
25|$|Lamia was a {{queen of}} Libya, whom Zeus loved. Hera turned {{her into a}} monster and murdered their {{children}}. Or, alternatively, she killed Lamia's children and the grief turned her into a monster. Lamia was cursed with the inability to close her eyes so that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> obsess over {{the image of her}} dead children. Zeus gave her the gift {{to be able to take}} her eyes out to rest, and then put them back in. Lamia was envious of other mothers and ate their children.|$|E

500|$|McEntire {{possesses}} a contralto vocal range and performs [...] "vocal gymnastics" [...] with her voice, a musical technique {{in which a}} singer twirls a note around, using their vibrato. McEntire has often credited Dolly Parton for influencing this trait, stating that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> listen to Parton's records and find her style of vocal gymnastics [...] "so pretty".|$|E
60|$|At {{the foot}} of the tree was a pool of blood and a little trail of crimson drops upon the grass, leading away {{parallel}} with the shore of Jad-ben-lul. Then she had not slain him! She was vaguely aware of a peculiar, double sensation of relief and regret. Now <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>always</b> in doubt. He might return; but at least <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not have to live above his grave.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>always</b> <b>would</b> sit on {{that little}} stool. I think {{she must have}} had a kind of notion that it was a coaxing, wheedling little stool.|$|R

I've told her so all along, and I've begged her not to do it,--almost on my knees I have; but she wouldn't be said by me. <b>She</b> never <b>would.</b> <b>She's</b> <b>always</b> been that wilful that I'd sooner have her away from me than with me. Though she's a good young woman in the house,--she is, indeed, Mr Eames,--and there isn't a pair of hands in it that works so hard; {{but it was no}} use my talking." ...|$|R
500|$|Acknowledging the album's lack of {{commercial}} success, Dixon said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> prefer to [...] "take a chance creatively" [...] than release what she {{perceived to be}} stultifying records. She commented: [...] "I knew the single 'Drummer Boy' was a risk. It {{was a very difficult}} record and so far removed from anything I'd done before. I get that... I take full responsibility for that, but I'm glad I did it. I'd rather make a unique record like 'Drummer Boy' and have it fail than play it safe and release bland, generic music that doesn't excite me." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1935, {{her mother}} married Loyal Edward Davis (1896 [...] 1982), a {{prominent}} conservative neurosurgeon who moved {{the family to}} Chicago. Nancy and her stepfather got along very well; she later wrote that he was [...] "a man of great integrity who exemplified old-fashioned values." [...] He formally adopted her in 1935, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> refer to him as her father. At {{the time of the}} adoption, her name was legally changed to Nancy Davis. She attended the Girls' Latin School of Chicago (describing herself as an average student), graduated in 1939, and later attended Smith College in Massachusetts, where she majored in English and drama, and graduated in 1943.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Thatcher criticised {{the way the}} {{decision}} to invade Iraq had been made two years previously. Although she still supported the intervention to topple Saddam Hussein, she said that (as a scientist) <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> look for [...] "facts, evidence and proof", before committing the armed forces. She celebrated her 80th birthday on 13 October at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hyde Park, London; guests included the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Alexandra and Tony Blair. Lord (Geoffrey) Howe of Aberavon was also in attendance and said of Thatcher: [...] "Her real triumph was to have transformed not just one party but two, so that when Labour did eventually return, the great bulk of Thatcherism was accepted as irreversible." ...|$|E

She sat down to rest under an acacia tree and a black mamba snake crept upon her belly before slithering away, leaving her unharmed. She took this {{as a sign that}} the child <b>she</b> carried <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be protected, and that’s how {{the title of the book}} came about." ...|$|R
60|$|Endymion {{began to}} feel that the run of his good fortune was dried. His sister, when he had a trouble, would never hear of this; she always held that the misery and calamities of their early years had {{exhausted}} the influence of their evil stars, and apparently she had been right, and perhaps <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>always</b> been right had he not been perverse, and thwarted her in the most important circumstances of his life.|$|R
5000|$|... "Just for You" [...] is a {{love song}} with Heather singing about the exultations of love and the lengths that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> go to <b>always</b> be there; to support, to {{sacrifice}} and to guide singing the insistent refrain {{at the end of}} every line of the verses: [...] "Just for You".|$|R
500|$|Throughout {{their adult}} lives, Jane and Cassandra {{were close to}} their cousin, Eliza de Feuillide, and to neighbors Mary and Martha Lloyd. Mary became the second wife of Austen's brother James, and Martha lived with the Austen family (beginning shortly after Rev. Austen's death in 1805) and married Austen's brother Frank late in life. Jane and Cassandra were also friends for many years with three sisters, Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, who lived at Manydown Park. Anne Brydges Lefroy, wife of Rev. George Lefroy, [...] "became Jane Austen's best-loved and admired mentor, the person <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> run to for advice and encouragement" [...] after the Lefroys moved to nearby Ashe in 1783. Her death in a riding {{accident}} in 1804 left Jane grief-stricken.|$|E
500|$|Theologian Richard A. McCormick {{wrote in}} 2006 that Church {{officials}} abused their {{authority in the}} Mansour case, and brought [...] "the teaching office into disrepute". Author Kenneth A. Briggs, former religion editor for The New York Times, wrote that the Mansour case [...] "was in many respects the most dramatic, but not the only, instance of a particular nun singled out for punishment". Theologian Margaret Farley, a Sister of Mercy {{and a professor at}} Yale University, said, [...] "It was a painful truth that [...] had to leave, that the church declared her officially not a member. There was suffering in the community, and also for her. When she left she was quoted as saying that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be a Sister of Mercy in her heart. And that has absolutely been the case. She continued in works of mercy all her life." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the Queen was {{set against}} Beatrice marrying {{anyone in the}} {{expectation}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> stay at home with her, {{a number of possible}} suitors were put forward before Beatrice's marriage to Prince Henry of Battenberg. One of these was Napoléon Eugéne, the French Prince Imperial, son and heir of the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of France and his wife, the Empress Eugénie. After Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon was deposed and moved his family to England in 1870. After the Emperor's death in 1873, Queen Victoria and Empress Eugénie formed a close attachment, and the newspapers reported the imminent engagement of Beatrice to the Prince Imperial. These rumours ended with the death of the Prince Imperial in the Anglo-Zulu War on 1 June 1879. Queen Victoria's journal records their grief: [...] "Dear Beatrice, crying very much as I did too, gave me the telegram... It was dawning and little sleep did I get... Beatrice is so distressed; everyone quite stunned." ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, why wasn't {{somebody}} kind to her? Why wasn't there {{somebody who}} would take her in their arms, and hold her to their breast, and give her rest, pure, deep, healing rest. Oh, why wasn't there somebody to take her in their arms and fold her safe and perfect, for sleep. She wanted so much this perfect enfolded sleep. She lay always so unsheathed in sleep. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> lie <b>always</b> unsheathed in sleep, unrelieved, unsaved. Oh, how could she bear it, this endless unrelief, this eternal unrelief.|$|R

5000|$|At the weigh in, {{everyone}} pulled {{large numbers}} except a defeated Adrian who lost 2 pounds. She had a breakdown over the frustration {{that she was}} having trouble getting over the same hump as when she tried to lose weight in high school, and then her friends told her that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>always</b> be a [...] "chunky" [...] person. Kim pulled Adrian aside and tried to instill hope, saying that is not true and she has built a very athletic body and she will continue to drop the pounds in time if she continues with the hard work.|$|R
500|$|Iwakami and Shinbo {{recruited}} Yuki Kajiura {{to compose}} the soundtrack {{for the series}} after Urobuchi recommended her. Shinbo had previously worked with Kajiura on Le Portrait de Petit Cossette, and Urobuchi told of the inspiration the music from that series had on him while writing parts of the script. Stating that he had long {{been a fan of}} her anime soundtracks, Urobuchi also praised Kajiura's work ethic, remarking that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> fully familiarize herself with the plotline of the story while composing for it. Japanese pop music duo ClariS was also commissioned to perform , the opening theme of the series. Iwakami involved himself directly in the song's development to ensure that it would fit with the series, marking one of the only times that he explicitly intervened in an aspect of the production. Both [...] "Connect" [...] and the ending theme, [...] "Magia" [...] by Kalafina, were revealed in a television commercial several weeks before the series' premiere in Japan.|$|E
500|$|After DelaCerna {{stated that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> make sure Copeland could dance, both the {{emancipation}} papers and restraining orders were dropped. Copeland, who claimed {{she did not}} understand the term emancipation, withdrew the petition after informing the judge that such charges no longer represented her wishes. Still, DelaCerna wanted the Bradleys out of her daughter's life. Copeland re-enrolled at San Pedro High School for her junior year (1998–99), on pace to graduate with her original class of 2000. DelaCerna sought Cantine's advice on finding a new ballet school. Copeland began ballet study at Lauridsen Ballet Centre with former ABT dancer Diane Lauridsen, although her dancing was now restricted to afternoons in deference to her schooling. Late in 1998, all parties appeared on Leeza Gibbons' talk show, Leeza, where Copeland sat silently as the adults [...] "bickered shamelessly". As a student, Copeland had a 3.8/4.0 GPA through her junior year of high school. In 2000, DelaCerna stated that Copeland's earnings from ballet were set aside in a savings account and only used as needed.|$|E
500|$|After the {{original}} version of [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] was released, Carey's official website premiered two other versions of the song, the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix" [...] and the [...] "Pulse Club Remix". While the song's initial release was tepidly received by critics, reviewers were more favorable towards the remixes. The remixes only feature Carey and eliminate the extensive rap verses with which many critics took issue. According to Carey's manager, Randy Jackson, three versions of the song were released in order to monopolize all radio formats and cater to multiple audiences. In an interview with Billboard, Jackson expressed how they would remind Carey's fans of her earlier remixes, which <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> re-do her vocals: [...] "The vintage throwback mix will remind fans of remixes she did years ago, and she's {{had a lot of}} Billboard No. 1 dance hits as well. She went in and re-sang the vocals, knowing that the two verses on this first version of this single with Meek and Ross were going to be hip-hop verses where people were rapping. We wanted to have something for all of her fans." ...|$|E
5000|$|By 1992, Unison, Céline Dion, and {{numerous}} high-profile media appearances had propelled Dion to superstardom in North America. She had achieved {{one of her}} main objectives: wedging {{her way into the}} Anglophone market and achieving fame. However, while she was experiencing rising success in the US, her French fans in Canada criticized her for neglecting them. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> later rebuff these criticisms at the 1991 Félix Awards show, where, after winning [...] "English Artist of the Year", she openly refused to accept the award. She asserted that <b>she</b> was—and <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be—a French, not an English, artist. Apart from her commercial success, there were also changes in Dion's personal life, as Angélil, who was twenty-six years her senior, transitioned from manager to lover. However, the relationship was kept a secret as they both feared that the public would find their relations inappropriate.|$|R
50|$|Outside the bunker, Harry is {{told the}} plane is now safe and Ruth joins him on the hillside. Ruth tells him that the reason she left was because <b>she</b> thought there <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be too many secrets between them and that one day she might lose herself in the secrets... but that hasn't happened.

Then I should come out and curtsey to her, and say so prettily, 'Dear aunt, it was only our little joke.' That's my line.
