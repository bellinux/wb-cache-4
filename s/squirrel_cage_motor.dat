50|$|If {{the rotor}} of a <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>motor</b> were {{to run at}} the true {{synchronous}} speed, the flux in the rotor at any given place on the rotor would not change, and no current would be created in the squirrel cage. For this reason, ordinary squirrel-cage motors run at some tens of RPM slower than synchronous speed. Because the rotating field (or equivalent pulsating field) effectively rotates faster than the rotor, {{it could be said}} to slip past the surface of the rotor. The difference between synchronous speed and actual speed is called slip, and loading the motor increases the amount of slip as the motor slows down slightly. Even with no load, internal mechanical losses prevent the slip from being zero.|$|E
5000|$|The motor {{operates}} {{by simple}} magnetic attraction between {{one of the}} electromagnets {{and one of the}} iron bars. The bar is not permanently magnetized, nor does electric current flow through any part of the rotor. Unlike the visually somewhat similar <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>motor,</b> no current flow is induced in the bars. The cams and switches are arranged so that as each bar approaches within range of the magnet the current is first switched on and the bar is pulled towards it. As it approaches closer, the current is then switched off and so the bar continues to rotate past the magnet, rather than being attracted to it and stopping there. Each of the coils, cams and switches is so arranged that each of the bars is attracted in turn and so the motor rotates continuously.|$|E

40|$|Broken rotor bars fault {{detection}} in inverter-fed squirrel cage induction motors is still {{as difficult as}} the dynamics introduced by the control system or the dynamically changing excitation (stator) frequency. This paper introduces a novel fault diagnosis techniques using motor current signature analysis (MCSA) to solve the problems.

The competency of the amplitude of the sideband components at frequencies (1 ± 2) as indices for broken bars recognition is subsequently studied in the controlled motor via open loop constant voltage/frequency control method.

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper The paper analyses {{the possibility}} of reducing the initial current of synchronous motor used for powering an excavator in an open coal-pit. The main generator group, which consists of three DC generators S = 1250 kW, reaches the torque moment through synchronous motor with salient poles usage, Sr = 1250 kW. The motor is accelerated as asynchronous <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>motor,</b> drawing attention to the machine acceleration period till the moment it enters synchronism. During this period, lasting up to 15 seconds, {{it is necessary to}} connect the rotor winding through a resistor, to start the acceleration as asynchronous motor and pull the machine into synchronism. After that, a synchronous motor powers the DC generators and operates as a synchronous compensator. The excitation circuits of electromotor were originally powered by the DC generators. Now, these systems are replaced by more efficient thyristor static converters. In this way, the excavator efficiency is increased, a faster response of excitation circuit is obtained and initial currents of synchronous motor are significantly reduced...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, stator current {{analysis}} {{used for}} detecting the incipient fault in <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>motor</b> has received much attention. However, {{in the case}} of interturn short circuit in stator, the traditional symmetrical component method has lost the precondition due to the harmonics and noise; the negative sequence component (NSC) is hard to be obtained accurately. For broken rotor bars, the new added fault feature blanked by fundamental component is also difficult to be discriminated in the current spectrum. To solve the above problems, a fundamental component extraction (FCE) method is proposed in this paper. On one hand, via the antisynchronous speed coordinate (ASC) transformation, NSC of extracted signals is transformed into the DC value. The amplitude of synthetic vector of NSC is used to evaluate the severity of stator fault. On the other hand, the extracted fundamental component can be filtered out to make the rotor fault feature emerge from the stator current spectrum. Experiment results indicate that this method is feasible and effective in both interturn short circuit and broken rotor bars fault diagnosis. Furthermore, only stator currents and voltage frequency are needed to be recorded, and this method is easy to implement...|$|E
