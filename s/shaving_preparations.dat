50|$|The first can of {{pressurized}} {{shaving cream}} was Rise shaving cream, which {{was introduced by}} Carter-Wallace in 1949. By the following decade this format attained two-thirds of the American market for <b>shaving</b> <b>preparations.</b> The gas in shaving cream canisters originally contained chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), but this substance was increasingly believed to be detrimental to the Earth's ozone layer. This led to restrictions or reductions in CFC use, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency ban in the late 1970s. Gaseous hydrocarbon propellants such as mixtures of pentane, propane, butane and isobutane could be used instead of the CFCs. Because of the large proportion of water in pressurized shaving cream, the risk from the normally flammable hydrocarbons was reduced.|$|E
50|$|A {{rudimentary}} form of {{shaving cream}} was documented in Sumer around 3000 BC. This substance combined wood alkali and animal fat and {{was applied to}} a beard as a <b>shaving</b> <b>preparation.</b>|$|R
50|$|On a {{small boat}} moored in the harbor, its owner, deep sea diver Jack Burke (Frank Fenton), is <b>shaving</b> in <b>preparation</b> of visiting Marge's place, while his diving partner/friendly rival Mike Clancy (John Carradine) awakens from drunken sleep to find that Burke has tied him to the bunk bed. He offers to pay for drinks if Burke unties him, but Burke {{wants to see the}} cash first. Clancy tells him that it's in his pocket, so Burke reaches in, takes all of it, and leaves without untying him, as Clancy shouts angrily and struggles to loosen the bonds.|$|R
50|$|Tussaud was {{perceived}} as a royal sympathizer; in the Reign of Terror she was arrested, along with Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, and her head was <b>shaved</b> in <b>preparation</b> for her execution by guillotine. She was released thanks to Collot d'Herbois' support for Curtius and his household. Tussaud was then employed to make death masks of the revolution's famous victims, including Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Marat, and Robespierre. Her death masks were paraded {{through the streets of}} Paris, like revolutionary flags. Conflicting accounts argue over whether Tussaud searched through the bodies of the dead to collect the most illustrious heads she could find, as stated in her memoirs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} effective way to prevent ingrown hairs is to abstain from shaving and allow facial and body hair to grow out as normal. When shaving, there are a few precautions that can be taken to prevent ingrown hairs including proper <b>shaving</b> techniques and <b>preparation</b> of the skin before shaving. When shaving, applying the proper amount of lubrication (in the form of shaving cream, gel, or soap) is important to prevent the hair from being forced underneath the surface of the skin. Also the application of too much force with a razor can contribute to hair that is cut shorter than the surrounding dermis. [...] Using a beard trimmer at the lowest setting (1 mm or 0.5 mm) instead of shaving is an effective alternative.|$|R
40|$|Neurosurgeons perform {{operations}} every day, many {{of which}} involve the scalp. There is evidence supporting similar or decreased wound infection rates in the unshaven scalp. Patients with standard scalp incisions were assigned to either <b>shave</b> or shaveless <b>preparations</b> (n = 20). The timing of preparation and skin closure was recorded for both groups as were infectious complications. All of the patients have been followed {{for an average of}} 10 months. There were no cases of infection. The timing of scalp preparation and closure was not significantly different between the two groups (P <. 05). We have previously suggested that shaving the scalp is not a critical step in the prevention of infection. We confirm that the timing of this technique is not prolonged over that of standard preparations...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now {{you expect}} me to tell of Germans and the fight and {{shelling}} and all sorts of things. I haven't seen a live German; I haven't been within two hundred yards of a shell burst, there has been no attack and I haven't got the V.C. I have made myself muddy beyond describing; I've been working all the time, but I've not fired a shot or fought a ha'porth. We were busy all the time--just at work, repairing the parapet, which had to be done gingerly because of snipers, bringing our food in from the rear in big carriers, getting water, pushing our trench out from an angle slantingways forward. Getting meals, clearing up and so on takes a lot of time. We make tea in big kettles in the big dug-out, which two whole companies use for their cooking, and carry them with a pole through the handles to our platoons. We wash up and wash and <b>shave.</b> Dinner <b>preparation</b> (and consumption) takes two or three hours. Tea too uses up time. It's like camping out and picnicking in the park. This first time (and next too) we have been mixed with some Sussex men who have been here longer and know the business.... It works out that we do most of the fatigue. Afterwards we shall go up alone to a pitch of our own....|$|R
5000|$|Lister (Craig Charles) has decided, {{much to the}} {{annoyance}} of Rimmer (Chris Barrie), to take the Cat (Danny John-Jules) {{with him as he}} spends the remainder of the journey back to Earth in stasis. As Lister is <b>shaving</b> in <b>preparation</b> for stasis the ship jolts. Holly (Norman Lovett) explains that after three million years of constant acceleration the ship has just broken the light barrier. Reassuring Lister that everything will be alright Holly goes back to navigating the ship. Lister however starts seeing odd occurrences in the mirror; his reflection reels back in pain as he cuts his chin with the razor. Lister feels his own chin and sees no blood. Carrying on regardless he then sees the reflection of Rimmer racing up behind him. He turns and sees no one there. Later, Lister goes to speak to Rimmer in the drive room, only to see him apparently talking to no-one and speaking gibberish. Rimmer walks out of the drive room, only for Lister to see another Rimmer immediately walk in {{the other side of the}} room, and in their subsequent conversation Rimmer says exactly the same things he did previously, this time making perfect sense. Finally, the Cat runs past Rimmer and Lister in the corridor shouting about how he lost a tooth, but Lister and Rimmer then find Cat in Lister's quarters, happily trying to eat Lister's robotic goldfish and with all his teeth intact. After discussing the occurrences with Holly it appears that they are experiencing [...] "Future Echoes"; events that will occur in the future that can be seen in the present.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} needleless intradermal (ID) vaccines to induce protection against clinical disease and to compare the serological response of pigs to intramuscular (IM) and ID vaccination with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae bacterins. Materials and methods: In each study, pigs seronegative for M hyopneumoniae were vaccinated either once or twice with M hyopneumoniae bacterins. The serological response to ID and IM vaccination was evaluated by the DAKO M hyopneumoniae blocking ELISA, and ID vaccine efficacy was tested by experimental respiratory challenge with a heterologous strain of virulent M hyopneumoniae. Results: Injection site reactions were minimal for all vaccines. Pigs vaccinated ID, either by needle or needleless injector, had significantly higher M hyopneumoniae antibody titers than did pigs vaccinated by IM injection. Pigs vaccinated by needleless ID injection had lower lung lesion scores and higher IgA and IgG titers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid than did nonvaccinates following challenge. Protective immunity was established by 21 days postvaccination after a single ID dose of vaccine. Intradermal vaccination of swine for M hyopneumoniae by needleless injector was safe and efficacious, and did not require <b>shaving</b> or other <b>preparation</b> of the skin. Implications: Intradermal vaccination of swine with needleless injectors is feasible if vaccines are formulated for small doses (eg, 0. 2 mL) ...|$|R
6000|$|Englishmen, as a rule, shave {{themselves}} {{when they do not}} wear beards. The author of the little pamphlet before us gives a dozen curious hints which prove the difficulty of the art. Almost all razors, he seems to think, were [...] "made to sell." [...] He suggests that razors of tried and trusty character, razors whose public form can be depended upon, should be purchased of barbers. But it is not every barber who will part with such possessions. Razors are like Scotch sheep dogs; no one would keep a bad one, or sell, or give away a good one. Coelebs did not find the quest of a wife more arduous than all men find that of a really responsible razor. You may be unlucky in the important matter of lather. For soap our author gives a recipe which reminds one of Walton's quaint prescriptions and queer <b>preparations.</b> <b>Shaving</b> soap should be made at home, it seems, and the mystery of its manufacture is here disclosed. The only way to keep razors [...] "set" [...] is to persevere in sending them to various barbers till the genius who can [...] "set" [...] them to your hand is discovered. Perhaps he lives at Aleppo; perhaps, like the father of a heroine of comic song, at Jerusalem. Till he is discovered the shaver wins no secure happiness, and in the search for the barber who has an elective affinity for the shaver may be found material for an operetta or an epic. The shaver figures as a sort of Alastor, seeking the ideal setter of razors, as Shelley's Alastor sought ideal beauty in the neighbourhood of Afghanistan, and in the very home of the Central Asian Question. No razor should be condemned till it has been [...] "stropped" [...] well and carefully. And this brings us to the great topic of strops. Some say that soldiers' old buff belts make the best strops. The Scotch peasantry use a peculiar hard smooth fungus which grows in decaying elm trees. Our author has heard that [...] "Government now demands the return of" [...] the old buff belts. Government cannot want them all for its own use, and perhaps will see to it that old buff strops once more find an open market. In the lack of old buff belts, you may mix up tallow and the ashes of burnt newspaper, and smear this unctuous compound on the strop. People who neglect these [...] "tips," [...] and who are clumsy, like most of us, may waste a forty-eighth part of their adult years in shaving. This time is worth economizing, and with a little forethought, an ideal razor-setter, tallow, buff belts, burnt newspapers, and the rest, we may shave in five minutes daily.|$|R
