5|$|It {{has been}} known {{for more than a century}} that {{consumption}} of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as Vibrio spp. or by viruses and bacteria from <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including the microbial pathogens. These are retained in the animals' tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like digestive glands. Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates. These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour as a result of the proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a red tide.|$|E

40|$|Philosophy of Doctor - PHDThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare the water quality of raw {{wastewater}} and treated <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> from three different sewage treatment plants in the Western Cape, South Africa. The treatment plants investigated are on the same river system. Sewage treatment plant 1 and 2 use older technologies, while sewage treatment plant 3 has been upgraded and new technologies (membrane bioreactor) were incorporated in the treatment processes. The first objective was to determine the occurrence of total coliforms, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and fluoroquinolone and sulfamethoxazole antibiotic residues in raw wastewater and treated <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents.</b> Bacteria in treated <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> can result in diseases such as dysentery, gastroenteritis, and typhoid upon exposure. A chromogenic test was used to screen for coliforms and E. coli. Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) were used to quantitate antibiotic residues (fluoroquinolones and sulfamethoxazole) in raw wastewater and treated <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents.</b> This study showed that bacteria are present in raw wastewater and residual bacteria are released with treated <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> from <b>sewage</b> treatment plants.

40|$|This work {{highlights}} {{the recovery of}} water from <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> using alumina ceramic membranes with pore sizes of 0. 2 and 0. 45 μ m respectively in dead-end filtration mode. The work demonstrates the ability and advantages of alumina-based microfiltration (MF) membranes in filtering microbes and other harmful pollutants normally present in <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> in dead-end filtration mode. The fouling behavior of the membranes in the filtration cycle is identified, which in turn helped to regenerate the fouled membranes for subsequent usage. Regeneration studies of fouled membranes also suggest that though chemical cleaning was effective in recovering membrane performance, the fouling had still been progressed slowly and the membranes showed the ability to perform at least five filtration cycles of highly-contaminated <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents.</b> As expected, the filtration efficiency and flux characteristics at various transmembrane pressure (TMP) of the membranes varies with the pore size of the membrane and is explained in light of Darcy's and Poiseuille's laws of filtration. The results show that alumina ceramic membrane with disc geometry having a pore size of 0. 2 μ m is more effective in filtering the total suspended solids, turbidity and microbes of the <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> as compare to that of 0. 45 μ m membrane to a level in which the permeate water appears to be benign for discharging into the surface thereby offering the possibility of recycling or reusing the recovered water from the <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> for suitable purposes...|$|R

40|$|Water {{deficiency}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious problems that faces the world particularly in the arid and semi arid regions. In Egypt, the governmental striving to increase water resources take three main managements, namely, development of upper river Nile projects, improvement of current water distribution system and re-use of water including domestic <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents.</b> The last direction frames the most appreciable and self-controllable resource so far despite many obstacles and limitations to be retrieved. In the present work two field trials were conducted in a sandy soil in Upper Egypt (Luxor) to investigate the use of treated domestic <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> or freshwater (canal from river Nile) as control for growing six summer oil crops i. e, sunflower, peanut, soybean, castor bean,sesame and cotton. The pertinence of reusing biologically treated domestic <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> in farming practices were assessed in terms of both parasitic load and potential toxic elements inside. Results exhibited that all tested growth characters and yield components for tested plants irrigated with biologically treated <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> far exceeded those for plants irrigated with freshwater. Plants irrigated with sewage water produced more oil yield than control by 206. 6, 319. 4, 28. 8, 90. 5, 371. 5 and 16. 2 Kg/feddan for castor bean, sunflower, soybean, sesame, peanut and cotton, respectively. The content of potential toxic elements in seeds and oil grown in plots irrigated with exclusive treated domestic <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> were almost more or less the same as those met in harvests irrigated with freshwater. It is worthy to mention that the oil produced from previous crops(in most cases) are used in industrial purposes such as manufacturing of printer ink, nylon, soaps,, papers, textile,leather,waxes,varnishes, lacquers, paints, various glues, plastics and synthetic materials as well. Therefore, treated domestic <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents,</b> especially if separated away from industrial wastes, could be used to growing oil crops for manufacturing purposes in arid and semi arid land...|$|R

40|$|Chlorination {{could be}} the most {{cost-effective}} method for disinfecting saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> resulting from toilet flushing with seawater. Upon chlorination, the high levels of bromide ions in saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> (up to 32 mg/L) can be oxidized to hypobromous acid/hypobromite, which could then react with organic matter in the <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> to form brominated disinfection byproducts (Br-DBPs). In this study, primary and secondary saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> were collected and chlorinated at different chlorine doses, and a powerful precursor ion scan method using ultra performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was adopted for detection and identification of polar Br-DBPs in these samples. With the new method, 54 major polar Br-DBPs were detected in the chlorinated saline effluents and six of them were newly identified as wastewater DBPs, including bromomaleic acid, 5 -bromosalicylic acid, 3, 5 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, 3, 5 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 6 -dibromo- 4 -nitrophenol, and 2, 4, 6 -tribromophenol. The formation of polar Br-DBPs, especially those newly detected ones, during chlorination of the saline effluents was studied. For the secondary saline effluent, various polar Br-DBPs formed and reached their maximum levels at different chlorine doses, whereas for the primary saline effluent, the formation of polar Br-DBPs basically kept increasing with increasing chlorine dose. Compared with the secondary saline effluent, the primary saline effluent generated fewer and less Br-DBPs and rarely generated nitrogenous Br-DBPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|Rotating {{biological}} contactors (RBCs) are robust mechanical fixed-film {{secondary treatment}} systems capable of withstanding surges in organic load. RBCs were first installed in Germany in 1960 and {{have since been}} developed and refined into a reliable operating unit. The rotating disks support the growth of bacteria and micro-organisms present in the sewage, which break down and stabilize organic pollutants. To be successful, micro-organisms need both oxygen to live and food to grow. Oxygen is obtained from the atmosphere as the disks rotate. As the micro-organisms grow, they build up on the media until they are sloughed off due to shear forces provided by the rotating discs in the <b>sewage.</b> <b>Effluent</b> from the RBC is then passed through a secondary clarifier where the sloughed biological solids in suspension settle as a sludge.|$|E
25|$|The {{impacts of}} human habitation, {{particularly}} the inadequate treatment of <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent,</b> {{and the growth}} of mining in the upper reaches and the processing of metals in the Sheffield area have resulted in serious pollution of the river, and the depletion of fish stocks, to the extent that large parts of the Don contained no fish until the mid-1980s. Concerted efforts have been made to improve the water quality, by reducing the concentration of metals, the ammonia content, and the biological oxygen demand (BOD), which {{is a measure of the}} amount of oxygen that is needed by organisms to break down organic matter in the water. Sewage treatment works on the Don, notably those at Cheesebottom, on the west bank of the river at Thurgoland and Blackburn Meadows at Tinsley, have been upgraded, as has that at Darton on the River Dearne. This has led to a great improvement in ammonia levels and BOD, further aided by the construction of biological treatment facilities for the processing of industrial effluent in the Doncaster area, while the decline in the steel industry in Sheffield has reduced the discharge of metals into the river.|$|E

Sewage treatment plant 1 and 2 use older technologies, while sewage treatment plant 3 has been upgraded and membrane technologies were incorporated in the treatment processes. Coliforms and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were used as bioindicators for faecal bacteria. A chromogenic test was used to screen for coliforms and E. coli. Fluoroquinolones and sulfamethoxazole are commonly used antibiotics and were selected to monitor the efficiency of sewage treatment processes for antibiotic removal. Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) were used to quantitate antibiotic residues in raw and treated sewage. Raw intake water at all treatment plants contained total coliforms and E. coli. High removal of E. coli by treatment processes was evident for treatment plant 2 and 3 only. Fluoroquinolones and sulfamethoxazole were detected in raw wastewater from all sewage treatment plants. Treatment processes at plant 1 did not reduce the fluoroquinolone concentration in treated <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents.</b> Treatment processes at plant 2 and 3 reduced the fluoroquinolone concentration by 21 % and 31 %, respectively.

40|$|Tightening quality {{standards}} for European waters {{has seen a}} move towards enhanced wastewater treatment technologies such as granulated organic carbon treatment and ozonation. Although these technologies {{are likely to be}} successful in degrading certain micro-organic contaminants, these may also destroy compounds which would otherwise complex and render metals significantly less toxic. This study examined the impact of enhanced tertiary treatment on the capacity of organic compounds within <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> to complex copper and zinc. The data show that granulated organic carbon treatment removes a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fraction that is unimportant to complexation such that no detrimental impact on complexation or metal bioavailability is likely to occur from this treatment type. High concentrations of ozone (> 1  mg O 3 /mg DOC) are, however, likely to impact the complexation capacity for copper although this is unlikely to be important at the concentrations of copper typically found in effluent discharges or in rivers. Ozone treatment did not affect zinc complexation capacity. The complexation profiles of the <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> show these to contain a category of non-humic ligand that appears unaffected by tertiary treatment and which displays a high affinity for zinc, suggesting these may substantially reduce the bioavailability of zinc in effluent discharges.
