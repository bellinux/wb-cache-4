5000|$|Some {{forms of}} {{cultural}} control of Orobanche aegyptiaca include sanitation {{efforts to help}} prevent the movement of seeds, individual picking of weeds by hand, and avoidance by changing the <b>sowing</b> <b>time</b> or not growing a host plant. Reducing spread of infected soil via farm machinery, avoidance of grazing on infected plants, and staying away {{from the use of}} hay produced from [...] "Orobanche"-infested plants are all methods to help prevent the movement of seeds. The individual picking of weeds by hand is very important as the plant is able continue living as only a stem and produce a flower that can spread seeds even while not connected to the host. Any avoidance strategy must be carried out with a plant that cannot be parasitized by [...] "Orobanche aegyptiaca" [...] and could take up to 15-20 years to complete, as this is how long the plant's seeds can remain viable in the soil. Also, because seeds can safely pass through an animal digestive system, it’s important to ensure manure is not contaminated. Another option for cultural control is the use of trap crops or catch crops. Trap crops promote the germination of O. aegyptiaca seeds but will not allow parasitism; these include flax, mung bean, maize, and sorghum. Catch crops allow parasitism but are destroyed before the parasitic plant flowers, so the broomrape seeds cannot be produced and dispersed. Finally, there has been some success with host plant resistance in sunflower, fafa bean, lentil, and tomato but it has been very limited. Resistant cultivars of sunflower were bred in Russia and Spain but quickly lost their host-plant resistance due to selection towards more aggressive biotypes of the plant that had adapted to the new cultivars. In the resistant sunflower cultivars, germination was still induced but the plant's germ tube never develops after penetration by the haustorium. Because has been shown that macromolecules are transferred from the host to the parasite, one method for resistance is the introduction of anti-microbial gene from the flesh fly into the host genome. This allows for its protein product to be transferred to the parasite and work as a means of control.|$|E

5000|$|People {{have always}} adapted to climatic changes and some {{community}} coping strategies already exist, for example changing <b>sowing</b> <b>times</b> or adopting new water-saving techniques. Traditional knowledge and coping strategies {{must be maintained}} and strengthened, otherwise adaptive capacity may be weakened as local knowledge of the environment is lost. Strengthening these local techniques and building upon them also makes {{it more likely that}} adaptation strategies will be adopted, as it creates more community ownership and involvement in the process. [...] In many cases however this will be not be enough to adapt to new conditions which are outside the range of those previously experienced, and new techniques will be needed. Current development efforts are increasingly focusing on community-based climate change adaptation, seeking to enhance local knowledge, participation and ownership of adaptation strategies.|$|R
40|$|Cataloguing of {{different}} insect pests occurring in black gram, screening of black gram genotypes against major insect pests and their incidence on black gram at three different <b>sowing</b> <b>times</b> were investigated at Agricultural Research Station Farm, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Kovilpatti, Tuticorin District. Totally, 11 species of insect pests {{were identified in}} black gram ecosystem. Among the 10 black gram genotypes screened, KBG 06 016 recorded minimum population of leafhoppers during both the years and KBG 05 007 and KBG 06 021 showed minimum population of aphid during 2010 – 2011 and 2011 – 2012, respectively. The minimum damage by pod borer was noticed in KBG 04 003 and KBG 08 001 during 2010 – 2011 and 2011 – 2012, respectively. The minimum number of leafhoppers, aphids and pod borers were observed in monsoon, post-monsoon and pre-monsoon sown black gram, respectively...|$|R
