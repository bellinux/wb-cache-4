40|$|For some {{anisotropic}} wave models, the PML (perfectly matched layer) {{method of}} open boundaries can become polynomially or exponentially unstable in time. In this work {{we present a}} new method of open boundaries, the phase <b>space</b> <b>filter,</b> which is stable for all wave equations. Outgoing waves {{can be characterized as}} waves located near the boundary of the computational domain with group velocities pointing outward. The phase space filtering algorithm consists of applying a filter to the solution that removes outgoing waves only. The method presented here is a simplified version of the original phase <b>space</b> <b>filter,</b> originally described in [22] for the Schrodinger equation. We apply this method to anisotropic wave models for which the PML is unstable, namely the Euler equations (linearized about a constant jet flow) and Maxwell's equations in an anisotropic medium.

40|$|Abstract [...] A new hybrid {{method is}} {{presented}} that combines the scale <b>space</b> <b>filter</b> (SSF) and Markov random field (MRF) for color image segmentation. The fundamental {{idea of the}} SSF {{is to use the}} convolution of Gaussian functions and image-histogram to generate a scale space image and then find the proper interval bounded by the local extrema of the derivatives. The Gaussian function is with zero mean and varied standard deviation. Using the SSF the different scaled histogram is separated into intervals corresponding to peaks and valleys. The MRF makes use of the property that each pixel in an image has some relationship with other pixels. The basic construction of an MRF is a joint probability given the original data. The original data is the image that is obtained from the source and the result is called the label image. Because the MRF needs a number of segments before it converges to the global minimum, the SSF is exploited to do coarse segmentation (CS) and then MRF is used to do fine segmentation (FS) of the images. Basically, the former is histogram-based segmentation, whereas the latter is neighborhood-based segmentation. Finally, experimental results obtained from using SSF alone, MRF using iterated conditional mode (ICM), and MRF using Gibbs sampling are compared.

40|$|Abstract. The {{well-known}} {{fact that}} tropical sea level can be usefully simulated by linear wind driven models recommends it as a realistic test problem for data assimilation schemes. Here {{we report on}} an assimilation of monthly data for the period 1975 - 1992 from 34 tropical Pacific tide gauges into such a model using a Kalman filter. We present an approach to the Kalman filter that uses a reduced state space representation for the required error covariance matrices. This reduction makes the calculation highly feasible. We argue that a more complete representation will be of no value in typical oceanographic practice, that in principle {{it is unlikely to}} be helpful, and that it may even be harmful if the data coverage is sparse, the usual case in oceanography. This is in part a consequence of ignorance of the correct error statistics for the data and model, but only in part. The reduced state space is obtained from a truncated set of multivariate empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) derived from a long model run without assimilation. The reduced state <b>space</b> <b>filter</b> is compared with a full grid point Kalman filter using the same dynamical model for the period 1979 - 1985, assimilating eight tide gauge stations and using an additional seven for verification [Miller et al., 1995].
