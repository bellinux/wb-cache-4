40|$|Foreground-background {{segmentation}} in videos is {{an important}} low-level task needed for many different applications in computer vision. Therefore, {{a great variety of}} different algorithms have been proposed to deal with this problem, however none can deliver satisfactory results in all circumstances. Our approach combines an efficient novel Background <b>Substraction</b> <b>algorithm</b> with a higher order Markov Random Field (MRF) which can model the spatial relations between the pixels of an image far better than a simple pairwise MRF used in most {{of the state of the}} art methods. Afterwards, a runtime optimized Belief Propagation algorithm is used to compute an enhanced segmentation based on this model. Lastly, a local between Class Variance method is combined with this to enrich the data from the Background Substraction. To evaluate the results the difficult Wallflower data set is used...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} ensure the {{performance}} of the automated fiber placement forming parts, according to the homogeneity of the image of the prepreg surface along the fiber direction, a defect segmentation algorithm which was the combination of gray compensation and <b>substraction</b> <b>algorithm</b> based on image processing technology was proposed. The gray compensation matrix of image was used to compensate the gray image, and the maximum error point of the image matrix was eliminated according to the characteristics that the gray error obeys the normal distribution. The standard image was established, using the allowed deviation coefficient K as a criterion for substraction segmentation. Experiments show that the algorithm has good effect, fast speed in segmenting two kinds of typical laying defect of bubbles or foreign objects, and provides a good theoretical basis to realize automatic laying defect online monitoring...|$|E
