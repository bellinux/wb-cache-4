5|$|She {{suffered}} from bulimia very badly. That's not, like, a revelation – you knew {{just by looking}} at her… <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia… I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been physically stronger.|$|E

5|$|Anne {{soon learned}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> no say in her son's care. James {{appointed}} {{as head of the}} nursery his former nurse Helen Little, who installed Henry in James' own oak cradle.

6000|$|Mrs. Gereth massed herself {{there more}} and more as an immoral woman, but Fleda had to {{recognize}} that <b>she</b> too <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been stupid and <b>she</b> too <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gratified her. [...] "And when did all this take place?" ...|$|R

40|$|When Nikki Gemmell {{described}} {{her sense of}} liberation on deciding to publish "The Bride Stripped Bare" anonymously, {{she seemed to have}} in mind only a desire not to offend people close to her. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> also <b>have</b> liberated herself from the literary celebrity machine. But, once the game was up, she got even more of it than <b>she</b> <b>would</b> otherwise <b>have</b> done...|$|R

5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E

No work was done on the ship, which was eventually seized by the US Army and used as a troop transport {{following the end of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{previous}} actions of breaking into ISIS and hacking the mainframe, Archer is excused from his expenses after Cyril {{comes to the}} assumption that Kremenski had been stealing from Archer's account the whole time. Malory notes that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> known {{if there was a}} mole at ISIS, her earlier phone call shown to have been with Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB. She changes the subject when questioned, and rather complains that someone left donuts on the floor attracting ants.|$|E

Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, because she would be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997. Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked Mavis to return to the serial.|$|E
