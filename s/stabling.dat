Although this is not always possible with modern <b>stabling</b> practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, {{it is important to remember}} the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} of the {{entrance}} is the subway that links all the platforms, reached either by steps or lift; it houses the main public toilets, automated teller machines (ATM) and several catering outlets (there is catering on all platform islands except 13–15). A passenger information office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond, and at the western end is Platform 4, used by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for <b>stabling</b> empty trains, as is the former Motorail unloading bay alongside. At the far end of this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for <b>stabling</b> engineers' on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a girder bridge that carries the A4 out of the city.|$|E

5|$|A journey between Arnos Grove and Southgate {{typically}} takes {{slightly more}} than four minutes. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3-9 minutes between 07:07 and 01:07 eastbound, and every 2-6 minutes between 05:19 and 00:06 westbound. When operational problems occur on the line, Arnos Grove station may act as a temporary terminus of a reduced service – either a shuttle service between Arnos Grove and Cockfosters or a truncated service from Central London. The station has a set of seven sidings to its south for <b>stabling</b> trains.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} end of the small {{courtyard}} is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as <b>stabling</b> and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E

Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant House because there is a law against <b>stabling</b> large animals in the District of Columbia.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt is {{well-known}} {{that the structure}} of the set of <b>stable</b> marriages of a <b>stable</b> marriage instance can be represented as a finite distributive lattice and, conversely, every finite distributive lattice is a set of <b>stable</b> marriages for some <b>stable</b> marriage instance. Recently, Irving [12] and Gusfield [9] propose some representations of the set of all <b>stable</b> assignments for a given solvable instance of the <b>stable</b> roommates problem. In this paper, we will give a unifying approach to the structures of the <b>stable</b> marriage problem and the <b>stable</b> roommates problem. To achieve this purpose, we first study the duality in the structure of a <b>stable</b> marriage instance, then transform every <b>stable</b> roommates instance into a corresponding <b>stable</b> marriage instance and obtain {{the structure of the}} <b>stable</b> roommates instance directly from that of the corresponding <b>stable</b> marriage instance. The main results of this paper are: (1) There is a one-one correspondence between the set of <b>stable</b> marriages for a <b>stable</b> marriage instance and the set of feasible words of some Faigle geometry; (2) There is a one-one correspondence between the set of <b>stable</b> assignments for a <b>stable</b> roommates instance and the set of basic words of some Faigle geometry...|$|R

5|$|Part of {{the chalk}} cliff near the lower {{terminus}} collapsed in 1957, forcing the railway's closure while a strengthening concrete wall was built. The new wall reduced the lower terminus {{to a single}} length of track.

The wooden station platforms were replaced by modern concrete structures.|$|E
5|$|By 1795, the {{original}} Bridgewater Canal from Worsley to Manchester had proved an economic success, prompting its owner, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to seek powers to extend it route to Leigh via Astley. The Duke's plans were approved, despite {{opposition from the}} local population. Canal traffic brought trade to Astley Green where the Hope and Anchor Inn (now the Boathouse) was built with <b>stabling</b> for horses that pulled the barges. The original canal bridge built to connect Lower and Higher Green lasted until 1904, when it was replaced. The second bridge was replaced in 1920 by an iron bridge, which could be raised to counter the effects of mining subsidence. A boatyard was established by Lingards Bridge.|$|E
5|$|When Angel {{was first}} opened, a long {{dead-end}} siding was provided for train <b>stabling,</b> converging {{from the left}} onto the northbound line {{just south of the}} station. This was retained over the years but eventually it was closed on 23 January 1959 (along with the signal box {{at the south end of}} the platform) to simplify through running. The siding lay derelict and unused until the rebuilding scheme. Part of the siding was used as the northbound diversion tunnel, which branched off the existing northbound line, cut through into the end of the siding and continued along it until it branched off left to the new northbound platform.|$|E

It was extended in 1929 and then again in 1960, when a concert room was added, offering late-night entertainment. After its closure in the 1980s, the hotel was demolished. The Hyde Road Hotel and Restaurant at the main entrance, originally known as Belle Vue House, was renamed the Palm Court Restaurant in 1942, and then Caesar's Palace in 1969. It housed a cabaret bar and a restaurant, which was converted to an amusement arcade in 1976 when it was once again renamed, to Jennison's Ale House. The building was closed after a partial collapse in 1980.|$|E
