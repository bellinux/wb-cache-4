500|$|The {{narrative}} {{begins in}} 2047. Mikako is apparently {{alone in a}} hauntingly empty city, trying to contact people through her mobile telephone. She wakes up in her Tracer orbiting an extrasolar planet. [...] She then goes to Agartha, the fictional fourth planet of the Sirius System. Mikako sends an e-mail to Noboru (which shows the date 2047-09-16), with the subject [...] "I am here", which would reach him eight years later. Some flashes of imagery, perhaps indicative of memory, a hallucination, or even a mystical encounter, are then shown. The room shown {{at the beginning of}} the animation is presented again; Mikako is squatting in the corner, sobbing and pleading with her doppelganger to let her see Noboru again so <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> him she loves him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Thanks. She {{must bear}} it as best <b>she</b> <b>can.</b> I <b>tell</b> her it's a grand {{opportunity}} for practising patience. But she hardly sees it {{from that point}} of view. Why, there are the children!" ...|$|R
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the episode, Liz complains about the cold weather saying that she has been stuck inside her apartment playing online Boggle, a word game designed by using a plastic grid of lettered dice, in which players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters. Later, Jack tells Liz that she is the female version of former Boston Celtics basketball player Kevin McHale. Jack's Boston office is a duplication of his New York one. When Liz enters, Jack asks her if <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> which seven items are different, prompting the two to look into the camera and smile and thus breaking the fourth wall, a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience. In one scene, Jack says that many Boston residents have named their daughters [...] "Belichick", after New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick.|$|E
500|$|Breathless {{shows up}} at Tracy's apartment, once again {{in an attempt to}} seduce him. Tracy shows he is only human by {{allowing}} her to kiss him. Tess witnesses this and eventually leaves town. Tracy leads a seemingly unsuccessful raid on Club Ritz, but it is actually a diversion so officer [...] "Bug" [...] Bailey can enter the building to operate a secretly installed listening device so the police can hear in on Big Boy's criminal activities. The resultant raids all but wipe out Big Boy's criminal empire. However, Big Boy discovers Bug and captures him for a trap planned by Influence and Pruneface to kill Tracy in the warehouse. In the resulting gun battle, a stranger with no face called [...] "The Blank" [...] steps out of the shadows to save Tracy after he is cornered and kills Pruneface. Influence escapes as Tracy rescues Bug from the same fate given to Lips Manlis, and Big Boy is enraged upon hearing that The Blank foiled the hit. Tracy tries again to get the testimony from Breathless he needs to put Big Boy away. She agrees to testify only if Tracy agrees to give in to her advances. Tess eventually has a change of heart, but before <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> Tracy, she is kidnapped by The Blank, with the help of Big Boy's club piano player, 88 Keys.

2500|$|Reaction to {{the novel}} was mixed among reviewers. The New York Times [...] "found some {{difficulty}} in getting at the [...] purpose, ethical or artistic," [...] concluding that it was [...] "as {{a study of the}} human conscience, its powers and its limitations," [...] that the novel was to be regarded. Finding the story unpleasant and its characters [...] "generally unlikable," [...] it yet declared it [...] "a book distinctly well written, if to write well, in making fiction, is to so write as to hold the attention of even an unwilling reader and compel him to note with something like admiration the skillful development of the traits of personages for whom he feels no liking whatever." [...] In spite of this dislike, the reviewer noted that Wright [...] "knows her trade as novelist. As novelists go she is one among ten thousand. … [...] has a keen sense of humor, good descriptive powers, a good working knowledge of human nature, an effective style. <b>She</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> a story well." ...|$|E

Fluctuating between skepticism and uneasiness over his newfound abilities, Archibald listens to Gormala's insights and sees one of his visions fulfilled at Lammas-tide, when he and Gormala witness Lauchlane Macleod, a local fisherman, wreck his boat on a chain of sharp rocks known as the Skares.
