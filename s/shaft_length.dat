5|$|The humerus is very robust with {{strongly}} expanded {{upper and}} lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its shaft circumference equals {{about half of the}} total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone plate. On the front outer side of the shaft a large triangular deltopectoral crest is present, the attachment for the Musculus pectoralis major and the Musculus deltoideus. It covers about the upper half of the <b>shaft</b> <b>length,</b> its apex positioned rather low. The ulna is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, BMNH 36585, has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimetres. The ulna is straight in front view and has a large olecranon, the attachment process for the Musculus triceps brachii. Radius, wrist and hand are unknown.|$|E

50|$|Length and Weight - These {{variables}} {{are used to}} tailor a golf club to a particular player. <b>Shaft</b> <b>lengths</b> can be altered to suit golfers of different heights. Golf shafts are manufactured in various weights to suit players of any skill or strength level.|$|R
50|$|Front-wheel-drive {{vehicles}} tend {{to suffer}} from torque steer under heavy acceleration. This is caused by differing drive <b>shaft</b> <b>lengths</b> which in turn results in different incident angles at the joints of the driveshaft. The farther these joints are articulate, the less effective they are at delivering torque to the wheels.|$|R

50|$|Universal joints let {{the shaft}} keep {{rotating}} while allowing for changes due to suspension movement, such as <b>shaft</b> <b>length</b> and horizontal angle, and shaft angle as the steering turns. Constant-velocity universal joints are normally used to transfer power smoothly between the components. The inner universal {{can be a}} plunge or tripod type joint. The tripod is splined to the intermediate shaft and held by a circlip. A ball, supported on needle roller bearings, is fitted to each post of the tripod, and these slide in a trunion inside the yoke. This caters for changes in <b>shaft</b> <b>length</b> and horizontal angle. The drive is transferred through the trunion and balls to rotate the shaft.|$|E
50|$|The furthest {{shooting}} {{drivers of}} all are long-drive-clubs, {{which may have}} a 48-inch shaft. This is the maximum legal <b>shaft</b> <b>length</b> in golf. Maximum length shafts are unpopular even in professional golf, due to the shot inconsistency and smaller error margin they provide.|$|E

50|$|Outboard motor <b>shaft</b> <b>lengths</b> are {{standardized}} to fit 15-inch, 20-inch and 25-inch transoms. If {{the shaft}} {{is too long}} it will extend farther into the water than necessary creating drag, which will impair performance and fuel economy. If the shaft is too short, the motor will be prone to ventilation. Even worse, if the water intake ports on the lower unit are not sufficiently submerged, engine overheating is likely, which can result in severe damage.|$|R
60|$|But the {{common-sense}} {{method of}} stating {{the matter is}} that a feather is composed of two parts, a shaft with lateral filaments. For the greater part of the <b>shaft's</b> <b>length,</b> these filaments are strong and nearly straight, forming, by their attachment, a finely warped sail, like that of a wind-mill. But towards the root of the feather they suddenly become weak, and confusedly flexible, and form the close down which immediately protects the bird's body.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{prominent}} processes on the humerus. The longer, less prominent, and more ridge-like {{of these is}} the dorsal process. This process is remarkably short compared to other ophthalmosaurids, being {{less than half of the}} length of the humeral shaft, a condition also seen in Undorosaurus and Aegirosaurus; in Ophthalmosaurus, Brachypterygius, Paraophthalmosaurus, and Cryopterygius, the process reaches the midpoint of the humerus, while it is even longer in Arthropterygius, Platypterygius americanus, Platypterygius australis, and Platypterygius hercynicus. The other process is the deltopectoral crest, which is similarly small among ophthalmosaurids (i.e. less than half of the <b>shaft</b> <b>length)</b> in the same manner as Arthropterygius, Platypterygius hercynicus, [...] and Janusaurus; it is about half of the <b>shaft</b> <b>length</b> in Ophthalmosaurus, and is almost as long as the entire shaft in Sisteronia, Acamptonectes, and Platypterygius americanus.|$|E

The defining character of the boot is the <b>length</b> of the <b>shaft.</b> Ankle boots generally have a shaft height of less than 8 inches (20 cm), calf-length boots 8-15 inches (20-38 cm), knee-length boots 15-19 inches (38-48 cm), while over-the knee boots have <b>shaft</b> <b>lengths</b> of 19 inches (38 cm) or more; however these divisions are arbitrary and at the boundaries the {{decision as to whether}} a boot is, for example, calf-length or knee-length is largely subjective.|$|R
40|$|An {{all-composite}} driveshaft incorporating integral flexible diaphragms {{was developed}} for prime contractor testing. This new approach makes obsolete the split lines required to attach metallic flex elements and either metallic or composite spacing tubes in current solutions. Subcritical driveshaft weights can be achieved that are half that of incumbent technology for typical rotary wing <b>shaft</b> <b>lengths.</b> Spacing tubes compose {{an integral part of}} the initial tooling but remain part of the finished shaft and control natural frequencies and torsional stability.

50|$|The <b>shaft</b> <b>length</b> in woods {{varies from}} about 40 - 48 in, {{with the current}} {{standard}} length for the driver being 45 in, formerly 43.5 in. Graphite shafts are usually preferred for woods due to their light weight, which enables users to generate higher clubhead speeds and thus greater distance. The maximum legal length of a shaft by USGA and R&A rules is 48 in, though some woods used in long drive contests have been made with shaft lengths up to 50 in long.|$|E
50|$|The <b>shaft</b> <b>length</b> of an iron {{decreases}} as the iron's number increases; {{therefore the}} iron number is inversely proportionate to its length. This reduced length {{means that a}} clubhead of the same mass traveling at the same angular velocity (degrees per second, as swung by a golfer) has lower momentum because the clubhead's speed is slower. To combat this, higher-numbered iron clubheads are heavier than lower-numbered iron heads; there is generally a 1/4 oz. (7g) increase in mass between one clubhead and the next higher number.|$|E
50|$|The outer {{universal}} joint allows greater angular changes but not changes in <b>shaft</b> <b>length.</b> It is normally {{a ball and}} cage type with an inner race splined to the intermediate shaft. An outer race is formed in the yoke. The cage retains the balls in location in grooves in both races.The balls transfer the drive from the shaft to the hub and allow for changes in horizontal angle and for a wide steering angle to be achieved. A flexible rubber boot fitted to each joint retains grease and keeps out dirt and moisture.|$|E
2500|$|The {{golf swing}} is {{outwardly}} similar {{to many other}} motions involving swinging a tool or playing implement, such as an axe or a baseball bat; however, unlike many of these motions, {{the result of the}} swing is highly dependent on several sub-motions being properly aligned and timed, to ensure that the club travels up to the ball in line with the desired path, the clubface is in line with the swing path, and the ball impacts the centre or [...] "sweet spot" [...] of the clubface. The ability to do this consistently, across a complete set of clubs {{with a wide range of}} <b>shaft</b> <b>lengths</b> and clubface areas, is a key skill for any golfer, and takes a significant effort to achieve.|$|R

50|$|The planÃ§on Ã  picot, {{or simply}} planÃ§on (also spelled planson), was a medieval {{infantry}} weapon designed for smashing and thrusting. It {{consisted of a}} stout iron-shod baseball-bat-like <b>shaft</b> (<b>length</b> 1-1.5 m) with a steel spike attached on top. It was cheap and easy to make plus it was extremely efficient against heavily armoured opponents. The weapon was a relative of the goedendag, a popular weapon of Flemish militias of the 14th century. Given that the planÃ§on Ã  picot was recorded at several times as being carried alongside the goedendag, {{they may not be}} identical.|$|E
50|$|Bristles are {{composed}} of two parts, the foot and the shaft. The foot is at the proximal end, {{in regards to the}} bristle, and it is the part of the structure that is tucked under the distal end of the scale, under the dome. The foot is flat and bends at a 30Â° to 90Â° angle relative to the shaft. The shaft could be smooth, curved, ribbed, or serrated, and in some species, instead of being a solid bar, it appears rolled up so that the slit running along the <b>shaft</b> <b>length</b> is the point of convergence where both sides meet.|$|E

50|$|A {{swashplate}} {{consists of}} a disk attached to a shaft. If the disk were aligned perpendicular to the shaft, then rotating the shaft would merely turn the disk with no reciprocating (or swashplate) effect. But instead the disk is mounted at an oblique angle, which causes its edge to appear to describe a path that oscillates along the <b>shaft's</b> <b>length</b> as observed from a non-rotating point of view away from the shaft. The greater the disk's angle to the shaft, the more pronounced is this apparent linear motion. The apparent linear motion {{can be turned into}} an actual linear motion by means of a follower that does not turn with the swashplate but presses against one of the disk's two surfaces near its circumference. The device has many similarities to the cam.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} enhance computational efficiency of the nonlinear dynamic analysis of the large-scale deep-hole drilling machine. Based on finite element model, the drilling shaft system is constructed into Timoshenko beam element {{on the basis of}} flexible rotary shaft so as to increase the accuracy of numerical calculation. In order to save the calculation time and resources, modal synthesis technique is adopted to reduce the feature modal of linear freedom degrees of drilling shaft system. As a result, the accuracy required by the non-linear analysis will not be loss. On the basis of these, the whirling characteristics of drilling shaft system are studied under the conditions of different <b>shaft</b> <b>lengths,</b> and simultaneously, the stability patterns of drilling shaft motion and its stability region are obtained in the selected drilling depth and cutting speed parameters while drilling intersection holes...|$|R
