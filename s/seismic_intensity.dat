25|$|The strong ground motion {{registered}} at {{the maximum}} of 7 on the Japan Meteorological Agency <b>seismic</b> <b>intensity</b> scale in Kurihara, Miyagi Prefecture.

25|$|The JMA Scale {{runs from}} 0 to 7, with 7 being the strongest. The Mercalli {{intensity}} scale is sometimes used {{together with the}} Shindo; however this is not usual practice in Japan. Real-time earthquake reports are calculated automatically from measurements of ground acceleration. The JMA reports the earthquake level based on the ground acceleration, measured automatically with <b>seismic</b> <b>intensity</b> meters. There is no simple and linear relationship between Shindo Number and peak ground acceleration as Shindo Number also depend on duration, so {{the values of the}} table below should only be regarded as an approximate orientation.|$|E

In addition to the improvement of site factors, {{it is expected that}} the modification of other empirical relations will lead to an improvement in accuracy. In this section, we discuss the improvement in the accuracy of expected <b>seismic</b> <b>intensities</b> through enhancement of the other empirical relations.|$|R

25|$|The {{instrumental}} scales used {{to describe}} the size of an earthquake began with the Richter magnitude scale in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface wave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale measures the amplitude of the shock, but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency <b>seismic</b> <b>intensity</b> scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects.|$|E

2500|$|The Japan Meteorological Agency <b>seismic</b> <b>{{intensity}}</b> {{scale is}} a seismic scale used in Japan and Taiwan {{to measure the}} intensity of earthquakes. It is measured in units of [...] Unlike magnitude measures such as the moment magnitude scale (Mw), and the earlier Richter magnitude scale, which attempt to describe the energy released by the earthquake, the JMA scale describes the degree of shaking at various points on the Earth's surface, and {{is analogous to the}} Mercalli intensity scale. The intensity of an earthquake is not totally determined by its magnitude, but varies with event's depth, and distance from the event; for example, a quake may be described as [...] "shindo 4 in Tokyo, shindo 3 in Yokohama, shindo 2 in Shizuoka".|$|E

50|$|Much {{of central}} Japan {{experienced}} <b>seismic</b> <b>intensities</b> of 5 (on the JMA scale). Damage from this earthquake was particularly severe {{in the coastal}} areas of Shizuoka Prefecture from Numazu to Tenryu River, with many houses being damaged or destroyed.|$|R
30|$|Further {{enhancements}} in {{the performance}} of the IPF and PLUM methods appear to be possible by incorporating more observational facilities into the system. According to the PLUM method simulations, the size of the blind zone strongly depends on the density of the incorporated seismic network. The size of a blind zone would be further reduced if real-time <b>seismic</b> <b>intensities</b> are available from a denser seismic network (e.g., a low-cost sensor network). The PLUM method may have less difficulty incorporating low-cost sensors since the algorithm it uses is very simple and requires only real-time <b>seismic</b> <b>intensities.</b> In the IPF method, a denser seismic network may further improve the ability of trigger-data discrimination, enabling the IPF method to recognize the spatial distribution of velocity amplitude with a higher resolution.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the first}} time that an {{earthquake}} in Japan was officially measured at a <b>seismic</b> <b>intensity</b> (shindo in Japanese) of the highest Level 7 on the scale of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). After the earthquake, <b>seismic</b> <b>intensity</b> observation in Japan was fully mechanized (from April 1996) and JMA <b>seismic</b> <b>intensity</b> Levels 5 and 6 were each divided into 2 levels (from October 1996).|$|E
5000|$|Maximum <b>seismic</b> <b>intensity</b> (MM IX) {{was located}} in the Mixco area, some {{sections}} of Guatemala City and in Gualán. A <b>seismic</b> <b>intensity</b> of MM VI covered an area of 33,000 km².

50|$|The {{importance}} of a tool to measure earthquake Intensity was already outlined early in the 1990s.

30|$|To {{determine}} the most plausible source-model construction methodology, we compare the <b>seismic</b> <b>intensities</b> calculated from simulated waveforms using the assumed source models with those estimated from the questionnairebased intensities determined by Muramatu and Kominami (1992). The {{sum of the}} squared differences between the <b>seismic</b> <b>intensities</b> obtained from simulated waveforms and those estimated from the questionnaire-based intensities is the smallest in the source model having the following characteristics: (1) the total seismic moment is given by applying the methodology based on seismological scaling relationships, (2) the combined asperity area is specified to be 22 % of the total rupture area (Somerville et al., 1999), (3) the rupture starting point is the northwestern end of the Nukumi segment, and (4) the Gifu-Ichinomiya fault might rupture during the 1891 Nobi earthquake.|$|R
40|$|Since 2008, the Portuguese seismological service, has {{implemented}} the ShakeMap software package provided by U. S.

The maps are produced based on regional constraints from instrumental ground motions and site amplifications. In late 2009, USGS released a new version (V 3. 5) of ShakeMap software with added features.

30|$|We {{examine the}} {{construction}} methodology of a source model for strong ground-motion prediction of scenario earthquakes {{with a long}} active-fault zone including a multi-segment rupture case. For the multi-segment rupture event, different seismic moments are given by applying two different source-model construction methodologies: (1) a methodology based on seismological scaling relationships and (2) a methodology in an active-fault study based on the cascade model (Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities, 1995). The difference between these methodologies {{is whether or not}} a slip of each segment depends on total rupture length. We investigate which construction methodology is more appropriate for the construction of the source model. We use the two methodologies to construct characterized source models for strong ground-motion simulations of the 1891 Nobi earthquake, which was a multi-segment rupture event occurring in the Nobi active-fault system. We evaluate the constructed source models by comparing the <b>seismic</b> <b>intensities</b> obtained from simulated waveforms with those estimated from the questionnaire-based intensities determined by Muramatu and Kominami (1992). The characterized source model constrained by seismological scaling relationships can give a more adequate distribution of the estimated <b>seismic</b> <b>intensities.</b> We also suggest that the Gifu-Ichinomiya fault might be considered as a source fault to explain the damage distribution on the Nobi Plain.|$|R
