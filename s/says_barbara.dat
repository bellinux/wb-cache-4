Researchers at the University of Toronto suggest that ingesting uncooked or unpasteurized {{dairy products}} (see also Raw milk) {{may reduce the}} risk of colorectal cancer. Mice and rats fed uncooked sucrose, casein, and beef tallow had one-third to one-fifth the incidence of microadenomas as the mice and rats fed the same ingredients cooked. This claim, however, is contentious. According to the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, health benefits claimed by raw milk advocates do not exist.

50|$|Initial {{reactions}} to the pilot were lukewarm. While The Guardian described Taylor as 'ever-watchable', it felt {{there was too much}} focus on character at the expense of plot, summing up 'whether or not there's a series in here remains to be seen'. Critics remained ambivalent as Barbara progressed to full series; previewing the second series opener in The Guardian, Jonathan Wright felt the show had become 'an enjoyable slice of mainstream sitcom', but Charlie Catchpole in The Mirror felt Taylor and Kelly were both 'sadly wasted', remarking 'Carlton Television <b>say</b> <b>Barbara</b> is ITV's most popular comedy for five years. I believe them. It's not exactly a crowded field, is it?'. However, every episode of the 1999 and 2002 series was in ITV's top 30 weekly ratings as compiled by BARB and audience figures frequently averaged around 5-7 million viewers, 17 of the episodes winning their slots, meaning they were the most watched shows at the time of broadcast.|$|R

My father was the youngest of us all. Compared with him I was sober and contained. He fidgeted: people remarked upon it. He hummed. But for the stern eye of a thin young man sitting next to him trying to read a paper, I believe he would have broken out into song.

40|$|In her 1937 novel, Slogum House, Mari Sandoz {{turned the}} usual {{stereotype}} of greed and cupidity on its head. Instead of presenting a voracious male rancher aggrandizing his land holdings {{to the detriment}} of hard-working homesteaders, Sandoz created Regula Haber Slogum, a grasping woman who eventually owns nearly an entire county, which she has managed to have named after her family. Although Gulla, as she is known, controls most of Slogum County, she continues brutally to foreclose mortgages and force sheriffs 2 ̆ 7 sales, even during the depression years of the 1930 s. Despite this depiction of what Katharine Mason has called 2 ̆ 2 a caricature of motherhood, 2 ̆ 2 few analysts or critics have analyzed Sandoz 2 ̆ 7 s portrayal of greed as female. Those who have done so have had little to <b>say.</b> <b>Barbara</b> Rippey, in a parenthetical comment, remarked only that a woman who mistreated men and children was 2 ̆ 2 an unlikely thesis 2 ̆ 2 for Sandoz 2 ̆ 7 s era. Scott Greenwell hypothesized that Sandoz had made her antagonist female because she realized that 2 ̆ 2 in the animal kingdom the female is frequently the aggressor with an instinct for acquisitiveness. 2 ̆ 2 These superficial probings leave several crucial questions unanswered. Why did Sandoz choose to portray evil as female rather than male? What did Sandoz convey to readers in making her Devil a woman? Could a Gulla Slogum have, in fact, existed in the late nineteenth- century and early twentieth-century West...|$|R

Carey begged Mary to wait, and went outside the window with them, sitting down under a tree whence the murmured sounds of repetition could be heard, lasting about twenty minutes between the two, and then she returned, the little ones jumping on each side of her, Armine begging that Miss Ogilvie would come and see the museum, and <b>Barbara</b> <b>saying</b> that Jock wanted to help to show it off.|$|R
50|$|Not {{long after}} 1831, Chapman {{and his family}} moved to Santa Barbara, where he {{acquired}} the property near the beach which later became known as Burton Mound.

50|$|The measure has {{remained}} controversial since its passage. Oregon {{remains one of}} only five states without a sales tax, the others being Alaska, Delaware, Montana, and New Hampshire. Furthermore, the measure is blamed for cuts in school programs, the budget crises of 2002 and 2003 and cuts to statewide public safety programs, including deep cuts to the Oregon State Police which never fully recovered from 50% staffing reductions. Many critics <b>say</b> that then-Governor <b>Barbara</b> Roberts' warning that Measure 5's passage would lead to massive chaos has been borne out.

60|$|After that, {{like two}} {{children}} who kiss first, {{and then make}} acquaintance, they stood apart, silent, faintly smiling. It had been given and returned in real sweetness and comradeship, that kiss, for a sign of womanhood making face against the world; but {{now that it was}} over, both felt a little awkward. Would that kiss have been given if Fate had been auspicious? Was it not proof of misery? So Mrs. Noel's smile seemed <b>saying,</b> and <b>Barbara's</b> smile unwillingly admitted. Perceiving that if they talked it could only be about the most ordinary things, they began speaking of music, flowers, and the queerness of bees' legs. But all the time, Barbara, though seemingly unconscious, was noting with her smiling eyes, the tiny movement's, by which one woman can tell what is passing in another. She saw a little quiver tighten the corner of the lips, the eyes suddenly grow large and dark, the thin blouse desperately rise and fall. And her fancy, quickened by last night's memory, saw this woman giving herself up to the memory of love in her thoughts. At this sight she felt a little of that impatience which the conquering feel for the passive, and perhaps just a touch of jealousy.|$|R
