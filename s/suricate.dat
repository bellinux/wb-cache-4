5000|$|The meerkat or <b>suricate</b> (Suricata suricatta) {{is a small}} carnivoran {{belonging}} to the mongoose family (Herpestidae). It is {{the only member of}} the genus Suricata. Meerkats live in all parts of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana, in much of the Namib Desert in Namibia and southwestern Angola, and in South Africa. A group of meerkats is called a [...] "mob", [...] "gang" [...] or [...] "clan". A meerkat clan often contains about 20 meerkats, but some super-families have 50 or more members. In captivity, meerkats have an average life span of 12-14 years, and about half this in the wild.|$|E
40|$|This paper reports four fatal {{cases of}} metastrongylid {{nematode}} Angiostrongylus dujardini infection {{observed in a}} Saguinus oedipus and a Callimico goeldii monkey and in two <b>suricates</b> (Suricata suricatta). All animals were kept in captivity in a zoo of central Italy. The two monkeys died with no premonitory signs, while the two-month-old <b>suricates</b> showed malaise, anorexia and tachypnea {{for a few days}} prior to death. Cardiomegaly and/or granulomatous pneumonia were the major anatomo-pathological findings. Inflammatory lesions were observed in the liver, heart and kidney of the <b>suricates</b> at histology. A. dujardini diagnosis was confirmed through both morphological identification of adult worms recovered at necropsy and molecular characterization of larvae in tissue samples. Callitrichidae and <b>suricates</b> are active predators and maintain their hunting behaviour in captivity and it is then likely that they were exposed to infection by preying on parasitized gastropods, intermediate hosts of A. dujardini, entering zoo enclosures from the surrounding environment. This is the first report of A. dujardini in Italy and in S. suricatta...|$|R
50|$|The yellow {{mongoose}} {{is primarily}} diurnal, though nocturnal activity has been observed. Living in colonies {{of up to}} 20 individuals in a permanent underground burrow complex, the yellow mongoose will often co-exist with Cape ground squirrels or <b>suricates</b> and share maintenance of the warren, adding new tunnels and burrows as necessary. The tunnel system has many entrances, nearby which the yellow mongoose makes its latrines.|$|R
40|$|Human speech encodes both {{referential}} {{and affective}} information, but {{evidence for a}} similar phenomenon in animal vocalizations has been lacking. Recent work on <b>suricates,</b> an African mongoose, shows that animal alarm calls simultaneously encode information about both predator type and the signaler’s perception of urgency. Although Darwin hypothesized that animal signals were primarily manifestations of an individual’s motivation or level of arousal [1], research over the past 20 years has shown that some animal vocalizations – particularl...|$|R
40|$|Field {{observations}} and acoustic analyses {{have shown that}} <b>suricate</b> (Suricata suricatta) alarm calls vary in their acoustic structure depending on predator type. In this study, we tested whether receivers respond appropriately when hearing a call {{in the absence of}} a predator. Although the only way for suricates to escape from predators is to retreat to boltholes, responses to playbacks could be divided into distinct categories. The subjects responded differently to alarm calls given in response to aerial or terrestrial predators and to recruitment calls emitted in response to snakes and deposits on the ground. Suricates also showed rather distinct responses to low, medium and high urgency aerial calls. Differences in the responses were less obvious for different levels of urgency in the terrestrial and recruitment calls. <b>Suricate</b> receivers thus gain information about both the predator type and level of urgency from the acoustic structures of their calls...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>suricate</b> (Suricata suricatta), a cooperatively {{breeding}} mongoose, {{one individual}} typically watches out for predators {{while the rest}} of the group is foraging. Most of the time these sentinels announce their guarding duty with special vocalizations. The response of foraging group members to these calls was investigated by analysing observational data, and by performing playback experiments. The use of special calls by sentinels, and the responses of the foraging group members to them, suggest that the coordination of vigilance is strongly in£uenced by vocal communication. Sentinel calls decreased the time spent alert by the foraging group members. Other group members were less likely to go on guard when a sentinel was vocalizing. Both the proportion of time during which guards overlapped, and the proportion of time the group was unprotected without a guard, decreased when sentinels announced their duty, due to better coordination of the rotation of sentinels. Suricates, however, do not appear to use sentinel calls to mediate a strict rotation of guarding duty...|$|E
40|$|In most respects, the {{demography}} of Kalahari suricates (Suricata suricatta) {{resembles that}} of other social mongooses. Average group size varies from four to nine, and groups typically include several mature females, of which one {{is responsible for the}} majority of breeding attempts. Breeding females show a postpartum oestrus; gestation is around 60 days; litter size is three to five pups at emergence and females rarely breed before the age of 24 months. In contrast, annual survival rates (0. 20 for pups and 0. 43 for animals over one year old) are lower than those recorded in other species. Breeding frequency is related to rainfall and breeding can cease altogether when rainfall is unusually low. In a year when this occurred, group size eroded rapidly and over 60 % of groups became extinct. Total numbers were slow to recover during the following year because emigration by females was infrequent and new groups did not form in vacant ranges created by the extinction of groups. High rates of group extinction have been found in other cooperative breeders and may occur because breeding success and survival show inverse density dependence.

40|$|In {{cooperative}} {{groups of}} <b>suricates</b> (Suricata suricatta), helpers {{of both sexes}} assist breeding adults in defending and feeding pups, and survival rises in larger groups. Despite this, dominant breeding females expel subordinate females from the group {{in the latter half}} of their (own) pregnancy apparently because adult females sometimes kill their pups. Some of the females that have been expelled are allowed to rejoin the group soon after the dominant female's pups are born and subsequently assist in rearing the pups. Female helpers initially resist expulsion and repeatedly attempt to return to their natal group, indicating that it is unlikely that dominant females need to grant them reproductive concessions to retain them in the group...|$|R

Wildlife managers and scientists must address the potential threat that humans pose to the health of free-ranging wildlife. uberculosis (TB), considered an important emerging dis-ease in humans, is now {{the leading cause of death}} in adults worldwide (1). Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the most common infection in humans, M. bovis is responsible for an increasing proportion of human TB cases (1). M. bovis is widespread in domestic animals and has been extensively documented in both captive and free-ranging wildlife popula-tions (2). A number of wildlife populations are endemically infected, for example, the European badger (Meles meles) in the United Kingdom (3) and the African buffalo (Syncerus caf-fer) in South Africa (2). These permanent reservoirs of infec-tion pose a serious threat to public health and TB eradication programs. In contrast, M. tuberculosis is considered primarily a human pathogen and has been reported only in domestic or wildlife species living in close, prolonged contact with humans (4, 5). We describe the first documented outbreak of M. tuberculosis in free-ranging wildlife and discuss the implica-tions for ecotourism and wildlife health.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} unique features of the normal osteology and radiologic anatomy of the thoracic limb of the meerkat or <b>suricate</b> (Suricata suricatta), as no comprehensive information has been published. Bone specimens of 19 suricates were studied. Individual bones of the manus of one preserved carcass were studied in situ. Radiographic evaluation was performed in six animals. Comparisons to domestic carnivores were made and functional morphologic changes were identified. A suprahamate process was present on the scapula spine. Both supratrochlear and supracondylar foramina were present in the distal humerus, with a small Fossa coronoidea seen cranially. The medial epicondyle was markedly larger than the lateral epicondyle. The Tuberositas radii was located caudally. The proximal end of the olecranon was prominent medially. The large medial coronoid process had an extensive proximal articulation facet for the humeral trochlea. The ulna styloid process articulated with the ulnar and accessory carpal bones. The manus was similar to that of domestic carnivores; however, Os metacarpalis I was markedly reduced with the absence of the first digit. There were seven carpal bones. Os carpi radiale was the largest, with a large palmaro-medial process and a small sesamoid bone present medially. Ossa metacarpalia II–V and corresponding phalanges were slender, with an elongated Processus unguicularis (third phalanx) present. Radiologic findings demonstrated increased mobility of the scapula and shoulder joint, with ease of abduction. On the cranio-caudal view of the humerus and elbow joint, the distal radius and manus were consistently rotated in a supinated position. Morphologic changes were identified for the enhanced, predominant function of the shoulder, elbow, carpal, and digital flexor muscles associated with superior digging ability, and supination of the antebrachium and manus. Reference values for size parameters of the long bones are reported. The findings will assist in clinical zoologic medicine and paleozoologic studies. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Disease can {{be caused}} by various species of the genus Mycobacterium. A number of reports, both {{published}} and unpublished, of rarely reported mycobacteria have surfaced in South Africa in the last few years. Some unusual hosts have also been involved, causing concern in some quarters. These include reports on Mycobacterium goodii in a spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta), M. xenopi in a ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), M. intracellulare in wild-caught chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), the 'dassie bacillus' in free ranging rock hyrax (dassies; Procavia capensis) the 'oryx bacillus' from free-ranging buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and M. tuberculosis in <b>suricates</b> (Suricata suricatta), a domestic dog and in baboons. In this article it has been attempted to put these in context and show how improved surveillance and technologies have allowed mycobacteria to be identified to species level more easily. Most of the unusual mycobacterial species have most likely been present in the region for many years and have probably caused disease episodes before, but have been misdiagnosed. Each case must be evaluated carefully with respect to the animal species involved, the environment in which the host is found and the mycobacterial species, and operational decisions made accordingly.

40|$|The {{variation}} in the acoustic structure of alarm calls appears to convey information {{about the level of}} response urgency in some species, while in others it seems to denote the type of predator. While theoretical models and studies on species with functionally referential calls have emphasized that any animal signal considered to have an external referent also includes motivational content, to our knowledge, no empirical study has been able to show this. In this paper, I present an example of a graded alarm call system that combines referential information and also information on the level of urgency. Acoustically different alarm calls in the social mongoose Suricata suricatta are given in response to different predator types, but their call structure also varies depending on the level of urgency. Low urgency calls tend to be harmonic across all predator types, while high urgency calls are noisier. There was less evidence for consistency in the acoustic parameters assigned to particular predator types across different levels of urgency. This suggests that, while <b>suricates</b> convey information about the level of urgency along a general rule, the referential information about each category of predator type is not encoded in an obvious way...|$|R
