25|$|A {{series of}} steps are {{involved}} in analysis of CAPP-Seq data from mutation detection to validation and open source software can {{do most of the}} analysis. After the first step of variant calling, germline and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) mutations are removed in CAPP-seq to reduce the background biases. Several statistical significance tests can be performed against background to all type of variant calling. For example, statistical significance of tumor-derived SNVs can be estimated by random sampling of background alleles using Monte Carlo method. For the indel calls, statistical significance is calculated applying a separate method that used a strand <b>specific</b> <b>analysis</b> by Z-test shown in previous work. Finally, a computational validation steps reduces the false positive calls. However, a robust computational framework specific for CAPP-seq data analysis is a high demand in this field.|$|E

Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidate genes and nucleotides (SNPs). Often, such identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organisational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences.|$|E

A new algorithm of face verification based on client <b>specific</b> discriminant <b>analysis</b> is developed. Two aspects of improvement are made in the new algorithm. First, a dimensionality reduction based on the between-class scatter matrix is introduced which is more efficient than that based on the population scatter matrix. The second improvement lies in the use of a new Fisher criterion function which is introduced {{in order to reduce the}} computational complexity of the client <b>specific</b> discriminant <b>analysis</b> problem. The experimental results obtained on the internationally recognized facial database XM 2 VTS using the Lausanne protocol show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

40|$|In the {{measurement}} of ultra-precision freeform surfaces, least-squares-based form characterization methods are widely {{used to evaluate the}} form error of the measured surfaces. Although many methodologies have been proposed in recent years to improve the efficiency of the characterization process, relatively little research has been conducted on the analysis of associated uncertainty in the characterization results which may result from those characterization methods being used. As a result, this paper presents a task <b>specific</b> uncertainty <b>analysis</b> method with application in the least-squares-based form characterization of ultra-precision freeform surfaces. That is, the associated uncertainty in the form characterization results is estimated when the measured data are extracted from a specific surface with specific sampling strategy. Three factors are considered in this study which include measurement error, surface form error and sample size. The task <b>specific</b> uncertainty <b>analysis</b> method has been evaluated through a series of experiments. The results show that the task <b>specific</b> uncertainty <b>analysis</b> method can effectively estimate the uncertainty of the form characterization results for a specific freeform surface measurement.
