40|$|International audienceThis paper {{considers}} {{the case where}} a dispute occurs between a verifier and a signer {{about the validity of}} a digital signature. In non-repudiation services such dispute may occur long after the <b>signature</b> creation <b>and</b> <b>approval.</b> We present a security model for digital signature validation with the notion of dispute. The first contribution of this paper is the definition of the semantics of a Resolution of Dispute Rule (RDR) in the scope of this model. The second contribution is a calculus for reasoning about the validation of digital signatures at a particular date which may be in the past (so-called long-term signature validation). This calculus is then used to implement the RDR. The usefulness of the calculus is demonstrated through modeling Evidence Record Syntax (ERS), one of the main protocols used in practice for long-term signature validation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Notions of <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> anomaly {{have formed}} the basis of useful methods in cyber defense, but even in {{combination}} provide only weak evidence for recognizing many events of interest. One can recognize many important events without requiring signatures of specific ways the events can take place and without treating every anomalous behavior as an event. We describe an approach to event recognition that subsumes <b>and</b> extends <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> anomaly methods by starting from a richer language for characterizing events. This paper explains how recognition methods based on this richer event-characterization language offer means for overcoming the limitations constraining <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> anomaly methods.

40|$|This {{position}} paper {{is focused on}} what we believe {{is one of the}} most significant issues affecting usage of XML <b>Signature</b> <b>and</b> Encryption in the industry today: performance. We shall briefly describe some performance and scalability issues with respect to implementations of XML <b>Signature</b> <b>and</b> Encryption, and then outline some of the challenges related to implementing a one-pass, or streaming implementation of XML Signature. Overview Many early implementations of XML <b>Signature</b> <b>and</b> Encryption were (and still are) based on the Document Object Model (DOM). DOM was chosen as it provided capabilities that made it suitable for supporting XML <b>Signature</b> <b>and</b> Encryption, such as the ability to navigate the document in any direction and to easily represent XPath node-sets. However, DOM requires an in-memory representation of the document, which can be a major factor that affects performance. The same capabilities of DOM that made it attractive for implementing XML <b>Signature</b> <b>and</b> Encryption also made it unattractive for certain applications of XML <b>Signature</b> <b>and</b> Encryption, such as those that need to validate/decrypt large messages, those that run in a constraine...|$|R
