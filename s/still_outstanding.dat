These figures remain tentative, with exploration or analysis of several deposits <b>still</b> <b>outstanding.</b> Professor Alan R.

5|$|As {{with any}} theory, {{a number of}} mysteries and {{problems}} have arisen {{as a result of}} the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are <b>still</b> <b>outstanding.</b> Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the magnetic monopole problem, and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflationary theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the Big Bang theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.|$|E
5|$|By the June deadline, Laing {{had made}} a payment of $200,000. GEDCA {{requested}} the outstanding $50,000 along with the $100,000 remaining balance to be paid by Laing by the September deadline. When asked by a local talk radio station if the Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon settlement money would be a windfall for GEDCA and {{could be used for}} future economic development projects on Guam, GEDCA administrator Karl Pangelinan stated that the money would barely pay for the legal fees incurred during the years of legal fighting with Laing. In September, Rigel Entertainment declared bankruptcy. On October 26, GEDCA board met and established that Laing {{had made a}} partial late payment of $75,000 on the $150,000 <b>still</b> <b>outstanding.</b> A new deadline was set for January 31, 2013.

5|$|Birmingham City Football Club, an English {{association}} {{football club}} {{based in the}} city of Birmingham, was founded in 1875 as Small Heath Alliance. For their first thirteen years, there was no league football, so matches were arranged on an occasional basis, supplemented by cup competitions organised at both local and national level. In 1888, Small Heath joined the Combination, a league set up to provide organised football for those clubs not invited to join the Football League which was to start the same year.

After two seasons the club turned professional and joined the Football Alliance; the following year they were elected to the newly formed Second Division of the Football League. Their highest finishing positionfifth in the Second Divisionwas achieved in the 1901–02 season, and in the same season they reached the last 16 of the FA Cup for the third time. Lincoln failed to gain re-election to the League three times between 1909 and 1920; on each occasion, they won the championship of the league to which they had been demoted, either the Midland League or, in 1912, the Central League, and made an immediate return to the Football League.|$|E

On 14 January 1925, Maunsell ordered No.790 to be overhauled and trialled on the Central section. As the locomotive proved suitable for the operating conditions of this section, the Southern Railway's Locomotive Committee proceeded with the assembly of the Kclass parts using outside contractors. Nine sets of parts (Nos. A791A799) were conveyed to Armstrong Whitworth for assembly and the finished locomotives delivered in May and June 1925. These were dual-fitted with vacuum and Westinghouse (air) brakes for use with the former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) rolling stock on the Central section. Other differences from the prototype included the relocation of the regulator to the dome and an increase in superheater area. The tenth set of parts was retained by Ashford and used for the first member of the K1class later that year.|$|E
