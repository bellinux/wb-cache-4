40|$|In {{small to}} medium scale {{buildings}} {{located in the}} subtropics, such as Hong Kong, direct expansion air conditioning (DX A/C) systems are widely applied. This is because, as compared to chilled water based central air conditioning systems, DX A/C systems are compact, flexible for multi-room services, energy efficient and cost less to maintain and operate. However, traditionally, a DX A/C system {{is equipped with a}} single-speed compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>fan,</b> and employs ON / OFF control strategy to maintain indoor air temperature only, leaving the indoor moisture content (or relative humidity) uncontrolled. With the introduction of variable speed technology, the speeds of compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>fan</b> can be varied continuously so as to realize the simultaneous control of the indoor temperature and humidity. In this paper, the development of a novel control strategy based on PD law and fuzzy logic is reported. The compressor speed was adjusted directly according to the indoor air moisture content and <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>fan</b> speed according to the indoor air temperature, respectively, to realize the simultaneous control of indoor air temperature and humidity. Controllability tests for the novel control strategy were carried out and the test results suggested that, although two control loops for temperature and humidity were significantly coupled, the simultaneous control of indoor temperature and humidity was achieved with respect to control accuracy and sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|An airflow {{control method}} has been {{developed}} for variable air volume (VAV) systems. This airflow control method is named VSD volumetric tracking (VSDVT) since both the supply and return airflows are determined using signals of the variable speed drives (VSD) instead of the flow stations. Its performance is studied and compared with the fan tracking (FT) method using model simulations. The VSDVT maintains a constant building pressure and the required outside airflow under all load conditions, reduces the annual return air fan energy by up to 50 %, and the annual <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>fan</b> energy by up to 30 %.

40|$|Cooling coils {{provide both}} {{sensible}} cooling and moisture removal. Data from field test {{studies have demonstrated}} that the moisture removal capacity of a cooling coil degrades at part-load conditions, especially when the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>fan</b> operates continuously. Degradation occurs because moisture that condenses on the coil surfaces during the cooling on cycle evaporates back into air stream when the coil is off. This paper presents initial laboratory and field results that characterize the part- load dehumidification performance of various cooling systems. The lab and field measurements compare well to theoretical algorithms that have been developed to predict this part- load phenomenon (Henderson and Rengarajan 1996). The lab data have also confirmed many of the underlying assumptions of the theoretical model. The paper also discusses the types of applications and control modes where part- load latent degradation is the greatest concern...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study {{to develop a}} new control algorithm to replace the traditional on-off control algorithm widely used by direct expansion (DX) air conditioning (A/C) systems, which are widely used in small to medium sized buildings. The new control algorithm, which enables both the compressor and the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>fan</b> in a DX A/C system to operate at high speeds when the indoor air dry bulb temperature setting is not satisfied and at low speeds otherwise, is termed the H-L control. Extensive experiments have been conducted with an experimental DX A/C system at simulated different climates under both H-L and on-off control. The results suggest that the use of H-L control would result in better control performance in terms of an improved indoor humidity level and a higher energy efficiency of the DX A/C system when compared {{to the use of the}} traditional on-off control. The H-L control is also simpler, and its associated hardware cost is much lower than that of the control algorithms based on variable speed technology.

40|$|In recent years, in {{the quest}} focused about energy {{conservative}} building design, as a high efficiency air conditioning scheme, the variable air volume (VAV) systems owe their growing popularity in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) applications. This paper reports the simulation study to investigate the inherent operational characteristics of direct expansion (DX) VAV air conditioning (A/C) unit when the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>fan</b> and compressor speeds are varied based on the thermal load persisting in the conditioned space. Based on the Matlab-Simulink environment, a new fuzzy based simulation model of the DX VAV system has been developed and the energy utilization of the air conditioning system is investigated by incorporating the concept of combined economizer cycle (EC) and demand controlled ventilation (DCV) techniques into the simulated model. Indoor air quality (IAQ) is addressed under DCV and combined DCV-EC modes of ventilation. Simulation results obtained for the DX VAV A/C system are compared with the conventional constant air volume (CAV) system. The results infer that the fuzzy control methodology and algorithm developed are feasible with a proper control of IAQ being achieved.

It includes {{a discussion of}} how the MotorMaster software {{can be used to}} conduct motor replacement analyses. Motors rarely operate at their full-load point. Field tests of 60 motors at four industrial plants indicate that, on average, they operate at 60 % of their rated load. 1 Motors that drive <b>supply</b> or return <b>air</b> <b>fans</b> in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems generally operate at 70 % to 75 % of rated load. 2 A persistent myth is that oversized motors, especially motors operating below 50 % of rated load, are not efficient and should be immediately replaced with appropriately sized energy-efficient units. In actuality, several pieces of information are required to complete an accurate assessment of energy savings. They are the load on the motor, the operating efficiency of the motor at that load point, the full-load speed (in revolutions per minute [rpm]) of the motor to be replaced, and the full-load speed of the downsized replacement motor. 3 Motor Load Estimation Techniques Operating efficiency and motor load values must be assumed or based on field measurements an...|$|R

Dynamic tests at damper frequencies up to 5 Hz showed very different flow characteristics when compared with steady-state flow, particularly with respect to peak pressures and the pressure-flow relationship at fan stall and unstall.

40|$|During {{the summer}} 2007 smart {{operation}} strategies for air-conditioning (A/C) and lighting systems were developed and {{tested in a}} number of governmental buildings in Kuwait as one of the solutions to reduce the national peak demand for electrical power that commonly occur around 15 : 00 h. The working hours for these building are generally between 07 : 00 and 14 : 00 h and their peak demand exceeds 600 MW. The smart operation strategies implemented in these buildings included pre-closing treatment (PCT) between 13 : 00 and 14 : 00 h and time-of-day control (TDC) after 14 : 00 h. Also de-lamping was carried out in some of the buildings to readjust the higher than recommended illumination levels. This paper presents the achievements of implementing these smart operations strategies in Justice Palace Complex (JPC) as a case study. The peak load of this building was 3700 kW.

40|$|In a {{variable}} air volume (VAV) system with 100 % outdoor air, the cooling {{need in the}} building is satisfied with a certain air flow at a certain <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> temperature.

40|$|Most air {{handling}} units (AHUs) in commercial buildings have an air economizer cycle for free cooling under certain outside air conditions. During the economizer cycle, the outside air and return air dampers are modulated to seek mixing <b>air</b> temperature at <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> temperature setpoint. Mechanical cooling is always required when outside air temperature {{is higher than the}} <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> temperature setpoint. Generally the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> temperature setpoint is set at 55 ?F for space humidity control. Actually the dehumidification is not necessary when outside air dew point is less than 55 ?F. Meanwhile the space may have less cooling load due to envelope heat loss and/or occupant schedule. These provide an opportunity to use higher <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> temperature to reduce or eliminate mechanical cooling and terminal box reheat. On the other hand the higher <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> temperature will require higher air flow as well as higher fan power. Therefore the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> temperature has to be optimized to minimize the combined energy for fan, cooling and heating energy.
