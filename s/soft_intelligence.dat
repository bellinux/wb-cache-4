60|$|In {{the mean}} time {{the friends of}} the old man {{continued}} to advance. Middleton himself was foremost, supporting the light and aerial looking figure of Inez, on whose anxious countenance he cast such occasional glances of tender interest as, in similar circumstances, a father would have given to his child. Paul led Ellen, close in their rear. But while the eye of the bee-hunter did not neglect his blooming companion, it scowled angrily, resembling more the aspect of the sullen and retreating bear than the <b>soft</b> <b>intelligence</b> of a favoured suitor. Obed and Asinus came last, the former leading his companion with a degree of fondness that could hardly be said to be exceeded by any other of the party. The approach of the naturalist was far less rapid than that of those who preceded him. His feet seemed equally reluctant to advance, or to remain stationary; his position bearing a great analogy to that of Mahomet's coffin, with the exception that the quality of repulsion rather than that of attraction held him in a state of rest. The repulsive power in his rear however appeared to predominate, and by a singular exception, as he would have said himself, to all philosophical principles, it rather increased than diminished by distance. As the eyes of the naturalist steadily maintained a position that was the opposite of his route, they served to give a direction to those of the observers of all these movements, and at once furnished a sufficient clue by which to unravel the mystery of so sudden a debouchement from the cover.|$|E
60|$|The active exertion, with {{intervals}} of placid drifting along the land-locked shore, somewhat soothed him. The heaving Pacific beyond was partly {{hidden in a}} low creeping fog, but the curving bay was softly radiant. The rocks whereon she sat that morning, the hotel where she was now quietly reading, were outlined in black and silver. In this dangerous contiguity {{it seemed to him}} that her presence returned,--not the woman who had met him so coldly; who had penned those lines; the woman from whom he was now parting forever, but the blameless ideal he had worshiped from the first, and which he now felt could never pass out of his life again! He recalled their long talks, their rarer rides and walks in the city; her quick appreciation and ready sympathy; her pretty curiosity and half-maternal consideration of his foolish youthful past; even the playful way that she sometimes seemed to make herself younger as if to better understand him. Lingering at times in the shadow of the headland, he fancied he saw the delicate nervous outlines of her face near his own again; the faint shading of her brown lashes, the <b>soft</b> <b>intelligence</b> of her gray eyes. Drifting idly in the placid moonlight, pulling feverishly across the swell of the channel, or lying on his oars in the shallows of the rocks, but always following the curves of the bay, like a bird circling around a lighthouse, it was far in the night before he at last dragged his boat upon the sand. Then he turned to look once more at her distant window. He would be away in the morning and he should never see it again! It was very late, but the blue light seemed to be still burning unalterably and inflexibly.|$|E

40|$|Patients, clinicians and {{managers}} {{all want to}} be reassured that their healthcare organisation is safe. But there is no consensus about what we mean when we ask whether a healthcare organisation is safe or how this is achieved. In the UK, the measurement of harm, so important in the evolution of patient safety, has been neglected in favour of incident reporting. The use of <b>softer</b> <b>intelligence</b> for monitoring and anticipation of problems receives little mention in official policy. The Francis Inquiry report into patient treatment at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust set out 29 recommendations on measurement, more than on any other topic, and set the measurement of safety an absolute priority for healthcare organisations. The Berwick review found that most healthcare organisations at present have very little capacity to analyse, monitor or learn from safety and quality information. This paper summarises the findings of a more extensive report and proposes a framework which can guide clinical teams and healthcare organisations in the measurement and monitoring of safety and in reviewing progress against safety objectives. The framework has been used so far to promote self-reflection at both board and clinical team level, to stimulate an organisational check or analysis in the gaps of information and to promote discussion of 'what could we do differently'...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFormal metrics for {{monitoring}} {{the quality and}} safety of healthcare have a valuable role, but may not, by themselves, yield full insight into the range of fallibilities in organizations. ‘Soft intelligence’ is usefully understood as the processes and behaviours associated with seeking and interpreting soft data—of the kind that evade easy capture, straightforward classification and simple quantification—to produce forms of knowledge that can {{provide the basis for}} intervention. With the aim of examining current and potential practice in relation to <b>soft</b> <b>intelligence,</b> we conducted and analysed 107 in-depth qualitative interviews with senior leaders, including managers and clinicians, involved in healthcare quality and safety in the English National Health Service. We found that participants were in little doubt about the value of softer forms of data, especially for their role in revealing troubling issues that might be obscured by conventional metrics. Their struggles lay in how to access softer data and turn them into a useful form of knowing. Some of the dominant approaches they used risked replicating the limitations of hard, quantitative data. They relied on processes of aggregation and triangulation that prioritised reliability, or on instrumental use of soft data to animate the metrics. The unpredictable, untameable, spontaneous quality of soft data could be lost in efforts to systematize their collection and interpretation to render them more tractable. A more challenging but potentially rewarding approach involved processes and behaviours aimed at disrupting taken-for-granted assumptions about quality, safety, and organizational performance. This approach, which explicitly values the seeking out and the hearing of multiple voices, is consistent with conceptual frameworks of organizational sensemaking and dialogical understandings of knowledge. Using <b>soft</b> <b>intelligence</b> this way can be challenging and discomfiting, but may offer a critical defence against the complacency that can precede crisis...|$|E
40|$|Disease {{surveillance}} is {{the collection}} and analysis health data to provide information for action and to inform decisions relating to public health policy. Surveillance systems in the UK typically rely on data about diagnoses made by clinicians, or laboratory confirmations of specific disease pathogens. In recent {{years there has been}} a growth in syndromic surveillance systems that collect and analyse pre-diagnostic information in real-time in order to provide early warning of rises in disease, and estimate the health status of the community. The research question of this thesis is: “What is contribution of NHS Direct data to health protection surveillance in England and Wales?” NHS Direct is a nurse-led health helpline (telehealth system) available to the entire population of England and Wales. Health protection surveillance is the surveillance of infectious diseases and environmental hazards that may pose a threat to public health. NHS Direct data are suitable for surveillance purposes because they are broadly representative of the health seeking behaviour of those aged below 65 years in England and Wales, and are available nationally on a daily basis. The seasonality of syndromes indicative of infection is largely determined by viral rather than bacterial diseases. Half the seasonal variation in respiratory syndromes reported to NHS Direct is estimated to be due to RSV and influenza. Rotavirus and norovirus are estimated {{to be the most important}} enteric pathogens determining the seasonality of diarrhoea and vomiting calls. The surveillance system has detected seasonal trends and acute rises in these syndromes at both regional and national level. However, retrospective analyses and operational results have not, in any consistent way, demonstrated value for local outbreak detection. The main added value of these data for health protection is for influenza surveillance. Numerical threshold values for calls about the ‘cold/flu’ and fever syndromes consistently provide 1 - 2 weeks advance warning of national rises in influenza A and B. Spatio-temporal analysis of fever calls about school aged children also provided a unique description of the spatial evolution of a national influenza outbreak, with utility for local and national surveillance. Additionally, self-sampling by NHS Direct callers is a feasible method of providing laboratory diagnoses, and enhancing community surveillance schemes. NHS Direct syndromic data have also been used for providing early warning of regional and national rises in viral gastroenteritis, heatstroke, hay fever. When interviewed, the system’s users (those who receive surveillance alerts) reported additional benefits of the system were for validating other hard and <b>soft</b> <b>intelligence</b> sources, managing winter pressures on the NHS, surveillance response and reassurance during major incidents, and handling the media. It is recommended that the HPA explore further the use of the data for prospective geographical surveillance of influenza, norovirus and heatstroke. Also that the HPA and NHS Direct attempt to extract data about multiple symptoms linked to a single NHS Direct caller. Finally, other countries should consider surveillance of telehealth data if there is a perceived need to develop real-time monitoring of common syndromes (i. e. there are recognised shortfalls in existing primary care surveillance) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Recent {{high-profile}} reports {{into serious}} failings {{in the quality}} of hospital care in the NHS raise concerns over the ability of trust boards to discharge their duties effectively. Objectives: Our study aimed to generate theoretically grounded empirical evidence on the associations between board governance, patient safety processes and patient-centred outcomes. The specific aims were as follows: (1) to identify the types of governance activities undertaken by hospital trust boards in the English NHS with regard to ensuring safe care in their organisation; (2) in foundation trusts, to explore the role of boards and boards of governors with regards to the oversight of patient safety in their organisation; (3) to assess the association between particular hospital trust board oversight activities and patient safety processes and clinical outcomes; (4) to identify the facilitators and barriers to developing effective hospital trust board governance of safe care; and (5) {{to assess the impact of}} external commissioning arrangements and incentives on hospital trust board oversight of patient safety. Methods: The study comprised three distinct but interlocking strands: (1) a narrative systematic review in order to describe, interpret and synthesise key findings and debates concerning board oversight of patient safety; (2) in-depth mixed-methods case studies in four organisations to assess the impact of hospital board governance and external incentives on patient safety processes and outcomes; and (3) two national surveys exploring board management in NHS acute and specialist hospital trusts in England, and relating board characteristics to whole-organisation outcomes. Results: A very high proportion of trust boards reported the kinds of desirable characteristics and board-related processes that research says may be associated with higher performance. Our analysis of the symbolic aspects of board activities highlights the role and differences in local processes of organising the governance of patient safety. Most boards do allocate considerable amount of time to discussing patient safety and quality-related issues and were using a wide range of hard performance metrics and <b>soft</b> <b>intelligence</b> to monitor its organisation with regard to patient safety. Although the board of governors is generally perceived to be well-meaning, they were also considered to be being largely ineffective in helping to promote and deliver safer care for their organisations. We did not find any statistically significant relationship between board attributes (self-reported) and processes and any patient safety outcome measures. However, we did find a significant relationship between two dimensions of the Board Self-Assessment Questionnaire and two specific-and-related national staff survey organisational ‘process’ measures: (1) staff feeling safe to raise concerns about errors, near-misses and incidents and (2) staff feeling confident that their organisation would address their concerns, if raised. We also found that contracting and external financial incentives appeared to play only a relatively minor role in incentivising quality and safety improvement. Conclusions: Our research is the first large-scale mixed-methods study of hospital board activity and behaviour related to the oversight of patient safety in the English NHS and the key findings should be used to influence the design of future governance arrangements as well as the training and support of board.

40|$|Silicone based {{compliant}} and unobtrusive wireless sensor nodes on the skin, {{so called}} biopatches or biostamps, have good potential to revolutionize precision medicine. In much, their promise comes from being unobtrusive in similar manner as contact lenses are compared to eye-glasses. Also, they have intrinsic advantages in their compliancy and direct contact {{to the body}} in applications like physical sensors for biomechanical readout, sweat biomarker sensors, optically based non-invasive sensors for various blood stream data, and planar electrophysiological arrays. [i] Our group initiated the use of liquid alloys for stretchable RF-electronics. [ii] The primary objective was to provide large cross-sections with high compliancy for low resistance also in larger areas and components needed in high quality RF-circuits. In addition, the liquid alloy provided a sliding contact to the embedded modules and with that contact robust against large strains. Most recently, we have introduced a very compliant and adhesive PDMS elastomer (named S 3 -PDMS for soft, stretchable and sticky PDMS), which not only allows for better contact to the skin but also increases the adhesion between the embedded modules and the elastomer. [iii] With these improvements, we now {{believe that it is}} possible to make also thicker biopatches unobtrusive, allowing for reusable gadgets, and circuits and devices which demand more volume. At the moment we are investigating how such biopatches should be used in biomechanical medicine. Our technology development is built on batch-wise printed circuit board production with good prospects for medium-sized series. However, to truly revolutionize the precision of precision medicine, the continuous sensoric feedback that supports the medical treatment should be tailored for each person’s needs. Hence, we aim for serial production of very small customized series of sensors as prescribed by your doctor. [i] T. Q. Trung and N. -E.

The motive for this interest was the promises of certain information processing characteristics, which are similar to some extend, to those of human brain. The immediate examples of these include an ability to learn and generalize. In parallel to this and further developments in the information systems technology, established the essential motivation that the construction industry should benefit from these developments for enhanced and effective executions. Today such information processing methods are collectively referred to as soft computing (SC). Explicitly, soft computing is an emerging approach to computing which parallels the remarkable ability of the human mind to reason and learn in an environment of certainty and imprecision. SC consists of several computing paradigms, including neural networks, fuzzy set theory, approximate reasoning and combinatorial optimization methods such as genetic algorithms. SC finds important applications in diverse disciplines. As a branch of artificial <b>intelligence,</b> <b>soft</b> computing is closely related to computational intelligence where in essence SC methods are implemented by machine learning techniques. Paper deals with SC in the context of construction information technology (CIT) pointing out the important role it can play. It exemplifies the SC applications in CIT supported by pilot implementations, which are carried out as a part of ongoing departmental research program. Architecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R
40|$|Background : In {{adolescence}} often incompatibility between {{psychological and}} social development. If this incompatibility is not be good overcome can be mired in negative behaviors. One of the negative behavior is free sex. According to suvey of BKKBN in 2008 showed about 63 % of adolescents in Indonesia ever done free sex. This sexual behavior is motivated by inherent factors in himself. These factors were grouped into hard skill and soft skill factors. The aim {{of this research was}} to know the influence of hard skill and soft skill factors with sexual behavior in adolescents at Seberang Ilir area of Palembang city. Method : This study is a quantitative research with cross sectional approach. The method used by distributing questionnaires. Data collected and processed using SPSS program and performed univariate analisys and bivariate analysis. Study sample was adolescent living in 12 districts at Seberang Ilir area of Palembang city with 96 respondents sample. Result : The research indicated that there was influence between knowledge (Pvalue= 0, 000), emotional intelligence (Pvalue= 0, 016), moral intelligence (Pvalue= 0, 005), hard skill (Pvalue= 0, 000), and soft skill (Pvalue= 0, 003) with sexual behavior in adolescent. Conclusion : The factors of hard skills and soft skill have influence with sexual behavior in adolescents. Need an increase in hard skill (knowledge), and <b>soft</b> skills (emotional <b>intelligence</b> and moral intelligence) so that the adolescent can avoid sexual behavior...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, the {{modelling}} {{techniques of}} PV panels from I-V characteristics are discussed. At the beginning, a necessary review {{on the various}} methods are presented, where difficulties in mathematics, drawbacks in accuracy, and challenges in implementation are highlighted. Next, a novel approach based on linear system identification is demonstrated in detail. Other than the prevailing methods of using approximation (analytical methods), iterative searching (classical optimization), or <b>soft</b> computing (artificial <b>intelligence),</b> the proposed method regards the PV diode model as the equivalent output of a dynamic system, so the diode model parameters {{can be linked to}} the transfer function coefficients of the same dynamic system. In this way, the problem of solving PV model parameters is equivalently converted to system identification in control theory, which can be perfectly solved by a simple integral-based linear least square method. Graphical meanings of the proposed method are illustrated to help readers understand the underlying principles. As compared to other methods, the proposed one has the following benefits: 1) unique solution; 2) no iterative or global searching; 3) easy to implement (linear least square); 4) accuracy; 5) extendable to multi-diode models. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by indoor and outdoor PV module testing results. In addition, possible applications of the proposed method are discussed like online PV monitoring and diagnostics, noncontact measurement of POA irradiance and cell temperature, fast model identification for satellite PV panels, and etc...|$|R
40|$|The {{explosive}} growth of biological information {{generated by the}} scientific community {{all over the world}} has led to storage of voluminous data. This torrent of information has, in turn, led to an supreme requirement for computerized databases to store, categorize, and index the data and for specialized tools to view and analyze the data. Bioinformatics is the analysis of biological information using computers and statistical techniques; the science of developing and utilizing computer databases and algorithms to accelerate and enhance biological research. Computers are used to gather, store, analyze and integrate biological and genetic information which can then be applied to gene-based drug discovery and development. Data mining or knowledge discovery from data (KDD), is used to extract interesting, nontrivial, implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information from data. Soft computing differs from conventional (hard) computing in that, unlike hard computing, it is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation. The guiding principle of soft computing is to exploit the tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation to achieve tractability, robustness and low solution cost for the emerging field of conceptual <b>intelligence.</b> <b>Soft</b> computing includes the techniques such as fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms,etc. The methodologies of soft computing are complementary rather than competitive and they {{can be viewed as a}} foundation component. This paper will focus on issues related to data mining and soft computing and relevance of these in bioinformatics. Further the paper focuses on some of its current applications...|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this book}} is based on {{philosophical}} as well as logical views {{on the subject of}} decoding the ‘progress’ of decision making process in the cognition system of a decision maker (be it a human or an animal or a bird or any living thing which has a brain) while evaluating the membership value µ(x) in a fuzzy set or in an intuitionistic fuzzy set or in any such soft computing set model or in a crisp set. A new theory is introduced called by “Theory of CIFS”. The following two hypothesis are hidden facts in fuzzy computing or in any soft computing process :- Fact- 1 : A decision maker (intelligent agent) can never use or apply ‘fuzzy theory’ or any soft-computing set theory without intuitionistic fuzzy system. Fact- 2 : The Fact- 1 does not necessarily require that a fuzzy decision maker (or a crisp ordinary decision maker or a decision maker with any other soft theory models or a decision maker like animal/bird which has brain, etc.) must be aware or knowledgeable about IFS Theory! The “Theory of CIFS” is developed with a careful analysis unearthing the correctness of these two facts. Two examples of ‘decision making problems’ with complete solutions are presented out of which one example will show the dominance of the application potential of intuitionistic fuzzy set theory over fuzzy set theory, and the other will show the converse i. e. the dominance of the application potential of fuzzy set theory over intuitionistic fuzzy set theory in some cases. The “Theory of CIFS” may be viewed to belong to the subjects : Theory of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets, <b>Soft</b> Computing, Artificial <b>Intelligence,</b> etc...|$|R
