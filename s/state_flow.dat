2500|$|Under steady <b>state</b> <b>flow</b> {{conditions}} (e.g. no flood wave), {{open channel}} flow can be subdivided into three types of flow: uniform flow, gradually varying flow, and rapidly varying flow. [...] Uniform flow describes a situation where flow depth does not change with distance along the channel. [...] This can only occur in a smooth channel that does not experience any changes in flow, channel geometry, roughness or channel slope. [...] During uniform flow, the flow depth is known as normal depth (yn). [...] This depth {{is analogous to the}} terminal velocity of an object in free fall, where gravity and frictional forces are in balance (Moglen, 2013). [...] Typically, this depth is calculated using the Manning formula. [...] Gradually varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is very small. [...] In this case, hydrostatic relationships developed for uniform flow still apply. [...] Examples of this include the backwater behind an in-stream structure (e.g. dam, sluice gate, weir, etc.), when there is a constriction in the channel, and when there is a minor change in channel slope. [...] Rapidly varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is significant. In this case, hydrostatics relationships are not appropriate for analytical solutions, and continuity of momentum must be employed. [...] Examples of this include large changes in slope like a spillway, abrupt constriction/expansion of flow, or a hydraulic jump.|$|E

40|$|We study in-gap {{electronic}} states {{induced by}} a nonmagnetic defect with short-range potential in two-dimensional topological insulators and trace their evolution as {{the distance between}} the defect and the boundary changes. The defect located far from the boundary is found to produce two bound states independently of the sign of its potential. The states are classified as electronlike and holelike. Each of these states can have two types of the spatial distribution of the electron density. The first-type states have a maximum of the density in the center and the second-type ones have a minimum. When the defect is coupled with the boundary, the bound states are transformed correspondingly into resonances of two types and take up the form of the edge <b>states</b> <b>flowing</b> around the defect. Under certain conditions, two resonances interfere giving rise to the formation of a bound state embedded into the continuum spectrum of the edge <b>states</b> <b>flowing</b> around the defect. We calculate the spatial distribution of the electron density in the edge <b>states</b> <b>flowing</b> around the defect and estimate the charge accumulated near the defect. The current density field of the edge <b>states</b> <b>flowing</b> around the defect contains two components one of which flows around the defect and the other circulates around it.

50|$|The {{initial stage}} of the natural {{transition}} process {{is known as the}} Receptivity phase and consists of the transformation of environmental disturbances - both acoustic (sound) and vortical (turbulence) - into small perturbations within the boundary layer. The mechanisms by which these disturbances arise are varied and include freestream sound and/or turbulence interacting with surface curvature, shape discontinuities and surface roughness. These initial conditions are small, often unmeasurable perturbations to the basic <b>state</b> <b>flow.</b> From here, the growth (or decay) of these disturbances depends {{on the nature of the}} disturbance and the nature of the basic state. Acoustic disturbances tend to excite two-dimensional instabilities such as Tollmien-Schlichting waves (T-S waves), while vortical disturbances tend to lead to the growth of three-dimensional phenomena such as the crossflow instability.|$|E

5000|$|The {{red blood}} cell is highly {{flexible}} and biconcave in shape. Its membrane has a Young's modulus {{in the region of}} 106 Pa. Deformation in {{red blood cell}}s is induced by shear stress. When a suspension is sheared, the red blood cells deform and spin because of the velocity gradient, with the rate of deformation and spin depending on the shear-rate and the concentration.This can influence the mechanics of the circulation and may complicate the measurement of blood viscosity. It is true that in a steady <b>state</b> <b>flow</b> of a viscous fluid through a rigid spherical body immersed in the fluid, where we assume the inertia is negligible in such a flow, it is believed that the downward gravitational force of the particle is balanced by the viscous drag force. From this force balance the speed of fall can be shown to be given by Stokes' law [...] Where a is the particle radius, ρp, ρf are the respectively particle and fluid density μ is the fluid viscosity, g is the gravitational acceleration. From the above equation we can see that the sedimentation velocity of the particle depends on the square of the radius. If the particle is released from rest in the fluid, its sedimentation velocity Us increases until it attains the steady value called the terminal velocity (U), as shown above.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} fundamental nonlinear {{dynamics of}} ferrofluidic Taylor-Couette flow - flow confined between two concentric independently rotating cylinders - consider small aspect ratio by solving the ferrohydrodynamical equations, carrying out systematic bifurcation analysis. Without magnetic field, we find steady flow patterns, previously observed {{with a simple}} fluid, such as those containing normal one- or two vortex cells, as well as anomalous one-cell and twin-cell <b>flow</b> <b>states.</b> However, when a symmetry-breaking transverse magnetic field is present, all <b>flow</b> <b>states</b> exhibit stimulated, finite two-fold mode. Various bifurcations between steady and unsteady states can occur, corresponding to the transitions between the two-cell and one-cell states. While unsteady, axially oscillating <b>flow</b> <b>states</b> can arise, we also detect {{the emergence of new}} unsteady <b>flow</b> <b>states.</b> In particular, we uncover two new states: one contains only the azimuthally oscillating solution in the configuration of the twin-cell <b>flow</b> <b>state,</b> and another a rotating <b>flow</b> <b>state.</b> Topologically, these <b>flow</b> <b>states</b> are a limit cycle and a quasiperiodic solution on a two-torus, respectively. Emergence of new <b>flow</b> <b>states</b> in addition to observed ones with classical fluid, indicates that richer but potentially more controllable dynamics in ferrofluidic flows, as such <b>flow</b> <b>states</b> depend on the external magnetic field.
