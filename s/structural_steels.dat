2500|$|In welding, {{equivalent}} {{carbon content}} (C.E) {{is used to}} understand how the different alloying elements affect hardness of the steel being welded. This is then directly related to hydrogen-induced cold cracking, which is the most common weld defect for steel, thus it is most commonly used to determine weldability. Higher concentrations of carbon and other alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, silicon, molybdenum, vanadium, copper, and nickel tend to increase hardness and decrease weldability. Each of these elements tends to influence the hardness and weldability of the steel to different magnitudes, however, making a method of comparison necessary to judge the difference in hardness between two alloys made of different alloying elements. There are two commonly used formulas for calculating the equivalent carbon content. One is from the American Welding Society (AWS) and recommended for <b>structural</b> <b>steels</b> and the other is the formula based on the International Institute of Welding (IIW).|$|E

50|$|Until {{relatively}} recently, <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> connections {{were either}} welded or riveted. High-strength bolts have largely replaced <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> rivets.

In this paper, the electronic structure and mechanical properties of carbon <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> in quenched state were calculated by the empirical electron theory of solids and molecules (EET).

40|$|GJ {{steel is}} {{a new type of}} {{high-performance}} <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> which has been increasingly adopted in practical engineering. Q 460 GJ <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> has a nominal yield strength of 460 MPa, which does not decrease significantly with the increase of steel plate thickness like normal <b>structural</b> <b>steel.</b> Thus, Q 460 GJ <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> is normally used in medium-walled welded sections. However, research works on the residual stress in GJ steel members are few though {{it is one of the}} vital factors that can affect the member and structural behavior. This article aims to investigate the residual stresses in welded I-shaped sections fabricated from Q 460 GJ <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> plates by experimental tests. A total of four full scale welded medium-walled I-shaped sections were tested by sectioning method. Both circular curve correction method and straightening measurement method were adopted in this study to obtain the final magnitude and distribution of the longitudinal residual stresses. In addition, this paper also explores the interaction between flanges and webs. And based on the statistical evaluation of the experimental data, a multilayer residual stress model is proposed...|$|R

50|$|But {{a problem}} arose for the NRL {{researchers}} because naval materials, e.g., ship-plate steel, are not perfectly elastic but undergo significant plastic deformation {{at the tip}} of a crack. One basic assumption in Irwin's linear elastic fracture mechanics is small scale yielding, the condition that the size of the plastic zone is small compared to the crack length. However, this assumption is quite restrictive for certain types of failure in <b>structural</b> <b>steels</b> though such steels can be prone to brittle fracture, which has led to a number of catastrophic failures.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, {{the first}} {{parameter}} for {{the determination of}} fracture toughness in the elasto-plastic region was the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) or [...] "opening {{at the apex of}} the crack" [...] indicated. This parameter was determined by Wells during the studies of <b>structural</b> <b>steels</b> which, due to the high toughness could not be characterized with the linear elastic fracture mechanics model. He noted that, before the fracture happened, the walls of the crack were leaving and that the crack tip, after fracture, ranged from acute to rounded off due to plastic deformation. In addition, the rounding of the crack tip was more pronounced in steels with superior toughness.|$|E
