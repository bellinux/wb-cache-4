40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in how multinational corporations transfer various management practices {{from one country to}} another. The positions vary from an extreme where all practices will become globally standardised; to claims that the local context will be a decisive factor. In this article, the research question is why an MNC would want to transfer the partnership practice and what the key elements to success might be. As pointed to, partnership {{is a part of the}} company's business system, the way they are used to operating. Also important is that the risk of failing in terms of technological issues was important, and thus commitment and cooperation are crucial.

40|$|Since the Second World War the <b>shop</b> <b>steward's</b> role at plant {{level has}} been growing, {{involving}} stewards in {{various levels of}} company decision-making machinery which has encouraged them to develop a role and identity not always compatible with their role as seen by the trade union external {{to the place of}} work.

40|$|An {{important}} role of the <b>shop</b> <b>steward</b> is negotiating with management {{on behalf of the}} employees. Acting as a mediator between management and their co-workers, they find themselves often in a challenging position, and in many European countries it becomes more and more difficult to attract and maintain competent <b>shop</b> <b>stewards.</b> In this, it is remarkable, that still {{only a small percentage of}} <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> appear to be female, compared with men. Do women also have a different idea on the role of a <b>shop</b> <b>steward,</b> and have different ways of negotiating and conflict management? In this project we explore the experience of work by male and female <b>shop</b> <b>stewards.</b> Do they perceive different levels of stress in their role, and different demands and job resources? And is their approach to conflict and conflict management different from their male colleagues? In the following study we analyze a sample of more than 2000 <b>shop</b> <b>stewards,</b> both male and female, from five European countries (Spain, Belgium, Holland, Denmark and Germany) to investigate these issues. We arrive at the conclusion that women perceive autonomy and social support differently than men, but only in the more masculine countries. Whereas, in the more feminine ones the perception is similar. Consequently, the conflict management behavior of men and women is affected differently. We focus on the accommodating behavior in women, which we see as detrimental to their position and the holding of power inside the organizations.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the role of the Danish <b>shop</b> <b>steward</b> system at five {{manufacturing}} firms which have introduced more flexible management systems during 1993 - 95. The firms {{have been part of the}} DISKO survey which covered 1900 Danish private firms ([URL] // www. business. auc. dk/ ike/ disko/). The analysis is based upon the survey as well as follow-up interviews with managers and <b>shop</b> <b>stewards.</b> In focus are questions about the shop stewards’ contribution to organisational development, agreement and disagreement between management and employees and their <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> regarding flexibility measures, and the shop stewards’ capability of taking care of the employees’ interests. The main results show that the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> support the management regarding organisational development based upon the stewards’ detailed knowledge of their colleagues’ qualifications and attitudes and so the stewards help changes to start where the potential is present. Parallel to these activities the <b>shop</b> <b>steward</b> is an advocate of broad vocational training measures directed towards change itself as well as relevant tasks and the use of training methods which are accepted by the employees. The shop stewards’ activities are based upon an extensive agreement among the management, employees and <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> regarding cooperation at the workplace. Nevertheless, at certain points four of the five firms had experienced confrontations because of management’s initiatives directed towards more flexibility. These confrontations included the change towards wages by results and qualifications, because of disagreements on criteria and the extent of wage differentiation. Other points comprised job demarcations and reductions of the work force. In such cases the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> tried to find solutions which secured a balance which could be accepted of the colleagues as well as the management, but also outright stop of further changes of job demarcations were part of the stewards’ actions. At the end of the paper these results are the basis for an evaluation of the strong and weak points of the <b>shop</b> <b>steward</b> system with regard to organisational change towards more flexible firms and they are compared with the results of two other Danish investigations and a european project on direct employee participation. <b>Shop</b> <b>stewards,</b> employee representatives, flexibility, human resource management...|$|R

40|$|Characteristics {{known from}} Human Resource Management have {{recently}} been reintroduced through terms such as high involvement workplace practices (Geary, 2003; Gill, 2009; Pil & MacDuffie, 1996). These work forms emphasize the integration of business and employee relations strategy, and labor-management cooperation for the achievement of organizational goals (Gollan & Davis, 2001). Most of this literature leaves out the unions and concentrates to a larger extent on direct involvement processes where the workers are seen as individuals (Boxall, Haynes, & Macky, 2007; Gomez, Bryson, & Willman, 2010; Kochan, Katz, & McKersie, 1986; Marchington & Wilkinson, 2000; Wilkinson & Dundon, 2010). Some writers have even indicated that the high involvement work forms are threatening unionmanagement cooperation on workplaces, basically because different versions of involvement and participation has been incorporated {{as part of the}} organization’s structure and work practice, which again makes indirect participation through the union stewards less important (Wilkinson, 1998). In an European context, collective participation remains significant in certain countries, notably Germany and Scandinavia (Nergaard, 2010; Wilkinson & Dundon, 2010). Heckscher (2001) indicates that the future form of unionism lies in union strategies much closer to productivity and labor-management cooperation than labor-management relations based on antagonism. He claims that the unions with the highest level of internal participation in recent years have not been militantly anti-capitalist, but rather have sought to link internal participation with deep involvement in management decision-making. This study attempts to explore the role of the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> in organizations using high involvement workplace practices. I have used theoretical approach found in the Industrial Relation field together with organizational studies in order to investigate the role the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> develop in organizations using high involvement workplace practices. This thesis is a result of an inductive-deductive process, where I have examined theory and research on both the role of the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> in industrial companies and the use of high involvement workplace practices, parallel with collecting and analyzing the data material {{on the role of the}} <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> in such workplace practices. This is a qualitative study where I have used a number of different methods in order to illuminate the research question. Most of the data material in this study is collected through an Action Research project called PALU where four industrial companies participated. I also carried out interviews, and shadowed in two additional industrial companies. The main research question is: In the context of labor-management cooperation, how can we understand the role of the <b>shop</b> <b>steward</b> in organizations using high involvement workplace practices? In order to embark on the research question, I developed four sub-questions out of a bundle of organizational characteristics known as high involvement workplace practices, such as less hierarchical structure, highly-skilled production, high involvement leadership practices, and direct employee involvement. The subquestions are:   1. How can we understand the role of the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> in organizational structures based on the assumption that the workers take responsibility for communication, knowledge sharing, and decision-making? In this study I have argued that the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> take an active role in informing and developing the shop floor workers and by this make the employees ready for high involvement organizational structures. This study also shows that when the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> are involved in enterprise development processes together with the management, they develop knowledge and skills on organizational development issues and include this as part of their representative role towards the members. This means that enterprise development and production issues become part of the information the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> give to the members in the same way as other union matters. Because of this I argue that the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> become channels of communication on productivity issues on the shop floor. Taking an organizational approach to this finding, the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> safeguard a role on communications not necessarily taken into account by most researchers on high involvement workplace practices. 2. How can we understand the role of the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> in high-tech industries, where the enterprises are dependent on skilled and flexible workers? In this study I have argued that the enterprises’ demand for skilled and flexible workers changes its character in meeting with the union principles such as collectivity and solidarity. The <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> participate in developing the members’ skills as a way of securing the members’ rights by emphasizing both horizontal career development and the members’ psychological job demands. In addition, the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> themselves hold knowledge on the shop floor that is important for the highly skilled organization. The <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> approach to the demands for a highly skilled workforce influences the enterprise’s workplace practices towards a more horizontal and collective approach to skill development. 3. How can we understand the role of the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> in high involvement leadership practices based on labor-management cooperation? In this study I have argued that the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> participate in complementary leadership practices where the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> hold past, local knowledge about the company’s challenges and opportunities. For new managers this means that some issues may be new to them when entering the enterprise development scene, while the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> on the other hand are quite familiar with the issues at stake. The shop stewards’ experience is therefore complementary to the managers’. 4. How can we understand the role of the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> in organizations that emphasize direct involvement between management and the individual workers? In this study I argue that the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> support direct involvement arrangements because they see it as motivational and promising for the union members. They influence these work forms by making sure that they develop as collective workplace practices. This way the shop union protects the individual workers against possible demands in this work system such as self-imposed demands and goals. Also, the experiences from one of the companies shows that the role of the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> seems almost boundless when it comes to developing the enterprise into a stage the shop union sees as promising for the union members. When the change process is over and the new organization goes over in an operational phase, the <b>shop</b> <b>stewards</b> are unable to have such an offensive role because leading an organization on a day-to-day mission is too closely linked to management and not leadership in a broader sense.
