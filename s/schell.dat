50|$|Classic {{threshold}} {{models were}} developed by <b>Schelling,</b> Axelrod, and Granovetter to model collective behavior. <b>Schelling</b> attempted to model the dynamics of segregation motivated by individual interactions in America (<b>Schelling,</b> 1971) by constructing two simulation models. <b>Schelling</b> demonstrated that “there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results,” and that the dynamics of movement influenced patterns of segregation. In doing so <b>Schelling</b> highlighted the significance of “a general theory of ‘tipping’”.|$|R

40|$|Friedrich <b>Schelling</b> has re-emerged in Anglo-Saxon {{philosophy}} as a singularly important figure in Germand Idealism, not as some mediate figure in between Kant, Fichte, and Hegel. Because <b>Schelling</b> 2 ̆ 7 s works resist being subsumed into a univocal or systematic articulation, they instead invite a reading, {{in the sense}} developed by Jean-Luc Nancy, that itself is transported to the writing of his texts. In order to show the auto-immune character of <b>Schelling</b> 2 ̆ 7 s writing, this thesis will turn to <b>Schelling</b> 2 ̆ 7 s First Outline of a System of the Philosophy of Nature (1799), the Philosophical Investigations into the Essence of Human Freedom (1809), and the unfinished The Ages of the World (1815). These texts show that the recent resurgence of <b>Schelling</b> in theory and philosophy is not because of philosophy 2 ̆ 7 s re-discovery of <b>Schelling,</b> but that <b>Schelling</b> {{is representative of the}} crisis in which theory and philosophy currently find themselves, articulating a deconstructive writing avant-la-lettre...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1950s, the {{situation}} began to change. In 1954, {{the centennial of}} his death, an international conference on <b>Schelling</b> was held. Several philosophers including Karl Jaspers gave presentations about the uniqueness and relevance of his thought, the interest shifting toward his later work on being and existence, or, more precisely, the origin of existence. <b>Schelling</b> {{was the subject of}} the 1954 dissertation of Jürgen Habermas. In 1955 Jaspers published a book titled <b>Schelling,</b> representing him as a forerunner of the existentialists. Walter Schulz, one of organizers of the 1954 conference, published a book claiming that <b>Schelling</b> had made German idealism complete with his late philosophy, particularly with his Berlin lectures in the 1840s. Schulz presented <b>Schelling</b> as the person who resolved the philosophical problems which Hegel had left incomplete, in contrast to the contemporary idea that <b>Schelling</b> had been surpassed by Hegel much earlier. Theologian Paul Tillich wrote: [...] "what I learned from <b>Schelling</b> became determinative of my own philosophical and theological development". Maurice Merleau-Ponty likened his own project of natural ontology to Schelling's in his 1957-58 Course on Nature.|$|R

50|$|In 1800 <b>Schelling</b> {{published}} System des transcendentalen Idealismus (System of Transcendental Idealism). In {{this book}} <b>Schelling</b> described transcendental philosophy and nature philosophy as complementary to one another. Fichte reacted {{by stating that}} <b>Schelling</b> {{was working on the}} basis of a false philosophical principle: in Fichte's theory nature as Not-Self (Nicht-Ich = object) could not be a subject of philosophy, whose essential content is the subjective activity of the human intellect. The breach became unrecoverable in 1801, after <b>Schelling</b> published Darstellung des Systems meiner Philosophie ("Presentation of My System of Philosophy"). Fichte thought this title absurd, since in his opinion philosophy could not be personalized. Moreover, in this book <b>Schelling</b> publicly expressed his estimation of Spinoza, whose work Fichte had repudiated as dogmatism, and declared that nature and spirit differ only in their quantity, but are essentially identical (Identität).

Hegel never replied. In the same year, <b>Schelling</b> gave a speech about the relation between the visual arts and nature at the Academy of Fine Arts; and Hegel wrote a severe criticism of it to one of his friends.

50|$|<b>Schelling</b> was {{especially}} close to August Wilhelm Schlegel and his wife, Caroline.

Robert Richards, however, argues {{in his book}} The Romantic Conception of Life that Schelling's interventions were not only appropriate but most likely irrelevant, as the doctors called to the scene assured everyone involved that Auguste's disease was inevitably fatal. Auguste's death drew <b>Schelling</b> and Caroline closer. Schlegel had moved to Berlin, and a divorce was arranged (with Goethe's help).
