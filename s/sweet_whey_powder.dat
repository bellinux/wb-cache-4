In view of the many whey powder producers, there is need to establish the quality of the whey powders currently on the market in terms of conformance to specifications, consistency over different seasons, and keeping quality. Selected <b>sweet</b> <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> from different processors was analysed for microbiological, physicochemical and sensory quality. The whey powder was in most the cases within specifications. There was suggestive evidence of seasonal variability in the cooked flavor and sweet taste. In regard to storage, {{there was no significant difference}} in the flavor and aroma of the whey powder with storage except for the oxidized flavor which was marginally significantly different in at least one product. Most of the variation was in the microbiological and physicochemical properties. Of three products considered, rate of deterioration by the Maillard reaction, one was significantly different from the other two, having lower activation energy. Accelerated shelf-life testing deterioration rates compared well with those at ambient conditions for two products, implying that ASLT can be used for shelf-life determinations only if Maillard reaction inhibitors are absent. The flavor and aroma of sweet Cheddar cheese whey powder from one processor over 12 months, was consistent. However, the physicochemical, and microbiological properties were variable mainly between the fall and summer production with the fall production being higher in L* (lightness) and pH, but low in solubility index, and conversely, the summer production being high in solubility index and titratable acidity but low in L*...|$|E

The dough was examined for farinographic, amylographic, extensographic and fermentographic properties. The data of staling tests including color, texture, flavor and also proximate analysis data were analyzed by ANOVA. Finally, differences among treatments were examined by Ducan’s multiple range procedure. The results indicated that the best treatment was the use of 3 % <b>whey</b> <b>powder,</b> as far as staling and texture of bread are concerned.

Drying samples at 135 °C for 2 h resulted in higher moisture content in whey permeate (7. 5 % vs 3. 0 %), <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> (7. 7 % vs 3. 8 %), DDGS 1 (11. 4 % vs 7. 5 %), and DDGS 2 (13. 1 % vs 8. 8 %) compared with the Karl Fischer method (p< 0. 05). Whey permeate and <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> were considerably darkened as the drying time increased. In conclusion, drying samples at 135 °C for 2 h is not appropriate for determining the moisture content in <b>whey</b> permeate, <b>whey</b> <b>powder,</b> or DDGS as well as the mixed diet containing these ingredients. The oven-drying method at 105 °C for 5 to 6 h appears to be appropriate for whey permeate and <b>whey</b> <b>powder,</b> and at 105 °C for 2 to 3 h for DDGS...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Three {{kinds of}} samles (whey protein {{containing}} casenoglycopeptide, whey protein removed casenoglycopeptide and cheese <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> digested with 7 kinds of proteases at 37   0 C for 24 hr (trypsin, protenase-K, actinase-E, thermolysin, and papain) or 25   0 C (pepsin and chymotrypsin). Strong inhibotory activity against the angiotensin converting enzyime (ACE, EC 3. 4. 15. 1) was generated in all samples by 5 proteases digestion (pepsin, chymotrypsin, protinase-K, thermolysin and papain). In whey protein removed caseinoglycopeptide digestion by thermolysin induced the highest activity (95, 25 %). In cheese <b>whey</b> <b>powder,</b> the highest activity was derived by thermolysin (98. 25 %). On the other hand, week ACE inhibitory activity were derived by trypsin and actinase-E digestion. As no remarkable differences in inhibitory activity were observed between whey protein containing casenoglycopeptide and whey protein removed casenoglycopeptide samples, the bioactive peptides {{are considered to}} come mainly not from casenoglycopeptide but from cheese <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> components...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} on spray drying of whey has significantly changed {{during the last}} 20 years. Industries started to apply more technical and scientific information for <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> production. The main problems in <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> are: sticking and caking during production and storage, which lead to decrease of the yield. These problems {{are based on the}} control of the glassy state during the dehydration process and storage. Due to the importance of the glass transition, spray drying parameters should be adjusted to improve <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> production. This review highlights the scientific research that deal with the impact of these factors on spray drying of whey. To conclude, in order to improve the spray drying of whey the industries should: apply thermohygrometers to measure the air properties; to stablish the relation between water activity and outlet air relative humidity; and to adjust spray drying parameters based on the properties of the air and whey...|$|R
50|$|The {{cocoa powder}} is then {{mixed with the}} {{hazelnuts}} along with sugar, vanillin and skim milk in a large tank until it becomes a paste-like spread. Modified palm oil is then added to help retain the solid phase of the Nutella at room temperature, which substitutes for the butter found in the cocoa bean. In addition, <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> {{is added to the}} mix because it acts as a binder for the paste. <b>Whey</b> <b>powder</b> is an additive commonly used in spreads to prevent the coagulation of the product because it stabilizes the fat emulsions. Similarly to <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> lecithin, which is a form of a fatty substance found in animal and plant tissues, is used to emulsify as it promotes homogenized mixing of the different ingredients allowing the paste to become spreadable. It also aids the lipophilic properties of the cocoa powder which, again, keeps the product from separating. Vanillin is added to enhance the sweetness of the chocolate. The finished product is then packaged.|$|R

25|$|The UK Oreo website gives a {{slightly}} different ingredients list {{to that of the}} US product. Unlike the US version, UK Oreo cookies originally contained <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> and so were not suitable for people who avoid milk products. As the <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> was sourced from cheese made with calf rennet, UK Oreo cookies were also not suitable for vegetarians. On 6 December 2011, Kraft announced that Oreo cookies would start to be produced in the UK. Their Cadbury factory at Sheffield in South Yorkshire was selected to manufacture Oreo cookies in the UK for the first time. Production started on May 2013.|$|R
