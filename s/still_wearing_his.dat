25|$|After {{the tough}} win against BYU, Walker and company won out {{to finish the}} regular season. After getting past South Carolina 34â€“18 on September 25, Georgia rolled {{during the month of}} October. Walker's {{performance}} against the Gamecocks was modest by his standards (32 rushes, 143 yards, and 1 touchdown), but he ran hard while <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> cast.|$|E
25|$|Sea-based searching did not {{commence}} until mid-afternoon, {{when the}} Bombo's owwners {{arranged for the}} tug Warung to leave Port Kembla to look for survivors. The local fishing trawler Pacific Gull, skippered alone by Albert Barnett, made the first discovery near Coledale, being the body of Captain Bell, <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> binoculars and cap. His wristwatch had stopped at 10:15. Barnett spotted more bodies closer to shore, but the conditions made it too dangerous to attempt to retrieve them. Further searching was carried out the next day, including by a Tiger Moth aircraft of South Coast Aviation Services, but {{the bodies of the}} remaining ten men were never found.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday 9 November 1913 {{at around}} 10:30a.m. the H. B. Hawgood was running {{before the storm}} when they spotted the Isaac M. Scott, still heading North and making heavy weather of it, off Tawas Point, Michigan, just hours before {{the brunt of the}} storm struck. When {{communication}} was restored and newspapers began carrying accounts of the storm the Isaac M. Scott was only listed as missing. The body of Capt. A. McArthur washed up at Southampton, Ontario, Canada on 11 December 1913 while <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> life preserver. One of her lifeboats was found 23 miles north of the Chantrey Island lighthouse, off Southampton, Ontario. All 28 crew members perished in the disaster.|$|E

5000|$|Kekkonen and his {{adjutant}} in the sauna. Kekkonen is naked (but <b>still</b> <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> eyeglasses), while <b>his</b> adjutant <b>wears</b> a full military dress uniform. They {{talk about}} everyday matters.|$|R

500|$|Bellerophon {{was soon}} closely engaged with the French, {{breaking}} through the enemy line and closing with Aigle. As with the other French ships in the fleet, Aigle's rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on Bellerophon and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied [...] "It {{is too late to}} take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man".|$|E
500|$|Clisby was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> RAAF uniform on 15May when he {{went into}} action with his flight against more than thirty Bf110s over Reims. Having {{destroyed}} two of the German heavy fighters, Clisby's Hurricane was seen going down with its cockpit trailing smoke and flames, evidently hit by cannon fire. He was initially posted as [...] "missing", along {{with one of his}} comrades, Flying Officer Lorimer, whose plane was also seen losing height in the same action. The French later found two burnt-out Hurricanes in the vicinity, which were identified as [...] Clisby's and Lorimer's. Clisby died without knowing that he had been awarded the DFC. A fellow pilot later said, [...] "He was an Australian and had thrown himself into the fray with a reckless abandon that was magnificent in its way".|$|E
500|$|In 1947, Warren was {{appointed}} the new school's first dean. Once again {{he found himself}} involved in creating a new medical school. His first appointments were three former associates in Rochester: Dr Charles Carpenter as the first professor of infectious disease; Dr. Andrew H. Dowdy as the first professor of radiology; and [...] Dr John S. Lawrence, who had pioneered the use of phosphorus-32 as a radioactive tracer, as professor of medicine. With Dr William P. Longmire Jr, a 34-year-old plastic surgeon from Johns Hopkins University recruited by Lawrence as professor of surgery, they became the [...] "Founding Five" [...] of the new school. Initially, the new school was accommodated in wartime Quonset huts scattered about the UCLA campus. Warren was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> army fatigues. Construction of permanent accommodation commenced in 1949. By 1951 when the first students, 26 men and two women, arrived there were 15 faculty members. By the time the first class graduated in 1955 there were 43 [...] faculty members. The UCLA Medical Center opened in 1955.|$|E

60|$|At {{the long}} table upon which the evening meal was spread sat the entire {{household}} of the Baron, and here and there among the men were evidences of painful wounds but barely healed, while the host himself <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> <b>his</b> sword arm in a sling.|$|R

500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the disturbance, which spread to Newgate Prison next door and continued into the night, Sheppard escaped for the fourth time. [...] He unlocked his handcuffs and removed the chains. [...] Still encumbered by his leg irons, he attempted to climb up the chimney, but his path was blocked by an iron bar set into the brickwork. [...] He removed the bar {{and used it to}} break through the ceiling into the [...] "Red Room" [...] above the [...] "Castle", a room which had last been used some seven years before to confine aristocratic Jacobite prisoners after the Battle of Preston. [...] <b>Still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> leg irons as night fell, he then broke through six barred doors into the prison chapel, then to the roof of Newgate, 60feet (20m) above the ground. [...] He went back down to his cell to get a blanket, then back to the roof of the prison, and used the blanket to reach the roof of an adjacent house, owned by William Bird, a turner. [...] He broke into Bird's house, and went down the stairs and out into the street at around midnight without disturbing the occupants. [...] Escaping through the streets to the north and west, Sheppard hid in a cowshed in Tottenham (near modern Tottenham Court Road). [...] Spotted by the barn's owner, Sheppard told him that he had escaped from Bridewell Prison, having been imprisoned there for failing to support a (nonexistent) bastard son. [...] His leg irons remained in place for several days until he persuaded a passing shoemaker to accept the considerable sum of 20 shillings to bring a blacksmith's tools and help him remove them, telling him the same tale. [...] His manacles and leg irons were later recovered in the rooms of Kate Cook, one of Sheppard's mistresses. [...] This escape astonished everyone. Daniel Defoe, working as a journalist, wrote an account for John Applebee, The History of the Remarkable Life of John Sheppard. [...] In his History, Defoe reports the belief in Newgate that the Devil came in person to assist Sheppard's escape.|$|E
2500|$|Alec remembers one {{occasion}} in Adelaide in 1947 {{when he had}} to bowl for most of one day in 102-degree heat. After his last over, he was completely befuddled and had to be led from the ground by his team mates. Not knowing where he was, he stumbled up the steps through the Father and Son Enclosure, past the Press Box and into the England dressing room. There the team physiotherapist took him into the showers, sat him down on a wooden chair, clothed and <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> boots, and turned on the cold tap. It took almost three quarters of an hour for the big Surrey bowler to come round from his heat exhaustion! ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most famous}} {{episode in the}} history of the Swiss Guards was their defence of the Tuileries Palace in central Paris during the French Revolution. [...] Of the nine hundred Swiss Guards {{defending}} the Palace on 10 August 1792, about six hundred were killed during the fighting or massacred after surrender. [...] One group of sixty Swiss were taken as prisoners to the Paris City Hall before being killed by the crowd there. An estimated hundred and sixty more died in prison of their wounds, or were killed during the September Massacres that followed. Apart from less than a hundred Swiss who escaped from the Tuileries, some hidden by sympathetic Parisians, the only survivors of the regiment were a three-hundred-strong detachment that had been sent to Normandy to escort grain convoys a few days before 10 August. [...] The Swiss officers were mostly amongst those massacred, although Major Karl Josef von Bachmann in command at the Tuileries was formally tried and guillotined in September, <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> red uniform coat. [...] Two Swiss officers, the captains Henri de Salis and Joseph Zimmermann, did however survive and went on to reach senior rank under Napoleon and the Restoration.|$|E
50|$|The {{only man}} to have trouble with the creek was General Crook. Dismounted, he <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> <b>his</b> high riding boots, and as {{he stepped into the}} stream, the boots filled with water and bogged him down. Nearby {{soldiers}} grabbed their commander's arms and hauled him to the other side.|$|R
50|$|After the war Franz {{moved to}} the United States as part of Operation Paperclip, and worked for a time with the USAF on engine-related issues at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He was known to <b>still</b> <b>wear</b> <b>his</b> long leather, {{military}} coat from Nazi Germany in the United States, with the Nazi insignia removed.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} Rooney took Tumbler on his knee, {{and began to}} tempt him with savoury morsels. It is only just to the child, (who <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> <b>his</b> raven coat), {{to say that he}} yielded readily to persuasion. Rooney also amused and {{somewhat}} scandalised his friends by insisting on old Kannoa sitting beside him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That he has {{not left}} the service long is shown by his <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> {{ammunition}} boots, as they are called," [...] observed Mycroft.|$|E
60|$|The Frenchman ushered him in. The {{door was}} closed and {{carefully}} locked. Then Monsieur Guillot swung {{around and looked at}} his visitor with some curiosity. Granet was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> uniform.|$|E
60|$|Helen's {{relief was}} almost as great as her companion's. A moment later Mills ushered in their guest. He was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> bandage, but his colour had returned. He seemed, in fact, almost gay.|$|E
60|$|From {{the window}} of my room I saw the doctor get astride his mule. He was girt with a big sword, but he <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> <b>his</b> long, absurd and shabby gown and his loose, ill-fitting shoes, {{so that it was}} very likely that the stirrup-leathers would engage his {{thoughts}} ere he had ridden far.|$|R
60|$|So the King {{dismissed}} {{his court}} {{and said he}} would himself walk with Dorothy to the gate. He did not weep nor groan any more, but his long face was quite solemn and his big ears hung dejectedly on each side of it. He <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> <b>his</b> crown and his ermine and walked with a handsome gold-headed cane.|$|R
60|$|It {{became evident}} {{as the days}} wore on that she was right... Bit by bit she {{obtained}} the other clothes--with some difficulty--from Aunt Emma, but her husband <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> <b>his</b> best on Sundays and sometimes of an evening; and twice, on going into the bedroom suddenly, she had caught him surveying himself at different angles in the glass.|$|R
60|$|Tavernake rose to {{his feet}} and lit a cigarette--a new habit with him, while Beatrice busied herself with a small coffee-making machine. He sat in an easy-chair and smoked slowly. He was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> {{ready-made}} clothes, but his collar was of the fashionable shape, his tie well chosen and neatly adjusted. He seemed somehow to have developed.|$|E
60|$|<b>Still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> cocked hat--for he {{had nothing}} else with which to shield his head from the sun--and with his uniform coat on, for {{he had not yet}} an {{opportunity}} of ripping from it the letter he carried, and this he would not part from--Dickory roamed about the little settlement. Mander was an industrious and thrifty man. His garden, his buildings, and his surroundings showed that.|$|E
60|$|Then {{there came}} a curious and wholly {{unexpected}} interruption. A man in dark, plain clothes, <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> overcoat, and carrying a bowler hat, had been standing in {{the entrance of the}} restaurant for a moment or two, looking around the room as though in search of some one. At last he caught the eye of the Baron de Grost and came quickly toward him.|$|E
5|$|Osborn {{returns in}} Peter Parker: Spider-Man #75 and is blown {{up at the}} end of the issue. It is shown in Spectacular Spider-Man #250 that he has recovered, and he returns to his {{civilian}} life. Without the Green Goblin identity, Osborn would then go on to attack Spider-Man indirectly, through minions and via smear campaigns designed to portray him as a monster. However, Norman would <b>still</b> <b>wear</b> <b>his</b> Green Goblin costume in battle.|$|R
50|$|Flowers and his henchmen track Chas to Turner's flat. They are {{appalled by}} the loose {{clothing}} and feminine wig that Chas now wears, and allow him to go and collect his things upstairs. Chas discusses his options with Turner and Pherber, then shoots Turner in the head. Pherber hides in a closet. As he is led to <b>his</b> death, Chas <b>still</b> <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> feminine clothes and wig, but his face is identical to Turner's.|$|R

60|$|The {{house where}} Mr Waller lived {{was one of}} a row of semi-detached villas {{on the north side of}} the Common. The door was opened to them by their host himself. So far from looking {{battered}} and emitting last breaths, he appeared particularly spruce. He had just returned from Church, and was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> gloves and tall hat. He squeaked with surprise when he saw who were standing on the mat.|$|E
60|$|In {{his search}} for work he was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> best-looking suit; the others he would dispose of; and with this plan in his mind on his return to his room that night {{he went to the}} tiny closet to make a bundle of the things which he would dispose of on the morrow, only to {{discover}} that in his absence some one had been there before him, and that there was nothing left for him to sell.|$|E
60|$|He {{pushed open}} the swing door and found himself {{face to face with}} Da Souza's one clerk--a youth of unkempt appearance, shabbily but flashily dressed, with sallow {{complexion}} and eyes set close together. He was engaged at that particular moment in polishing a large diamond pin upon the sleeve of his coat, which operation he suspended to gaze with much astonishment at this unlocked-for visitor. Trent had come straight from Ascot, straight indeed from his interview with Francis, and was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> racing-glasses.|$|E
5000|$|After {{dating a}} woman named Tina for a short time, Warrick {{proposed}} and married her in Season 6. Nearing the Season 6 finale, Warrick's marriage seemed to have become rocky, especially when he discovered that she was cheating on him. Through the midpoint of Season 7, Warrick <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> <b>his</b> wedding band, which would suggest that he and Tina have worked through their differences. In season 8, however, Warrick told Catherine {{that he was getting}} divorced.|$|R
5000|$|Sergio GutiÃ©rrez BenÃ­tez (born May 29, 1945) is a Mexican {{priest who}} {{supported}} an orphanage for 23 {{years as a}} lucha libre wrestler. While performing, he wore a red and yellow mask and used the ring name Fray Tormenta. He made only sporadic in-ring appearances in the 2000s before retiring completely from wrestling in July 2011, but <b>still</b> <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> mask even in his duties as a priest. Fray Tormenta means [...] "Friar Storm" [...] in English.|$|R
60|$|When Dickory came back, {{he first}} {{looked to see}} if Kate <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> <b>his</b> shoes and stockings, and {{then he began to}} ask what there was that he might now do. He would go again to the town if he might be of use. But Kate had no errand for him there. Dickory had told her how he had been with Mr. Newcombe at her home, and {{therefore}} there was no need of her sending him another message.|$|R
