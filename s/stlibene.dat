40|$|Resvestrol {{has been}} known to inhibit {{bacterial}} and fungal growth in vitro, and can be accumulated in plant to concentrations necessary to inhibit microbial pathogens. Hence, stilbene synthase gene has been used to transform to synthesize resveratrol in heterologous plant species to enhance resistance against pathogens. In the present study, we investigated the antimicrobial activities of resveratrol and piceid to bacterial and fungal pathogens, which causing severe damages to rice plants. In addition, disease resistance was compared between transgenic rice varieties, Iksan 515 and Iksan 526 transformed with <b>stlibene</b> synthase gene and nontransgenic rice varieties, Dongjin and Nampyeong. Minimum inhibitory concentration of resveratrol for Burkolderia glumae was 437. 5 μM, and the mycelial growth of Biplaris oryzae was slightly inhibited at concentration of 10 μM. However, other bacterial and fungal pathogens are not inhibited by resveratrol and piceid. The expression of the stilbene synthase gene in Iksan 515 and Iksan 526 did not significantly enhanced resistance against bacterial grain rot, bacterial leaf blight, sheath blight, and leaf blight. This study is the first report on the effect of resveratrol and piceid against pathogens of rice plant, and changes of disease resistance of transgenic rice plants transformed with stilbene synthase gene...|$|E
