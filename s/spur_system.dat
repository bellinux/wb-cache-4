50|$|The Panthers' main {{weakness}} was {{its final}} drive unit. The problems stemmed from several factors. The original MAN proposal {{had called for}} the Panther to have an epicyclic gearing (planetary) system in the final drive, {{similar to that used}} in the Tiger I. Germany suffered from a shortage of gear-cutting machine tools and, unlike the Tiger tanks, the Panther was intended to be mass-produced. To achieve the goal of higher production rates, numerous simplifications were made to the design and its manufacture. This process was aggressively pushed forward, sometimes against the wishes of designers and army officers, by the Chief Director of Armament and War Production, Karl-Otto Saur (who worked under, and later succeeded, Reichminister Speer). Consequently, the final drive was changed to a double <b>spur</b> <b>system.</b> Although much simpler to produce, the double spur gears had inherently higher internal impact and stress loads, making them prone to failure under the high torque requirements of the heavy Panther tank. Because of the significant numbers of breakdowns, the Wehrmacht was forced to move the Panther D and Tiger I tanks by rail, throughout 1943. The tanks could not participate in major movements of more than 100 km without adversely affecting unit strengths due to breakdowns.|$|E

A pair of involute spur gear is modelled in a CAD system (PRO / ENGINEER) and FEA is done by using finite element software ANSYS 13. The bending stresses in the tooth root and contact stresses were examined using a 3 -D FEM model.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} a <b>spur</b> gear <b>system</b> was performed through a numerical analysis approach. This study used the gear dynamic program DANST, a computer simulator, to determine the dynamic behavior of a <b>spur</b> gear <b>system.</b> The analytical results have taken the deflection of shafts and bearings into consideration for static analysis, {{and the influence of}} these deflections on gear dynamics was investigated. Damping in the gear system usually is an unknown quantity, but it has an important effect in resonance vibration. Typical values as reported in the literature were used in the present analysis. The dynamic response due to different damping factors was evaluated and compared. The effect of the contact ratio on spur gear dynamic load and dynamic stress was investigated through a parameter study. The contact ratio was varied over the range of 1. 26 to 2. 46 by adjusting the tooth addendum. Gears with contact ratio near 2. 0 were found to have the most favorable dynamic performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] quantify the growth habit of locally important pear varieties, initially, 2 - year-old pear branches were classified into groups based on the length and position of lateral shoots. Four groups were formed that ranged from cultivars with a spurred growth habit and strong apical control, to cultivars with a spreading growth habit and weak apical control. Secondly, the development of fruiting branches was observed {{for up to five}} years by observing the five developmental alternatives of the terminal buds of laterals, i. e., dormant, vegetative, reproductive without fruit, reproductive with fruit, and abortion. Under local conditions two general problems were observed. A large proportion of buds remain vegetative giving rise to poor flowering, and many buds remain dormant, probably due to the use of vigorous rootstocks and inadequate winter chilling. Local training systems address these shortcomings through the use of rest-breaking agents, girdling, and winter pruning techniques. Winter pruning strategies for locally important cultivars can be split into two broad approaches. In one approach spurs are renewed within <b>spur</b> <b>systems</b> primarily via bourse shoots. In the other approach spurs are renewed via year-old shoots. The motivation for the use of these systems is discussed in light of the above architectural findings...|$|R

40|$|Geared {{systems have}} been widely used in {{mechanical}} applications for more than a hundred years. A large range of literature has been published especially for spur/helical gear systems and the investigations into technical areas of spur/helical gears have been very well developed, including understanding of condition monitoring systems, diagnostic and prognostic methods. However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding on the general dynamic behavior of planetary gear systems with tooth faults. Planetary gears are normally used as effective power transmission elements with high power to weight/volume ratios, large speed reductions in compact volume, and high reliability. They tend to have high efficiency and are used in many applications, such as automotive, heavy truck/tractor, helicopter, wind turbines and bucket wheel reclaimer gearboxes. The purpose of this research is to develop a vibration analysis system that simulates dynamic behavior of large low speed, high torque planetary <b>spur</b> gear <b>systems</b> such as used in bucket wheel reclaimer and wind turbine gearboxes, with and without gear element faults. This thesis investigates lumped mass modelling methods for planetary gearbox dynamic behavior based on previous gearbox modelling research including the use of the coupled torsional-transverse behavior of the gear body. The dynamic model of the planetary <b>spur</b> gear <b>system</b> includes effects such as: variable tooth mesh stiffness, dynamic transmission error effects, and pitch and profile excitation for gear fault detection purposes. Different tooth faults are simulated using the concept of combined torsional mesh stiffness. The dynamics of <b>spur</b> planetary gear <b>systems</b> with and without tooth faults are compared and analyzed to improve the understanding of fault detection in the present gear systems. Dynamic modelling of gear systems, such as outlined in this thesis can assist in understanding the consequence of large transient events, including the fluctuations in tooth loads which can reduce gear fatigue life and lead to further tooth damage. Early detection of faults on gear teeth can be used to initiate maintenance actions in order to reduce repair work and avoid catastrophic breakdown...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a surface contact static stress of a <b>spur</b> gear <b>system</b> combined with dynamic characteristic using transient Finite Element Method (FEM). Traditionally, the static stress analysis is done separately with dynamic properties due to limitation of complex equation and avoiding of error occurred. However, in this paper, static stress information {{is combined with}} the dynamic mechanism due to the time consuming during the design and analysis stage. A transient FEM analysis is carried out to formulate and solve large systems of algebraic equations {{in order to obtain}} a relationship between the contact parameter and the kinematics function. The methodology of the research is started with static stress analysis on tooth surface contact of a pair of the spur gear. Finite element modeling is run by choosing a certain static condition. The loading conditions are applied suitable with the gear mechanism. Degree of freedom controlled is based on the transmission system. The process is repeated until diagnosing work is satisfied. The result of the surface contact stress is visualized at each condition. Modeling of <b>spur</b> gear <b>system</b> is continued by combining stress analysis with dynamic characteristic via transient finite element method. Analysis of gear mechanism is obtained by investigate the stress distribution on real time application. Time range is set {{at the beginning of the}} analysis. Duration of the analysis is depended on a time frame chosen. By the transient FEM analysis, the stress occur at each step of the work cycle is performed. Results of the kinematics functions are derived and qualitative kinematics variations due to contact changes in time-step domain is identified. The simulation results from static and transient FEM are compared due to the validating procedure. The finite element results are in good agreement compared with the theory calculation...|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the most}} common manners of {{classifying}} vine training systems now is based on which parts of the vines are permanent fixtures which determines which parts of the vine are removed each year as part of the winter pruning. With a cane-trained system, there are no permanent cordons or branches that are kept year after year. The vine is pruned down to the spur in winter, leaving only one strong cane which is then trained into becoming the main branch for next year's crop. Examples of cane trained systems include the Guyot and Pendelbogen. With spur-trained systems, the main branch or cordon is kept each year with only individual canes being pruned during the winter. While vines that are cane trained will often have a thin, smooth main branch, spur trained vines will often have thick, dark and gnarled cordon branches. Many old vine vineyards will often utilize <b>spur</b> training <b>system.</b> Some examples of spur-training systems include the goblet or bush vine systems, and Cordon de Royat. Some systems, like the Scott Henry and VSP Trellis, can be adapted to both spur and cane training. Vine systems that are classified as either cane or spur trained may be alternately described by the way they are pruned in the winter so systems that are described as [...] "cane-trained" [...] will be <b>spur</b> pruned while <b>systems</b> that are [...] "spur-trained" [...] will be cane-pruned.|$|R
