25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E

500|$|The role of Martha was {{originally}} played by Burcin Kapkin upon her introduction in 1988. In 2005 the character {{returned to the}} show, played by the model Jodi Gordon. Gordon took acting lessons before successfully auditioning for the role. Gordon later revealed that she was initially nervous about auditioning due to her lack of acting experience. However, producers gave her two months prior to filming so she could learn her scripts and gain more acting skills. Gordon said, [...] "I'd never done any acting. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a few little acting course things and then I kind of fluked the part".|$|E
500|$|In an {{exclusive}} written interview with The Westmorland Gazette nine months into his sentence, Park talked {{of how he}} had struggled with prison, saying: [...] "They [...] may smoke incessantly, play loud music, the TV or video games, rifle your drawers, steal, lie etc. There {{is not a lot}} you can do about it... I watched a guy [...] "chasing the dragon". It frightened me to death. I had never seen that before." [...] He refused to answer detailed questions about the trial or case, but protested his innocence, saying [...] "If I knew who killed my wife, how, where, why, then I would have said <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know then. I do not know now." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{has also become}} a fashion trend. In 2008, American fashion designer Marc Jacobs donned a SpongeBob tattoo on his right arm. He explained that [...] "Well, I just worked with Richard Prince on the collaboration for Louis Vuitton and Richard has done a series of paintings of SpongeBob. He had brought up in our conversation how he saw the artistic value of SpongeBob as the cartoon and I kind of liked it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it." [...] He further added that [...] "It's funny." [...] The tattoo was described by blogger and TV personality Perez Hilton {{as one of the}} [...] "Worst Celebrity Tattoos". In the same year, A Bathing Ape released SpongeBob-themed shoes. Singer Pharrell Williams backed a line of SpongeBob T-shirts and shoes targeted at hip adults. In 2014, the character was among the popular culture icons referenced by American fashion designer Jeremy Scott in his Moschino debut collection at the Milan Fashion Week.|$|E

500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] I said to the art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do {{you want me to}} do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> what I was told and I put the pistol in there. Add to the fact that they only had, like, a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not my fault. I mean, they told me to put the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Holding the gun {{became a}} {{controversial}} thing 'cause we filmed it in London, and they don't {{have a lot}} of gun use out there. That doesn't mean that there's no gun use, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> find it really interesting. For me, the thing is, it blew me away that members of [...] Parliament were speaking about this. One, because it's a music video, and two, because don't you guys have television shows out there that show crime? It's really strange to me. I don't understand why pop stars are put on such a high pedestal over other celebrities. Why do members of Parliament feel that they need to scrutinize her for having a gun, and 'She's in the public,' and 'She should know better,' and 'She's a role model,' but what about every other celebrity out there? What about every other actor? That's very strange to me. I was really surprised at how much the gun use was scrutinized. [...] a professional criminal, so it makes sense he has a gun. We shouldn't censor ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by Aristotle. Documented cases {{of carbon monoxide}} {{being used as a}} method of suicide date to at least 100 BC in ancient Rome. In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor Julian suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work Misopogon: [...] "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside." [...] This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, Jovian.|$|E

500|$|The nudity was {{optional}} for the performers. The French cast was [...] "the nudest" [...] of {{the foreign}} groups, while the London cast [...] "found nudity the hardest to achieve." [...] The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe, but in Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked {{up and down the}} aisle during the show's prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled [...] "CENSORED". Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said, [...] "I was dead set against the nude scene at first, but I remembered my acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it." [...] According to Melba Moore, [...] "It doesn't mean anything except what you want it to mean. We put so much value on clothing. .... It's like so much else people get uptight about." [...] Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that [...] "it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing." [...] Rado said that [...] "being naked in front of an audience, you're baring your soul. [...] Not only the soul but the whole body was being exposed. It was very apt, very honest and almost necessary." ...|$|E
500|$|Production on {{the episode}} began on September 14, 2004, and ran through to September 22. The {{standing}} sets {{were used for}} the first three days of filming. Further sets were created to represent the Vulcan Embassy and portions of the Forge. The final two days were filmed on site in Simi Valley in southern California, which doubled as the main areas of the Forge. The property used in the valley was owned by mining company P.W. Gillibrand, which was near property owned by Vulcan Materials Company. Optical effects were added to represent the firestorm and the sehlat. The CGI sehlat was based on one which previously appeared in [...] episode [...] "". Visual effects producer Dan Curry said that the team [...] "looked at the animated series and it just looked nice and pleasant, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a couple of sketches to do a reinterpretation of it to make it look scary, but not be too radical a departure from the original". Eden FX modelled the CGI under supervision by staff visual effects supervisor Art Codron. Additional care was taken to create the fur so that close-ups could be used if required. The only physical portion of the sehlat to be created was a single paw. [...] "Yesteryear" [...] was set in the Vulcan city Shi'Khar, which reappears in [...] "The Forge", and it is also the first mention of the area on Vulcan called the Forge. A further reference was made to [...] "Vulcan's Forge" [...] in the [...] episode [...] "".|$|E
500|$|Portman and Kunis started {{training}} {{six months}} before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers. Portman worked out for five hours a day, doing ballet, cross-training, and swimming. A few months closer to filming, she began choreography training. Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates, [...] "train seven days a week, five hours, for five, six months total, and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1,200 calories a day." [...] She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds, and reported that Portman [...] "became smaller than I did." [...] Kunis said, [...] "I did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet. You wear a tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl. But this is very different because you can't fake it. You can't just stay in there and like pretend you know what you're doing. Your whole body has to be structured differently." [...] Georgina Parkinson, a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), coached the actors in ballet. ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria Riccetto served as [...] "dance doubles" [...] for Portman and Kunis respectively. Dancer Kimberly Prosa also served as a double for Portman. She stated: [...] "Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her. Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the fouettés, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the rest of whatever dance shots they needed." ...|$|E

2500|$|That {{was written}} {{around the time}} of the first record [...] I think that was the second thing Ed and I wrote together.

2500|$|Patton married Cristina Zuccatosta, an Italian artist, in 1994. The couple divided {{their time}} between San Francisco and Bologna, Italy, until their {{separation}} in 2001. Patton used {{to own a}} home in Bologna and speaks Italian. Regarding his close association with Italy, Patton stated, [...] "It happened after I got married.
