25|$|Sparse {{dictionary}} {{learning is}} a representation learning method which aims at finding a sparse representation of the input data (also known as sparse coding) {{in the form of}} a linear combination of basic elements as well as those basic elements themselves. These elements are called atoms and they compose a dictionary. Atoms in the dictionary are not required to be orthogonal, and they may be an over-complete <b>spanning</b> <b>set.</b> This problem setup also allows the dimensionality of the signals being represented to be higher than the one of the signals being observed. The above two properties lead to having seemingly redundant atoms that allow multiple representations of the same signal but also provide an improvement in sparsity and flexibility of the representation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a family of}} finite dimensional simple Lie superalgebras of Cartan type over a field of characteristic $p> 3 $, the so-called special odd contact superalgebras. First, the <b>spanning</b> <b>sets</b> are determined for the Lie superalgebras and their relatives. Second, the <b>spanning</b> <b>sets</b> are used to characterize the simplicity and to compute the dimension formulas.

40|$|We {{answer a}} number of open {{problems}} in frame theory concerning the decomposition of frames into linearly independent and/or <b>spanning</b> <b>sets.</b> We prove that in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, Parseval frames with norms bounded away from 1 can be decomposed into {{a number of}} sets whose complements are spanning, where the number of these sets only depends on the norm bound. We also prove, assuming the Kadison-Singer conjecture is true, that this holds for infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Further, we prove a stronger result for Parseval frames whose norms are uniformly small, which shows that in addition to the <b>spanning</b> property, the <b>sets</b> can be chosen to be independent, and the complement of each set to contain a number of disjoint, <b>spanning</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R

Several procedures for conveniently obtaining <b>spanning</b> <b>sets</b> for certain subspaces of estimable parametric functions in classification models are developed; and for such <b>spanning</b> <b>sets</b> the estimability of single effect as well as the rank of the design matrix is determined...|$|R

Furthermore we extend our earlier results in positive characteristic and give a general result which reduces the problem to giving <b>spanning</b> <b>sets</b> of the highest weight vectors for the action of GL_r× GL_s on tuples of r× s matrices.
