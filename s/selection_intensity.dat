General models of opposing directional selection, with arbitrary dominance, are investigated by considering simultaneously the stability properties of the trivial equilibria and the curve along which multiple roots appear. Numerical calculations lead us to infer that the average degree of dominance determines the equilibrium characteristics of models of opposing selection. It appears that if the favored alleles are, on the average, recessive, there may be multiple polymorphic equilibria, whereas only a single polymorphic equilibrium can occur when the favored alleles are, on the average, dominant. The principle that the average degree of dominance controls equilibrium behavior is then extended to models allowing directional selection in one sex with overdominance in the other sex, by showing that polymorphism is maintained {{if and only if}} the average fitness in heterozygotes exceeds one...|$|R

Results Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian coalescent methods found higher <b>intensities</b> of <b>selection</b> and more sites under significant positive selection in the 48 Physalis S-RNase alleles than the 49 from Solanum. Highest posterior densities of dN/dS (&# 969;) estimates show that the strength of selection is greater for Physalis at 36 codons. A nested maximum likelihood method was more conservative, but still found 16 sites with greater selection in Physalis. Neither method found any codons under significantly greater selection in Solanum. A random effects likelihood method that examines data from both taxa jointly confirmed higher <b>selection</b> <b>intensities</b> in Physalis, but did not find different proportions of sites under selection in the two datasets. The greatest differences in strengths of selection were found in the most variable regions of the S-RNases, as expected if these regions encode self-recognition specificities. Clade-specific likelihood models indicated some codons were under greater selection in background Solanum lineages than in specific lineages of Physalis implying that selection on sites may differ among lineages. Conclusions Likelihood and Bayesian methods provide a statistical approach to testing differential selection across populations or species. These tests appear robust to the levels of polymorphism found in diverse S-allele collections subject to strong balancing selection.

This selection tool is usually used for characters that are sex-limited, expressed after death(meat characteristics) and usually with low heritability, for example milk or egg production in females. A bull for example cannot be assessed for milk production, however the performance of its female offsprings can be used to determine the use of the animal for future crosses. A progeny test is performed by mating the male with a number of females to produce many progenies in different environment and over a long time period involving different seasons to nullify the impact of season, management, environment in breeding value estimation. The average performance of the offspring is then found, giving a measure of the male's respective value to the breeder.|$|E
5000|$|Neofunctionalization is also {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "mutation during non-functionality” or “mutation during redundancy”. [...] Regardless of if the mutation arises after non-functionality of a gene or due to redundant gene copies, the important aspect is that in both scenarios one copy of the duplicated gene is freed from selective constraints and by chance acquires a new function which is then improved by natural selection. This process is thought to occur very rarely in evolution for two major reasons. The first reason is that functional changes typically require a large number of amino acid changes; which has a low probability of occurrence. Secondly, because deleterious mutations occur much more frequently than advantageous mutations in evolution. This makes the likelihood that gene function is lost over time (i.e. pseudogenization) far greater than the likelihood of {{the emergence of a new}} gene function. Walsh discovered that the relative probability of Neofunctionalization is determined by the selective advantage and the relative rate of advantageous mutations. This was proven in his derivation of the relative probability of Neofunctionalization to pseudogenization, which is given by: [...] where ρ is the ratio of advantageous mutation rate to null mutation rate and S is the population selection 4NeS (Ne: effective population size S: <b>selection</b> <b>intensity).</b>|$|E

Simulations were conducted with different <b>intensities</b> of family <b>selection</b> in SG and FCG and <b>intensities</b> of clonal <b>selection</b> in subsequent generations. The results show that family <b>selection</b> <b>intensities</b> between 50 % and 60 % allowed the greatest gains.

In the case of applying stronger <b>selection</b> <b>intensities</b> for a higher efficiency with sequential selection (SG and FCG) weaker intensities should be applied in the SG (60 %) and stronger intensity in FCG (40 %).
