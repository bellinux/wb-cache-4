500|$|Allan Johnson, {{while writing}} for the Chicago Tribune, said that Enterprise looked [...] "sleeker and less cheesy than the {{original}} 'Trek'." [...] Johnson added that although it contained technology that wasn't as advanced as that seen in the earlier Star Trek series set in the 24th century, it [...] "still maintains a techno-savvy, post-1960s 'Trek' flair." [...] David Kronke in the Los Angeles Daily News, said that the sets were [...] "largely gun-metal gray, representing a sort of retro-futurism – <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> might've happened if '50s sci-fi design cliches had had today's technology to work with" [...] and that the consoles had a [...] "simpler mechanical feel". In his review of [...] "Broken Bow" [...] for The Washington Post, David Segal, described Enterprises speed of warp 4 as slower than a Hyundai.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr is {{credited}} with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut, although she personally disagrees. In 1995, she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All my friends in art school used to run around with this <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you call Beatles' haircut, and my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart [...] liked it very very much. He {{was the first one}} who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] After suffering blackouts and intense headaches, Sutcliffe was taken to a hospital on 10 April 1962—Kirchherr rode with him in the ambulance—but died before the ambulance reached the hospital. Three days later Kirchherr met the Beatles at the Hamburg airport and told them Sutcliffe had died of a brain haemorrhage.|$|E

500|$|... "The song {{has kind}} of an old school vibe to it, {{so we wanted to}} be really {{stripped}} down and really simple with the video. Every time we get the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr is {{credited}} with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut although she disagrees, saying: [...] "All that rubbish people said, that I created their hairstyle, that's rubbish! Lots of German boys had that hairstyle. Stuart [...] had {{it for a long}} while and the others copied it. I suppose the most important thing I contributed to them was friendship." [...] In 1995, Kirchherr told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All my friends in art school used to run around with this <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you call Beatles haircut. And my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] Kirchherr says that after she cut Sutcliffe's hair, Harrison asked her to do the same when she was visiting Liverpool, and Lennon and McCartney had their hair cut in the same style while they were in Paris, by Kirchherr's friend, Vollmer, who was living there at the time as an assistant to photographer William Klein.|$|E
500|$|Prop master Rob Smith {{joined the}} series during its second season, {{and had to}} quickly learn about all the gadgets {{featured}} in Fringes debut season. Smith was asked to create a [...] "neural stimulator" [...] in the script to [...] "Momentum Deferred", but [...] "didn’t really know the episodes well enough to say, ‘Oh, ok, that’s exactly what it is.’ So I talked to the director, {{who had been on}} season 1, and he goes, ‘Oh, I don’t know, it’s just something that goes on the guy’s head'." [...] Smith discovered that the headpiece in question had been rented during the first season, causing him to recreate the prop over one weekend. He called this process [...] "a little bit stressful." [...] The gadget, Smith explained, was important because it [...] "defined the way that Walter works. He’s this mad scientist who takes conventional science and then puts his own twist on it, as it were. And then the thing that struck me about that one was that it made me uncomfortable to look at it." [...] Smith added, [...] "It’s {{one of those things that}} people love and hate about Fringe, it puts your [...] out of your comfort zone. That’s <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I was trying to say about Walter… there’s kind of a bird’s nest of wires everywhere, and then they end up on the guy’s head, and from that he can tell what the guy’s thinking. It’s quite cool." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to this resorption of bone in the vertical and anterioposterior dimensions, the alveolus also resorbs faciolingually, thus diminishing {{the width of the}} ridge. [...] What initially began as a sort of tall, broad, bell curve-shaped ridge (in the faciolingual dimension) eventually becomes a short, narrow, stumpy <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> doesn't even appear to be a ridge. [...] Resorption is exacerbated by pressure on the bone; thus, long-term complete denture wearers will experience more drastic reductions to their ridges that non-denture wearers. [...] Those individuals who do wear dentures can decrease the amount of bone loss by retaining some tooth roots in the form of overdenture abutments or have implants placed. [...] Note that the depiction above shows a very excessive change and that this many take many years of denture wear to achieve.|$|E
2500|$|Using this {{leftover}} money, Lynch {{decided to}} experiment on making {{a work that}} was a mix of animation with live action, producing a four-minute short called The Alphabet (1968). The film starred Lynch's wife Peggy as a character known as The Girl, who chants the alphabet {{to a series of}} images of horses before dying at the end by hemorrhaging blood all over her bed sheets. Adding a sound effect, Lynch used a broken Uher tape recorder to record the sound of his baby daughter Jennifer crying, creating a distorted sound that Lynch felt to be particularly effective. Later describing what had inspired him, Lynch stated that [...] "Peggy's niece was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that's <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> started The Alphabet going. The rest of it was just subconscious." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} recorded in 2005 for a DVD special feature, Remington Steele co-creator Michael Gleason and star Stephanie Zimbalist discuss {{the large number}} of women who have approached them over the years to express their appreciation for the character of Laura Holt. Speaking of the women she meets, Zimbalist said [...] "They are extraordinary women.... They are interesting. They do interesting things. They are smart. They're independent. They're <b>sort</b> <b>of,</b> <b>what</b> my character was – and I meet them all the time." [...] Also in 2005, Robin Rauzi published an article in the Los Angeles Times saying that Laura Holt was her hero. In a subsequent interview Rauzi elaborated, saying that Laura [...] "was one of the only examples of an unmarried modern career woman on TV that I could identify with at that time" [...] and that Laura [...] "didn’t seem that far away from who I was and who I could be." [...] Rauzi concludes, [...] "I’ve decided to stop being embarrassed to say Remington Steele changed my life. It did and for the better." ...|$|E
