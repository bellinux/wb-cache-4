A minimum of the curve exists at the intercept with the major strain axis or close thereby, the plane strain forming limit. With {{the definition of the}} onset of local necking (e. g. membrane force reaches an extreme value) and the assumption of a hardening law according to Hollomon (σ = K εn) it can be shown that the corresponding theoretical plane strain forming limit is identical with the strain hardening coefficient, n. There is no thickness effect. Taking into account the strain rate sensitivity of the material, which is obvious in steel, along with the sheet thickness, the fact can be explained that practical forming limits, obtained by the use of the above described method, lie well above theoretical forming limits. Thus the basic influence parameters for the forming limits are, the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent,</b> n, the initial sheet thickness, t0 and the strain rate hardening coefficient, m. The lankford coefficient, r, which defines the plastic anisotropy of the material, has two effects on the forming limit curve.

It was observed that the movement and multiplication of dislocations, elongation of grains, breaking of elongated grains, rotation, carbide fragmentation and boundary refinement of broken grains occur simultaneously during the evolution of ASBs in the impacted 4340 steel specimens. The extent of these mechanisms depends on the imposed local strain and strain rate. Extensive grain refinement coupled with high density of dislocations results in the shear band structures being more susceptible to crack nucleation and propagation.

Three values of deformation (two in the plastic region taking into account the modified Crussard-Jaoul analysis and one after failure) were considered. Fractions of LAGB and HAGB, grain size and grain aspect ratio were calculated and compared for the different ECAP passes and tensile deformation levels. The dislocation density evolution calculated by the Bergström model for both the tensile curves and the ECAP curve showed a higher increase in the amount of dislocations during the initial stages of deformation than at higher values of deformation due to higher probabilities of dislocations annihilation. The <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponents</b> calculated via the Bergström model for each ECAP pass shows that there is a continuous decrease in the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> capacity until the eighth pass where a small increase with a subsequent stabilization was found.

Stainless steel plates were welded using gas tungsten arc welding technique. Tensile test specimens of weld metal were subjected to various aging heat treatments at temperatures of 750 and 850 °C for periods of 1 to 100 hours. Microstructural analyses were performed using techniques including metallography, EDS analysis, and measurement of ferrite content with ferritoscope. Fracture behavior of the weld metals was characterized by conducting tensile tests at 25 and 500 °C, and performing fractographic and microstructural observations using SEM. Transformation of delta-ferrite to the intermetallic sigma phase during aging resulted in a mild increase in tensile strength and significant reduction in ductility. Slant and flat macroscopic fracture modes were observed in the aged weld metals, with the slant mode being dominant at 500 °C. This mode was associated with deformation localization along arrays of primary voids, nucleated at cracked sigma phase particles, oriented at about 45 ° to loading direction.

Tensile flow behaviour of all the microstructural conditions could be adequately described by the Hollomon equation (sigma = K- 1 epsilon(n 1)) at higher (> 623 K) temperatures. Deviation from the Hollomon equation was observed at low strains and lower (< 623 K) temperatures. The Ludwigson modification of Hollomon's equation, sigma = K- 1 epsilon(n 1) + exp (K- 2 + n(2) epsilon), was found to describe the flow curve. In general, the flow parameters n(1), K- 1, n(2) and K- 2 were found to decrease with increase in temperature except in the intermediate temperature range (423 to 623 K).

In {{the past ten}} years nanotechnology has developed from a buzzword to an integral part of our modern life. The promise of bottom up devices has turned into better, faster, and stronger products utilizing nanoscale materials. Tires designed with carbon nanotubes, touchscreens, reformulated steel, self-cleaning fabrics, drug delivery systems, and semiconductor devices all rely on nanoscale materials. However, the mechanical property relationships are not fully understood, and the cross-roads of mechanical performance and electrical properties is still being explored. For example, the role of electrical contact in mechanical systems is important for reliability in systems that contain interconnect, switches, or relays. MEMS switches in particular can have reliability issues if the conducting area is decreased, or the switch fails due to plasticity. In this thesis, an attempt is made to characterize failure modes of several fundamental nanoscale materials using nanoindentation. In this thesis, ostensibly brittle materials such as alumina, chromia, and silicon are chosen as being archetypal examples of brittle materials. The use of conductive probe indentation is used here as a measure of plasticity under the indenter in constrained metal films with native oxide layers, as well as to determine the point of oxide fracture. In situ transmission electron microscope indentation is used to explore dislocation velocities and <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> in compressed silicon pillars.

In this paper the plastic components of stresses entering in the experessions for the specific plastic work were derived from the plastic singular solution described by the HRR stress field. In order to ascertain the accuracy of such approximate solutions for criteria based on energy balance, a comparison between the components of elastic strain energy density, and its total value, with the specific plastic work (Wp) was undertaken, in order to derive certain conclusions {{about the importance of}} the contribution of energy component and the specific plastic work. The analysis was based on the typical case of a transverse internal crack in plate under plane-stress conditions, which is submitted to a mode I deformation. While the dilatational (Tv) and the distortional (TD) components of elastic SED were calculated for impending plasticity the specific plastic work (Wp) was evaluated by assuming ssy conditions and the theory of HRR field using the plastic singular solution for mode I.

40|$|Grit {{blasting}} {{is used as}} {{a cost-effective}} method to increase the surface roughness of metallic biomaterials, as Ti. 6 Al. 4 V and 316 LVM, to enhance the osteointegration, fixation and stability of implants. Samples of these two alloys were blasted by using alumina and zirconia particles, yielding rough (up to Ra~ 8. μm) and nearly smooth (up to Ra~ 1. μm) surfaces, respectively. In this work, we investigate the sub-surface induced microstructural effects and its correlation with the mechanical properties, with special emphasis in the fatigue behavior. Blasting with zirconia particles increases the fatigue resistance whereas the opposite effect is observed using alumina ones. As in a conventional shot penning process, the use of rounded zirconia particles for blasting {{led to the development of}} residual compressive stresses at the surface layer, without zones of stress concentrators. Alumina particles are harder and have an angular shape, which confers a higher capability to abrade the surface, but also a high rate of breaking down on impact. The higher roughness and the presence of a high amount of embedded alumina particles make the blasted alloy prone to crack nucleation. Interestingly, the beneficial or detrimental role of blasting is more intense for the Ti. 6 Al. 4 V alloy than for the 316 steel. It is proposed that this behavior is related to their different <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponents</b> and the higher mass fraction of particles contaminating the surface. The low value of this exponent for the Ti. 6 Al. 4 V alloy justifies the expected low sub-surface hardening during the severe plastic deformation, enhancing its capability to soft during cyclic loading. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The element rhenium (Re) is a {{refractory}} metal that has gained significant {{recognition as a}} high-performance engineering material because it exhibits an exclusive combination of properties. Rhenium has the second highest melting point of all metals (after tungsten (W)), the third highest Young’s modulus (after iridium (Ir) and osmium (Os)), and the fourth highest density (after Os, Ir and platinum (Pt)). It also {{has one of the}} highest <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponents</b> of all elements, a low coefficient of friction, and a high hardness, all of which result in excellent wear properties. Compared to the other {{refractory metal}}s, Re has superior tensile strength and creeprupture strength over a wide temperature range (up to approximately 2000 °C). For example, between room temperature and 1200 °C, its strength is approximately twice that of W. In addition, the rupture strength of rhenium is greater than that of W at temperatures as high as 2800 °C. At 2500 °C its strength is comparable to that of carbon composites. These properties imply that structures made of Re have excellent mechanical stability and rigidity, and they enable the design of parts with thin sections. It can also be concluded that Re is extremely attractive for high-temperature structural and energy system applications. A summary of properties is provided in Table 1. Interestingly, while the other refractory metals have a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure (Figure 1), Re has a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure (Figure 2). Consequently, it does not possess a ductile-to-brittle transition and, therefore, can safely be used at subzero temperatures. [1 - 5] Rhenium is the only refractory metal that does not form carbides. Even so, the solubility of carbon in Re is relatively high along with the wettability* between these two elements.
