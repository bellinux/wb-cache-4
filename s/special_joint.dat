40|$|The {{profiles}} for aluminium {{structures are}} usually obtained {{by means of}} extrusion process that, as well-known, allows many possibilities of cross-sectional shapes. In particular, extruded shapes can be customized according to the different possible uses by incorporating essential design features, such as stiffener, rib, bulbs, slots and tracks. These features can be exploited to conceive more rational joining systems by providing the cross-section with slots and tracks in which mechanical fasteners can be located. These systems, generally named "special joints", represent a very competitive solutions with respect to conventional joining systems thank {{to the possibility of}} easy and rapid execution, treatments and machining reduction. <b>Special</b> <b>joints</b> are mainly employed in complementary building structures, such as façades, support structures for solar panels, doors and windows frames. In the last years, other structural applications like staircases, floors, pedestrian bridge, industrial furniture and shelves have been developed involving <b>special</b> <b>joints.</b> Although <b>special</b> <b>joints</b> are widely used in structural applications, few literature about this topic is available and no clear design rules are provided by the main aluminium structural codes. As an attempt to overcome this lack of information, a research about the mechanical behaviour of <b>special</b> <b>joints</b> was undertaken at University of Naples Federico II with the financially support of METRA S. p.

500|$|The Senate {{had refused}} to pass six bills after their twice being passed by the House of Representatives.

In 1967, the Prime Minister advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint the <b>Special</b> <b>Joint</b> Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the National and Royal Anthems; the group first met in February and, within two months, on April 12, 1967, presented its conclusion that [...] "O Canada" [...] should be designated as the national anthem and [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] as the royal anthem of Canada, one verse from each, in both official languages, to be adopted by parliament. The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song. For [...] "O Canada", the Robert Stanley Weir version of 1908 was recommended, with a few minor changes, for the English words; two of the [...] "stand on guard" [...] phrases were replaced with [...] "from far and wide" [...] and [...] "God keep our land." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 28, 1959, {{speaking}} {{before a}} <b>special</b> <b>joint</b> {{session of the}} Virginia Assembly, Governor Almond announced that Virginia was powerless to prevent school desegregation. Speaking slowly from a typewritten script and with obvious deep emotion, Almond declared [...] "Virginia has not surrendered and does not surrender now", but then {{said he would not}} use the police power of the state to try to force schools to stay segregated. (This was an obvious reference to the incident in which Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus called out the Arkansas National Guard to bar nine African American students from enrolling at Little Rock Central High School in 1957. The students were admitted only after President Dwight Eisenhower placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control, and had the students escorted into the high school by the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division.) Almond asked the legislature to repeal all aspects of the Stanley plan which had been overturned by the courts, repeal the state's compulsory school attendance law, adopt a $3 million tuition grant program to allow students to attend segregated private schools of their choice, and strengthen the penalty for threatening to bomb a church, school, or other meeting place. Almond also announced a study of Section 129 of the Virginia Constitution, a political gesture that was never seriously pursued. Almond's program became known by some as [...] "passive resistance" [...] and [...] "freedom of choice" [...] (although it is also sometimes called [...] "tokenism" [...] or [...] "containment"), a legislative approach intended to shift Virginia toward desegregation {{in the face of a}} hostile electorate.|$|E
