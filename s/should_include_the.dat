25|$|While in Insein {{prison in}} July 1941, Thakin Soe and Than Tun had co-authored the Insein Manifesto, which {{declared}} fascism {{as the major}} enemy in the coming war and called for temporary co-operation with the British {{and the establishment of}} a broad coalition alliance that <b>should</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. It followed the Popular Front line advanced by the Bulgarian communist leader Georgi Dimitrov, at the Seventh Comintern Congress in 1935.|$|E
25|$|Breslovers do not {{restrict}} {{themselves to}} Rabbi Nachman's commentaries on the Torah, but also study {{many of the}} classic texts, including the Tanakh, Talmud, Midrash, and many others. They may also study the writings of Rebbes from other dynasties. In fact, Rebbe Nachman claimed that while even a complete simpleton can become a pure and righteous Jew, the ideal study schedule of an extremely scholarly Hasid <b>should</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) with its commentaries, the entire Talmud with its commentaries, the entire Shulchan Arukh, all the Midrashic works, the Zohar and Tikkunei Zohar, {{the teachings of the}} Arizal and other kabbalistic works, all {{over the course of a}} single year.|$|E
25|$|In AD 638 (17 AH), Abu Musa Ashaari, {{one of the}} {{officials}} of the Caliph Umar in Basrah, complained about {{the absence of any}} years on the correspondence he received from Umar, making it difficult for him to determine which instructions were most recent. This report convinced Umar of the need to introduce an era for Muslims. After debating the issue with his counsellors, he decided that the first year <b>should</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> date of Muhammad's arrival at Medina (known as Yathrib, before Muhammad's arrival). Uthman ibn Affan then suggested that the months begin with Muharram, in line with the established custom of the Arabs at that time. The years of the Islamic calendar thus began with the month of Muharram in the year of Muhammad's arrival at the city of Medina, even though the actual emigration took place in Safar and Rabi' I. Because of the Hijra, the calendar was named the Hijra calendar.|$|E

5000|$|In July 2012, all Members of Knesset {{were sent}} {{a copy of}} the New Testament by a missionary organization. Ben Ari called it provocative, and {{subsequently}} tore his copy, referring to it as a despicable book responsible for the murder of millions of Jews, and which <b>should,</b> <b>including</b> <b>the</b> senders, be put in [...] "history's trash can".|$|R

25|$|None of the {{evidence}} established {{the cause of the}} collision. However, in the opinion of the court of inquiry the cause would probably be found in one of the factors mentioned. It also noted that although the air traffic system was satisfactory, not all of the procedures involved appeared to have been equally promulgated. It therefore came with a series of recommendations. Broadcast of the regional QFF should be done on time and as a priority. All clearances into a control zone <b>should</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> regional QFF and any local reading should not be given. Altimeter setting messages should be sent on their own and not included in other messages to avoid confusion. Air traffic procedures should be uniformly applicable to all users. Air traffic officers should be examined periodically. Ensure that there is no possibility of controllers confusing future regional QFF with the current QFF. RAF crews should be given more information on procedures in the Metropolitan Control Zone.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} Philcoxias highly {{specialized}} morphology {{has led to}} confusion about its proper taxonomic placement. In 1996, before Philcoxia was even formally published as a taxon, it had been placed by Vinícius Souza in the tribe Scrophularieae of the Scrophulariaceae. Peter Taylor et al. later noted in the 2000 description of the genus that its affinities <b>should</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> genera Gratiola and Dopatrium in the tribe Gratioleae of the Scrophulariaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group later changed the circumscription of the Scrophulariaceae so that the tribe Gratioleae is now within the Plantaginaceae. In 2004, E. Fischer also placed in tribe Gratioleae, but also placed it within the informally recognized subtribe Dopatriinae, which was described as also containing the genera Deinostema, Dopatrium, Hydrotriche, and Limnophila, which consist mostly of aquatic species. In 2007, an extensive study and phylogenetic analysis by Peter Fritsch et al. confirmed that Philcoxia should {{be placed in the}} tribe Gratioleae, but it is in fact not as closely related to Gratiola and the Dopatriinae as was previously assumed.|$|E

500|$|The {{principle}} {{differs from}} that of the ICCPR, which obliges parties to [...] "respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction" [...] the rights in that Convention. However, it does not render the Covenant meaningless. The requirement to [...] "take steps" [...] imposes a continuing obligation to work towards the realisation of the rights. It also rules out deliberately regressive measures which impede that goal. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also interprets the principle as imposing minimum core obligations to provide, at the least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights. If resources are highly constrained, this <b>should</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> use of targeted programmes aimed at the vulnerable.|$|E
500|$|Then in 1997 Kasahara {{formulated}} {{a definition}} between the two. He {{reasoned that the}} Nanking Massacre <b>should</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> entire area of what was then known as the [...] "Nanking Special Administrative District". This district encompassed not only the city of Nanking proper, occupied by the Japanese from December 13, but also the six rural counties surrounding it, namely Jiangning, Lishui, Jurong, Jiangpu, Luhe, and Gaochun. This definition, though considerably larger than the IMTFE's, keeps the massacre contained to [...] "Nanking" [...] without including cities {{on the outskirts of}} Shanghai like Suzhou and Wuxi which Honda does include. Kasahara believes that including massacre victims from the surrounding rural parts of Nanking adds 30,000 victims onto the death toll.|$|E
500|$|... In {{the section}} [...] "Morphology" [...] of Chapter XIII of On the Origin of Species, Darwin commented on {{homologous}} bone patterns {{between humans and}} other mammals, writing: [...] "What can be more curious than that {{the hand of a}} man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and <b>should</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> same bones, in the same relative positions?" [...] and in the concluding chapter: [...] "The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse … at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications." ...|$|E

500|$|Darwin {{discusses}} morphology, {{including the}} importance of homologous structures. He says, [...] "What can be more curious than that {{the hand of a}} man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and <b>should</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> same bones, in the same relative positions?" [...] This made no sense under doctrines of independent creation of species, as even Richard Owen had admitted, but the [...] "explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modifications" [...] showing common descent. He notes that animals of the same class often have extremely similar embryos. Darwin discusses rudimentary organs, such as the wings of flightless birds and the rudiments of pelvis and leg bones found in some snakes. He remarks that some rudimentary organs, such as teeth in baleen whales, are found only in embryonic stages. These factors also supported his theory of descent with modification.|$|E

2500|$|Current, {{alternating}} and direct, in amperes.The {{frequency range}} for which AC measurements are accurate is important, {{depends on the}} circuitry design and construction, and should be specified, so users can evaluate the readings they take. [...] Some meters measure currents as low as milliamps or even microamps. All meters have a burden voltage (caused by {{the combination of the}} shunt used and the meter's circuit design), and some (even expensive ones) have sufficiently high burden voltages that low current readings are seriously impaired.
