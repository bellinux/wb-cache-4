5|$|Hailed as {{the first}} MTV Unplugged {{recording}} for the Regional Mexican genre and as a <b>significant</b> <b>release</b> for the Mexican music scene, the album earned a Latin Grammy Award for Best Norteño Album at the 12th Latin Grammy Awards, and a Grammy Award for Best Banda or Norteño Album.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the animated film, Yellow Submarine was not {{generally considered to be}} a <b>significant</b> <b>release.</b> Issued two months after The Beatles, {{it was one of the}} few Beatles releases that failed to top the charts in either the United Kingdom or the United States, peaking instead at number 3 and number 2, respectively. In Canada, Yellow Submarine topped the RPM national albums chart for two weeks, ending the White Album's 12-week run at number 1. On America's Billboard Top LPs chart, it was kept from the top by the same album.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, RKO Pictures, {{which had}} {{produced}} no films while under Wesray control, was spun off yet again. Actress and Post Cereals heiress Dina Merrill and her husband, producer Ted Hartley, acquired a majority interest and merged {{the company with}} their Pavilion Communications. After a brief period as RKO/Pavilion, the business was reorganized as RKO Pictures LLC. With the inaugural RKO production under Hartley and Merrill's ownership, False Identity (1990), the company also stepped into the distribution business. In 1992, it handled the well-regarded independent production Laws of Gravity, directed by Nick Gomez. RKO's next <b>significant</b> <b>release</b> came in 1998 with Mighty Joe Young, a remake of a 1949 RKO movie that was itself something of a King Kong redux. In the early 2000s, the company was involved as a coproducer on TV movies and modestly budgeted features {{at the rate of}} about one annually. In 2003, RKO coproduced a Broadway stage version of the 1936 Astaire–Rogers vehicle Swing Time, under the title Never Gonna Dance.|$|E

25|$|Version 5.0, {{launched}} on March 18, 1999, and subsequently included with Windows 98 Second Edition and bundled with Microsoft Office 2000, was a <b>significant</b> <b>release</b> that supported bi-directional text, ruby characters, XML, XSLT {{and the ability}} to save web pages in MHTML format. There was enhanced support for CSS Level 1 and 2. The first release of Windows 98 in 1998 had included IE4. However, Internet Explorer5 incorrectly includes the padding and borders within a specified width or height; this results in a narrower or shorter rendering of a box. The bug was fixed in Internet Explorer 6 when running in standards-compliant mode.|$|E
25|$|The {{second wave}} of psychobilly is noted as having begun with the 1986 release of British band Demented Are Go's debut album In Sickness & In Health. The genre soon spread {{throughout}} Europe, inspiring {{a number of new}} acts such as Mad Sin (formed in Germany in 1987) and the Nekromantix (formed in Denmark in 1989), who released the album Curse of the Coffin in 1991. The Quakes formed in Buffalo, New York in 1986, but had such difficulty building a following in their hometown that they moved to London the following year, where they released the album Voice of America in 1990. Another <b>significant</b> <b>release</b> of this era was the compilation album Rockabilly Psychosis and the Garage Disease, which acknowledged the genre's roots in rockabilly and garage rock.|$|E

500|$|Congregation {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics, who praised its musical quality, stylistic elements, and emotional content. It was promoted with two singles, [...] "Turn On the Water" [...] and [...] "Conjure Me", and The Afghan Whigs' extensive touring in the United States and Europe. Although {{it did not}} chart, the album helped the band attain a cult following and receive offers from major record labels, leading to their signing to Elektra Records. Since its initial reception, Congregation has been viewed by writers as the band's breakthrough album and a <b>significant</b> <b>release</b> in rock music during the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|The {{project was}} {{regarded}} as a contractual obligation by the Beatles, who were asked to supply four new songs for the film. Some songs were written and recorded specifically for the soundtrack, while others were unreleased tracks from other projects. The album was issued two months after the band's self-titled double LP (also known as the [...] "White Album") and was therefore not viewed by the band as a <b>significant</b> <b>release.</b> Yellow Submarine has since been afforded a mixed reception from music critics, some of whom consider that it falls short of the high standard generally associated with the Beatles' work. It reached the top 5 in the UK and the US, and has been reissued on compact disc several times.|$|E
500|$|Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{was also}} a <b>significant</b> <b>release</b> during the burgeoning Hotlanta music scene. The scene started as a black music revival in Atlanta during the late 1980s, and {{developed}} {{with the success of}} LaFace Records and the national attention received by Atlanta-based recording artists and producers such as Toni Braxton, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri, and Babyface. The album offered realistic depictions of the city and veered from the Afrocentric themes of Arrested Development and Dupri's mainstream stylings. It was named the third best album of 1994 in ego trips list of [...] "Hip Hop's 25 Greatest Albums by Year 1980–98". Vibe included it as one of the [...] "150 Essential Albums of the Vibe Era (1992–2007)". The magazine also included the album on their 2004 list of [...] "51 Essential Albums" [...] that represent [...] "a generation, a sound, and in many cases, a movement", writing that [...] " [...] determined the South had something to say, and after emerging form the Dungeon production lab, they said it all, sometimes sang it all—pointedly, funkdafied, and putting on absolutely no East Coast pretense.

500|$|Khan {{starred in}} seven films in 1995, {{the first of}} which was Rakesh Roshan's melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. His most <b>significant</b> <b>release</b> that year was Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol's {{character}} during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a [...] "romantic hero". Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year's highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an [...] "all time blockbuster" [...] by Box Office India, with a gross of over [...] worldwide. It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015. The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan's Best Actor Awards. The director and critic Raja Sen said, [...] "Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [...] The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting." ...|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Evans {{discovered}} the young Puerto Rican bassist Eddie Gómez. In {{what turned out}} to be an eleven-year stay, Gómez sparked new developments in Evans' trio conception.

25|$|Many common {{building}} materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, <b>significant</b> <b>releases</b> of asbestos fiber {{do not occur}} unless the {{building materials}} are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal because the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal process.
