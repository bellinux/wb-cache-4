40|$|Introduction: The global {{prevalence}} of cancer is rising. Use of oral anticancer medications has expanded exponentially. Knowledge about these medications {{as well as}} <b>safe</b> <b>handling</b> guidelines has not kept abreast with the rapidity these medications are applied in clinical practice. They pose serious hazards on all personal involved in handling these medications {{as well as on}} patients and their caregivers. We addressed the gaps in knowledge and <b>safe</b> <b>handling</b> of oral anticancer agents among pharmacists in institutional based cancer care. Materials and Methods: We used a 41 item questionnaire to explore three domains, pharmacists’ knowledge, <b>safe</b> <b>handling</b> practice and confidence and self-improving strategies towards these agents among pharmacists in multicentre specialized cancer care. Results: Participants included 120 pharmacists dedicated to handle and dispense oral anticancer agents. About 20 % of Pharmacists have adequate knowledge about oral anticancer agents. Less than 50 % apply <b>safe</b> <b>handling</b> principles adequately. Only a quarter are confident in educating cancer patients and their caregivers about Oral Anti-Cancer Agents. Conclusions: Pharmacists’ knowledge about Oral Anticancer agents needs to be improved. <b>Safe</b> <b>handling</b> and dispensing practice of these medications should be optimized. Pharmacists’ confidence towards educating patients and their caregiver needs to be addressed. Enhancing safety of oral anticancer agents should be a priority. Involving all key players, research and quality improving projects are needed to improve all aspects of the safety of oral anticancer agents...|$|R

40|$|Problem: Nurses are {{potentially}} exposed to hazardous drugs (HDs) in their practice.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine relationships among factors affecting nurses’ use of HD <b>safe</b> <b>handling</b> precautions, to identify factors that promote or interfere with HD precaution use, and to determine nurse managers’ perspectives on use of <b>safe</b> <b>handling</b> precautions.

50|$|<b>Safe</b> <b>handling</b> {{refers to}} the process in which health care workers adhere to {{evidence-based}} practices (EBP) set forth by national organizations, that {{have been designed to}} eliminate or significantly reduce occupational exposure. Some of these practices include but are not limited to, donning of personal protective equipment such as a disposable gown, gloves, masks and the utilization of a closed-system drug transfer device. The key <b>safe</b> <b>handling</b> is to protect the health care worker throughout the three phases of contact with the hazardous drugs. These phases are drug preparation, administration and disposal. Research has shown that while compounding hazardous drugs in a Class II BSC in conjunction with a closed-system drug transfer device, a significant decrease in drug contaminants inside a Class II BSC has resulted. The Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) further elaborates on the topic of <b>safe</b> <b>handling</b> by stating that a closed-system drug transfer device is viewed as one of safest measures to prevent hazardous drug exposure from coming in contact with a clinician’s working environment.|$|R
