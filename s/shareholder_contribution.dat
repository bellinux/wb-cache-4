40|$|Do {{you believe}} that bank {{shareholder}} equity provides an indefinitely lasting source of funding which covers for (residual) risk and loss-absorption? Our innovative approach clarifies and disentangles actual <b>shareholder</b> <b>contribution</b> to bank equity. This case study applies it to Deutsche Bank, a European systemically important institution, from 2001 to 2015. Our analysis shows that bank shareholder equity lasted for {{less than three months}} in 2007 in the bank entity, while payout policies exhausted <b>shareholder</b> <b>contribution</b> to loss-absorbing capital in 2006 - 2008. Since 2005, <b>shareholder</b> <b>contribution</b> to Tier 1 Capital remained below 10 %. According to our findings, the actual contribution by shareholders to bank equity capital was limited, while shareholder payout policies, including share buybacks and trading on its own shares, were material. These findings raise concerns on the actual capacity by shareholder equity to assure protection against (residual) risk and loss absorption. Customer and investor protections appear to lay with bank entity equity dynamics. These findings have implications for bank financial sustainability and resilience, company capital maintenance, and regulatory capital requirements. Further developments based upon this innovative methodology may improve on existing prudential and accounting regulations...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{localized}} food systems and alternative food networks reconnects farmers and consumers, {{and contributes to}} resilience and sustainability of food systems. Local food systems bring life to rural areas and favor community building, supporting local economies and local ecosystems. Community supported agriculture (CSA) has grown rapidly in the last decades, and builds {{on the notion of}} shared risks and costs of food production, by allowing for <b>shareholder</b> <b>contribution</b> and joint learning about food. This study contributes to the discussion about farmer transitions towards CSA by discussing shared characteristics, as well as forces that support and hinder the process. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were carried out with six Norwegian CSAs. Findings revealed that there emerged two main reasons for CSA establishment. One, being in an unwanted situation with vegetable wholesalers, declining income and demand. Two, the desire to connect with consumers and see opportunities to locally produce organic food with increased involvement from the local community. The CSA farmers show a high motivation for producing quality food produced on farm resources while demonstrating environmental engagement and emphasizing sustainable use of resources. Location and organizational form is found to be an important factor for commitment and engagement from shareholders. The network of CSA is a supportive force of collaboration and knowledge-exchange in order to develop new and existing CSAs. CSAs are found to be a viable option for farmers to increase social relationships, foster learning, and improve the economic stability of the farm. CSA is likely to remain a small, but important, part of food systems, and is seen as an essential component in re-localizing food systems. M-A...|$|E

The purpose of the close company rules is that a partner in labor income is taxed {{in the same way}} that an employee’s income. The problem that arises when one partner {{in a close}}ly held company leave a <b>shareholders</b> <b>contribution</b> to the company which aims to raise the threshold for the shares discussed in this paper. This procedure means that the partner may make a profit for the company to low taxation. An unconditional <b>shareholders</b> <b>contribution</b> is not regulated by law, although there are a few statements of practice and legislative history regarding this procedure. The purpose of a <b>shareholders</b> <b>contribution</b> is to increase the company’s assets while liabilities remain unchanged. The paper analyzes this process based on tax law. The purpose of the tax law is that the law will be used to tackle tax evasion. In order for the law to be applied, a tax benefits arising to the taxpayer. It also requires that the taxpayer participated directly or indirectly in the transaction. The tax relief must be considered as the main reason for this act.

40|$|Problem statement: Loan {{management}} {{is a very}} complex and yet, a vitally important aspect of any commercial bank operations. The balance sheet position shows the main sources of funds as deposits and <b>shareholders</b> <b>contributions.</b> Approach: In order to operate profitably, remain solvent and consequently grow, a commercial bank needs to properly manage its excess cash to yield returns in the form of loans. Results: The above are achieved if the bank can honor depositors withdrawals at all times and also grant loans to credible borrowers. This is so because loans are the main portfolios of a commercial bank that yield the highest rate of returns. Commercial banks and the environment in which they operate are dynamic. So, any attempt to model their behavior without including some elements of uncertainty would be less than desirable. The inclusion of uncertainty factor is now possible with the advent of stochastic optimal control theories. Thus, approximate maximum likelihood algorithm with variable forgetting factor was used to model the loan management behavior of a commercial bank in this study. Conclusion: The results showed that uncertainty factor employed in the stochastic modeling, enable us to adaptively control loan demand as well as fluctuating cash balances in the bank. However, this loan model can also visually aid commercial bank managers planning decisions by allowing them to competently determine excess cash and invest this excess cash as loans to earn more assets without jeopardizing public confidence...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} framework, called the Risk-Reward Nexus, {{to study the}} {{relationship}} between innovation and inequality. We ask the following question: What types of economic actors (workers, taxpayers, <b>shareholders)</b> make <b>contributions</b> of effort and money to the innovation process {{for the sake of}} future, inherently uncertain, returns? Are these the same types of economic actors who are able to appropriate returns from the innovation process if and when they appear? That is, who takes the risks and who gets the rewards? We argue that it is the collective, cumulative,and uncertain characteristics of the innovation process that make this disconnect between risks and rewards possible. We conclude by sketching out key policy implications of the Risk-Reward Nexus approach. JEL classification: 014, 015, 031...|$|R
50|$|Phantom {{stock is}} a {{contractual}} agreement between a corporation and recipients of phantom shares that bestow upon the grantee {{the right to}} a cash payment at a designated time or in association with a designated event in the future, which payment is to be in an amount tied to the market value of an equivalent number of shares of the corporation's stock. Thus, the amount of the payout will increase as the stock price rises, and decrease if the stock falls, but without the recipient (grantee) actually receiving any stock. Like other forms of stock-based compensation plans, phantom stock broadly serves to align the interests of recipients and <b>shareholders,</b> incent <b>contribution</b> to share value, and encourage the retention or continued participation of contributors. Recipients (grantees) are typically employees, but may also be directors, third-party vendors, or others.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new framework, called the Risk-Reward Nexus, {{to study the}} {{relationship}} between innovation and inequality. We ask: What types of economic actors (workers, taxpayers, <b>shareholders)</b> make <b>contributions</b> of effort and money to the innovation process {{for the sake of}} future, inherently uncertain, returns? Are these the same types of economic actors who are able to appropriate returns from the innovation process if and when they appear? That is, who takes the risks and who gets the rewards? We argue that it is the collective, cumulative, and uncertain characteristics of the innovation process that make this disconnect between risks and rewards possible. When, across these different types of actors, the distribution of financial rewards from the innovation process reflects the distribution of contributions to the innovation process, innovation tends to reduce inequality. When, however, some actors are able to reap shares of financial rewards from the innovation process that are disproportionate to their contributions to the process, innovation increases inequality. The latter outcome occurs when certain actors are able to position themselves {{at the point where the}} innovative enterprise generates financial returns; that is, close to the final product market or, i...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new verifiable secret {{redistribution}} protocol for threshold sharing schemes that forms {{a key component}} of a proposed archival storage system. Our protocol supports redistribution from (m,n) to (m #,n #) threshold sharing schemes without requiring reconstruction of the original data. The design is motivated by archive systems for which the added security of threshold sharing of data must be accompanied by the flexibility of dynamic shareholder changes. Our protocol enables the dynamic addition or removal of shareholders, and also guards against mobile adversaries. We observe that existing protocols either cannot be extended readily to allow redistribution between different access structures, or have vulnerabilities that allow faulty old shareholders to distribute invalid shares to new <b>shareholders.</b> Our primary <b>contribution</b> is that in our protocol, new shareholders can verify the validity of their shares after redistribution between different access structures...|$|R
40|$|For many marketers, {{the world}} of {{corporate}} finance, and shareholder value in particular, remains a peripheral issue. Accordingly, marketing's influence at the top management and board level continues to languish. A more synergistic marketing-finance relationship, we argue, rests on answers to two questions: What can marketing do for shareholder value; and what can a shareholder value approach do for marketing? Some valuable work on how marketing contributes to shareholder value has been conducted. But marketing's failure to incorporate current financial valuation techniques and properly demonstrate its contribution to financial market performance suggests that the latter question remains open. We address this question and set out a framework for understanding the <b>contribution</b> <b>shareholder</b> value can make to marketing. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} the opportunities that arise for marketing from embracing and incorporating shareholder value principles and metrics. (c) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

30|$|The {{conceptual}} aspects {{are among}} others considered by Christopher and Ryals [19] who assess {{the framework of}} VBM and shareholder value and its links to SCM. The authors identify sales, cost, and capital to be the levers of SCM that drive shareholder value by enhancing or accelerating cash flows through internal processes as well as interfaces to customers and suppliers. Lambert and Burduroglu [48] evaluate the impact of logistics on these levers and propose a framework to measure the resulting value <b>contribution.</b> <b>Shareholder</b> value is identified as the most comprehensive measure to quantify logistics impact on company value. Moreover, the need for cost effective ways to measure this impact is addressed. Lambert and Pohlen [49] introduce metrics for eight SC processes and their link to corporate performance and propose a framework to translate SC performance into shareholder value. Hofmann and Locker [43] conceptualize how SCM affects shareholder value and suggest a value-based performance measurement system to link operating SC activities to economic value added (EVA). The performance measurement system is tested in a single case study from the packaging industry.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} {{elaborate}} on how subject positions promoting shareholder value are infused with an outcome focus. Design/methodology/approach – The study employs Foucault's perspectives on government and the interrelations between objectivity and subjectivity {{in the analysis of}} in-depth case data gathered in one shareholder value-oriented-listed company and one non-listed company. Findings – The outside financial market discipline that objectifies shareholder value-oriented company executives makes them subjects in their own organisation, allowing them to redirect discipline onwards and thereby objectify their subordinates. The non-listed company executives, due to the relatively closed governance structure of their company and the lack of outside ownership, are not subject to such continuous outside discipline; they lack the same access to the means to create tangible outcomes within their organisations. The subject positions promoting shareholder value are focused on outcomes, whereas the non-listed company subject positions are focused on processes. Research limitations/implications – The subject positions of actors within different types of non-listed companies and listed companies without a shareholder focus form a target for future studies. Originality/value – The study contributes to the literatures on manager subject position formation and <b>shareholder</b> value. These <b>contributions</b> are achieved by uncovering a novel consequence of subject position formation and by revealing a mechanism by which outcome focus is tied with shareholder value.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with use of business intelligence in small and medium business. The main issue is to find such solutions, which are suited to needs and requirements {{of this type of}} business. The most suitable method of implementation of business intelligence is according to outputs of this thesis a development of own solution in low costs. On the contrary integrated solutions delivered by the big players on this market are too complex and very expensive for small and medium business. Web-based and SaaS solutions are interesting to these companies, but their support and provided services are not in sufficient level in Czech Republic. To reach all these goals there were analyzed information focused on possibilities and needs of small and medium business and consequently was performed analysis of business intelligence market. The gained outputs were verified in practical part, which is based on project of implementation of business intelligence solution to specific small company. Resources for the final figure of this project are mainly the interviews with <b>shareholder.</b> The main <b>contributions</b> of this thesis are previously mentioned analysis and project of implementation of business intelligence solution. By the help of these studies was found a suitable way, how to implement a business intelligences solution to small and medium business in low costs.

40|$|Although {{there are}} {{a vast number of}} studies on the link between {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial performance (CFP), there is still inconsistency among past literature. In the management and strategy area, some have documented a positive relationship, some have reported a negative relationship, and others have even found no relationship between CSR and financial CFP. Unlike previous marketing literature, which examined the marketing outcomes of CSR activity, we consider the effects of CSR on financial outcomes by examining a firm's time-series stock return. Most of the previous literature that explored the effects of CSR did not distinguish corporate social irresponsibility (CSiR) from CSR. Since CSiR and CSR are a divergent construct, we treat them as separate constructs and examine the effects of responsible corporate social behavior (CSR strength) and irresponsible corporate social behaviors (CSR weakness) separately. To further explore why all firms do not benefit equally from CSR initiatives, we consider time-specific and firm-specific conditions. In this study, we investigate 4 questions to figure out boundary conditions under which CSR initiatives can positively or negatively affect CFP: 1) Are the effects of CSR initiatives different across time?; 2) Are the effects different for CSR strength vs. CSR Weakness?; 3) Are the effects different in the short-term vs. long-term?; and 4) Are the effects different between firms with high marketing intensity vs. firms with low marketing intensity? Using company data on CSR performance from the KLD database in conjunction with COMPUSTAT and CRSP data from 1990 to 2010, we examine the effects of CSR strength and CSR weakness on stock market returns. The empirical results indicate the positive effect of a firm's CSR strength in recent years. This phenomenon {{can be explained by the}} evolution of legitimacy theory. When we further look into the 4 questions, the results indicate that firms with high marketing intensity get punished when they have CSR weakness while firms with low marketing intensity get rewarded when they have CSR strength. These asymmetric effects could be explained by the visibility theory and <b>shareholder</b> expectation. Theoretical <b>contribution</b> and managerial implications are discussed...|$|R
