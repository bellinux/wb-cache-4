25|$|Compression/expansion of time: SPs {{can provide}} a {{longitudinal}} experience and enable students to follow through patients over time, even in a compressed time frame of examination. One technique employed in SP encounters {{is the use of}} information cards. When the trainee or examinee articulates the need for an examination or a laboratory test, the SP hands him/her a <b>small</b> <b>card</b> with the results of that exam/test, and the encounter can continue.|$|E

Artist Nick Rindo made the crop portrait of Cosby from a type of seeds called rapeseed. He accompanied the Cosby portrait with a <b>small</b> <b>card,</b> explaining that it was made from rapeseed, {{but one of the}} staff taped over the word rapeseed. Due to the outrage, it was taken down after a day of display.|$|E

500|$|The rest of {{the weapons}} were finally {{delivered}} on 26 May. The three assassins from Belgrade testified that Major Tankosić, directly and through Ciganović, not only provided six hand grenades and four new Browning FN Model 1910 automatic pistols with [...]380 ACP ammunition, but also money, suicide pills, training, a special map with the location of gendarmes marked, knowledge of contacts on a clandestine tunnel used to infiltrate agents and arms into Austria-Hungary, and a <b>small</b> <b>card</b> authorizing {{the use of that}} tunnel. Major Tankosić confirmed to the journalist and historian Luciano Magrini that he provided the bombs and pistols and was responsible for training Princip, Grabež, and Čabrinović and that he (Tankosić) initiated the idea of the suicide pills.|$|E
500|$|Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, {{producers}} at Universal Pictures, independently {{heard about}} Peter Benchley's novel Jaws. Brown came across {{it in the}} literature section of lifestyle magazine Cosmopolitan, then edited by his wife, Helen Gurley Brown. A <b>small</b> <b>card</b> written by the magazine's book editor gave {{a detailed description of}} the plot, concluding with the comment [...] "might make a good movie". The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was [...] "the most exciting thing that they had ever read" [...] and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished. They purchased the movie rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000 (equivalent to $ million in [...] ). Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.|$|E
500|$|Students who die while {{enrolled}} at Texas A are also honored at Silver Taps, a ceremony held, when necessary, {{on the first}} Tuesday of the month. [...] This tradition began as a memorial for former Texas A president Lawrence Sullivan Ross. [...] In the modern incarnation, {{on the morning of}} Silver Taps, a <b>small</b> <b>card</b> with the deceased student's name, class, major, and birthdate is placed as a notice {{at the base of the}} flagpole in Academic Plaza. [...] At 10:15p.m., all lights on campus are extinguished, and Albritton Tower begins to chime hymns. [...] When the music begins, students gather in silence in front of the statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross at Academic Plaza. [...] At 10:30 pm, the Ross Volunteers march into the plaza and fire a 3-volley salute. [...] Buglers stationed at the top of the Academic Building then play a special rendition of Taps, known as Silver Taps. The song is played three times; once to the north, once to the south, and once to the west. [...] It is never played to the east, [...] "because the sun will never rise on that Aggie again." [...] Once the buglers have finished their tribute, the crowd disperses. [...] Generally, students remain silent until reaching their homes.|$|E
25|$|In {{some of the}} low church traditions, other {{practices}} are sometimes added or substituted, as other ways of symbolizing the confession and penitence of the day. For example, in one common variation, <b>small</b> <b>cards</b> are distributed to the congregation on which people are invited to write a sin they wish to confess. These <b>small</b> <b>cards</b> are brought forth to the altar table where they are burned.|$|R

5000|$|Obviously, {{the deals}} that are {{identical}} except for swapping—say—the 2 and the 3 {{would be unlikely}} to give a different result. To make the irrelevance of <b>small</b> <b>cards</b> explicit (which is not always the case though), in bridge such <b>small</b> <b>cards</b> are generally denoted by an 'x'. Thus, the [...] "number of possible deals" [...] in this sense depends of how many non-honour cards (2, 3, [...]. 9) are considered 'indistinguishable'. For example, if 'x' notation is applied to all <b>cards</b> <b>smaller</b> than ten, then the suit distributions A987-K106-Q54-J32 and A432-K105-Q76-J98 would be considered identical.|$|R
2500|$|Otto Klemperer {{was born}} in Breslau, Silesia Province, then in Germany (now Wrocław, Poland), as a son of Nathan Klemperer, a native of Prague, Bohemia (today's Czech Republic). His parents were Jewish. Klemperer studied music first at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, and later at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin under James Kwast and Hans Pfitzner. He {{followed}} Kwast to three institutions and credited him with the whole basis of his musical development. In 1905, he met Gustav Mahler while conducting the off-stage brass at a performance of Mahler's Symphony No. 2, Resurrection. He also made a piano reduction of the second symphony. The two men became friends, and Klemperer became conductor at the German Opera in Prague in 1907 on Mahler's recommendation. [...] Mahler wrote a short testimonial, recommending Klemperer, on a <b>small</b> <b>card</b> which Klemperer kept {{for the rest of}} his life. Later, in 1910, Klemperer assisted Mahler in the premiere of his Symphony No. 8, Symphony of a Thousand.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 January 1889, she {{was given}} the habit and {{received}} the name Thérèse of the Child Jesus. On 8 September 1890, Thérèse took her vows. The ceremony of taking the veil followed on the 24th, when she added to her name in religion, [...] "of the Holy Face", a title which was to become increasingly important {{in the development and}} character of her inner life. In his [...] "A l'ecole de Therese de Lisieux: maitresse de la vie spirituelle, [...] "Bishop Guy Gaucher emphasizes that Therese saw the devotions to the Child Jesus and to the Holy Face as so completely linked that she signed herself [...] "Therese de l'Enfant Jesus de la Sainte Face"—Therese of the Child Jesus of the Holy Face. In her poem [...] "My Heaven down here", composed in 1895, Therese expressed the notion that by the divine union of love, the soul takes on the semblance of Christ. By contemplating the sufferings associated with the Holy Face of Jesus, she felt she could become closer to Christ. She wrote the words [...] "Make me resemble you, Jesus!" [...] on a <b>small</b> <b>card</b> and attached a stamp with an image of the Holy Face. She pinned the prayer in a small container over her heart.|$|E
