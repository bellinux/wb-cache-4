40|$|Abstract—The {{emergence}} of the Internet as a pervasive communication medium {{has led to the}} rise of many applications of streaming media. However, because of their distinct statistical properties and user viewing patterns, traditional delivery and caching schemes for web objects such as HTML files or images can not be efficiently applied to streaming media such as audio and video. In this paper, we therefore propose an integrated caching scheme for streaming media with segment-based caching and with hierarchically distributed proxies. Firstly, each stream is divided into segments and their caching algorithms are considered to determine how to distribute the segments into different level proxies efficiently. Then, by introducing two kinds of <b>segment</b> <b>priorities,</b> <b>segments</b> replacing algorithms are proposed to determine which stream and which segments should be replaced when the cache is full. Finally, a web friendly caching scheme is proposed to integrate the streaming caching with the conventional caching of normal web objects. Performance of the proposed algorithms is verified by carrying out simulations. Index Terms [...] stream caching, web caching, content delivery networks, hierarchically distributed proxies 1...|$|R

The {{first part of}} the paper examines the requirements for real-time operating systems and ends with the DunejX basic design decisions. The operating system must be able to provide immediate tasks for reflex reaction to interrupts and autonomous tasks for reacting with a specified deadline to periodic or aperiodic events related to the real-time application. Thus the behaviour of the computing system must be thoroughly controiled. The guarantee of response is provided by a high level real-time scheduler which supervises the priorities given to the tasks, and by a priority-driven, reentrant, preemptive, real-time kernel. In order to provide fast response results, the real-time kernel takes advantage of the symmetric multiprocessor architecture. @ComputÍng Systems, Vol. 6. No. 4. Fall 1993 425 The reliability of the application code is eased by providing programming tools and allowing code reusability through full Unix compatibility. The second part presents the detailed implementation choices of DunejX which aim at reducing all known kinds of latencies due to processors, resources or I/Os contentions. Immediate task association with an interrupt level and with an autonomous application task context, inter-task shared memory <b>segments,</b> <b>priority</b> inheritance, deadlock prevention, contiguous files are some of the relevant features which are provided.

40|$|Abstract The {{ability to}} attend to motion is {{paramount}} for living beings. The human visual system is able to detect coherent motion and select within multiple moving objects the most conspicuous or most relevant to the task at hand. Similarly, any artificial agent operating in dynamic environments needs to be endowed with a mechanism for rapid detection and prioritization of moving stimuli in its field of view. In this paper, we present a biologically and psychologically inspired model of this ability and tune it for the extraction of motion at different scales and velocities. Unlike many computational models that compute saliency pixelwise, we extract moving proto-objects through segmentation of motion energy features. These perceptual units, so called proto-objects, are identified as consistently moving blobs. A proto-object based priority map is hence obtained by assigning a single saliency value to the region confining a <b>segmented</b> object. <b>Priority</b> stems {{from a combination of}} bottom-up saliency, evaluated in a center-surround fashion, and from top-down biasing of motion features or motion saliency.

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} System-on-a-Chip show that an {{increasing}} number of special-purpose processors are being added to improve the efficiency of common operations. Unfortunately, the use of these processors may introduce suspension delays incurred by communication, synchronization, and external I/O operations. When these processors are used in real-time systems, conventional schedulability analyses incorporate these delays in the worst-case execution/response time, hence significantly reducing the schedulable utilization. This report describes schedulability analyses and proposes segment-fixed priority scheduling for self-suspending tasks. We model the tasks as segments of execution separated by suspensions. We start from providing response-time analyses for self-suspending tasks under Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS). While RMS is shown to not be optimal, it can be used effectively in some special cases that we have identified. We then derive a utilization bound for the cases {{as a function of the}} ratio of the suspension duration to the period of the tasks. For general cases, we develop a segment-fixed priority scheduling scheme. Our scheme assigns individual <b>segments</b> different <b>priorities</b> and phase offsets that are used for phase enforcement to control the unexpected self-suspending nature...|$|R

40|$|Mobile {{opportunistic}} {{network is}} a kind of delay-tolerant network that consists of mobile wireless-enabled nodes and adopts the form of opportunistic transmissions. When nodes are within the radio range, data and contents could be exchanged among the nodes to meet users' requests or subscriptions. Yet because of unpredictable node movements and varied users' interests, the sharing of contents is a challenging problem in mobile opportunistic networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-resolution content sharing algorithm in mobile opportunistic networks. The algorithm takes data granularity into account and attaches to each content <b>segment</b> a <b>priority</b> weight that combines factors of the node contact pattern and the match between the requests and contents when nodes are in contact. Then, {{on the basis of the}} priority weight, the most valued contents of proper resolution level are forwarded to the peer nodes for sharing. Our algorithm also calculates an importance weight for the contents stored in the cache, and content segments with the smallest importance would be transformed into lower resolution to free storage space and hence improve the overall usage of the storage. Extensive experimental results show that our algorithm performs well under extensive conditions. It increases the content delivery rate with little extra cost on message transmissions and delay of requests compared with other algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first step on the research on multi-resolution content sharing in mobile opportunistic networks. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
