25|$|Supersonic speeds also {{threatened}} inlet stability; the inlet's central {{shock cone}} {{served as a}} compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip; known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable but produced inefficient <b>spillage</b> <b>drag.</b> Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned {{just in front of}} the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock would become supercritical, and supersonic airflow would enter the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in surges or compressor stalls, these could cause flameouts or damage.|$|E
50|$|The second {{difficulty}} {{occurs when}} the aircraft Mach number changes. The airflow {{has to be the}} same at the intake lip, at the throat and at the engine. This statement is a consequence the conservation of mass. However, the airflow is not generally the same when the aircraft's supersonic speed changes. This difficulty is known as the airflow matching problem which is solved by more complicated inlet designs than are typical of subsonic inlets. For example, to match airflow, a supersonic inlet throat can be made variable and some air can be bypassed around the engine and then pumped as secondary air by an ejector nozzle. If the inlet flow is not match, it may become unstable with the normal shock wave in the throat suddenly moving forward beyond the lip, known as inlet unstart. <b>Spillage</b> <b>drag</b> is high and pressure recovery low with only a plane shock wave in place of the normal set of oblique shock waves. In the SR-71 installation the engine would continue to run although afterburner blowout sometimes occurred.|$|E
5000|$|The air inlets {{allowed the}} SR-71 to cruise at over Mach 3.2 while keeping airflow into the engines {{at the initial}} subsonic speeds. Mach 3.2 was the design point for the aircraft, its most {{efficient}} speed. At the front of each inlet, a pointed, movable cone called a [...] "spike" [...] (Inlet cone) was locked in its full forward position {{on the ground and}} during subsonic flight. When the aircraft accelerated past Mach 1.6, an internal jackscrew moved the spike up to 26 in inwards, directed by an analog air inlet computer that took into account pitot-static system, pitch, roll, yaw, and angle of attack. Moving the spike tip drew the shock wave riding on it closer to the inlet cowling until it touched just slightly inside the cowling lip. This position reflected the spike shock-wave repeatedly between the spike centerbody and the inlet inner cowl sides, and minimized airflow spillage which is the cause of <b>spillage</b> <b>drag.</b> The air slowed supersonically with a final plane shock wave at entry to the subsonic diffuser.|$|E

For better performance characteristics, the present method suggests that the inlet should be designed to have some spillage at 13; design Mach number...|$|R
50|$|Ideally, {{the first}} oblique shock wave should {{intercept}} the air intake lip, thus avoiding air <b>spillage</b> and pre-entry <b>drag</b> {{on the outer}} boundary of the deflected streamtube. For a fixed geometry intake at zero incidence, this condition can only be achieved at one particular flight Mach number, because {{the angle of the}} shock wave (to the longitudinal direction) becomes more acute with increasing aircraft speed.|$|R
40|$|Airflow {{characteristics}} of variable cycle engines (VCE) designed for Mach 2. 32 can have transonic airflow requirements {{as high as}} 1. 6 times the cruise airflow. This is a formidable requirement for conventional, high performance, axisymmetric, translating centerbody mixed compression inlets. An alternate inlet is defined where the second cone of a two cone centerbody collapses to the initial cone angle to provide a large off-design airflow capability, and incorporates modest centerbody translation to minimize <b>spillage</b> <b>drag.</b> Estimates of transonic <b>spillage</b> <b>drag</b> are competitive with those of conventional translating centerbody inlets.

40|$|An {{optimisation}} method {{consisting of the}} non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and computational fluid dynamics of aero-engine nacelles is outlined. The method is applied to three nacelle lengths to determine the relative performance of different ultra-high bypass ratio engine nacelles. The optimal designs at each nacelle length are optimised for three objective functions: cruise drag, drag rise Mach number and change in <b>spillage</b> <b>drag</b> from mid to end of cruise. The Pareto sets generated from these optimisation computations demonstrate that the design space for short nacelles is much narrower in terms of these performace metrics and there are significant penalties in the off design conditions compared to the longer nacelle. Specifically the minimum <b>spillage</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient attainable, for a nacelle with a drag rise Mach number above 0. 87, was 0. 0040 for the shortest nacelle compared to 0. 0005 for a nacelle which was 23 % longer...|$|E

In this study, flowfields were simulated by solving the Euler equations with the unstructured grid method for handling the complex geometry. To simulate intake flows at actual flights, a bump was introduced inside the nacelle. The effect of nacelle mass flow ratios on overall aerodynamic performance was investigated in detail by changing bump heights.

Computational techniques must be capable of accurately simulating the physics of shock/boundary layer interactions, secondary corner flows, flow separation, and bleed {{if they are to be}} useful in the design. In particular, bleed and flow separation, play an important role in inlet unstart, and the associated pressure oscillations.

The extrapolation {{was part of a}} joint program to evaluate performance prediction techniques for large flexible supersonic airplanes similar to a supersonic transport. The extrapolation procedure included: interpolation of the wind tunnel data at the specific conditions of the flight test points; determination of the drag increments to be applied to the wind tunnel data, such as <b>spillage</b> <b>drag,</b> boundary layer trip drag, and skin friction increments; and estimates of the drag items not represented on the wind tunnel model, such as bypass doors, roughness, protuberances, and leakage drag.

40|$|The {{impact of}} cruise speed on {{technology}} level for certain aircraft components is examined. External-compression inlets {{were compared with}} mixed compression, self starting inlets at cruise Mach numbers of 2. 0 and 2. 3. Inlet engine combinations that provided the greatest aircraft range were identified. Results show that increased transonic to cruise corrected air flow ratio gives decreased range for missions dominated by supersonic cruise. It is also found important that inlets be designed to minimize <b>spillage</b> <b>drag</b> at subsonic cruise, {{because of the need}} for efficient performance for overland operations. The external compression inlet emerged as the probable first choice at Mach 2. 0, while the self starting inlet was the probable first choice at Mach 2. 3.

40|$|A {{simplified}} method is presented for computing the installation losses of aircraft gas turbine propulsion systems. The method has been programmed {{for use in}} computer aided conceptual aircraft design studies that cover {{a broad range of}} Mach numbers and altitudes.

The methods for computing each of these installation effects are described and computer codes for the calculation of these effects are furnished. The results of these methods are compared with selected data for the F- 5 A and other aircraft. The computer program can be used with uninstalled engine performance information which is currently supplied by a cycle analysis program.

40|$|Air intake related {{aerodynamic}} {{aspects of}} an air breathing cruise missile are analyzed. A method for thrust and drag accounting is established, and, based on that, a partial simulation model for the thrust and intake <b>spillage</b> <b>drag</b> force of the missile is developed. The model combines wind tunnel data with analytical data. The intake spillage force has two components, pre entry force and cowl force. The pre entry force can be computed relatively easily, while the cowl force depends strongly upon actual intake geometry and no general method exists. An approximate cowl force is computed based on available data. The accuracy of the cowl drag results is difficult to predict, as no complete theoretical model is available, and the partial models published cite no accuracy limits. The cowl drag results need further verification through wind tunnel tests or CFD analysis. However, spillage force results are produced {{that are in the}} magnitude of 30 % of total drag, which is expected. Also, dependencies on known variables and trends are as expected. Finally, flight test profiles in order to validate the model are suggested...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{designed to}} measure the external drag of fuselage side intakes is described. The scope of the experiment and the techniques employed are discussed and an assessment is made of the accuracy of results. Measurements of the external drag of rectangular intakes installed {{on the sides of}} a fuselage are presented. Results at subsonic speeds show that drag at full flow is independent of compressmn surface geometry, so that substantial flow spillage may be achieved for little drag penalty provided that the intake throat Mach number is kept high by elevation of the compression surface. For a given total turning of the flow by th 2 compression surface, splllage drag is found to be uniquely related to the inlet mass flow ratio (as distinct from capture mass flow ratlo). Radius of the cowl lip 1 s found to affect the drag of the intake at full flow but becomes less Important as flow is reduced.

40|$|The most {{remarkable}} variable cycle {{characteristic of the}} variable cycle engine (VCE) is that it keeps airflow almost constant during subsonic cruise throttling by modulating variable geometries, which can efficiently decrease <b>spillage</b> <b>drag</b> and increase installed thrust. One {{of the most critical}} challenges for the modulation lies in completely maintaining airflow, as well as avoiding specific fuel consumption (SFC) degradation during throttling. This has resulted in a need to investigate the modulation regulation of the adaptive cycle engine (ACE) which is a new concept for VCE and has greater potential for flexibly modulating airflow and pressure ratio. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} study the variable geometries’ modulation schedule of ACE in maintaining airflow during throttling. A configuration of an ACE concept and its modeling study are first put forward. Then, the control schedule is researched via the combination of sensibility analysis and basic working principle instead of optimizing them directly. Results show that when the net thrust decreases from 100 % to about 55 % during subsonic cruise and to 32 % during the supersonic cruise, the demand airflow of the engine is kept almost constant, which greatly improves the installed performance during throttling...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, active {{research}} has been conducted to study the technological feasibility of supersonic laminar flow control on the wing of the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT). For this study, the F- 16 XL has been chosen due to its highly swept crank wing planform that closely resembles the HSCT configurations. During flights, it is discovered that the shock wave generated from the aircraft inlet introduces disturbances on the wing where the data acquisition is conducted. The flow field about a supersonic inlet is characterized by a complex three dimensional pattern of shock waves generated by the geometrical configuration of a deflector and a cowl lip. Hence, in this study, experimental method is employed to investigate the effects of the variation of deflector configuration on the flow field, and consequently, the possibility of diverting the incoming shock-disturbances away from the test section. In the present experiments, a model composed of a simple circular tube with a triangular deflector is designed to study the deflector length and the deflector base width variation in the flow field. Experimental results indicate that the lowest external pressure ratio is observed at the junction where the deflector lip and the inlet cowl lip merge. Also, it is noted that the external pressure ratio, the internal pressure ratio, the coefficient of <b>spillage</b> <b>drag,</b> and the shock standoff distance decrease as the deflector length increases. In addition, the Redefined Total Pressure Recovery Ratio (RTPRR) increases with an increase in the deflector length. Results from the study of the effect of the deflector's base width variation on the flow field indicate that the lowest external pressure ratio is observed at the junction between the inlet cowl lip and the deflector lip. As the base width of the deflector increases, the external pressure ratio at 0 rotation increases, whereas the external pressure ratio at 180 rotation decreases. In addition, the internal pressure ratio and the coefficient of <b>spillage</b> <b>drag</b> decrease as the base width of the deflector increases. However, RTPRR and shock standoff distance increase as the base width increases. In conclusion, as deflector dimensions vary, distinctive patterns in the pressure variation around the inlet deflector are observed. With an increase in the deflector length and base width, the magnitude of shock-disturbances are weakened due to a decrease in the external pressure ratio. Also, as the deflector length and base width increase, a smaller bow shock angle is formed. Therefore, the inlet shock wave formation would be significantly altered, and consequently, shock disturbances on the wing test section can be avoided through appropriately designing the deflector...|$|E
