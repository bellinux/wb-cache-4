40|$|Background Researching <b>male</b> <b>sex</b> {{work offers}} {{insight into the}} sexual lives {{of men and women}} while {{developing}} a more realistic appreciation for the changing issues associated with <b>male</b> <b>sex</b> work. This type of research is important because it not only reflects a growing and diversifying consumer demand for <b>male</b> <b>sex</b> work, but also because it enables the construction of knowledge that is up-to-date with changing ideas around sex and sexualities. Discussion This paper discusses a range of issues emerging in the <b>male</b> <b>sex</b> industry. Notably, globalisation and technology have contributed to the normalisation of <b>male</b> <b>sex</b> work and reshaped the landscape in which the <b>male</b> <b>sex</b> industry operates. As part of this discussion, we review STI and HIV rates among <b>male</b> <b>sex</b> workers at a global level, which are widely disparate and geographically contextual, with rates of HIV among <b>male</b> <b>sex</b> workers ranging from 0...|$|R

2500|$|Like all individuals, some {{intersex}} {{individuals may}} be raised as a certain <b>sex</b> (<b>male</b> or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not. Recognition of third sex or gender classifications occurs in several countries, however, it is controversial {{when it becomes}} assumed or coercive, {{as is the case}} with some German infants. Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an [...] "X" [...] or [...] "other" [...] option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure.|$|E
2500|$|Particularly among fishes, {{hermaphroditism}} can pay off {{in situations}} where one sex {{is more likely to}} survive and reproduce, perhaps because it is larger. Anemone fishes are sequential hermaphrodites which are born as males, and become females only when they are mature. Anemone fishes live together monogamously in an anemone, protected by the anemone stings. The males do not have to compete with other males, and female anemone fish are typically larger. When a female dies a juvenile (male) anemone fish moves in, and [...] "the resident male then turns into a female and reproductive advantages of the large female–small male combination continue". In other fishes sex changes are reversible. For example, if some gobies are grouped by <b>sex</b> (<b>male</b> or female), some will switch sex.|$|E

2500|$|Male and gay {{prostitution}} {{is increasing}} in Pakistan, though gay prostitution {{is not a}} recent phenomenon in the country. British explorer Richard Francis Burton, who visited the Sindh region long before the British conquest, documented a brothel of boy prostitutes in Karachi. Today many areas of large cities in the country have become virtual red-light districts for gay <b>sex.</b> <b>Male</b> prostitutes operate their business in every city and major town in Pakistan. Clients of male prostitutes come from every class, age group and profession. Homosexual men belonging to the upper and middle classes frequently pick up male prostitutes from video game shops, restaurants and cold-drinks spots. Young male prostitutes generally find customers in places like dark alleys, crowded bus stops, shopping centres, cinemas, hotel lobbies, parks, railway stations, hospitals, school compounds, elevators of public buildings etc. Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Sabzi Mandi, Lea Market, Landhi, Malir, and Lyari in Karachi are places visited by homosexuals from lower income groups. Clients in these areas primarily consist of bus drivers and conductors, night watchmen, labourers from upcountry, policemen, low-income government officials, small-time [...] businesspersons etc.|$|E
2500|$|A gregarious animal, the chital forms matriarchal herds {{comprising}} {{an adult}} female and her offspring {{of the previous}} and the present year, which {{may be associated with}} individuals of any age and either <b>sex,</b> <b>male</b> herds and herds of juveniles and mothers. Small herds are common, though aggregations of as many as 100 individuals have been observed. Groups are loose and disband frequently, save for the juvenile-mother herd. Herd membership in Texas is typically up to 15; herds can have five to 40 members in India. Studies in the Nallamala Hills (Andhra Pradesh, India) and the Western Ghats (western coast of India) showed seasonal variation in the sex ratio of herds; this was attributed to the tendency of females to isolate themselves ahead of parturition. Similarly, rutting males leave their herds during the mating season, hence altering the herd composition. Large herds were most common in monsoon, observed foraging in the grasslands. Predators of the chital include wolves, Bengal tigers, [...] Asiatic lions, leopards, Indian rock pythons, dholes, Indian pariah dogs and mugger crocodiles. Red foxes and golden jackals target juveniles. Males are less vulnerable than females and juveniles.|$|E
