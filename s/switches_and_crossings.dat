40|$|Approximately 25 {{percent of}} the budget for the {{maintenance}} and renewal of railway tracks –in Switzerland more than a billion Swiss Francs– is used for the <b>switches</b> (points) <b>and</b> <b>crossings</b> (S&C). While in the mean time the budget expenditure for the maintenance and renewal of plain track is optimized with e. g. the help of decision support systems, for S&C this optimisation stays rather rudimentary. One of the identified causes thereof is the lack of insight in the degradation and deterioration process of S&C. This study therefore combined several databases of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). Statistical analyses are carried out on them to retrieve the lifetime expectancy of complete railway <b>switches</b> (points) & <b>crossings</b> <b>and</b> their respective components, e. g. point rails, stock rails, frog.

40|$|A highly {{available}} {{infrastructure is}} a premise for a capable railway operation of high quality. Therefore maintenance is necessary. Especially switches are critical because they connect different tracks and allow {{a train to}} change its moving direction without stopping. Their inspection, maintenance and repair {{have been identified as}} a cost driver for infrastructure managers. The Institute of Transportation Systems, in cooperation with the German Railways (DB AG) is exploring ways to monitor the condition of <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> their degradation process to reduce failures and thus maintenance costs. Any sensor applied in the field has to be very reliable and robust, {{due to the fact that}} switches are exposed to strong forces and sometimes extreme weather conditions. But such sensors are expensive. Hence huge investments would have to be made if the current 71 000 <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> diamond <b>crossings</b> of German Railways would be equipped. Therefore it is the goal of the research to determine and monitor the condition without sensors. External data sources have to be identified and integrated to provide the necessary information otherwise gained from sensors. This paper presents how an existing diagnostic system can be improved via external measured parameters to monitor the switch condition...|$|R

The switches that are used in the universality result are re-used in order to prove another result. Define the accessibility problem for railway circuits to consist in the following. The circuit is given with, at the same time, two points of the circuit, one is called the source point, the other one is called the target point and a fixed number of other points, called flip-flop switches, that can be initialized arbitrarily. The problem is to decide, whether or not there is an initialization of the flip-flop switches such that it is then possible to go from the source to the target. This problem is proved to be NP-complete...|$|R

50|$|Mangalloy {{has been}} used in the mining industry, cement mixers, rock crushers, railway <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossings,</b> crawler treads for {{tractors}} and other high impact and abrasive environments. It is also used in high impact environments like inside a shot peening machine. These alloys are finding new uses as cryogenic steels, due to their high strength at very low temperatures. Mangalloy is heat treatable, but the manganese lowers the temperature at which austenite transforms into ferrite. Unlike carbon steel, mangalloy softens rather than hardens when rapidly cooled, restoring the ductility from a work-hardened state. Most grades are ready for use after annealing and then quenching from a yellow heat, with no further need of tempering, and usually have a normal Brinell hardness of around 200 HB, (roughly the same as 304 stainless steel), but, due to its unique properties, the indentation hardness has very little effect on determining the scratch hardness (the abrasion and impact resistance of the metal). Another source says that the basic Brinnell hardness of manganese steel according to the original Hadfield specification is 220 but that with impact wear the surface hardness will increase to over 550.|$|E
5000|$|On 12 July 2013, {{the last}} four cars of an SNCF Paris-Limoges train left the track while {{entering}} the Brétigny-sur-Orge station, killing seven people and injuring 32. The French land transport accident investigation bureau BEA-TT concluded in an interim report published on 10 January 2014 that [...] "the derailment {{was caused by a}} fishplate obstructing the flangeway of an oblique crossing forming part of a double slip. Under the weight of the train travelling at 137 km/h, the fishplate had pivoted around the first of four bolts meant to hold it in place, the three others having come loose. The most likely cause of the bolts coming loose, says BEA-TT, were stresses caused by cracking in the cast steel crossing. This had caused the head of the third bolt to break off and the others to fail, one becoming unscrewed and the heads of the other two also shearing off." [...] Recommendations included improving agency expertise in bolted track joints, clarification and reinforcement of regulations for defect detection and repair, and identification of <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossings</b> where higher levels of maintenance and early renewal should be implemented.|$|E

40|$|It is {{reported}} that <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossings</b> (S&C) {{are one of}} the subsystems that cause the most delays on Swedish Railways while accounting for at least 13 % of maintenance costs [6]. It is the main reason why we chose to base our study on this subsystem. Intelligent data processing allows understanding the real reliability characteristics of the assets to be maintained. The first objective of this research is to determine the S&C reliability characteristics based on field data collection. Because field failure data are typically strongly censored, an especial statistics software package was developed to process field failure data, as commercial packages have not been found satisfactory in that respect. The resulting software, named RDAT® (Reliability Data Analysis Tool) has been relied upon for this study: it is especially adapted to statistical failure data analysis. In the next step the availability of studied <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossings</b> is estimated based on the reliability characteristics founded in the first step.

40|$|The {{development}} of reliable methods for measuring deflections as trains pass has enabled valuable insights into railway track behaviour to be gained. This is especially useful for problem {{areas such as}} transitions from normal ground onto hard substructures and complex track geometries such as <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossings.</b> To date, {{much of the research}} on transition zone behaviour has focussed on transitions associated with underbridges and other substructures. <b>Switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossings</b> have received some attention and level crossings generally very little. This paper describes and discusses the behaviour of a transition onto a level crossing in the south of England, UK. Measurements are presented from both trackside and on-train instruments. It is found that at this crossing, maintenance constraints have resulted in a group of unsupported or hanging sleepers on the approach to the crossing; and that this fault is not effectively rectified by tamping. Comparisons are also made between the way the fault shows up in measurements from trains of the loaded track profile and data from trackside measurements. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Sudden {{application}} of heavy traction/braking torque induces flats in rail wagon wheelsets. Flat wheels generate high frequency impact forces sufficient to cause severe {{damage to the}} rail head surface. Early detection of flats would facilitate re-profiling the wheels before they cause serious damage to critical rail components, such as <b>switches,</b> <b>crossings,</b> <b>and</b> insulated rail joints. Although there are many sensors available in the market to detect/record wagon accelerations, there are no powerful signal processing tools readily available to detect the presence of wheel flats from the recorded acceleration signatures. This study presents two wavelet approaches to overcome the difficulties in the on-board monitoring and detection systems of rail wheel flats using vibration signals. Signal average techniques, wavelet local energy average concept, and wavelet decomposition are employed in this study. A Matlab-Simulink based dynamic simulation system capable of modeling the wheel flats and track irregularities is also developed for predicting the wheelset/bogie frame acceleration time series. An analysis of the numerical simulation results demonstrates that the methods proposed {{in this study are}} effective for the on-board monitoring of wheel flats of sizes smaller than the condemning limits.
