5|$|The outlet of {{the river}} onto the Humber {{is thought to have}} changed in the early medieval period. The {{original}} outlet has been identified at a place called Limekiln creek.

5|$|The Zagreb TV centre {{became a}} member of the Yugoslav Radio Television (JRT) (an {{umbrella}} organization of television stations in Yugoslavia), acting as Eurovision Technical Centre for the JRT. In 1972 Television Zagreb began broadcasting of its <b>second</b> <b>channel,</b> and switched to airing its programming in color in 1975. The third Television Zagreb channel was introduced in 1988, and teletext service was launched in 1990. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, Television Zagreb was renamed Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) and it {{became a member}} of the European Broadcasting Union; however, HRT suffered significant war damage to its infrastructure as 80 percent of its transmitters and 30 relay stations were damaged, destroyed or occupied. In October 1999 all three nationwide HRT channels started broadcasting around the clock, but in 2002 the third HRT channel ceased operation. Nova TV, the first privately owned television station in Croatia, began operating in 2000. It was followed by another privately owned broadcaster, RTL Televizija, on 30 April 2004. Both Nova TV and RTL Televizija aired a single analog TV channel each.|$|E

25|$|The levee {{also saw}} {{significant}} improvement during the 1850s. In {{the first half}} of the 19th century, a <b>second</b> <b>channel</b> developed in the Mississippi River at St. Louis. An island (nicknamed Bloody Island for the duels fought there) formed between the two channels, and a smaller island (Duncan's Island) developed below St. Louis. It was feared that the levee at St. Louis might be left high and dry, and federal assistance was sought and obtained with a grant of $50,000 in 1851. Using the engineering planning of Robert E. Lee, levees were constructed in 1852 and 1853 on the Illinois side to direct water toward Missouri and eliminate the <b>second</b> <b>channel,</b> joining Bloody Island to the land on the Illinois side and washing away Duncan's Island by 1855.|$|E
25|$|Below Doncaster, {{the main}} channel {{of the lower}} Don {{originally}} meandered in a north-easterly direction across the marshland of Hatfield Chase to enter the Trent just above its junction with the Ouse.

25|$|The Egyptian {{television}} {{began with}} a six-hour-broadcasting channel; however the broadcasting hours changed to 13 hours/day. Later, in 1961, a <b>second</b> <b>channel</b> was launched, and a third channel was launched in 1962. Thus, the total broadcasting hours of the three channels was 25–30 hours/day. The contents of the shows reflected people's interests at the time.|$|E

25|$|Dual-trace {{oscilloscopes}} have a {{mode switch}} to select either channel alone, both channels, or (in some) an X‑Y display, which uses the <b>second</b> <b>channel</b> for X deflection. When both channels are displayed, {{the type of}} channel switching can be selected on some oscilloscopes; on others, the type depends upon timebase setting. If manually selectable, channel switching can be free-running (asynchronous), or between consecutive sweeps. Some Philips dual-trace analog oscilloscopes had a fast analog multiplier, and provided a display of {{the product of the}} input channels.|$|E
25|$|A 1994 {{ruling by}} the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom held the New Zealand Government {{responsible}} under the Treaty of Waitangi (1840) {{for the preservation of}} the language. Accordingly, since March 2004, the state has funded Māori Television, broadcast partly in Māori. On 28 March 2008, Māori Television launched its <b>second</b> <b>channel,</b> Te Reo, broadcast entirely in the Māori language, with no advertising or subtitles. The first Māori TV channel, Aotearoa Television Network (ATN) was available to viewers in the Auckland region from 1996, but lasted for one year only.|$|E

25|$|According to Reformed theologians, God's self-revelation {{is always}} through his son Jesus Christ, because Christ {{is the only}} {{mediator}} between God and people. Revelation of God through Christ comes through two basic channels. The first is creation and providence, which is God's creating and continuing {{to work in the}} world. This action of God gives everyone knowledge about God, but this knowledge is only sufficient to make people culpable for their sin; it does not include knowledge of the gospel. The <b>second</b> <b>channel</b> through which God reveals himself is redemption, which is the gospel of salvation from condemnation which is punishment for sin.|$|E
25|$|Attenborough, by then {{controller}} of BBC 2, {{wanted to}} make a strong statement on BBC's <b>second</b> <b>channel</b> of the boundless possibilities that colour television offered, and recognised that natural history was the obvious subject matter to choose. He commissioned a series called The World About Us (1969–1982) that would broadcast in a 50-minute Sunday evening slot. Because of the challenge of producing enough colour material, the commission was shared between the NHU and London's Travel and Exploration Unit. The extended opportunities offered by the 50-minute format and improvements in film technology and expertise finally allowed the NHU to begin showcasing its talent.|$|E
25|$|Multiplexes {{can make}} use of {{statistical}} multiplexing at the MPEG video coder whereby the bitrate allocated to a channel within the multiplex can vary dynamically depending on {{how difficult it is}} to code the picture content at that precise time, and how much demand there is for bandwidth from other channels. In this way, complex pictures with much detail may demand a higher bitrate at one instant and this can result in the bitrate allocated to another channel in the same multiplex being reduced if the <b>second</b> <b>channel</b> is currently transmitting pictures which are easier to encode, with less fine detail.|$|E

50|$|In 1960 {{the company}} was renamed Schweizerische Radio- und Fernsehgesellschaft (and the {{equivalent}} names in the other languages - see above) to reflect the addition of television services. In 1964 the Federal Council allowed television advertising, {{as a means of}} keeping licence fees down. In 1966 the three main languages were each given a <b>second</b> radio <b>channel,</b> in order to counter the effects of new commercial broadcasters outside the country, whose strong signals were reaching the Swiss population. In the same year a dedicated Romansh broadcasting unit was created in Chur, using some of the new German-language <b>second</b> <b>channel's</b> broadcasting time. In 1968 colour television was introduced, and the number of licence fee payers passed one million.|$|R

25|$|Van Zandt is {{also the}} program {{director}} for two radio channels for the Sirius Satellite Radio network. The channels continuously broadcast on satellite radio in the US, and worldwide on Sirius Internet Radio. One channel, named Underground Garage, has the same philosophy and musical mandate as his own radio show. On-air hosts on the channel include original Rolling Stones manager/producer Andrew Loog Oldham, singer/guitarist Joan Jett, former record executive Kid Leo, punk rock singer Handsome Dick Manitoba and rock entrepreneur Kim Fowley. The <b>second</b> <b>channel,</b> named the Outlaw Country, presents the edgier side of country music, both roots and contemporary. On-air hosts for this channel include pop-culture satirist Mojo Nixon.|$|E
25|$|The World Service {{employed}} a {{medium wave transmitter}} at Orford Ness to provide English-language coverage to Europe, including on the frequency 648 kHz (which could be heard {{in parts of the}} south-east of England). Transmissions on this frequency were stopped on 27 March 2011, {{as a consequence of the}} budgetary constraints imposed on the BBC World Service in the 2010 budget review. A <b>second</b> <b>channel</b> (1296kHz) traditionally broadcast in various Central European languages, but in 2005 it began regular English-language transmissions via the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) format. This is a digital shortwave technology that VT expects to become the standard for cross-border transmissions in developed countries.|$|E
