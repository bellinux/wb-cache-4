25|$|An {{example of}} a D/L tied match was the ODI between England and India on 11 September 2011.

At one point, India were leading under D/L during one rain delay, and would have won if play had not resumed. At a second rain interval, England, who had scored <b>some</b> <b>quick</b> runs (knowing they needed to get ahead in D/L terms) would correspondingly have won if play had not resumed. Play was finally called off with just 7 balls of the match remaining and England's score equal to the Duckworth–Lewis 'par' score, therefore resulting in a tie.|$|E

Then Shoaib returned, taking four wickets (to end with bowling figures of 9.2-1-55-5), and the wheels fell off as Northamptonshire lost their last six wickets for 12 runs. Stephen Moore continued his fine form, making 62, as Worcestershire looked to gain a slender lead - Ben Phillips taking a couple of wickets to give Northamptonshire some hope of tying the hosts down. Then, Damien Wright ripped through with <b>some</b> <b>quick</b> wickets, as Worcestershire went from 110 for 3 to 147 for 8 - only for Shoaib and Matthew Mason to give Worcestershire the lead thanks to a boundary-filled 47-run partnership.|$|E

In his next two overs, Tendulkar dismissed Hayden and trapped Warne lbw with a perfectly pitched googly. Harbhajan then took the final two wickets to take his match tally to 13 wickets and complete a sensational 171 run Indian victory.

25|$|After {{a string}} of four minor games the MCC played South Australia {{on either side of}} Christmas, with Christmas Day and Boxing Day being rest days. Les Favell won the toss and batted. Lynn Marks and Les Cunningham were out for ducks, but Favell (40) added 58 for the second wicket with Ian Chappell (59), {{followed}} by Brian Shiell who made his highest First Class score of 202 not out, adding 146 with Barry Jarman (70), 51 with George Griffiths (23) and 129 with David Sincock (28 not out) when Favell declared at 459/5 at lunch on the second day. Chappell caught Geoff Boycott for a duck and with Peter Parfitt out for 6 the MCC were 13/2 before Bob Barber (46) and Colin Cowdrey (18) added 53 for the third wicket. M.J.K. Smith made 108, adding 136 with Ken Barrington (63), while John Murray (110) and Fred Titmus (79) put together 164 for the eight wicket. The MCC's 444 nearly matched South Australia's score and Favell set about making runs for a declaration, Ian Chappell hitting 113 not out as they rattled up 253/4 in 249 minutes. Left to make 269 runs in three hours the MCC responded in kind, Boycott (58) and Barber (77) made 138 for the first wicket, Cowdrey made 63 not out and the all rounder Barry Knight (46) was promoted up the order so that he could hit <b>some</b> <b>quick</b> runs.

25|$|On to the Adelaide Oval, {{or rather}} {{not as the}} SACA ringed off the famously long curves, much to the {{disappointment}} of those who liked seeing all-run fives when batsmen hit a straight-drive. South Australia had not won the Sheffield Shield for ten years, but were to do so again in 1963-64 {{with the help of}} their multi-talented import Gary Sobers. They were captained by the old favourite Les Favell and had a 19-year-old Ian Chappell in the team, but their Chinaman bowler David Sincock was unable to play because of his exams. The Melbourne Cup was due to be played during the match, so Ted Dexter and the Duke were off to the races and Colin Cowdrey was in charge. Favell won the toss, batted, and saw his side make steady progress to 324/7 {{by the end of the}} day. Favell was first out for 7 and his fellow-opener John Causby was run out by Ken Barrington and wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 16, but John Lill (87) and Gary Sobers (42) stroked their way to a third-wicket stand of 113 before they were both out on 154, along with Neil Dansie for a duck and South Australia were 154/4. Ian McLachlan (53) and Ian Chappell (36) added 66 before the youngster tripped over himself while hooking Brian Statham and hit the wicket with his bat. Statham (4/58) cleared up the tail with 3 wickets for 11 runs and South Australia were out for 335. Fred Titmus (1/80) and Ray Illingworth (0/43) failed to turn the ball on the notoriously flat wicket and Cowdrey set up defensive fields which rather relied on the batsmen getting themselves out, still the runs flowed enough and the crowd enjoyed themselves. Cowdrey was out for this third consecutive duck when acting as opener, but everybody else had a fine time; Geoff Pullar (21) added 55 for the second-wicket with Ken Barrington (102), who added another 168 with the stylish Tom Graveney (99), beating the third-wicket record for the MCC vs South Australia set by Plum Warner and George Gunn in 1911-12. Graveney was the more polished of the two, but Barrington hit Neil Hawke (6/130) for 4 boundaries in five balls. They and Peter Parfitt (15) were all out by 257/5, but the depth of the MCC batting was shown by Fred Titmus who hit a solid 137 not out, his highest first class century, adding 108 runs with Barry Knight (55) and 121 with wicket-keeper Alan Smith (another 55) and Cowdrey declared on 508/9. South Australia knocked off the 173 run deficit the same day, making 174/5 by stumps, with Sobers (99) run out by Statham going for his 100th run and everybody else chipping in. A shower of rain allowed everybody to get off the field to watch the Melbourne Cup and Favell declared on 283/7 to leave the MCC 67 minutes to make 111 runs. They made 95/1, thanks to <b>some</b> <b>quick</b> hitting by Pullar (56), but after playing into more rain they gave up 16 runs short in an affable, but farcical end. On a flat wicket with indifferent bowling the teams made 1,221 runs in four days despite the rain.|$|E
