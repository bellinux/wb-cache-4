5|$|Nagumo quickly {{reversed}} {{his order}} to re-arm the bombers with general purpose bombs {{and demanded that}} the <b>scout</b> <b>plane</b> ascertain {{the composition of the}} American force. Another 20–40 minutes elapsed before Tones scout finally radioed the presence of a single carrier in the American force. This was one of the carriers from Task Force 16. The other carrier was not sighted.|$|E
5|$|Hermes was berthed in Trincomalee on 8 April when {{a warning}} of an {{approaching}} Japanese fleet was received, and she sailed that day for the Maldives with no aircraft on board. On 9 April a Japanese <b>scout</b> <b>plane</b> spotted her near Batticaloa, and she was attacked by several dozen dive bombers shortly afterwards. With no air cover, the carrier was quickly sunk by the Japanese aircraft. Most of the survivors were rescued by a nearby hospital ship, although 307 men from Hermes {{were lost in the}} sinking.|$|E
5|$|This was {{a result}} of the attacks from Midway, {{as well as of the}} morning flight leader's {{recommendation}} of a second strike. Re-arming had been under way for about 30 minutes when, at 07:40, the delayed <b>scout</b> <b>plane</b> from Tone signaled that it had sighted a sizable American naval force to the east, but neglected to describe its composition. Later evidence suggests Nagumo did not receive the sighting report until 08:00.|$|E
5000|$|Quite {{possibly}} the most illustrious use of <b>scout</b> <b>planes</b> were with the sister battleships [...] and [...] Their extremely long range meant that they could fire over the horizon, and <b>scout</b> <b>planes</b> were needed to spot enemy ships. Seven seaplane scouts were carried on each ship, including four Aichi E13A for long-range reconnaissance, and three Mitsubishi F1Ms for artillery direction. Japan also pioneered the concept of submarine-borne <b>scout</b> <b>planes,</b> {{with a number of}} large submarines having waterproof hangars and catapults to carry scout floatplanes during World War II.|$|R

50|$|During {{that same}} day, Savannahs <b>scout</b> <b>planes</b> {{started a new}} phase of warfare by {{successfully}} bombing some tank columns with their depth charges, whose fuses had been set to detonate on impact. The <b>scout</b> <b>planes,</b> maintaining about eight hours of flight time daily, struck at other shore targets, and they also kept up antisubmarine patrols. Savannahs warplanes located an enemy battery that had been firing on the destroyer , and eliminated the battery with two well-placed depth charges.|$|R
5|$|During 1918, Australia and the Grand Fleet's {{other capital}} ships on {{occasion}} escorted convoys travelling between Britain and Norway. The 2nd BCS spent {{the period from}} 8 to 21 February covering these convoys in company with battleships and destroyers, and put to sea on 6 March in company with the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron to support minelayers. From 8 March on, the battlecruiser tested the capabilities of aircraft launched from platforms mounted over 'P' and 'Q' turrets. Australia, {{along with the rest}} of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot. The 2nd BCS sailed again on 25 April to support minelayers, then cover one of the Scandinavian convoys the next day. Following the successful launch of a fully laden Sopwith 1½ Strutter <b>scout</b> <b>plane</b> on 14 May, Australia started carrying two aircraft—a Strutter for reconnaissance, and a Sopwith Camel fighter—and operated them until the end of the war. The 2nd BCS again supported minelayers in the North Sea between 25–26 June and 29–30 July. During September and October, Australia and the 2nd BCS supervised and protected minelaying operations north of Orkney.|$|E

Along with guarding the carriers, North Carolina fired on major industrial plants near Tokyo, {{and one of her}} <b>scout</b> <b>plane</b> pilots performed a daring rescue of a downed carrier pilot under heavy fire in Tokyo Bay.|$|E
25|$|The Kingfisher {{was widely}} {{used as a}} shipboard, catapult-launched <b>scout</b> <b>plane</b> on U.S. Navy battleships, heavy cruisers and light cruisers during World War II, as well as playing {{a major role in}} support of shore bombardments and air-sea rescue. Two {{examples}} showing the plane's rescue capabilities include the recovery of World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker and his crew from the Pacific in November 1942 and Lieutenant John A. Burns' unique use of the aircraft in April 1944 to taxi airmen rescued from Truk Lagoon to the submarine , which was serving rescue duty near the atoll on that date. In all, LT Burns rescued 10 survivors on two trips and was awarded the Navy Cross for his efforts.|$|E
50|$|All day on 18 June 1944, each force {{sent out}} <b>scout</b> <b>planes</b> {{in an effort}} to locate its adversary. Because of their greater range, the Japanese {{aircraft}} managed to obtain some knowledge of Spruance's ships, but American <b>scout</b> <b>planes</b> were unable to find Ozawa's force. Early the following morning, 19 June, aircraft from Mitscher's carriers headed for Guam to neutralize that island for the coming battle and in a series of dogfights, destroyed many Japanese land-based planes.|$|R

During April, the {{squadron}} maintained a high operational tempo with {{the launch of the}} Arras offensive. In an air battle on 29 April, Minifie was credited with his first two aerial victories, shooting down an Albatros D.III in a solo effort, before sharing in the destruction of a second with fellow Australian, Flight Sub-Lieutenant Robert A.

Over the next two months, Minifie participated in the [...] "highly effective" [...] ground-strafing missions on Bullecourt and during the Battle of Messines, while simultaneously adding to his tally of aircraft brought down; he became an ace during this period. At 19 years of age, Minifie was the youngest Australian ace of the First World War. He was promoted to acting flight lieutenant in July, taking part in the Passchendaele offensive later that month. On 8 August, Minifie destroyed a German <b>scout</b> <b>plane,</b> forcing the machine down in flames and thus scoring his seventh victory. Ten days later, he executed a raid on two German aerodromes. Flying at a height of , he fired approximated 450 rounds of ammunition into the hangars. Cited for his efforts in bringing down several German aircraft and his assaults on ground targets between April and September, Minifie was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The notice for the decoration was promulgated in a supplement to the London Gazette on 2 November 1917.|$|E

[...] Flying SE-5A single-seaters, he claimed ten aerial victories, {{one of which was}} a Fokker triplane which was forced to land inside Allied lines and was captured intact. [...] The pilot of the plane was Gefr Preiss of Jasta 14, whose parachute was sent to England for further study. [...] In August he helped bring down another German <b>scout</b> <b>plane</b> inside Allied lines.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1917, [...] {{became the}} first Australian warship to launch an {{aircraft}} from aboard ship (as opposed to Brisbane, which placed the seaplane in the water before launch), when a Sopwith Pup took off from the battlecruiser's quarterdeck. From March 1918 onwards, the battlecruiser [...] {{was used to test}} a new method of aircraft launch; this time from platforms secured on top of a gun turret and its barrels. Following the successful launch of a fully laden Sopwith 1½ Strutter <b>scout</b> <b>plane</b> on 14 May, the first aircraft launch from a turret platform, Australia was fitted with platforms over her two midships turrets and started carrying two aircraft—a Strutter for reconnaissance, and a Sopwith Camel fighter—and operated them {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
2500|$|The battle {{commenced}} on {{the morning}} of June 4; the first several waves of U.S. attack aircraft were badly beaten, both near Midway and at sea around the Japanese task force. Then U.S. dive bombers from Spruance's Enterprise located Nagumo's fleet of four carrierswhich, fatefully, were without air cover. Most of Nagumo's attack planes had just returned from the first strike on Midway and were immobilized on the carrier decks, while his CAP cover planes were engaged with battling torpedo bombers sent by Spruance from Hornet (see [...] ). The U.S. dive bombers critically damaged three Japanese carriers including Nagumo's flagship all three eventually sank. The surviving carrier, , gave the Japanese some (brief) respite by sending strikes that crippled Yorktown. But several hours laternear the end of daylight hoursa U.S. <b>scout</b> <b>plane</b> located Hiryū again. Spruance quickly ordered his dive bombers to strike, which fatally damaged the fourth Japanese carrier; it was scuttled the next day.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{aircraft}} carriers {{also began to}} appear; these rarely carried dedicated <b>scout</b> <b>planes,</b> but usually combined this function {{with other types of}} aircraft, such as dive bombers (hence this type of aircraft was known in the United States Navy as [...] "scout bomber") or torpedo bombers ("torpedo scouts").|$|R
5000|$|The {{ship was}} spotted by US naval <b>scout</b> <b>planes</b> and escorted into Pearl Harbor on December 28, 1941 where Admiral Claude Bloch cited the crew for action beyond {{the call of}} duty.

The cruiser {{may or may not}} have been at action stations: the main guns and port torpedo launcher were trained on Kormoran and her Walrus <b>scout</b> <b>plane</b> had been readied for launch, prompting Detmers to prepare to engage Sydney, but her [...] guns were unmanned, and personnel were standing on the upper deck. During her manoeuvre, Sydney appeared to signal [...] "IK" [...] (the short-form for [...] "You should prepare for a cyclone, hurricane, or typhoon"), which Kormoran did not respond to, as from their perspective, such a signal did not make sense. The Germans were unaware that the letters were the interior of the real Straat Malakkas secret callsign, [...] "IIKP": to verify her identity, the ship had to signal back the outer letters. The aircraft was shut down by 17:25, and the catapult swung into the storage position; the two ships were too close for a safe launch.|$|E

By eleven in the morning, the convoy was being shadowed by a Japanese flying boat that dropped some bombs without causing damage before departing. The next morning another shadowing aircraft had taken position, and before noon the convoy was attacked by bombers and flying boats in two waves. During the first attack, Mauna Loa suffered slight damage and two casualties, one killed and one wounded. Houstons fire showed no effects. During the second attack, Houston distinguished herself with a barrage which made her [...] "like a sheet of flame" [...] shooting down 7 of the 44 planes of the second wave. The convoy continued toward Timor for a few hours, with Houston launching a <b>scout</b> <b>plane</b> seeking the enemy position. ABDA suspected the presence of Japanese carriers, an imminent invasion of Timor, and a support fleet lying in wait and thus ordered the convoy back to Darwin, which it reached before noon on the 18 February.|$|E

Not until after World War II, however, did {{the story of}} her last battle emerge, when a survivor of the heavy cruiser , told of meeting, in prison camp, Fireman 1st Class Fred L. Brown. Hampered by engine troubles and sailing alone, Asheville was discovered on 3 March 1942 by a shipborne <b>scout</b> <b>plane</b> south of Java and overtaken by a Japanese surface force, lead by Vice Admiral Nobutake Kondō, consisting of the destroyers [...] and , and the heavy cruiser [...] As the cruiser stood by, the two Japanese destroyers closed and engaged Asheville at close range with their guns. After an intense 30-minute gun battle, the smoldering hulk of Asheville, her forecastle and bridge almost completely shot away, finally sank. Brown, an 18 years old from Ft. Wayne, Indiana, had been in the gunboat's fire room when the surface force had overtaken the ship. Many men topside were dead by the time Brown arrived topside to abandon ship. After calling to ask if there was an officer among the swimmers a sailor on board one of the enemy destroyers threw out a line, which Brown grasped and was hauled on board. Ashevilles only known survivor perished in the Japanese Makassar prisoner-of-war camp on 18 March 1945, in the Celebes Islands of the Netherlands East Indies.|$|E
