5|$|The {{story of}} Florida International University's {{founding}} began in 1943, when state Senator Ernest 'Cap' Graham (father of future Florida governor and U.S. <b>senator</b> <b>Bob</b> Graham) presented {{the state legislature}} with the initial proposal {{for the establishment of}} a public university in South Florida. While his bill did not pass, Graham persisted in presenting his proposal to colleagues, advising them of Miami's need for a state university. He felt the establishment of a public university was necessary to serve the city's growing population.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Abu-Jamal {{published}} {{an essay in}} the Yale Law Journal, {{on the death penalty}} and his death row experience. In May 1994, Abu-Jamal was engaged by National Public Radio's All Things Considered program to deliver a series of monthly three-minute commentaries on crime and punishment. The broadcast plans and commercial arrangement were canceled following condemnations from, among others, the Fraternal Order of Police and US <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> Dole (Kansas Republican Party). Abu-Jamal sued NPR for not airing his work, but a federal judge dismissed the suit. His commentaries later were published in May 1995 as part of Live from Death Row.|$|E

He began working again with fellow former <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> Dole to convince the Senate to support this effort, as well as expanded school lunch, food stamps, and nutritional help for pregnant women and poor children in the U.S.|$|E

Originally estimated to cost $6.8 million, groundbreaking was on April 13, 1985, with Hatfield in attendance. On September 4, 1986, the new library building was dedicated in a ceremony featuring Hatfield, then <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> Packwood, and then Librarian of Congress Daniel J. Boorstin. Then school president Jerry E. Hudson presided over the ceremony that had over 700 people in attendance.|$|E
5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a {{challenge}} for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> Dole of Kansas.|$|E
5|$|The {{funeral service}} for Pat Nixon {{took place in}} the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda on June 26, 1993. Speakers at the ceremony, {{including}} California Governor Pete Wilson, Kansas <b>senator</b> <b>Bob</b> Dole, and the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, eulogized the former First Lady. In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith said that she had never seen him more distraught.|$|E

5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah <b>senator</b> <b>Bob</b> Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, Obama {{attended}} a Philadelphia fundraising dinner for Specter, an unusually public {{declaration of support}} {{so early in the}} primary season, when the President has the option of remaining neutral until the final outcome becomes clearer. Governor Rendell said that Obama and Biden felt obligated to strongly support Specter because they so strongly lobbied him to switch parties. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and radio personality Michael Smerconish also spoke on Specter's behalf. Senate Majority Leader Reid took the unusual steps of scheduling no Senate votes that day so both Specter and Pennsylvania <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> Casey, Jr. could attend the fundraiser. That move drew criticism from Republicans, as well as from Sestak, who felt Specter was skirting his Senate responsibilities, yet hypocritically criticizing Sestak at the same time for missing more than 100 votes in the U.S. House. The event was expected to raise about $2.5 million, which was to be split between Specter's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. After the fundraiser, Obama and Specter traveled via Air Force One to Pittsburgh to address labor activists at the AFL-CIO convention. There, Specter assured the audience he would support the Employee Free Choice Act, a proposed bill that would make union formation easier, which Specter had previously opposed as a Republican.|$|E
