5|$|With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made {{improvements}} to reduce occurrences of unexpected <b>shutdowns</b> {{that a small}} number of users were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down. We also added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown. It {{is important to note that}} these unexpected <b>shutdowns</b> are not a safety issue, but we understand it can be an inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible. If a customer has any issues with their device they can contact AppleCare.|$|E
50|$|The 2017 New Jersey state {{government}} <b>shutdown</b> {{was the second}} <b>shutdown</b> {{in the history of}} the U.S. state of New Jersey. The <b>shutdown</b> occurred after the New Jersey Legislature, and Governor Chris Christie failed to agree on a state budget by the constitutional deadline. Exercising his constitutional powers as governor, Christie ordered the <b>shutdown</b> as a means of pressuring the Legislature to pass a budget. The <b>shutdown</b> began at midnight on July 1, 2017, when Christie called for an orderly <b>shutdown</b> of non-essential government services.|$|R
5000|$|During the <b>shutdown,</b> {{approximately}} 800,000 {{federal employees}} were indefinitely furloughed, and another 1.3 million {{were required to}} report to work without known payment dates.

40|$|<b>Shutdown</b> {{maintenance}} {{projects are}} an intergral {{part of any}} plant maintenance system. When a plant is <b>shutdown,</b> production stops and major maintenance work and modification of components is carried out. Whatever the {{size and scope of}} the <b>shutdown,</b> component project management. is vital if the <b>shutdown</b> project is to be completed successfully. This autnor has found that {{there is little or no}} literature available that treats <b>shutdown</b> maintenance projects as a complete study. The study of the management organisation and structure, as well as the associated resources and services required by a <b>shutdown</b> project manager has been neglected. The aim of this thesis project is to research and investigate <b>shutdown</b> maintenance and to present it as a complete study. All the aspects of <b>shutdown</b> maintenance project management are dealt with. This is done in tne following way. <b>Shutdown</b> maintenance is defined with specific objectives. Then the management organi sati on. and structure, as well as the resources and services required for <b>shutdown</b> projects are discussed. The <b>shutdown</b> project management procedure and techniques are dealt with next, and finally there is a section on the effect of condition based maintenance on <b>shutdown</b> maintenance projects. This thesis project serves to provide a complete perspective on snutdown proJects where this was found to be lacking in previous literature on maintenance management. This thesis provides a useful source of instruction and information to an engineer who for the first time has been given a <b>shutdown</b> project to complete...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to fuel and oxidizer systems, the launch vehicle's {{main propulsion system}} is also equipped with a helium system consisting of ten storage tanks in {{addition to}} various regulators, check valves, distribution lines, and control valves. The system is used in-flight to purge the engine and provides pressure for actuating engine valves within the propellant management system and during emergency <b>shutdowns.</b> During entry, on the Space Shuttle, any remaining helium was used to purge the engines during reentry and for repressurization.|$|E

The intakes had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures {{to be met}} in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternate path for excess intake air during engine throttling or <b>shutdowns.</b> The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 New Jersey state {{government}} shutdown {{was the first}} shutdown {{in the history of}} the U.S. state of New Jersey. The shutdown occurred after the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Jon Corzine failed to agree on a state budget by the constitutional deadline. Furthermore, Corzine and the Legislature clashed on the issue of raising the state sales tax to help balance budget. Exercising his constitutional powers as governor, Corzine ordered the shutdown as a means of pressuring the Legislature to pass a budget. The shutdown began at midnight on July 1, 2006, when Corzine called for an orderly shutdown of non-essential government services, which was followed by a second round of <b>shutdowns</b> three days later on July 4.|$|E
5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} {{more for the}} shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more responsible, and 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government <b>shutdowns</b> {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the locks and navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical <b>shutdowns</b> of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, many users require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.|$|E

5|$|The AESC {{continued}} to snub the government. Playford advocated {{the use of}} brown coal from the South Australian Leigh Creek mine to avoid supply complications, and even made into law a bill encouraging its use. He also championed {{the development of the}} town and the expansion of the mine, which had been dormant for several decades, to ease the state's dependency on imported coal. Much state and federal government money was invested in the scheme, the town infrastructure was built, and the production started in February 1944. Shortly afterwards, the AESC responded by buying new boilers which would only be able to the more productive black coal. With more conflicts ensuing, and even with the company slowly relenting, Playford did not stop his struggle. A Royal Commission in March 1945 was appointed to ascertain a solution between the two parties, and presented its report in August with a recommendation that the AESC be nationalised. A few months later, Playford's stance received a boost when heavy strikes in New South Wales forced <b>shutdowns</b> in South Australia that saw thousands of labourers out of work. By then {{at the head of the}} only conservative government in the nation, when Playford requested commonwealth funds to assist in the nationalisation of the AESC Prime Minister Chifley responded with glee and enthusiasm. On 11 October, he presented a bill to Parliament to nationalise the AESC and create the Electricity Trust of South Australia.|$|E

40|$|The areas {{reviewed}} {{in this section}} of the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR) include those instrumentation and control systems-associated with systems used to achieve and maintain a safe <b>shutdown</b> condition of the plant. To the extent that the engineered safety feature (ESF) systems are used to achieve and maintain safe <b>shutdown,</b> the review of these systems in this section is limited to those features which are unique to safe <b>shutdown</b> and not directly related to accident mitigation. Such features may involve individual component control for safe <b>shutdown</b> versus sytem level actuation for accident mitigation or system operating modes which involve considerations which differ for safe <b>shutdown</b> and accident mitigation. This SRP section also addresses the review of those systems required for safe <b>shutdown</b> which are not classified as ESF systems. The specific arrangement of these systems depends on the type of plant (pressurized water reactor, PWR; boiling water reactor, BWR; etc.) as well as on individual plant design features, and the conditions under. which the safe <b>shutdown</b> has to be achieved and maintained. The functional performance requirements of safe shut-down systems and essential auxiliary supporting systems are reviewed by other branches in accordance with the SRP sections which address these systems. There are two kinds of <b>shutdown</b> conditions: hot <b>shutdown</b> and cold <b>shutdown.</b> In either case, it is necessary that reactivity control systems maintain a sub-critical condition of the core and that residual heat removal systems operate to maintain adequate cooling of the core. For a precise definition of both <b>shutdown</b> conditions for a specific plant, see Chapter 16, "Technical Specifications, " in the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR). Section 7. 5 includes the information systems important to safety that provide information which is used for the manual control of systems required for safe <b>shutdown...</b>|$|R
