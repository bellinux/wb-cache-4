40|$|The {{statistics}} of clear-sky index {{can be used}} to determine solar irradiance when the theoretical clear sky irradiance and the cloud cover are known. In this paper, observations of hourly clear-sky index for the years of 2010 [...] 2013 at 63 locations in the UK are analysed for over 1 million data hours. The aggregated distribution of clear-sky index is bimodal, with strong contributions from mostly-cloudy and mostly-clear hours, as well as a lower number of intermediate hours. The clear-sky index exhibits a distribution of values for each cloud cover bin, measured in eighths of the sky covered (oktas), and also depends on <b>solar</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>angle.</b> Cloud cover is measured either by a human observer or automatically with a cloud ceilometer. Irradiation (time-integrated irradiance) values corresponding to human observations of "cloudless" skies (0 oktas) tend to agree better with theoretical clear-sky values, which are calculated with a radiative transfer model, than irradiation values corresponding to automated observations of 0 oktas. It is apparent that the cloud ceilometers incorrectly categorise more non-cloudless hours as cloudless than human observers do. This leads to notable differences in the distributions of clear-sky index for each okta class, and between human and automated observations. Two probability density functions [...] -the Burr (type III) for mostly-clear situations, and generalised gamma for mostly-cloudy situations [...] -are suggested as analytical fits for each cloud coverage, observation type, and <b>solar</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> bin.

40|$|The {{present study}} is aimed at {{investigating}} the radiation budget in different snow-ice media (shelf ice, continental ice and natural snow) at three different elevated sites in the general area of Prince Astrid Coast of East Antarctica. Measurements of the dependence of albedo in different snow and ice media on <b>solar</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>angle,</b> cloud cover, liquid water content, grain size, etc. can be interpreted in terms of single and multiple scattering radiative transfer theory. Detailed albedo measurements were carried out during summer and winter in different snow and ice media in 1997 - 98 at different selected sites at Antarctica. The average albedo values {{were found to be}} high (90 per cent) in snow medium, moderate (83 per cent) in shelf ice and very low (50 per cent) in continental ice medium. The albedo was found to be a function of cloud amount, increasing with the amount and thickness. In white-out condition during blizzards, high albedo (average 83 per cent) was found as compared to clear sky day (76 per cent) and after blizzard (average 78 per cent). It showed dependence on the type and age of snow also. New snowfall over old snow displayed higher values (90 per cent) than older snow (70 per cent) and decreased with the ageof snow from 13 - 16 per cent. Naturalmelt-water in snowpack increases from 1 - 10 per cent, resulting in albedo decay from 7 - 10 per cent.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{to extract the}} topography modulation component from digital data is described. The enhancement process {{is based on the}} fact that the pixel contains two types of information: (1) reflectance variation due to the target; (2) reflectance variation due to the topography. In order to enhance the signal variation due to topography, the technique recommends the extraction from original LANDSAT data of the component resulting from target reflectance. Considering that the role of topographic modulation over the pixel information will vary with solar incidence angle, the results of this technique of digital processing will differ from one season to another, mainly in highly dissected topography. In this context, the effects of solar incidence angle over the topographic modulation technique were evaluated. Two sets of MSS/LANDSAT data, with <b>solar</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> varying from 22 to 41 deg were selected to implement the digital processing at the Image- 100 System.

Particularly emphasized are closure experiments, which test {{the degree of}} agreement among different measurements and calculations of aerosol properties and radiative effects. By combining results from previous measurements of large-scale smokes, volcanic aerosols, and anthropogenic aerosols with models of aerosol evolution, we estimate the spatial and temporal variability in optical depth spectra to be expected in the Tropospheric Aerosol Radiative Forcing Observational Experiment (TARFOX, planned for summer 1996 off the Eastern U. S. seaboard). In particular, we examine the expected changes in the wavelength dependence of optical depth as particles evolve through nucleation, growth by condensation and coagulation, and removal via sedimentation. We then calculate the expected radiative climate forcing (i. e. change in net radiative flux) for typical expected aerosols and measurement conditions (e. g. <b>solar</b> <b>elevations,</b> surface albedos, radiometer altitudes). These calculations use new expressions for flux and albedo changes, which account not only for aerosol absorption, but also for instantaneous <b>solar</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> and the dependence of surface albedo on <b>solar</b> <b>elevation.</b> These factors, which are usually ignored or averaged in calculations of global aerosol effects, can have a strong influence on fluxes measured in closure experiments, and hence must be accounted for in calculations if closure is to be convincingly tested.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the potential risk of epileptic seizures from wind turbine shadow flicker under various meteorologic conditions. Methods: We extend a previous model to include attenuation of sunlight by the atmosphere using the libradtran radiative transfer code. Results: Under {{conditions in which}} observers look toward the horizon with their eyes open we find that there is risk when the observer is closer than 1. 2 times the total turbine height when on land, and 2. 8 times the total turbine height in marine environments, the risk limited {{by the size of}} the image of the sun's disc on the retina. When looking at the ground, where the shadow of the blade is cast, observers are at risk only when at a distance < 36 times the blade width, the risk limited by image contrast. If the observer views the horizon and closes their eyes, however, the stimulus size and contrast ratio are epileptogenic for <b>solar</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> down to approximately 5 °. Discussion: Large turbines rotate at a rate below that at which the flicker is likely to present a risk, although there is a risk from smaller turbines that interrupt sunlight more than three times per second. For the scenarios considered, we find the risk is negligible at a distance more than about nine times the maximum height reached by the turbine blade, a distance similar to that in guidance from the United Kingdom planning authorities. © 2009 International League Against Epilepsy...|$|R
