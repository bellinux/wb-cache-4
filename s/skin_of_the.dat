5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in {{blood vessels in the}} <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.|$|E

5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur on the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth {{then make a}} 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
5|$|At {{its peak}} of popularity, the Large Black was used mainly for meat production, {{especially}} bacon. The {{meat from the}} Large Black {{is known for its}} lean quality and flavour without an excess of back fat, but for commercial production it was often crossed with the Yorkshire and Middle White pigs, producing a vigorous hybrid that was well regarded by farmers. However, today commercial processors do not favour the black <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purebred Large Black.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a {{new species}} of chewing louse, Psittacobrosus bechsteini, was {{described}} based on a dead specimen discovered on a museum <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cuban macaw. It {{is thought to have}} been unique to this species, and is therefore an example of coextinction. The feather mite species Genoprotolichus eurycnemis and Distigmesikya extincta have also been reported from Cuban macaw skins, the latter new to science.|$|E

5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as {{it does not have}} a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 2015, Lapierre {{was traded}} from the Blues to the Pittsburgh Penguins in {{exchange}} for Marcel Goc. Lapierre {{played a key role}} during the 2015 playoffs, getting under the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York Rangers by drawing penalties, instigating fights, taunting and most notably doing play-by-play towards the Rangers' bench. He played an important role on the face-off dot and on the penalty kill, frustrating the New York Rangers and his former head coach in Vancouver, Alain Vigneault.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous <b>skin)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the cheek, and nipples. Some sebaceous glands have unique names. Sebaceous glands on the lip and mucosa of the cheek, and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian glands. Sebaceous glands of the breast are also known as Montgomery's glands.|$|E

5|$|The condor's {{head and}} neck have few feathers, and the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{head and neck}} is capable of {{flushing}} noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals. The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange. The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few hissing or grunting sounds only heard when very close.|$|E
5|$|The <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adult {{cane toad}} is toxic, {{as well as}} the {{enlarged}} parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across their backs. When the toads are threatened, their glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as bufotoxin. Components of bufotoxin are toxic to many animals; even human deaths have been recorded due to the consumption of cane toads.|$|E
5|$|The <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{cane toad}} is dry and warty. It has {{distinct}} ridges above the eyes, which {{run down the}} snout. Individual cane toads can be grey, yellowish, red-brown, or olive-brown, with varying patterns. A large parotoid gland lies behind each eye. The ventral surface is cream-coloured and may have blotches in shades of black or brown. The pupils are horizontal and the irises golden. The toes have a fleshy webbing at their base, and the fingers are free of webbing.|$|E
50|$|Ceruletide was {{discovered}} and its structure elucidated in 1967 by Australian and Italian scientists from dried <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian {{green tree frog}} (Litoria caerulea, formerly Hyla caerulea). Its amino acid sequence is Pglu-Gln-Asp-TyrSO3H-Thr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2.|$|R
50|$|There are two <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bird in existence, one in <b>the</b> {{collection}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Museum in Liverpool and {{the other}} in the Naturhistorisches Museum Wien in Vienna. There are also several paintings, and some subfossil bones.|$|R
50|$|Van Hulsdonck was {{particularly}} skilled in rendering the softness and delicacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fruit.

5|$|The thin <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> octopus absorbs {{additional}} oxygen. When resting, around 41% of an octopus's oxygen absorption {{is through}} the skin. This decreases to 33% when it swims, as more water flows over the gills; skin oxygen uptake also increases. When it is resting after a meal, absorption through the skin can drop to 3% of its total oxygen uptake.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{reported}} {{that as the}} plane approached Detroit, Abdulmutallab went into the plane's lavatory for about 20 minutes. After returning to his seat at 19A (near the fuel tanks and wing, and against the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane), he complained {{that he had an}} upset stomach. He was seen pulling a blanket over himself.|$|E
5|$|A hamster {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E
