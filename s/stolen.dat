5|$|Several VCs {{have been}} <b>stolen</b> and, being valuable, {{have been placed}} on the Interpol watch-list for <b>stolen</b> items. The VC awarded to Milton Gregg, which was donated to the Royal Canadian Regiment Museum in London, Ontario Canada in 1979, was <b>stolen</b> on Canada Day (1 July 1980), when the museum was overcrowded and has been missing since.

5|$|The act was {{originally}} intended to discourage the handling of <b>stolen</b> property but several courts have judged that the National <b>Stolen</b> Property Act is sufficiently broad in scope to apply to goods crossing into the United States from a foreign nation, and is therefore applicable {{in the case of}} <b>stolen</b> cultural property.|$|E
5|$|Although sign theft {{has always}} been a problem along this highway, thefts reached {{epidemic}} proportions when the pending number change was announced. Within days of the announcement, virtually every US666 sign had been <b>stolen,</b> some for sale on eBay. Officials in Utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and <b>stolen,</b> while New Mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts, as a theft deterrent, had been <b>stolen.</b> Officials speculated from one scene that someone had intentionally crashed a car into the sign post to break the welds.|$|E

The fledgling infiltrates the Giovanni mansion and finds the sarcophagus guarded by the Kuei-Jin, who claim their leader, Ming-Xiao, has formed an alliance with LaCroix. The locked sarcophagus is returned to LaCroix's tower and Beckett, a vampire historian, tells the fledgling that {{the only person who}} can open it has been abducted by Grunfeld to lure LaCroix. The fledgling kills Grunfeld and learns that the sarcophagus' key has been <b>stolen.</b>|$|E

He was also 2nd with in on base % (.414), tied for 9th in triples (7) and 5th in times on base, reaching 257 times.

After the season, he {{was traded to the}} New York Yankees.|$|E
5|$|If {{a runner}} {{advances}} because the defense {{does nothing to}} try to stop the advance, the scorer may rule that the advance was due to defensive indifference and no <b>stolen</b> base is credited. However, a throw is not required for a <b>stolen</b> base. If a fielder begins to visibly make an attempt to prevent an advance but then elects not to throw, the advance is not due to defensive indifference.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Kinsler hit 20 {{home runs}} (leading all AL second basemen) and was 23-for-25 in <b>stolen</b> base {{attempts}} (a 92% success rate).

He also became the sixth player in franchise history to reach the 20–20 plateau, joining Alfonso Soriano (2005), Iván Rodríguez (1999), Rafael Palmeiro (1993), Bobby Bonds (1978), and Toby Harrah (1975 and 1977). He did it despite his stress fracture, which kept him under 500 at bats. His 23 <b>stolen</b> bases and 96 runs led the Rangers.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{an effort}} was {{initiated}} {{to revise the}} <b>Stolen</b> Valor Act {{to comply with the}} Supreme Court's decision.

In addition to a wrongful claim of receiving one of the listed military awards, intent to gain some benefit or something of value by fraud was required.|$|E
5|$|In February 1857 the Chelmsford Chronicle {{reported}} that £10 in silver had been <b>stolen</b> from Golding Spearman, {{keeper of the}} Tilbury Fort canteen. When the police were unable to identify the culprit, Spearman turned to Murrell, who asserted that he would place a spell on the thief which {{would result in the}} return of the money.

5|$|In {{the week}} before the Final, a block of 1,600 tickets in the Liverpool supporters' seating area was <b>stolen</b> in the postal system. The stadium {{authorities}} refused to reissue the tickets on crowd safety grounds, and threatened to eject anyone found sitting in the block from the stadium and possibly prosecute them for receiving <b>stolen</b> goods. Liverpool F.C. arranged for most of the affected fans to receive tickets from an allocation that had been held back for a lottery among their supporters. The day after the final, South Wales Police seized 100 <b>stolen</b> tickets. Three people were arrested after 15 forged tickets were found ahead of the match.|$|E

5|$|The <b>stolen</b> {{works were}} {{originally}} purchased by art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840–1924) and {{intended to be}} left on permanent display at the museum {{with the rest of}} her collection. Since the collection and its layout are permanent, empty frames remain hanging both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. Experts are puzzled by the choice of paintings that were <b>stolen,</b> especially since more valuable artwork was untouched. Among the <b>stolen</b> works was The Concert, one of only 34 known works by Vermeer and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting at over $200 million. Also missing is The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, Rembrandt's only known seascape. Other works by Rembrandt, Degas, Manet, and Flinck were also <b>stolen.</b>|$|E
