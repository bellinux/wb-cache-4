5|$|During the {{training}} expedition, Shaw's group came to Walla Brook at a crossing near Watern Tor in the north-east of Dartmoor.

25|$|Digital reconstructions of Ida's teeth {{reveal that}} she has unerupted molars in her jaw, {{indicating}} by comparison with modern squirrel monkeys that she was 9–10 months old and would have reached adulthood at 36 months. The shape of Ida's teeth provides clues as to her diet; jagged molars would have allowed her to slice food, suggesting {{that she was a}} leaf and seed eater. This is confirmed by the remarkable preservation of her gut content. Furthermore, the lack of a baculum (penis bone) found in all lower primates means that the fossil was from a female. X-rays performed on Ida revealed that her right wrist was healing from a fracture which may have contributed to her death. The scientists speculate whether she was overcome by carbon dioxide fumes while drinking from the Messel lake. Hampered by her broken wrist, <b>she</b> <b>slipped</b> into unconsciousness, was washed into the lake and sank to the bottom, where unique fossilisation conditions preserved her for 47 million years.|$|E
