A minority argues that capital mobility and outsourcing indicate a larger effect. This paper first surveys these views, and then argues that how we understand the policy consequences of trade liberalization helps determine the character of our analysis of the issue itself. Thus, a shift in policy perspective, to consider the "equity costs" of trade liberalization in terms of eroded U. S. labor market institutions, produces a larger framework for analyzing the consequences of globalization and trade liberalization than is available in traditional comparative advantage efficiency reasoning. From this wider perspective, trade liberalization has likely had {{a greater impact on}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> inequality than even the minority mainstream position allows. globalization, trade liberalization, wage inequality, outsourcing, equity costs, institutions, comparative advantage,...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} {{study of the}} impact on U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> structure of domestic technology, foreign technology, and import penetration. A model is presented which combines factor proportions theory with a version of growth theory. The model, which assumes two levels of skill, suggests that domestic technology raises both wages, while foreign technology, on a simple interpretation, lowers both. Trade at a constant technology, as usual, lowers the wage of that class of labor used intensively by the affected industry, and raises the other wage. The findings support the predictions of the model for domestic technology. On the other hand, they suggest that technological change, and perhaps other factors, have obscured the role of factor proportions in the data. Indeed, foreign technology and trade {{have the same effect}} on wages at different skill levels, not the opposite effects suggested by factor proportions. Finally, a simple diffusion story, in which foreign technology lowers all U. <b>S.</b> <b>wages,</b> is also rejected. Instead, uniformly higher U. <b>S.</b> <b>wages,</b> not lower, appear {{to be associated with the}} technology and trade of the oldest trading partners of the U. S., the economies of the West. Not so for Asia, especially the smaller countries which have recently accelerated their trade with the U. S.

40|$|The rise in U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> {{inequality}} {{over the}} past two decades is commonly associated with an increase in the use of "skill-biased" technologies (e. g., computer equipment) in the workplace, yet relatively few studies have attempted to measure the direct link between the two. This paper explores the relationship among inequality, worker education levels, and workplace computer usage using a sample of 230 U. S. industries between 1983 and 2002. The results generate two primary conclusions: First, this rising inequality in the United States has been caused predominantly by increasing wage dispersion within industries rather than between industries. Second, within-industry inequality is strongly tied to both the frequency of computer usage among workers and the fraction of total employment with a college degree. Both results lend support to the idea that skill-biased technological change has been an important element in the rise of U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> inequality.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the application of multivariate nonparametric models known as regression trees to the analysis of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> structure. In Chapter 1, I first review regression trees and other available multivariate nonparametric techniques, highlighting their differences and common features. In the second part of Chapter 1, I look at the literature on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> structure in connection with the issue of functional specification and argue that regression trees is particularly well suited for analyzing wage structures. In Chapter 2, I implement regression trees on U. <b>S.</b> <b>wages</b> for white male workers to estimate experience-wage profiles and unveil local sudden breaks in the profiles {{at the end of the}} working life. For 1980, these breaks account for about 50 % of the negative average differential between the last two experience groups. This effect decreases continuously until 1995. In Chapter 3 I propose a simple extension of the Oaxaca-type average wage gap decompositions between any two groups of workers. This procedure can be carried out without any compromise in the interpretation using a nonparametric wage structure. I then study wage gap decompositions for Mexican workers in the U. S. labor market. Finally, in Chapter 4 I apply regression trees to study both the relative growth performance of workers' real wages and the sources of wage dispersion and its evolution in the U. S. from 1980 onwards. On trends, the technique uncovers a linear structure for the growth experience of white workers with less than forty years of experience.

40|$|In the 1970 s, the {{relative}} earnings advantage of highly educated workers, par-ticularly recent or young university graduates, deteriorated in the United States {{and most other}} OECD nations (Freeman 1981).

40|$|Much of the U. S. labor {{economics}} literature {{asserts that}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> income inequality {{increased in the}} last half of the 20 th century. These papers point to two trends: 1) the increasing dispersion in U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> incomes, and 2) the rapid growth in the relative frequency of large wage incomes of fixed size in constant dollar terms. A subset of the labor economics literature interprets these trends as a hollowing out of the wage income distribution. A hollowing out would yield fewer middling wage incomes. Since nonmetro wage incomes have, historically, been smaller than metro wage incomes, a hollowing out might disproportionately displace nonmetro wage incomes into the left mode of the hollowed out distribution, that of small wage incomes. However, there was no hollowing out of the nonmetro wage income distribution between 1961 and 2003. While trends # 1 and # 2 exist in U. <b>S.</b> nonmetro <b>wage</b> income data, they are aspects of the stretching of the distribution of nonmetro wage incomes to the right over larger wage incomes as all its percentiles increased between 1961 and 2003. This stretching means that all nonmetro wage income percentiles increase simultaneously with greater proportional growth in the smaller percentiles. The literature focused on the greater absolute gains of the larger percentiles and took them as evidence of growing inequality. This paper shows for nonmetro wage incomes in the U. S. that those gains are but one aspect of the stretching of the distribution and that other aspects of this transformation might as easily be taken as evidence of growing equality. ...|$|R

We document the spectacular rise of U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> inequality after 1980 and place recent changes into a century-long historical perspective to understand the sources of change. The majority {{of the increase in}} wage inequality since 1980 can be accounted for by rising educational wage differentials, just as a substantial part of the decrease in wage inequality in the earlier era can be accounted for by decreasing educational wage differentials. Although skill-biased technological change has generated rapid growth in the relative demand for more-educated workers for at least the past century, increases in the supply of skills, from rising educational attainment of the U.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} rigid wages cannot provide the {{underpinnings}} of a universally valid {{theory of the}} business cycle, simply because wages are not universally rigid. Several different statistical techniques suggest that wage rates in the U. K. and Japan are between three and 15 times more flexible than in the U. S. during the postwar period. Corresponding to greater flexibility in wages, these two countries also exhibit more stable employment behavior over the business cycle. In historical data covering the period between the late-nineteenth-century and 1940, U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> behavior appears {{to be much more}} similar to that in Britain and Japan. The contrast between the prewar data and the postwar data, where the U.

A theoretical section attempts to distill from recent literature those features of labor market institutions that are regarded as optimal by economic theory. Japanese institutions exhibit more similarity to this theoretical paradigm than those in the U. S. or U. K. Economic theory predicts that long-duration contracts, like those in the postwar U. S., are more likely to emerge when the perceived cost of renegotiation is high, but we must appeal to history and cultural differences to explain why conflict avoidance plays a more prominent {{role in the development of}} Japanese labor market institutions than in the American case. In this comparison Britain is the odd-man-out, with well-publicized industrial strife, together with short contract durations.
