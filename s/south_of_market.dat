5|$|The South Tower was {{completed}} in September 2008, with all residential floors ready for residents. As of, April 2009, 70% of the South Tower's 376 luxury units and 14 townhouses had been sold. Because of the occupancy rate and low profits so far, the developers had initially refused to pay $5.4 million in development fees that would be spent on rent subsidies, job training programs and community development in the <b>South</b> <b>of</b> <b>Market</b> area. However, the developers finally agreed to pay the city.|$|E
5|$|With condo prices {{set from}} US$500,000 to US$2,000,000, many critics {{have noted that}} the One Rincon Hill complex is too {{expensive}} for most San Franciscans. With the total initial development cost of US$290 million, the average development cost per unit with 709 units total is approximately US$409,000. However, the developer Urban West Associates has contributed a total of US$38.5 million to funds like the <b>South</b> <b>of</b> <b>Market</b> Community Stabilization Fund {{in order to address}} this concern.|$|E

The freeway that goes from US 101 to the Bay Bridge that is signed as I-80 but not officially I-80 is called the San Francisco Skyway.|$|E

5|$|Route 6 was redefined in 1929 to use {{none of the}} old road east of Paterson (it had {{formerly}} {{been planned}} to use Market Street west of roughly where Route 17 now crosses it), and Route 5 was cut back to run only east from Ridgefield. The portion of pre-1927 Route 10 that was bypassed by Route 6 was designated Route 10N, but was eventually removed from the state highway system. In addition, Route 6 was redefined to bypass Paterson to the south. The new route would enter Paterson just <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>Market</b> Street, but then turn south and southwest before heading back west to rejoin the old route at {{the east end of}} the Little Falls bypass at the Union Boulevard crossing. The old road along Union Boulevard towards Paterson was assigned Route S6, as a spur of Route 6. Route S6 became Route 62 in the 1953 renumbering, and has since been truncated to a short piece between US 46 and I-80 in Totowa.|$|E
5|$|Richard's reign {{began in}} 1483. At {{the request of}} his brother Edward IV, Richard was acting as Lord Protector for his son Edward V. Richard had Parliament declare Edward V illegitimate and ineligible for the throne, and took it for himself. Richard lost {{popularity}} when {{the boy and his}} younger brother disappeared after he incarcerated them in the Tower of London, and his support was further eroded by the popular belief that he was implicated in the death of his wife. Across the English Channel in Brittany, Henry Tudor, a descendant of the greatly diminished House of Lancaster, seized on Richard's difficulties so that he could challenge his claim to the throne. Henry's first attempt to invade England was frustrated by a storm in 1483, but on his second attempt he arrived unopposed on 7 August 1485 on the southwest coast of Wales. Marching inland, Henry gathered support as he made for London. Richard mustered his troops and intercepted Henry's army <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>Market</b> Bosworth in Leicestershire. Thomas, Lord Stanley, and Sir William Stanley brought a force to the battlefield, but held back while they decided which side it would be more advantageous to support.|$|E

The quake severely damaged many of the city's freeways including the Embarcadero Freeway and the Central Freeway. Mayor Agnos made the controversial decision to tear down the Embarcadero Freeway, opening the waterfront but eventually shifting Chinatown voters away from him and costing him re-election in 1991.

By 1994 between 300,000 and 400,000 people attended the event. Controlling excesses became too difficult. Violence escalated, claimed by Dahn Van Laarz (Sister Dana van Iquity) {{to be the result of}} inebriated gawkers motivated by homophobia. When the police confiscated an AK-47 from a reveler trying to gain access to Castro Street, and they reported that 50 to 60 people had been arrested, the Sisters decided to move the celebration and Halloween in the Castro ended. The next year, the Sisters hosted a costume-mandatory dance named HallowQueen in a <b>South</b> <b>of</b> <b>Market</b> gay nightclub, which raised over $6,000 for charity.|$|E
500|$|These limits, {{combined}} with the early 1990s recession, led to a significant slowdown of skyscraper construction during the late 1980s and 1990s. [...] To guide new development, the city passed several neighborhood plans, such as the Rincon Hill Plan in 2005 and Transit Center District Plan in 2012, which allow taller skyscrapers in certain specific locations in the <b>South</b> <b>of</b> <b>Market</b> area. [...] Since the early 2000s, {{the city has been}} undergoing another building boom, with numerous buildings over 400feet (122m) proposed, approved, or under construction; some, such as the two-towered One Rincon Hill, have been completed. Several taller buildings are under construction in connection with the new Transbay Transit Center, including Salesforce Tower, which broke ground in 2013 and topped-out at [...] in April 2017.

500|$|This {{surge of}} {{construction}} was dubbed [...] "Manhattanization" [...] by opponents {{and led to}} local legislation that set some of the strictest building height limits and regulations in the country. [...] In 1985, San Francisco adopted the Downtown Plan, which slowed development in the Financial District north of Market Street and directed it to the area <b>South</b> <b>of</b> <b>Market</b> around the Transbay Terminal. Over 250 historic buildings were protected from development and developers were required to set aside open space for new projects. To prevent excessive growth and smooth the boom-and-bust building cycle, the Plan included an annual limit of [...] for new office development, although it grandfathered millions of square feet of proposals already in the development pipeline. [...] In response, voters approved Proposition M in November 1986 that reduced the annual limit to [...] until the grandfathered square footage was accounted for, which occurred in 1999.|$|E

2500|$|During 1874, when Josephine was 13, {{production}} {{of gold and}} silver from the Comstock Lode had fed a feverish stock market, leading to {{a great deal of}} speculation.
