2500|$|According to American intelligence, by late 1941 the German Wehrmacht and its <b>supporting</b> <b>industry</b> {{was already}} {{stretched}} thin {{and suggested that}} certain targets would be particularly sensitive to attack. As a result, oil and petroleum and synthetic rubber {{were added to the}} American [...] "Air War Plan 42". These targets became the focus of the American effort due to the mistaken belief that the Wehrmacht military forces of Nazi Germany were mostly motorised. In actuality German infantry divisions were heavily dependent on horses In 1942 and 1943, U-Boat bases were added due to the growing threat in the Battle of the Atlantic at that time. But the largest difference in American and British was the emphasis the Americans placed on destroying the Luftwaffe. In the British view, this would be achieved by paralysing the German economy.|$|E

Yamawaki was formerly Director of the Resources Mobilisation Bureau; his appointment in 1942 was interpreted by the Allies {{as part of a}} drive to establish Borneo as a significant location for storage of supplies and development of <b>supporting</b> <b>industry.</b> Law enforcement in Borneo fell to the notorious Kenpeitai, where they were directly responsible to the Military Commander and the Japanese War Ministry. They had virtually unlimited power, and frequently used torture and brutality as their normal mode of operation. The Kenpeitai headquarters were in a two-storey bungalow in Java Street (Jalan Jawa) of Kuching. From April 1944, it was replaced in a new location at the Sports Club Building in Api. Japanese Justice became synonymous with punishment out of all proportion to the offence, where they revived the pre-war civil court system from November 1942, with local magistrates applying the Sarawak Penal Code. With the Allied advance in the Pacific, the Japanese realised that Borneo was likely to be retaken. The Borneo Defence Army was strengthened with additional units and renamed as 37th Army. Command passed to Lieutenant General Masao Baba from 26 December 1944 until 11 September 1945, when the official Japanese surrender was signed on board the [...]|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s, Vietnam’s {{government}} {{concentrated on the}} promotion of <b>supporting</b> <b>industries</b> which {{can be seen as}} a “key” solution to sustaining economic growth, thereby improving the national welfare. However, Vietnam’s <b>supporting</b> <b>industries</b> still exhibit lower development and competitive weakness. The main reason for this condition is due to a lack of capital, technological innovation, and necessary management skills for development. Therefore, attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) for developing <b>supporting</b> <b>industries</b> offers the best strategy to realize this solution. However, attracting FDI to develop <b>supporting</b> <b>industries</b> represents a weakness which lies in both the quantity (total capital and projects) and quality of investment. So which factors are effective to attract FDI for developing <b>supporting</b> <b>industries</b> in Vietnam? This investigation establishes an analytical hierarchy framework available to the Vietnamese government and to policymakers in order to evaluate the influence of criteria needed to attract FDI for developing <b>supporting</b> <b>industries</b> based on eight main criteria. They include legal and institutional criteria, the market size of <b>supporting</b> <b>industries,</b> human resources, infrastructure facilities, technological development and innovation, domestic supply capacity, international cooperation and competition, and other criteria. This paper uses fuzzy preference relations (FPR) to evaluate the influence of criteria necessary to attract FDI for developing <b>supporting</b> <b>industries,</b> and these analytical results demonstrate that legal and institutional criteria, domestic supply capacity, human resources, technology development and innovation are all major considerations for attracting FDI...|$|R
