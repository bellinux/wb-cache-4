500|$|By 1978, {{when the}} New York City Subway {{was at its}} lowest point in its existence, State Comptroller Arthur Levitt stated {{that there were no}} plans to finish the line. During the 1980s, plans for the Second Avenue line stagnated. Construction on the 63rd Street Lines continued; the IND portion of the line opened in 1989 and {{extended}} to 21st Street–Queensbridge in Long Island City, Queens, but it did not include a connection to the Second Avenue line. Of this failure to complete construction, Gene Russianoff, an advocate for subway riders since 1981, stated: [...] "It's the most famous thing that's never been built in New York City, <b>so</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> skeptical and rightly so. It's much-promised and never delivered." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the 1975–1976 fiscal crisis, {{combined}} with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs, led to the MTA and the city having no funds to complete the Second Avenue Line. Construction of the subway was halted on September 29, 1975, with only three sections of tunnel having been completed, excluding the Chrystie Street Connection and the connection to the BMT 63rd Street Line.

2500|$|Dutch manners {{are open}} and direct with a no-nonsense attitude; informality {{combined}} with adherence to basic behaviour. According to a humorous source on Dutch culture, [...] "Their directness gives many {{the impression that they}} are rude and crude — attributes they prefer to call 'openness.'" [...] A well known more serious source on Dutch etiquette is [...] "Dealing with the Dutch" [...] from Jacob Vossestein: [...] "Dutch egalitarianism is the idea that people are equal, especially from a moral point of view, and accordingly, causes the somewhat ambiguous stance the Dutch have towards hierarchy and status." [...] As always, manners differ between groups. Asking about basic rules will not be considered impolite. [...] "What may strike you as being blatantly blunt topics and comments are no more embarrassing or unusual to the Dutch than discussing the weather." [...] That attitude of honesty explains how the Dutch accept each person as he or she is, because it is what the Dutch society asks <b>so</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> gelukkig ("happy").|$|E
2500|$|Vocalist Ronnie Radke {{had been}} hinting on Twitter {{that the group}} {{had been working on}} the band's second album, with tweets such as [...] "You guys don't {{understand}} how many light years my next album is from the last one". He and bandmate Ron Ficarro tweeted pictures of them in the studio with Ryan Ogren working on some new music. Ronnie had said {{a little bit about the}} new album to Marshal Music News. He said that, [...] "The last record was so vengeful and bitter and spiteful - <b>so</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> wondering what I'm gonna sing about next. And I'm just not quite ready to let people know. I'm sorry. When people hear the new stuff though I promise you they will lose their mind. It's light years ahead of my last album. We're demoing new songs right now, as we speak, and I'm telling you, people are seriously gonna lose their mind." [...] During the band's performance at Dirt Fest 2012 in Birch Run Michigan, Radke announced to the crowd that it would be the group's last show before returning to the studio for the band's second album. Ronnie also said in an interview that the band would be in the studio late 2012 with demos already and hoping for an early 2013 release. In issue number 1442 of Kerrang! Magazine, Ronnie Radke announced in an interview that [...] "The record's finished! That's what we did after the Warped Tour. We just didn't tell anybody!"
