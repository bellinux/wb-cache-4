5|$|Jovanovski {{is known}} as a two-way defenceman. Able to {{contribute}} offensively, he is an adept puck-carrier and joins plays deep in the opposing team's zone. He plays defence physically, bodychecking opponents primarily with his <b>shoulder.</b> <b>In</b> both aspects of his game, he is considered to play {{with a high level of}} risk, taking the chance of being out of position in favour of a good scoring chance or a hit.|$|E
5|$|References since antiquity {{are fairly}} rare. At the {{beginning}} of the 17th century, French sculptor Barthélemy Prieur cast a bronze statue Orion et Cédalion, some time between 1600 and 1611. This featured Orion with Cedalion on his <b>shoulder,</b> <b>in</b> a depiction of the ancient legend of Orion recovering his sight; the sculpture is now displayed at the Louvre.|$|E

5|$|Strasburg {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list with an inflamed right <b>shoulder</b> <b>in</b> July 2010. He returned to action on August 10, but in his third game back, on August 21, he was removed with an apparent injury. On August 27, the Nationals announced that Strasburg had a torn ulnar collateral ligament, requiring Tommy John surgery, and about 12 to 18 months of rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|After basic training, Carlos was {{relocated}} to San Diego, and {{assigned to a}} destroyer in the Pacific Fleet – the USS Cape Cod (AD-43). He won the California state (amateur) Middleweight Boxing Championship in 1983. He had set a goal {{to qualify for the}} Junior Olympics in boxing, but he injured his <b>shoulder</b> <b>in</b> training, and was then deployed to the Middle East subsequent to the U.S. Embassy bombing in Beirut on April 18, 1983. His ship was in the Strait of Hormuz when the US Marine barracks (along with the French paratrooper barracks) in Beirut were bombed on October 24, 1983. By 1984, the Cape Cod was rotated out of the Persian Gulf. Ashenoff returned to San Diego, and received an honorable discharge.|$|E
5|$|Born in Beaufort, North Carolina, Taylor {{attended}} East Carteret High School, {{where his}} pitching ability {{caused him to}} be chosen by the New York Yankees with the first overall selection in the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft. After two full seasons in the minor leagues, he injured his <b>shoulder</b> <b>in</b> a fight, and was ineffective after returning to baseball. He retired in 2000, having never played a game above Class AA. Taylor was the second of two players to be picked first overall in the MLB draft to never reach the major leagues, the other one being Steve Chilcott.|$|E
40|$|Occult {{instability}} {{is recognized}} as {{a major cause of}} <b>shoulder</b> dysfunction <b>in</b> throwing athletes. Few studies have characterized the findings of occult instability in nonthrowers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine <b>shoulder</b> instability <b>in</b> a group of weight lifters. The symptoms, physical findings, and results of treatment for 23 <b>shoulders</b> <b>in</b> 20 athletes are presented. All ath-letes presented with a complaint of progressive inability to perform exercises with the upper extremity in the abducted, externally rotated position (the "at-risk " po-sition) because of pain.

5|$|Considered the fourth-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} by Baseball America {{heading into the}} 1995 season, the Yankees projected Jeter as their starting shortstop. He suffered mild inflammation in his right <b>shoulder</b> <b>in</b> the Arizona Fall League after {{the conclusion of the}} 1994 regular season. As a precaution, the Yankees signed Tony Fernández to a two-year contract. With Fernández the starting shortstop, the Yankees assigned Jeter to Class AAA. During the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, offered Jeter the opportunity to work out for the MLB team with replacement players in spring training before the 1995 season. Jeter denied receiving the offer, and did not cross the picket line.|$|E
5|$|During {{the sixth}} annual WWE Draft on June 23, 2008 on Raw, Kennedy was drafted from Raw {{back to the}} SmackDown brand. On August 4, he dislocated his <b>shoulder</b> <b>in</b> a match against Shelton Benjamin at a house show, sidelining him from active competition. Kennedy made his return to WWE television, in a non-wrestling capacity, on the November 24 episode of Raw, while {{promoting}} his film Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia, and also made an appearance on SmackDown on the November 28 episode.|$|E
5|$|In {{a game in}} Boston in January of the 1952–53 season Kennedy {{suffered}} a separated <b>shoulder</b> <b>in</b> a scuffle with Milt Schmidt of the Bruins and underwent surgery. Originally thought lost for the season, Kennedy trained hard {{and was able to}} return to the Leafs in mid-March. However, Toronto still finished out of a playoff position. Despite missing more than two months of the schedule Kennedy still finished second in points on the team. For his efforts Kennedy received the J. P. Bickell Memorial Trophy which is awarded by the Maple Leaf Gardens board of directors as the player most valuable to the Leafs.|$|E

5|$|Nevin {{suffered}} a dislocated <b>shoulder</b> <b>in</b> spring training in 2003 while making a diving catch. He had {{surgery on his}} left shoulder {{and returned to the}} Padres in June. The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin, and White went on to have an All-Star season in left field. Ryan Klesko filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well at third base, Nevin's favorite position. Nevin offered to be used in a utility role, alternating with White, Klesko, and Burroughs, as well as Xavier Nady in right field. In 2004, Nevin had more than 100 RBI {{for the third time in}} his career, but underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee in July.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 2005, the Pacers {{played at}} The Palace {{for the first}} time since the brawl. The game was delayed 90 minutes after a series of bomb threats were aimed at the Pacers locker room, but the game {{eventually}} started after no explosives were found. Two of the key figures in the original incident missed the game, as Artest was still suspended and O'Neal had an injured <b>shoulder.</b> <b>In</b> the game, the Pacers stopped the Pistons' twelve-game winning streak with a 94–81 win.|$|E
5|$|Strong safety Ray Austin, who {{had been}} named most {{valuable}} player in the Volunteers' loss to Penn State during the 1993 Citrus Bowl, had 50 tackles—second-best among Tennessee defensive backs—two fumble recoveries, a sack, and two tackles for loss despite playing in only six games. The Volunteers' defense also featured a cornerback named Tony Edge, a player from Virginia's Phoebus High School {{who had been}} heavily recruited by both Virginia Tech and Tennessee. Edge suffered a dislocated <b>shoulder</b> <b>in</b> the Volunteers' last regular-season game, but pledged he would play against the Hokies despite doctors' disapproval.|$|E

5|$|The Hokies {{played the}} Orange Bowl without {{starting}} linebacker Lyndell Gibson, who fractured his <b>shoulder</b> <b>in</b> {{the second quarter}} of the ACC Championship Game. Gibson was fourth on the team in tackles with 66. Replacing Gibson was redshirt freshman Tariq Edwards, who played only a few times before the Orange Bowl. The Hokies also returned a player from injury for the Orange Bowl. Linebacker Barquell Rivers, who had been predicted to be Tech's starting middle linebacker, suffered a torn quadriceps tendon in offseason workouts, causing him to miss every game. Heading into the Orange Bowl, coaches were optimistic that he had healed {{enough to be able to}} play.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{returned}} from his injury on February 19, 2012 at Elimination Chamber to show support for John Laurinaitis. Christian returned on the March 16 episode of SmackDown, hosting an episode of the 'Peep Show' and given a spot on Laurinaitis' team in a 12-man tag match at WrestleMania XXVIII. On the March 26 episode of Raw, {{as part of a}} storyline, Christian was injured once again after (kayfabe) re-aggravating his neck and <b>shoulder</b> <b>in</b> a match with CM Punk. This was to write him off at WrestleMania as it was later reported that Christian has not yet been fully medically cleared to compete due to a history of shoulder injuries. Despite the injury, Christian still appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony to induct long-time friend Edge.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{began his}} final tour to England in 1961, and Benaud's regular {{absences}} {{due to a}} shoulder injury allowed him to lead Australia for {{a third of the}} tour matches. This included most of the first month of the tour; Benaud hurt his <b>shoulder</b> <b>in</b> the first match against Worcestershire, and spent most of the next three weeks either not bowling or travelling to London away from his men for specialist treatment. At one stage, Australia were left with only 10 men on the field when Benaud excused himself and his replacement succumbed to illness, requiring an Englishman to stand in. Harvey scored 474 runs at 47.40 in eight matches leading up to the Tests, including centuries against Lancashire and Glamorgan. It seemed that Harvey would captain Australia in a Test {{for the first time with}} Benaud's shoulder still problematic, but the captain declared himself fit. Harvey then made 114 in the drawn First Test at Edgbaston. This helped Australia take a 321-run first innings lead and put them in control of the match, but the hosts batted for the remainder of the match to stave off defeat; Benaud's shoulder prevented him from bowling more than nine overs.|$|E
5|$|He scored {{his first}} goal as a Canuck in the 2009–10 season opener against the Calgary Flames in a 5–3 loss on October 1. On March 9, 2010, Samuelsson scored his first career hat trick in a 6–4 win against the Colorado Avalanche. All three goals were {{scored in the}} second period and {{assisted}} by countryman Henrik Sedin. He later earned NHL First Star of the Week honours on March 15 for notching six goals and four assists in four games. The following day, Samuelsson injured his <b>shoulder</b> <b>in</b> a game against the New York Islanders. He missed eight games, returning in time for the 2010 playoffs. He reached the 30-goal plateau {{for the first time in}} his career and added 23 assists for a career-high 53 points. Then-Head Coach Alain Vigneault played Samuelsson primarily on the second line with Ryan Kesler and Mason Raymond, while he also earned time on the top unit of Henrik and Daniel Sedin.|$|E
