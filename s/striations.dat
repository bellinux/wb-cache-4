5|$|A partial tooth 8cm long {{purchased}} at a fossil trade show, reportedly from the Kem Kem Bed of Morocco and attributed to Spinosaurus maroccanus, showed 1–5mm wide longitudinal <b>striations</b> and micro-structures (irregular ridges) among the <b>striations</b> in a 2010 paper.|$|E
5|$|Among non-primates, the extinct Chriacus {{exhibits}} microscopic groves on its toothcomb, but the Philippine colugo (Cynocephalus volans) does not. The toothcomb of the colugos {{is generally}} considered {{to function as a}} toothcomb, but {{due to the lack of}} <b>striations</b> on the teeth and no documented observations of toothcomb use during oral grooming, its use seems to be limited to food procurement.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} revealed fine grooves or <b>striations</b> on the teeth in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were only found {{on the sides of}} the teeth on the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of the teeth. Between 10 and 20µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth. Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair.|$|E

Inhomogeneities of the <b>striation</b> pattern that develop during the rise in tension and also during isometric steady state are completely reversible by this procedure.

40|$|The {{anomalous}} self-absorption of a high-power {{radio wave}} measured during recent ionospheric modification experiments exhibits a hysteresis effect. These {{results are consistent}} with the assumption that the growth of field-aligned irregularities due to the interaction of a high-power pump wave and the ionospheric plasma occurs in two stages. During the first stage, <b>striation</b> growth is due to an instability which has a threshold independent of <b>striation</b> amplitude. When the <b>striation</b> level is sufficiently high, the threshold of the second stage is reached. The second-stage threshold is dependent on the <b>striation</b> amplitude. The state of background ionosphere is also found to be an important factor influencing the observed effects. 5347...|$|R
40|$|The <b>striation</b> {{mechanism}} of dielectric microdischarges, {{as in many}} plasma devices, is extensively explored by collisional kinetic and fluid simulations. <b>Striation</b> in a typical dielectric microdischarge device predominantly occurs near the anode region and is basically governed by the ionization-dominated α-processes, wherein surface and space charges collectively dictate the phenomenon in a complex manner. A novel type of <b>striation</b> has been investigated by us near the cathode region, which is dominated by γ-processes and {{is driven by the}} secondary-electron emission mechanism. close 101...|$|R
5|$|In the mandible, the {{diastema}} (gap) {{between the}} incisors and the cheekteeth (premolars and molars) is relatively deep. The mental foramen (an {{opening in the}} bone) is located relatively high and before the p4. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which are located on the outer side of the jaw and anchor some of the chewing muscles, meet at the m1.

5|$|Of {{the commercially}} {{available}} Hippeastrum species, sometimes sold as 'exotic' amaryllis, Hippeastrum cybister has extremely thin petals {{often described as}} spider-like. The miniature evergreen Hippeastrum papilio or 'Butterfly Amaryllis' whose petals resemble a butterfly (papilio) has a unique color and pattern with broad rose-burgundy center stripes and <b>striations</b> of pale green on the upper petals and narrow stripes on the bottom three. It has been crossed with both cybister and single flower cultivars to produce hybrids with unusual striping.|$|E
5|$|By {{examining}} unique <b>striations,</b> or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the macro-mechanism of {{abrasive}} water jet (AWJ) cutting is studied {{from the point}} of cutting front and <b>striation</b> formation analysis. The <b>striation</b> on the surface cut with AWJ is a characteristic phenomena which is strongly present when cutting with high traverse velocities for particular material type and thickness of workpiece. The connection between the cutting front step formation and <b>striation</b> formation is explained through series of experiments, which include visual observations of cutting transparent material and through analogies, which deal with river meandering and wear of pneumatic conveyor bends...|$|R
40|$|A- and I-band <b>striation</b> {{positions}} {{have been}} obtained, three-dimensionally reconstructed, and statistically analyzed from the volumes of resting isolated heart cells. <b>Striation</b> patterns from optically discrete subvolumes are imaged {{along the length}} of these myocytes with a computer-interfaced optical microscope imaging system. Planar <b>striation</b> maps are reconstructed by the computer from sequentially obtained <b>striation</b> pattern images displaced across the width or depth of the cell in controlled steps. Multiple planar maps are combined to form full three-dimensional (3 -D) reconstructions that illustrate the sarcomeric structure and ordering throughout the volume of the cell. These reconstructions demonstrate a high degree of <b>striation</b> registration throughout most regions of cardiac cells. The <b>striation</b> registration is often slightly (less than 10 degrees) skewed across the width or depth of nearly every cell and is occasionally disrupted between adjacent groups of sarcomeres. These disruptions in registration are always associated with the locations of the nuclei. Rigorous statistical analyses indicate small volumetric regions of the cell delineated by these disruptions can have significantly (0. 014 - 0. 113 micron) shorter or longer average sarcomere length periodicities. Unlike skeletal muscle "fibrillenstruktur," these data from cardiac cells exhibit no evidence of helical packing schemes for sarcomere order. These observations suggest that the relatively large nuclei displace and disrupt the normal registration of the sarcomeres, which is probably mediated by internal cytoskeletal structures...|$|R

5|$|Geastrum pectinatum {{has been}} mistaken for the morphologically similar but smaller species G.schmidelii. The latter species lacks {{vertical}} <b>striations</b> on the basal {{portions of the}} endoperidium, and {{does not have a}} pseudoparenchymatous collar around the stem. Another similar species, G.berkeleyi, has a shorter stem and is missing the ridges {{at the base of the}} spore sac. Further, the color of its spore sac is usually brown, in contrast to the gray-blue of G.pectinatum. G.xerophilum also has a dusting of white powder on the surface of the spore sac, but unlike G.pectinatum, consistently lacks a ring at the base of the pedicel; furthermore, in contrast to G.pectinatum, the spores of G.xerophilum are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope. G.striatum has smaller fruit bodies than G.pectinatum, and a distinct collar-like apophysis.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compare {{individual}} <b>striations,</b> examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known bullet exemplars {{are created by}} firing the weapon into a water tank. The spent bullet can be recovered, intact, as the water slows down the bullet before it can reach the tank walls, allowing {{for it to be}} recovered. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles. To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E
40|$|Abrasive {{water jet}} {{machining}} is an emerging technology which can shape almost all engineering materials, but also produces a characteristic striated surface finish which limits its potential applications. In this study, the characterisation of different materials' cut surfaces is investigated using a scanning electron microscope. The effect of abrasive particle {{distribution in the}} jet on <b>striation</b> formation is detailed. A non-invasive technique: laser Doppler anemometry is used to analyse the abrasive particle distribution in the jet. Furthermore, the mechanisms of <b>striation</b> formation are discussed in detail and an effective <b>striation</b> minimisation technique applied to the cutting process is outlined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Use {{scissors}} and cutting pliers to produce some <b>striation</b> marks. The data collection apparatus {{is used to}} collect the surface data of such marks produced by {{scissors and}} cutting pliers, and then get the profile curve that is vertical {{to the surface of}} <b>striation</b> marks. In application of fractal theory, the fractal dimension of such profile curve is then calculated, and further studies are made on its fractal characteristics. As an exploration on tool types and individual identification, this is aimed to provide a new theory and approach to examination identification of <b>striation</b> tool marks...|$|R
30|$|We {{employed}} a visual grading system to detect whether the muscles were affected. Normal muscle appears with low echo-intensity divided by echogenic perimysium and connective tissue with speckled appearance (muscle <b>striation)</b> in the transverse plane. The muscle was considered abnormal if it showed increased echogenicity, lost its <b>striation,</b> or showed change in muscle bulk (atrophy or hypertrophy).|$|R
5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric <b>striations,</b> scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ramaria botrytis include its large size, the orange, reddish, or purplish branchlets, striate spores with dimensions averaging 13.8 by 4.7µm, and a weak amyloid staining {{reaction of the}} stem tissue. R.rubripermanens has reddish terminal branches, a stout form, and striate spores, but may be distinguished from R.botrytis by its much shorter spores. Other species with which R.botrytis may be confused include: R.formosa, which has branches that are pinker than R.botrytis, and yellow-tipped; R.caulifloriformis, found in the Great Lakes region of the United States, whose branch tips darken with age; R.strasseri, which has yellow to brown branch tips; R.rubrievanescens, which has branches in which the pink color fades after picking or in mature fruit bodies; and R.botrytoides, which is most reliably distinguished from R.botrytis by its smooth spores. The European species R.rielii, often confused with R.botrytis and sometimes considered synonymous, can be distinguished by microscopic characteristics: R.reilii lacks the clamped hyphae of R.botrytis, its spores are longer and wider, and they have warts instead of <b>striations.</b> The North American species R.araiospora, though superficially similar to R.botrytis, has several distinguishing characteristics: it grows under hemlock; it has reddish to magenta branches with orange to yellowish tips; it lacks any discernible odor; it has warted, somewhat cylindrical spores averaging 9.9 by 3.7µm; and it has non-amyloid stem tissue. Uniformly colored bright pink to reddish, R.subbotrytis has spores measuring 7–9 by 3–3.5µm.|$|E
5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no <b>striations</b> when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and {{this is the type of}} muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new image {{processing}} strategy that enables an automated extraction of signatures from <b>striation</b> patterns. To this end, a signal model is proposed that allows a suitable description of the interesting features of forensically relevant <b>striation</b> marks. To provide for a high image quality, several images of the same surface area are recorded under systematically varying conditions. The images obtained are then combined to an improved result by means of appropriate sensor fusion techniques. Based upon the signal model, the signal of interest is concentrated, and a compact representation of the grooves is obtained. To enable an efficient description of the relevant features even {{in the cases of}} deformed surfaces or curved <b>striation</b> marks, a straightening of the grooves is performed before. In the following, a meaningful signature describing the information of interest is extracted using the whole length of the grooves. This signature can be used for an objective evaluation of similarity of <b>striation</b> patterns...|$|R
5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the bullet, and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the <b>striations</b> left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Cyathus have fruit bodies (peridia) that are vase-, trumpet- or urn-shaped with {{dimensions}} of 4–8mm wide by 7–18mm tall. Fruit bodies are brown to gray-brown in color, {{and covered with}} small hair-like structures on the outer surface. Some species, like C.striatus and C.setosus, have conspicuous bristles called setae {{on the rim of}} the cup. The fruit body is often expanded at the base into a solid rounded mass of hyphae called an emplacement, which typically becomes tangled and entwined with small fragments of the underlying growing surface, improving its stability and helping it from being knocked over by rain. Immature fruit bodies have a whitish membrane, an epiphragm, that covers the peridium opening when young, but eventually dehisces, breaking open during maturation. Viewed with a microscope, the peridium of Cyathus species is made of three distinct layers—the endo-, meso-, and ectoperidium, referring to the inner, middle, and outer layers respectively. While the surface of the ectoperidium in Cyathus is usually hairy, the endoperidial surface is smooth, and depending on the species, may have longitudinal grooves (<b>striations).</b>|$|E

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{a mathematical model}} for the estimation of the energy absorption capability of materials during abrasive water jet machining based on an energy balance inside the workpiece. A parameter x(h) is defined to describe and calculate the energy absorption capability. A method for the estimation of this parameter is developed based on a parabolic <b>striation</b> model. It is shown that the energy absorption depends on the depth of cut following a second-order equation. The relation between the relative depth of cut hlh,,, and the energy absorption capability ~ (h) can also be described by a second-order equation. For such materials as aluminium, cast iron,and stainless steel a critical point of abrasive water jet energy absorption is detected {{at a depth of}} cut of h = 0. 52 h,,, which corresponds to a <b>striation</b> angle of about 75 ".

40|$|There are {{two views}} {{concerning}} {{the mountains of}} Snowdonia and their role during former glaciations of Britain. One is that they formed a subsidiary centre for ice dispersal, while {{the second is that}} they were overrun by westward-flowing ice derived from the main Welsh ice centre in the east. In this paper <b>striation</b> directions are used to test the two hypotheses. The <b>striation</b> pattern reflects ice flow radiating from the general vicinity of Snowdon summit and the strong eastward component of flow contradicts the idea that the Welsh ice sheet overran the area. Since the <b>striation</b> directions are conformable with large landforms of glacial erosion, it is reasonable to suggest that Snowdonia maintained an independent ice centre during much of the last glaciation...|$|R
