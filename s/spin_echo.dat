40|$|The {{origin of}} the nonexponentiality of proton <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> of {{skeletal}} muscle has been carefully examined. It is shown that the slowly decaying part of the proton <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> is not due to extracellular water. First, for muscle from mice with in vivo deuteration, the deuteron <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> were also nonexponential, but the slowly decaying part had a larger weighing factor. Second, for glycerinated muscle in which cell membranes were disrupted, the proton <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> {{were similar to those}} in intact muscle. Third, the nonexponentiality of the proton <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> in intact muscle increased when postmortem rigor set in. Finally, when the lifetimes of extracellular water and intracellular water were taken into account in the exchange, {{it was found that the}} two types of water would not give two resolvable exponentials with the observed decay constants. It is suggested that the unusually short T 2 's and the nonexponential character of the <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> of proton and deuteron in muscle water are mainly due to hydrogen exchange between water and functional groups in the protein filaments. These groups have large dipolar or quadrupolar splittings, and undergo hydrogen exchange with water at intermediate rates. The exchange processes and their effects on the <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> are pH-dependent. The dependence of transverse relaxation of pH was observed in glycerinated rabbit psoas muscle fibers...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In fast spin-echo (FSE) imaging a {{train of}} <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> with an {{increasing}} T 2 weighting is acquired after a preceding RF excitation. When {{combined with the}} radial encoding scheme each of the <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> coincides with the k-space center and, thus, all spokes carry {{an equal amount of}} low spatial frequency information. Therefore, the image contrast represents an average of the varying T 2 weightings if a conventional reconstruction method like regridding is used. On the other hand, due to the oversampling of the k-space center, a single radial FSE data set implicitly contains information about the relaxation process. Here, a novel idea is presented to extract this temporal information using a numerical optimization procedure...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} several {{applications of}} a versatile pulse sequence family employing multiple <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> within one acquisition to accelerate multidimensional experiments. The core sequence, called multiple modulation multiple echo, measures the maximal set of <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> generated from {{a set of}} RF pulses with unequal time spacings. These echoes can be modulated individually to exhibit different encoding. As a result, one scan of the sequence determines a series of data points {{as a function of}} the specific encoding mechanism. The variety of realizations of this sequence includes single shot measurements of diffusion or flow in 1 D, 2 D, and single-scan 2 D slice-selective imaging. The essential spin dynamics of such sequences is introduced and their applications are reviewed. close 5...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to those static perturbations, numerous dynamic effects (<b>spin</b> <b>echo,</b> Rabi oscillations, etc.) can be exploited by applying a carefully designed sequence of microwave pulses. The first pulse coherently excites the electron spins, and this coherence is then manipulated and probed by the subsequent pulses. Those dynamic effects are rather important for practical realization of quantum computers, which ought to work at high frequency.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> {{effect was}} {{discovered}} by Erwin Hahn when he applied two successive 90° pulses separated by short time period, but detected a signal, the echo, when no pulse was applied. [...] This phenomenon of <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> was explained by Erwin Hahn in his 1950 paper, and further developed by Carr and Purcell who pointed out the advantages of using a 180° refocusing pulse for the second pulse.

25|$|Echo {{phenomena}} {{are important}} features of coherent spectroscopy {{which have been}} used in fields other than magnetic resonance including laser spectroscopy and neutron scattering. Echoes were first detected in nuclear magnetic resonance by Erwin Hahn in 1950, and <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> are sometimes referred to as Hahn echoes. In nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging, radiofrequency radiation is most commonly used.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{simplifications}} {{are used}} in this sequence: no decoherence is included and each spin experiences perfect pulses during which the environment provides no spreading.

2500|$|For the heteronuclear version, the {{simplest}} pulse sequence used {{is called a}} Müller–Kumar–Ernst (MKE) experiment,which has a single 90° pulse for the heteronucleus for the preparation period, no mixing period, and applies a decoupling signal to the proton during the detection period. [...] There are several variants on this pulse sequence [...] which are more sensitive and more accurate, which fall under the categories of gated decoupler methods and spin-flip methods. [...] Homonuclear J-resolved spectroscopy uses the <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> pulse sequence.|$|E
2500|$|HSQC {{works by}} {{transferring}} magnetization from the I nucleus (usually the proton) to the S nucleus (usually the heteroatom) using the INEPT pulse sequence; this {{first step is}} done because the proton has a greater equilibrium magnetization and thus this step creates a stronger signal. [...] The magnetization then evolves and then is transferred back to the I nucleus for observation. [...] An extra <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> step can then optionally be used to decouple the signal, simplifying the spectrum by collapsing multiplets to a single peak. [...] The undesired uncoupled signals are removed by running the experiment twice with the phase of one specific pulse reversed; this reverses {{the signs of the}} desired but not the undesired peaks, so subtracting the two spectra will give only the desired peaks.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) π-trains for dynamically decoupling a system from its environment {{has been extensively}} studied {{in a variety of}} physical systems. When applied to dipolar solids, recent experiments have demonstrated that CPMG pulse trains can generate long-lived <b>spin</b> <b>echoes.</b> While there still remains some controversy as to the origins of these long-lived <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> under the CPMG sequence, there is a general agreement that pulse errors during the π-pulses are a necessary requirement. In this work, we develop a theory to describe the spin dynamics in dipolar coupled spin- 1 / 2 system under a CPMG(ϕ_ 1,ϕ_ 2) pulse train, where ϕ_ 1 and ϕ_ 2 are the phases of the π-pulses. From our theoretical framework, the propagator for the CPMG(ϕ_ 1,ϕ_ 2) pulse train is equivalent to an effective "pulsed" spin-locking of single-quantum coherences with phase ±ϕ_ 2 - 3 ϕ_ 1 / 2, which generates a periodic quasiequilibrium that corresponds to the long-lived echoes. Numerical simulations, along with experiments on both magnetically dilute, random spin networks found in C_ 60 and C_ 70 and in non-dilute spin systems found in adamantane and ferrocene, were performed and confirm the predictions from the proposed theory.
