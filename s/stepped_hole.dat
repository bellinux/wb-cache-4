40|$|Abstract. The {{building}} {{operations of}} cast-in-place structure mostly {{need to have}} a certain shape of cast-in-place soldier piles. The cast-in-site soldier pile model proposed in this study includes a baseboard, stepped holes set in {{the central part of the}} baseboard, and a pile body set on the stepped surface of stepped holes. The pile body can be installed at the location of <b>stepped</b> <b>hole</b> on the baseboard during the construction process, and then solidification and compaction operations shall be taken on the cement paste inside the pile body through the pre-set vibrating hole. These results can increase overall support strength of the civil construction, and also facilitate the overall installation and transportation of this device and reduce the production cost by using the split-type baseboard and pile body...|$|E

A new technological scheme for a two-step press forging of <b>stepped</b> <b>holes</b> in a thick metal sheet was proposed. Finite element analysis on the two-step process is carried out by using DEFORM- 3 D. Distributions of effective strain and effective stress were obtained. The study showed that the process not only can form the <b>stepped</b> <b>holes,</b> but also can increase the surface quality and strength of <b>stepped</b> <b>holes</b> in sheet metal parts, According to the numerical simulation’s process parameter, an experimental die was designed, the simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} all-e-beam {{lithography}} (EBL) {{process for the}} patterning of photonic crystal waveguides. The whole device structures are exposed in two <b>steps.</b> <b>Holes</b> constituting the photonic crystal lattice and defects are first exposed with a small exposure step size (less than 10 nm). With {{the introduction of the}} additional proximity effect to compensate the original proximity effect, the shape, size, and position of the holes can be well controlled. The second step is the exposure of the access waveguides at a larger step size (about 30 nm) to improve the scan speed of the EBL. The influence of write-field stitching error can be alleviated by replacing the original waveguides with tapered waveguides at the joint of adjacent write-fields. It is found experimentally that a higher exposure efficiency is achieved with a larger step size;however,a larger step size requires a higher dose. National Natural Science Foundation of Chin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor the {{conventional}} radiographic technique, X/gamma ray filminterpretation {{is based on}} human eye perception. There is no criterion of "universal"visibility / detectability of flaws and IQIs for simulated radiography. However, atleast one detectability criterion is required for an automatic analysis study of a givenset-up. The Rose criterion, based on the contrast to noise ratio of the imaged flawnormalized to the spatial image resolution, is the current reference detectabilitymeasure. It is by definition well-adapted {{in the case of}} roughly circular flaws (e. g. flat bottom <b>holes</b> or <b>step</b> <b>hole</b> IQIs) but shows its limits for cracks with an elongatedshape or close to the limit of spatial resolution as well as for wire IQIs.

40|$|Various {{sizes of}} step drills were {{manufactured}} by a CNC grinder machine {{and used in}} the drilling process with different speeds and feed rates to produce single <b>step</b> <b>holes</b> in S 1214 free machining steel. The performance of step drills was {{compared with that of}} conventional twist drills in the drilling of the free machining steel for the same task. The influences of drill size, feed rate and cutting speed on the performance of step drills were studied. Experimental results show that for better cutting performance, the small diameter should not be less than 60 % of the large diameter. Also, most of the changes in the characteristics of the thrust force were influenced by the smaller drill of the step drill. On the other hand, the small diameter part of the step drill only contributed about 30 % of the torque. From the experimental results, empirical equations for drilling thrust force and torque have been established for step drills...|$|R

40|$|Electrochemical {{machining}} (ECM) is {{a potential}} procedure for high precision micromanufacturing. Especially the machining of work pieces without any thermal or mechanical impact is a significant feature. Additionally, the electrochemical dissolution behavior of the work piece material is only defined by its electrochemical attributes. Hence, mechanical characteristics such as the material's hardness and the ductility have no influence. This makes ECM an alternative process for mechanically hard to machine materials. In this study, a special procedure for machining microgeometries in carbide metal alloys is investigated, whereat a continuous electrolytic free jet (Jet Electrochemical Machining - Jet-ECM) is applied. The special characteristic of this technology is the restriction of the electric current to a confined area by the jet, {{which leads to a}} high localization of the removals. Even complex structures can be machined by the help of continuous direct current. Hence, higher dissolution rates compared to pulsed electrochemical processes can be achieved. In the experiments the machining of <b>step</b> <b>holes</b> and grooves in tungsten carbide alloys is performed. Therefore, point erosions without nozzle movement and linear erosions by single- and multi-axis motions of the tool are conducted. In addition, three-dimensional shaping of the investigated materials is presented by overlapping linear erosions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new hybrid (graph + rule based) approach for recognizing the interacting features from B-Rep CAD models of prismatic machined parts. The developed algorithm considers variable topology features and handles both adjacent and volumetric feature interactions {{to provide a}} single interpretation for the latter. The input CAD part model in B-Rep format is preprocessed to create the adjacency graphs for faces and features of associated topological entities and compute their attributes. The developed FR system initially recognizes all varieties of the simple and <b>stepped</b> <b>holes</b> with flat and conical bottoms from the feature graphs. A new concept of Base Explicit Feature Graphs and No-base Explicit Feature Graphs has been proposed which essentially delineates between features having planar base face like pockets, blind slots, etc. and those without planar base faces like passages, 3 D features, conical bottom features, etc. Based {{on the structure of}} the explicit feature graphs, geometric reasoning rules are formulated to recognize the interacting feature types. Extracted data has been post-processed to compute the feature attributes and their parent-child relationships which are written into a STEP like native feature file format. The FR system was extensively tested with several standard benchmark components and was found to be robust and consistent. The extracted feature file can be used for integration with various downstream applications like CAPP. ...|$|R

40|$|Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP) is {{considered}} to be the bridge that links Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM). One of the imperative characteristics of CAPP is Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR). CAD files contain detailed geometric information of a part, which are not suitable for using in the downstream applications such as process planning. Different CAD or geometric modeling packages store the information related to the design in their own databases. Structures of these databases are different from each other. As a result no common or standard structure has been developed so far, that can be used by all CAD packages. For that reason this paper will propose an intelligent feature recognition methodology (IFRM) to develop a feature recognition system which has the ability to communicate with the different CAD/CAM systems. The proposed methodology is developed for 3 D prismatic parts that are created by using solid modeling package by using CSG technique as a drawing tool. The system takes a neutral file in Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) format as input and translates the information in the file to manufacturing information. The boundary (B-rep) geometrical information of the part design is analyzed by a feature recognition program that is created specifically to extract the features from the geometrical information based on the geometric reasoning approach. A feature recognition algorithm is used to recognize different features of the part such as <b>step,</b> <b>holes,</b> etc. The system is written in C++ language on a PC-based system. Finally, a sample application description for a workpiece is presented for demonstration purposes...|$|R
