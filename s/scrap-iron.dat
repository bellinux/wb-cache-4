25|$|This led to {{frequent}} power-struggles within the organization, {{and ultimately the}} Baroness and Major Bludd enacted a plot to assassinate the Commander, and seize control of Cobra. In a twist of fate, the conspirators recruited Billy {{to carry out the}} assassination, but he was intercepted by Destro. Cobra Commander had no qualms about torturing his own son to unearth the conspiracy, yet Billy refused to surrender who had sponsored the hit. Storm Shadow later freed Billy, and they both escaped to New York, where Storm Shadow trained him in ninjitsu. Billy was later caught in the crossfire between the Soft Master and Cobra agent <b>Scrap-Iron,</b> resulting in an explosion which seemingly killed Billy and several others.|$|E
500|$|The Scrap Iron Flotilla was an Australian {{destroyer}} {{group that}} operated in the Mediterranean and Pacific during World War II. The name was bestowed upon the group by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels who described the fleet as a [...] "consignment of junk" [...] and [...] "Australia's <b>Scrap-Iron</b> Flotilla". The flotilla consisted of five vessels; [...] , which acted as flotilla leader, and four V-class destroyers; , , , [...] The ships were all built {{to fight in}} World War I, and were slow and poorly armed compared to newer ships. The five destroyers—the entirety of the RAN's destroyer force—departed Australia in November 1939 destined for Singapore where they carried out anti-submarine exercises with the Royal Navy submarine [...] On 13 November 1939, the flotilla left Singapore for the Mediterranean Sea, following a request from the Admiralty for assistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, {{with an air}} of reflection, [...] "I don't quite {{think it}} is; but perhaps I'm prejudiced. I wheeled <b>scrap-iron</b> at the rolling-mills when I was in Montreal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I'll {{hold you}} responsible, Captain Munster,' says he to me, mad {{enough to eat}} <b>scrap-iron.</b> 'No, you won't,' says she; 'I'm the {{charterer}} of the Emily, and Captain Munster has acted under my orders.' ...|$|E
60|$|But things ne'er do go {{smoothly}} in weddings, suicides, or courtships. Only {{there at}} the edge of the water, where Butter was to end himself, lay a life-preserver--a big round canvas one, which would float after the <b>scrap-iron</b> was soaked out of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did n't fly off the handle," [...] {{said the}} screw, twirling huskily {{at the end}} of the screw-shaft. [...] "If I had, you'd have been <b>scrap-iron</b> by this time. The sea dropped away from under me, and I had nothing to catch on to. That's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{that man}} {{goes on the}} loose with what he gets for firin', an' forgets all about those letters, it won't be nice for us," [...] he said. [...] "In the meanwhile, we've just got to buck up and lighten the blame old <b>scrap-iron</b> tank between us." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{procured}} a packing-case {{from the}} woodpile in the cellar, fitted a cover to it, and raided the <b>scrap-iron</b> the Silva tribe was collecting for the junkman. With fresh-sprinkled garments in the box, {{covered with the}} board and pressed by the iron, the device was complete and in operation.|$|E
6000|$|... "You had {{got quite}} {{away from the}} sublimity of New York, which upon the whole you seemed to {{attribute}} to the tall buildings along Fifth Avenue. We should like you to explain again why, if 'The Heart of New York,' with its sky-scrapers, made you think of <b>scrap-iron,</b> the Flatiron soothed your lacerated sensibilities?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I ain't no invalid," [...] he said. [...] "When {{it comes}} down to hard-pan, I can digest <b>scrap-iron.</b> But just now I've got dyspepsia. Most of what you was sayin' I can't digest. Never trained that way, you see. I like books and poetry, and what time I've had I've read 'em, but I've never thought about 'em the way you have. That's why I can't talk about 'em. I'm like a {{navigator}} adrift on a strange sea without chart or compass. Now I want to get my bearin's. Mebbe you can put me right. How did you learn all this you've ben talkin'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't, altogether," [...] {{our friend}} replied. [...] "Especially I don't {{leave out the}} upper West Side. That has moments of being even beautiful. But {{there is a point}} beyond which sublimity cannot go; and that is about the fifteenth story. When you get a group of those sky-scrapers, all soaring beyond this point, you have, in an {{inverted}} phase, the unimpressiveness which Taine noted as the real effect of a prospect from the summit of a very lofty mountain. The other day I found myself arrested before a shop-window by a large photograph labelled 'The Heart of New York.' It was a map of that region of sky-scrapers which you seem to think not justly beyond the scope of attributive sublimity. It was a horror; it set my teeth on edge; it made me think of scrap-iron--heaps, heights, pinnacles of <b>scrap-iron.</b> Don't ask me why <b>scrap-iron!</b> Go and look at that photograph and you will understand. Below those monstrous cliffs the lower roofs were like broken foot-hills; the streets were chasms, gulches, gashes. It looked as {{if there had been a}} conflagration, and the houses had been burned into the cellars; and the eye sought the nerve-racking tangle of pipe and wire which remains among the ruins after a great fire. Perhaps this was what made me think of scrap-iron--heaps, heights, pinnacles of it. No, there was no sublimity there. Some astronomers have latterly assigned bounds to immensity, but the sky-scrapers go beyond these bounds; they are primordial, abnormal." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{report this}} {{reflection}} in French, since {{the man was}} of Paris, not of Barcelona at all. At the Maranon he lived apart from the station, in a small shed with a metal roof and straw walls, which he called mon atelier. He had a work-bench there. They had given him several horse-blankets and a saddle--not that he ever had occasion to ride, but because no other bedding {{was used by the}} working-hands, who were all vaqueros--cattlemen. And on this horseman's gear, like a son of the plains, he used to sleep amongst the tools of his trade, in a litter of rusty <b>scrap-iron,</b> with a portable forge at his head, under the work-bench sustaining his grimy mosquito-net.|$|E
60|$|Joe {{followed}} the men, who picked their way carefully up a twenty-foot bank. At the top {{he found himself}} on a narrow railway track which ran between huge piles of rusty <b>scrap-iron.</b> These piles, separated by tracks, extended in every direction he could not tell how far, though in the distance {{he could see the}} vague outlines of some great factory-like building. The men began to carry loads of the iron down to the beach, and French Pete, gripping him by the arm and again warning him not to make any noise, told him to do likewise. At the beach they turned their burdens over to 'Frisco Kid, who loaded them, first in the one skiff and then in the other. As the boats settled under the weight, he kept pushing them farther and farther out, in order that they should keep clear of the bottom.|$|E
60|$|Almost {{opposite}} his berth, {{across the}} narrow passage under the bridge, there was, {{in the iron}} deck-structure covering the stokehold fiddle and the boiler-space, a storeroom with iron sides, iron roof, iron-plated floor, too, {{on account of the}} heat below. All sorts of rubbish was shot there: it had a mound of <b>scrap-iron</b> in a corner; rows of empty oil-cans; sacks of cotton-waste, with a heap of charcoal, a deck-forge, fragments of an old hencoop, winch-covers all in rags, remnants of lamps, and a brown felt hat, discarded by a man dead now (of a fever on the Brazil coast), who had been once mate of the Sofala, had remained for years jammed forcibly behind a length of burst copper pipe, flung at some time or other out of the engine-room. A complete and imperious blackness pervaded that Capharnaum of forgotten things. A small shaft of light from Mr. Massy's bull's-eye fell slanting right through it.|$|E
60|$|We grew maudlin, and all {{talked and}} shouted at once. I had a splendid constitution, a stomach that would digest <b>scrap-iron,</b> and I was still running my {{marathon}} in full vigour when Scotty began to fail and fade. His talk grew incoherent. He groped for words {{and could not}} find them, while the ones he found his lips were unable to form. His poisoned consciousness was leaving him. The brightness {{went out of his}} eyes, and he looked as stupid as were his efforts to talk. His face and body sagged as his consciousness sagged. (A man cannot sit upright save by an act of will.) Scotty's reeling brain could not control his muscles. All his correlations were breaking down. He strove to take another drink, and feebly dropped the tumbler on the floor. Then, to my amazement, weeping bitterly, he rolled into a bunk on his back and immediately snored off to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|We {{saw before}} us {{a sort of}} vault, stone-built, and low, and long. The light there was too dim {{for us to make}} out {{anything}} but walls and heaps of rusting <b>scrap-iron</b> cast away there and mouldering own. But trying to pierce that darkness we became conscious, as it seemed, of innumerable eyes gazing, not at us, but through the archway where we stood; innumerable white eyeballs gleaming out of blackness. From behind us came a little laugh. It floated past through the archway, toward those eyes. Who was that? Who laughed in there? The old South itself--that incredible, fine, lost soul! That [...] "old-time" [...] thing of old ideals, blindfolded by its own history! That queer proud blend of simple chivalry and tyranny, of piety and the abhorrent thing! Who was it laughed there in the old slave-market--laughed at these white eyeballs glaring from out of the blackness of their dark cattle-pen? What poor departed soul in this House of Melancholy? But there was no ghost when we turned to look--only our old guide with her sweet smile.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear fellow, I don't think anything. It's all {{the craziest}} conjecture. Stranger things even than this have happened. There are dozens here--in print. What are we human beings after all? Clay {{in the hands}} of the potter. Our bodies are merely an inheritance, packed tight and corded up. We have {{practically}} no control over their main functions. We can't even replace a little finger-nail. And look at the faces of us--what atrocious mockeries most of them are of any kind of image! But we know our bodies change--age, sickness, thought, passion, fatality. It proves they are amazingly plastic. And merely even as a theory it is not in the least untenable that by force of some violent convulsive effort from outside one's body might change. It answers with odd voluntariness to friend or foe, smile or snarl. As for what we call the laws of Nature, they are pure assumptions to-day, and may be nothing better than <b>scrap-iron</b> tomorrow. Good Heavens, Lawford, consider man's abysmal impudence.' He smoked on in silence for a moment. 'You say you fell asleep down there?' ...|$|E
60|$|The whole {{question}} of improved armaments has been approached by {{the governments of the}} earth in a spirit of nervous and unreflecting haste, whereas the right way was lying plainly before them, and had only to be pursued with calm determination. The learned vigils and labours of a certain class of inventors should have been rewarded with honourable liberality as justice demanded; and the bodies of the inventors should have been blown to pieces by means of their own perfected explosives and improved weapons with extreme publicity as the commonest prudence dictated. By this method the ardour of research in that direction would have been restrained without infringing the sacred privileges of science. For the lack of a little cool thinking in our guides and masters this course has not been followed, and a beautiful simplicity has been sacrificed for no real advantage. A frugal mind cannot defend itself from considerable bitterness when reflecting that at the Battle of Actium (which was fought for no less a stake than the dominion of the world) the fleet of Octavianus Caesar and the fleet of Antonius, including the Egyptian division and Cleopatra's galley with purple sails, probably cost less than two modern battleships, or, as the modern naval book-jargon has it, two capital units. But no amount of lubberly book-jargon can disguise a fact well calculated to afflict the soul of every sound economist. It is not likely that the Mediterranean will ever behold a battle with a greater issue; but when the time comes for another historical fight its bottom will be enriched as never before by a quantity of jagged <b>scrap-iron,</b> paid for at pretty nearly its weight of gold by the deluded populations inhabiting the isles and continents of this planet.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Brandreth {{met them}} {{at the door of}} his mother's cottage. It was a very small cottage on the outside, with a good deal of stained glass en évidence in leaded sashes; where the sashes were not leaded and the glass not stained, the panes were cut up into very large ones, with little ones round them. Everything was very old-fashioned inside. The door opened {{directly}} into a wainscoted square hall, which had a large fireplace with gleaming brass andirons, and a carved mantel carried to the ceiling. It was both baronial and colonial in its decoration; there was part of a suit of imitation armour under a pair of moose antlers on one wall, and at one side of the fireplace there was a spinning-wheel, with a tuft of flax ready to be spun. There were Japanese swords on the lowest mantel-shelf, together with fans and vases; a long old flint-lock musket stretched across the panel above. Mr. Brandreth began to show things to Annie, and to tell how little they cost, as soon as the ladies entered. His mother's voice called from above, [...] "Now, Percy, you stop till I get there!" [...] and in a moment or two she appeared from behind a portière in one corner. Before she shook hands with the ladies, or allowed any kind of greeting, she pulled the portière aside, and made Annie admire the snug concealment of the staircase. Then she made her go upstairs and see the chambers, and the second-hand colonial bedsteads, and the andirons everywhere, and the old chests of drawers and their brasses; and she told her some story about each, and how Percy picked it up and had it repaired. When they came down, the son took Annie in hand again and walked her over the ground-floor, ending with the kitchen, which was in the taste of an old New England kitchen, with hard-seated high-backed chairs, and a kitchen table with curiously turned legs, which he had picked up in the hen-house of a neighbouring farmer for a song. There was an authentic crane in the dining-room fireplace, which he had found in a heap of <b>scrap-iron</b> at a blacksmith's shop, and had got for next to nothing. The sideboard he had got at an old second-hand shop in the North End; and he believed it was an heirloom from the house of one of the old ministers of the North End Church. Everything, nearly, in the Brandreth cottage was an heirloom, though Annie could not remember afterward any object that had been an heirloom in the Brandreth family.|$|E
