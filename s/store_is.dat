50|$|Simpsons-Sears began {{operating}} full-line (department) {{stores in}} 1953. Internally, {{these have been}} classified by size, volume {{and the extent of}} merchandise selection. In the early decades, classifications were based on a letter designation, mirroring founding American parent, Sears, Roebuck and Co.: 'A' <b>Stores</b> <b>were</b> large full-line <b>stores,</b> 'B' <b>stores</b> <b>were</b> smaller full-lines, serving more-mid-sized markets, while 'D' <b>stores</b> <b>were</b> early <b>stores</b> serving small markets, normally offering mostly hard-line and home departments, with a catalogue desk. the 'D' <b>stores</b> <b>were</b> phased out in the early 1960s. Small stores, denoted 'S.S.' and serving similar markets to the original 'D' <b>Stores,</b> <b>were</b> introduced in the 1980s. In latter decades, <b>stores</b> have <b>been</b> classified by more descriptive terms, such as 'Select,' 'Core' and 'Small.' When Hometown Dealer <b>Stores</b> <b>were</b> introduced, they mirrored the assortments of the early 'D' stores.|$|R

5|$|The Gurdon Bill <b>Store</b> <b>is</b> {{named for}} Gurdon Bill, {{who was born}} in 1784. The land was {{originally}} purchased by Bill and his partner, Philip Gray, in 1818. Clouette notes that four years later, Bill was the sole owner of the property; a record from 1819 says Gray sold his interest in the store to Bill for $500. Bill continued to run the store until shortly before his death in 1856. At age 21, Bill went to Plainfield Academy and later went on to work with various merchants before setting up the store in North Groton, later incorporated as Ledyard, Connecticut. Clouette notes a brief passage of the store out of the Bill family, soon reacquired, before it was sold to the Congregational Society in 1875. The Congregational Society has made limited use of the store, preserving its historical integrity. Local historians speculate that the store's final transaction was made in 1868; afterwards the store was boarded up and left essentially unused.|$|E

5|$|Till {{was born}} and raised in Chicago and in August 1955, was visiting {{relatives}} near Money, in the Mississippi Delta region. He spoke to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant, the white married proprietor of a small grocery store there. Although what happened at the <b>store</b> <b>is</b> a matter of dispute, Till was accused of flirting with or whistling at Bryant. Decades later, Bryant disclosed that, in 1955, she had fabricated testimony that Till made verbal or physical advances towards her in the store. Till's reported behavior, perhaps unwittingly, violated the strictures of conduct for an African American male interacting with a white woman in the Jim Crow-era South. Several nights after the store incident, Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother J. W. Milam went armed to Till's great-uncle's house and abducted the boy. They took him away and beat and mutilated him before shooting him in the head and sinking his body in the Tallahatchie River. Three days later, Till's body was discovered and retrieved from the river.|$|E
