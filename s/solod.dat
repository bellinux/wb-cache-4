40|$|The {{study was}} to {{identify}} the compliance of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Approval Conditions in conditions terms of total suspended <b>solods</b> (TSS) discharge from the silt trap and in the rivers for Kuala Lumpur - Putrajaya - KLIA highway construction project, Malaysia. The data from August 2005 to May 2007 was obtained from Department of Environment, Kuala Lumpur. This project was chosen for the study because this project was among the early projects after the implementation of Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (ESCP). The highway cut across several rivers where a total of suspended solids (TSS) were measured at upstreams and downstreams with a total of twelve (12) stations. In addition, twelve (12) sampling stations for the silt trap discharge located along the rivers were also measured. The results have shown that fifteen (15) out of one hundred and thirty two (132) samplings for river stations recorded incompliance of about 11. 4 % and seven (7) out of fifty two (52) samplings for silt trap discharge stations recorded incompliance of about 13. 5 %...|$|R
50|$|<b>Solod</b> was {{appointed}} ambassador to Guinea on December 30, 1959. He succeeded Pavel Gerasimov. However, Solod's stay in Guinea was terminated by a diplomatic crisis {{between the two}} states. In November 1961 the Guinean president Ahmed Sékou Touré accused <b>Solod</b> {{of being involved in}} the so-called 'teachers' plot' (an alleged coup attempt by radical elements of the teachers' union). During a diplomatic reception in Conakry, Touré's presidential protocol officer pulled <b>Solod</b> out and directed him to immediately go to the Guinean Foreign Ministry. At the Foreign Ministry, he was informed that he was persona non grata in Guinea and that he had to leave the country at once.|$|E

50|$|<b>Solod</b> {{served as}} the Soviet envoy to Egypt in run-up to the 1956 Suez Crisis, and held discussions with Gamal Abdul Nasser regardings arms imports from the Soviet Union. <b>Solod</b> also {{maintained}} contacts with the Egyptian government in discussions on Soviet aid {{to the construction of}} Aswan Dam. Apart from the contacts with the Egyptian government, he also maintained contacts with local communists. From 1955 onwards, he advised Egyptian communists to recognize Nasser as a 'bourgeois nationalist'.|$|E

50|$|Solod's actual role in {{the alleged}} plot is {{believed}} to have been very marginal. In January 1962 the Soviet Union sent a new ambassador to Guinea, Dmitry Degtyar. Although the Soviet Union tried to downplay the rift between the two states after Solod's departure, the <b>Solod</b> affair contributed to a weaking of Soviet-Guinean relations and an opening for increased links between Guinea and the People's Republic of China.|$|E
50|$|Daniel Semyonovich <b>Solod</b> (Даниил Семёнович Солод, 1908-1988) was a Soviet diplomat and orientalist. He {{began working}} in the Soviet {{diplomatic}} corps in 1937. In 1940-1941 he served as Officer at the Soviet embassy in Yugoslavia. He was then transferred to Iran, where he served as Officer at the Soviet embassy in 1941-1943. In 1944-1950 he was the Soviet consul to Egypt. He served as the Soviet envoy to Lebanon and Syria. In 1953-1956 he returned to Egypt, as the Soviet envoy (becoming ambassador in 1954). Returning from Egypt, he {{was put in charge}} of the Near East department at the Soviet Foreign Ministry. Between 1959 and 1962 he was the Soviet ambassador to Guinea. After returning from Guinea, he worked at the Africa Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR until 1970.|$|E
5000|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} between the Soviet Union and Syria were established in July 1944. The Soviet Union commenced to again {{take an interest in}} the Middle East after the Second World War. The two countries signed a secret agreement on 1 February 1946, with Soviet minister to Syria and Lebanon Daniel <b>Solod</b> as signatory for the USSR, in which the Soviet Union agreed to provide military help {{in the formation of the}} Syrian Arab Army and prescribed Soviet diplomatic and political support in the international arena. The Soviet Union demonstrated its commitment to this treaty with Andrey Vyshinsky's 15 February 1946 address to the United Nations Security Council calling for the removal of British and French troops from the country. [...] The last French troops were removed from Syria on 17 April 1946. During the Cold War (1947-1991) a stronger political bond developed, and Syria was considered an ally to the Soviet Union in opposition to the Western powers.|$|E
50|$|The 4 great {{groups of}} Solonetzic soils {{are based on}} {{properties}} reflecting the degree of leaching. Solonetz soils have a dark, organic-matter-enriched A horizon overlying the Solonetzic B, which occurs usually {{at a depth of}} 20 cm or less. The Ae (grey, leached) horizon is very thin or absent. Solodized Solonetz have a distinct Ae horizon between the dark A and the Solonetzic B. Solods have a transitional AB or BA horizon formed by degradation of {{the upper part of the}} Solonetzic B horizon. Vertisolic Solonetzic soils have features intergrading the Vertisolic order in addition to any of the above Solonetzic features. The developmental sequence of Solonetzic soils is commonly from saline parent material to Solonetz, Solodized Solonetz and <b>Solod.</b> As leaching progresses, the salts and sodium ions are translocated downward. If leaching progresses for long enough and salts are removed completely, the Solonetzic B may disintegrate completely. The soil would then be classified in another order. Resalinization may occur and reverse the process associated with leaching.|$|E
40|$|Two {{pituitary}} hormones, {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) and prolactin, influence the steroid synthetic capacity of ovarian tissue in several species (Greep, 1971). Prolactin increases cholesterol content of rabbit interstitial tissue (Hilliard, Spies, Lucas & Sawyer, 1968), while LH increases {{the synthesis of}} progestational steroids from cholesterol (Dorrington & Kilpatrick, 1966; <b>Solod,</b> Armstrong & Greep, 1966).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate in detail the mineralogical soil composition in order to obtain a clearer picture of the extent to which it and the related pedogenetic process taking place in locations marked as solods on the R = 1 : 50, 000 soil map of the Vojvodina Province (Nejgebauer et al., 1971) correspond to the solodization process described in the literature. In the profiles of the soils we studied in the regions of western Bačka and southern Srem, illite was the dominant clay mineral, but some specific phenomena were also observed that from the pedogenetic point of view are typical of a soil type previously described in the literature (<b>solod),</b> namely the greater contribution of quartz, in the surface horizons of the total soil sample (which is indicative of clay mineral decomposition and destruction), the predominance of illite and kaolinite in the surface horizons of the clay fraction, and the fact that in the Bt,g horizon the kaolinite content decreased considerably and illuviation occurred of chlorite and vermiculite, two highly dispersive minerals from the smectite group...|$|E
