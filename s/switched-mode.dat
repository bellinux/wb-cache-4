25|$|In {{the case}} of a <b>switched-mode</b> power supply, a boost {{converter}} is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant DC bus voltage on its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another <b>switched-mode</b> converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics, but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.|$|E
25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors have relatively good decoupling {{properties in the}} lower frequency range up to about 1nbsp&MHz due to their large capacitance values. This {{is the reason for}} using {{electrolytic capacitors}} in standard or <b>switched-mode</b> power supplies behind the rectifier for smoothing application.|$|E
25|$|Multilayer ceramic {{capacitors}} {{are increasingly}} used to replace tantalum and low capacitance aluminium electrolytic capacitors in {{applications such as}} bypass or high frequency <b>switched-mode</b> power supplies as their cost, reliability and size becomes competitive. In many applications, their low ESR allows {{the use of a}} lower nominal capacitance value.|$|E
25|$|A {{ripple current}} is the RMS {{value of a}} {{superimposed}} AC current of any frequency and any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation. It arises, for example, in power supplies (including <b>switched-mode</b> power supplies) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as biased charge and discharge current through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor.|$|E
25|$|Regulatory {{agencies}} such as the EU have set harmonic limits as a method of improving power factor. Declining component cost has hastened implementation of two different methods. To comply with current EU standard EN61000-3-2, all <b>switched-mode</b> power supplies with output power more than 75W must include passive power factor correction, at least. 80 Plus power supply certification requires a power factor of 0.9 or more.|$|E
25|$|A typical <b>switched-mode</b> {{power supply}} first {{converts}} the AC mains to a DC bus {{by means of}} a bridge rectifier or a similar circuit. The output voltage is then derived from this DC bus. The problem with this is that the rectifier is a non-linear device, so the input current is highly non-linear. That means that the input current has energy at harmonics of the frequency of the voltage.|$|E
25|$|Non-linear loads {{change the}} shape of the current {{waveform}} from a sine wave to some other form. Non-linear loads create harmonic currents in addition to the original (fundamental frequency) AC current. This is of importance in practical power systems that contain non-linear loads such as rectifiers, some forms of electric lighting, electric arc furnaces, welding equipment, <b>switched-mode</b> power supplies, variable speed drives and other devices. Filters consisting of linear capacitors and inductors can prevent harmonic currents from entering the supplying system.|$|E
25|$|Ripple {{current is}} the AC {{component}} of an applied source (often a <b>switched-mode</b> power supply) whose frequency may be constant or varying. Ripple current causes heat to be generated {{within the capacitor}} due to the dielectric losses caused by the changing field strength together with the current flow across the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte in the capacitor. The equivalent series resistance (ESR) {{is the amount of}} internal series resistance one would add to a perfect capacitor to model this.|$|E
25|$|The {{impedance}} {{specified in}} the data sheets of various capacitors often shows typical curves for different capacitance values. The impedance at the resonant frequency defines the best working point for coupling or decoupling circuits. The higher the capacitance the lower the operable frequency range. Due to their large capacitance values, aluminum electrolytic capacitors have relatively good decoupling properties in the lower frequency range up to about 1MHz or a little more. This and the relatively low price is often the reason for using electrolytic capacitors in 50/60Hz standard or <b>switched-mode</b> power supplies.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{relatively}} high capacitance values aluminum electrolytic capacitors have low impedance values even at lower frequencies like mains frequency. They are typically used in power supplies, <b>switched-mode</b> power supplies and DC-DC converters for smoothing and buffering rectified DC voltages in many electronic devices {{as well as}} in industrial power supplies and frequency converters as DC link capacitors for drives, inverters for photovoltaic, and converters in wind power plants. Special types are used for energy storage, for example in photoflash or strobe applications or for frequency coupling in audio applications.|$|E
25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward voltage drop than p–n junction diodes. Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as <b>switched-mode</b> power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} this is to use two {{capacitors}} in series for the output smoothing on a bridge rectifier then place a switch between the midpoint of those capacitors and one of the AC input terminals. With the switch open, this circuit acts like a normal bridge rectifier. With the switch closed, it act like a voltage doubling rectifier. In other words, this makes it easy to derive a voltage of roughly 320V (±15%, approx.) DC from any 120V or 230V mains supply in the world, this can then be fed into a relatively simple <b>switched-mode</b> power supply. However, for a given desired ripple, the value of both capacitors must be twice the value of the single one required for a normal bridge rectifier; when the switch is closed each one must filter the output of a half-wave rectifier, and when the switch is open the two capacitors are connected in series with an equivalent value of half one of them.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, a <b>switched-mode</b> {{power supply}} chip, {{designated}} U16, of the Raspberry Pi2 ModelB version1.1 (the initially released version) {{was found to}} be vulnerable to flashes of light, particularly the light from xenon camera flashes and green and red laser pointers. However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at {{the other side of the}} Raspberry Pi2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the system on a chip (main processor) and then U16 with Blu-Tack (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests, where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes. The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a chip-scale package or wafer-level package), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as electrical tape, lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread), putting the Raspberry Pi2 in a case, and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not caught before the release of the Raspberry Pi2 because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference, it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference.|$|E

50|$|A <b>switched-mode</b> {{power supply}} (switching-mode power supply, {{switch-mode}} power supply, switched power supply, SMPS, or switcher) is an electronic power supply that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other power supplies, an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear power supply, the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a <b>switched-mode</b> power supply dissipates no power. Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a <b>switched-mode</b> power supply. <b>Switched-mode</b> power supplies may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|E
