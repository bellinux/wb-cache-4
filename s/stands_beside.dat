5|$|As {{the singer}} walks through a forest, {{the father is}} shown resorting to {{drinking}} in grief. A funeral scene follows, showing the girl walking up to her mother's wake. When she sees her mother's lips sealed with thread, she runs away from the wake. Madonna walks through a house, where shadows show the girl being scolded and shouted at by the father. Ultimately she walks to the graveyard and <b>stands</b> <b>beside</b> an old man, implying that she herself is the little girl portrayed. The video ends with the little girl dancing {{in front of her}} mother's grave as snow falls around her.|$|E
5|$|The Emirates Stadium {{is served}} {{by a number of}} London Underground {{stations}} and bus routes. Arsenal tube station is the closest for the northern portion of the stadium, with Highbury & Islington tube station servicing the southern end. While Holloway Road tube station is the closest to the southern portion, it is entry-only before matches and exit-only afterwards to prevent overcrowding. Drayton Park station, adjacent to the Clock End Bridge is shut on matchdays as the rail services to this station do not operate at weekends nor after 10pm. £7.6 million was set aside in the planning permission for upgrading Drayton Park and Holloway Road; however Transport for London decided not to upgrade either station, in favour of improvement works at the interchanges at Highbury & Islington and Finsbury Park, both of which are served by Underground and National Rail services and are approximately a ten-minute walk away. The Emirates Stadium is the only football stadium that <b>stands</b> <b>beside</b> the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh and is just over 2 miles from London King's Cross.|$|E

25|$|Professor Toy {{designed}} a modern Nave while retaining the ambience and architectural {{values of the}} older Chancel. He combined two very different architectural styles, incorporating the existing brick & reinforced concrete neo-Gothic Chancel, with the new Nave, a contemporary design which has large areas of glass and a timber ceiling. The line of the Nave roof reflects that of St Mary's Church which <b>stands</b> <b>beside</b> it.|$|E
25|$|For births, deaths, and {{fertility}} rates, the Nauru Bureau of Statistics was used. For population, the United States Census Bureau's mid-year estimated were used. If a cell is shaded light green and a dagger <b>stands</b> <b>beside</b> a number, it indicates the estimate from The World Factbook. In 2013, {{the number of}} births (366) and birth rate (38.8) was the second-highest during this period. In 2011, the total fertility rate of 4.2 was the highest since 1992 (4.5). Since 2009, {{there has been a}} natural change of at least 200 inhabitants—the first since the reparations of the population in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Two {{additional}} works cited by scholars as important precedents for Le déjeuner sur l'herbe are Pastoral Concert (c. 1510, The Louvre) and The Tempest (Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice), {{both of which}} are attributed variously to Italian Renaissance masters Giorgione or Titian. The Tempest is an enigmatic painting featuring a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting. The man is standing to the left and gazing to the side, apparently at the woman, who is seated and breastfeeding a baby; {{the relationship between the two}} figures is unclear. In Pastoral Concert, two clothed men and a nude woman are seated on the grass, engaged in music making, while a second nude woman <b>stands</b> <b>beside</b> them.|$|E
25|$|The camera {{manages to}} capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, {{flickering}} lights, and doors moving on their own. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, worsening the situation. During the thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches {{and there is}} a loud thud, causing the entire house to vibrate. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a Ouija board. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, <b>stands</b> <b>beside</b> the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.|$|E
500|$|The name of {{the town}} is derived from [...] "Wixan's Bridge", which was sited {{near the bottom of}} Oxford Road where a modern road bridge now <b>stands,</b> <b>beside</b> the Swan and Bottle public house. The Wixan were a 7th-century Saxon tribe from Lincolnshire who also began to settle in what became Middlesex. Anglo-Saxons began to settle and farm in the area of Uxbridge in the 5th century, {{clearing}} the dense woodland and remaining there for around 500 years. Two other places in Middlesex bore the {{name of the}} Wixan: Uxendon ("Wixan's Hill"), a name now preserved only in the street names of Uxendon Hill and Crescent in Harrow, and Waxlow ("Wixan's Wood") near Southall.|$|E

500|$|The {{air raids}} became {{intolerable}} to Manning, and she soon {{moved back to}} Cairo, where {{in the winter of}} 1941 she became press attaché at the United States Legation. In her spare time, she worked on Guests at the Marriage, an unpublished prototype for The Balkan Trilogy, as well as short stories and poetry, some of which she sent to Stevie Smith in the hope of getting them published. Over the years, Stevie had brooded over Manning's desertion of their friendship to marry Reggie, and around this time her jealousy took an overt form; in 1942 she wrote a poem entitled [...] "Murder", in which a man <b>stands</b> <b>beside</b> a grave and admits, [...] "My hand brought Reggie Smith to this strait bed – / Well, fare his soul well, fear not I the dead". In subsequent reprintings, the name [...] "Reggie Smith" [...] was replaced by [...] "Filmer Smith", veiling the allusion, but Manning found out and was furious.|$|E

2500|$|A {{consistent}} private patron over {{a period}} of many years was Sir William Paston, who was modernizing his Elizabethan seat at Oxnead, Norfolk. Paston commissioned from Stone the monument to his mother (died 1629) in the church at Paston, the family's ancient seat; in Stone's note-book, the price came to £340, and Stone remarks that in setting it up he was [...] "very extreordenerly entertayned thar" [...] by the genial Paston. The simpler monument by Stone of Sir Edmund Paston (died 1633), without the effigy and achievement of arms, <b>stands</b> <b>beside</b> his wife's.|$|E
2500|$|... miwa {{felt that}} [...] "Don't Cry Anymore" [...] was less {{indicative}} of her personality than the B-sides of the single. miwa describes the B-side [...] "Megurogawa" [...] as a [...] "comfortable and tender" [...] song, {{that feels like}} her starting point from where she started to make music. It describes somebody yearning to tell a boy about her feelings for him, as she <b>stands</b> <b>beside</b> Meguro River in Tokyo, in spring with cherry blossoms lining the river. [...] "Wake Up, Break Out!" [...] was written in her first year at high school, and she performed this often at live houses. She believes the song has {{the feeling of a}} live performance, since she recorded it with the same band as she did for [...] "Don't Cry Anymore." ...|$|E
