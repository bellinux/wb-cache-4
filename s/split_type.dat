2500|$|The E.117 of 1937 {{had major}} alterations. [...] The wing {{was the same}} span {{as that of the}} E.114 but was given a {{straight}} taper, resulting in a small (3.3%) decrease in area. For the first time flaps (of the <b>split</b> <b>type)</b> were fitted. The wing remained wooden but a steel framed, fabric covered fuselage was used and the fin and elevator were similarly constructed. [...] The new fuselage construction allowed the E.117 to have cabin doors for the first time, as well as a more generous interior. It had cantilever undercarriage legs, with wheels in fairings and a tailwheel in place of the skid used by most of the E.114s and E.115, though one of the only two E.117s built flew for a time with a tricycle undercarriage, its mainlegs moved rearwards and with a faired nosewheel assembly.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new type system based {{on the notion of}} <b>Split</b> <b>types.</b> In this system, every method is {{assigned}} two types, namely, an update type and a select type. We show that the system of <b>Split</b> <b>types</b> is strictly more powerful than the system of recursive types and that type inference remains decidable and feasible. We include a number of interesting examples not typable with recursive types that are typable with <b>Split</b> <b>types.</b> In particular, we demonstrate that the subtyping relation needed to encode the #-calculus into the Abadi and Cardelli's #-calculus holds. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm that infers <b>Split</b> <b>types</b> and show that it is sound and complete with respect to the type system. We conclude our presentation by relating the <b>typing</b> power of <b>Split</b> <b>types</b> to the typing power of other systems, such as, the system of recursive types with variance annotations and the system of Self types...|$|R

We also give a criterion to determine the <b>splitting</b> <b>type</b> in terms of the configuration of the nodes and tangent points.

5000|$|The {{fundamental}} {{application of}} both types is the same, {{which is to}} mount a bearing safely enabling its outer ring to be stationary while allowing rotation of the inner ring. The housing is bolted to a foundation through {{the holes in the}} base. Bearing housings may be either <b>split</b> <b>type</b> or solid type. <b>Split</b> <b>type</b> housings are usually two-piece housings where the cap and base may be detached, while others may be single-piece housings. Various sealing arrangements may be provided to prevent dust and other contaminants from entering the housing. Thus the housing provides a clean environment for the environmentally sensitive bearing to rotate free from contaminants while also retaining lubrication, either oil or grease, hence increasing its performance and duty cycle.|$|E

50|$|The Mk 1 used a 1500 cc MGA or Riley 1.5 litre {{engine in}} a ladder chassis with Elva {{designed}} independent front suspension. The engine was set well {{back in the}} chassis to help weight distribution, which produced good handling but encroached on the cockpit making the car a little cramped. The chassis carried lightweight 2-seater open glassfibre bodywork. It was produced as a complete car for the US and European market and available in kit form for the UK market. After about 50 cars were made it was upgraded to the Mk II which was the same car but fitted with a proprietary curved glass windscreen, replacing the original flat-glass <b>split</b> <b>type,</b> and the larger 1600 cc MGA engine. Approximately 400 of the Mk I and II were made.|$|E

The nose and the upper decking were covered with detachable steel panels; fabric covering was used elsewhere. Fuel and engine oil tanks were in the fuselage. The E-40 was powered by a four-cylinder 63/71 kW (85/95 hp) Walter Minor air-cooled, inverted piston engine driving a two-blade propeller. It had a <b>split</b> <b>type</b> main undercarriage with wheels on V-form legs mounted just forward of the wing leading edge. Rubber-in-compression spring units were mounted in extended hubs; the pistons of these units were held in place on a shallow, inverted V strut, itself attached to the lower fuselage via a steel tube pyramid. The tailwheel castored and had rubber springing within the rear fuselage.|$|E

40|$|From {{the work}} of Lian, Liu, and Yau on "Mirror Principle", in the {{explicit}} computation of the Euler data Q={Q_ 0, Q_ 1, [...] . } for an equivariant concavex bundle E over a toric manifold, there are two places {{the structure of the}} bundle comes into play: (1) the multiplicative characteric class Q_ 0 of V one starts with, and (2) the <b>splitting</b> <b>type</b> of E. Equivariant bundles over a toric manifold has been classified by Kaneyama, using data related to the linearization of the toric action on the base toric manifold. In this article, we relate the <b>splitting</b> <b>type</b> of E to the classifying data of Kaneyama. From these relations, we compute the <b>splitting</b> <b>type</b> of a couple of nonsplittable equivariant vector bundles over toric manifolds that may be of interest to string theory and mirror symmetry.

50|$|Like most {{engines of}} the era, the OX-5's {{high-temperature}} areas were built mostly of cast iron, using individual cylinders bolted {{to a single}} aluminum crankcase, wrapped in a cooling jacket made of a nickel-copper alloy. Later versions used a brazed-on steel jacket instead. Cylinder heads were also attached to the crankcase, using X-shaped tie-downs {{on the top of}} the head attached to the block via four long bolts. Fuel was carbureted near the rear of the engine, then piped to the cylinders via two T-shaped pipes, the cylinders being arranged so the intake ports of any two in a bank were near each other. The cylinders had one intake and one exhaust valve, each operated by a pushrod from a camshaft running between the banks. This arrangement caused the outer exhaust valves to have a rather long rocker arm. The pushrods were arranged one inside the other, the exhaust valve rod being on the inside and the intake valve rod a tube around it. The aluminum camshaft bearings were a <b>split</b> <b>type</b> bolted together and held in place by lock screws. The pistons were cast aluminum.|$|E

30|$|The HEVC design {{follows the}} classic block-based hybrid video coding approach. A picture is {{partitioned}} into {{a sequence of}} CTUs, which are analogous to macroblocks in previous standards. A CTU may contain only one CU, or may be split into four equal size CUs. In a recursive manner, a CU has a size of 2 N × 2 N (N = 8, 16, 32) can be further split into four smaller units of equal size. The block partition structure of a CTU is quadtree-like. A CU, which is the leaf node of the quadtree, specifies a region sharing the same prediction mode, i.e., intra or inter. The CU consists of a luma coding block (CB) and the corresponding chroma CBs and related syntax elements. Further, a CU can be split into one, two, or four PUs, and a PU defines a region sharing the same prediction information. For intra coded CUs, two possible PU <b>splitting</b> <b>types</b> are supported. For inter coded CUs, eight <b>splitting</b> <b>types</b> are defined. And for skipped CUs, only one PU <b>splitting</b> <b>type</b> (i.e., {{the same size as}} the CU) is allowed (Kim et al. 2012). After prediction and compensation, a nested quadtree partitions a CU residual into transform units, each of which defines a region sharing the same transformation.|$|R

In a typical <b>split</b> <b>type,</b> there was no remarkable swirling flow within a sub-channel and the lateral flow was vigorous in the gaps.
