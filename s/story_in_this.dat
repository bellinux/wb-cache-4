5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page <b>story.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E

25|$|I {{wanted to}} make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E

[...] This vignette offers a snapshot into life just north of the United States-Mexico border for two girls who are presumably of Mexican descent. Lucy's home is portrayed as a low-income, Mexican-American family. [...] Her mother is overworked and busy with many children while her father is rarely around. [...] However, the story focuses on the freedom that the girls have when no one of authority is watching; for example, waving at strangers, jumping on mattresses, scratching mosquito bites, picking scabs, and somersaulting in dresses.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{addition}} of a Christmas special in the production schedule, an episode had to be [...] "double banked" [...] with another <b>story</b> (<b>in</b> <b>this</b> case [...] "The Impossible Planet" [...] and [...] "The Satan Pit") for production to finish on time. With [...] "Love & Monsters", Davies was able to tell a story from a different character's point of view to allow for only a small appearance by Tennant and Piper. The [...] "Doctor-lite" [...] and [...] "companion-lite" [...] structure has since continued in the programme. The Abzorbaloff was also incorporated into the episode by necessity, as it was the winner of a Blue Peter children's competition to design a Doctor Who monster. [...] "Love & Monsters" [...] was watched by 6.66 million viewers in the United Kingdom and was met with divisive reception by critics and fans. Some praised the complexities of the script, while others felt it was a parody or strayed into offensive humour. Kay and the Abzorbaloff also attracted divided opinions.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said the}} episode [...] "had plenty of standout bits" [...] {{but that it}} [...] "represented a major flaw" [...] and [...] "perhaps in the program as a whole", citing that [...] "here {{seems to be more}} of an emphasis on comedic 'bits' rather than comedic 'situations,' which doesn't bode well for a situation comedy." [...] He explained that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] in particular [...] "felt very disjointed, bouncing between jokes more than storylines. It even opened with a Jenna surprise-birthday segment that was funny for what it was, but had {{absolutely nothing to do with}} the rest of the show." [...] Canning gave the episode a 7.0 out 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich liked that Josh had a <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode, and said that his impression of Tracy was [...] "pretty good".

500|$|Initially, Todd, as {{described}} by Hayward, was written as [...] "unequivocally bad: sullen, remorseless, charmless". [...] As Todd's popularity grew with the audience, mostly due to Howarth's abilities to portray Todd {{as more than a}} one-dimensional rapist, Malone and executive producer Susan Bedsow Horgan chose the controversial option of redeeming Todd rather than killing him off or permanently sending him to prison, which is what soap operas had usually done with irredeemable rapists in the past. The writers began to redeem Todd, or change him so that he could be incorporated into the show, in the spring of 1994, a year after the rape. Hayward states that it required [...] "a whole arsenal of symbolic weaponry," [...] something that had never happened in soap operas before. Malone was intrigued by crafting the <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way, and saw it as the spiritual journey of a man who wanted forgiveness for his past misdeeds.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN said that [...] "Family Guy {{has never really}} done anything particularly special for the last episode of any season [...] and despite the obvious efforts to increase the animation quality and try to tell a complete <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode, it didn't {{turn out to be}} the winning effort that will keep fans eagerly awaiting the show's return next season". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a D, and called it an [...] "unfortunate and unfunny flashback [...] with lots of incest gags [...] was genuinely queasy-making, but not in a way that made anyone laugh from the shock of recognition or anything like that", but said that Family Guy can be [...] "damn funny when it wants to be", referring to the Fox promos that take up the bottom quarter of the screen. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a positive review, stating: [...] "Good fun story, good fun jokes", but said that the end [...] "felt flat" [...] because of the Revenge of the Nerds music sequence.|$|E
500|$|Phantom Hourglass {{introduces}} the game mechanic {{of a large}} dungeon central to the game's <b>story,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case the Temple of the Ocean King. Link visits the Temple multiple times {{during the course of}} the game's story, in order to obtain sea charts that allow him to sail to other parts of the ocean. Throughout the game, the Temple has a curse placed on it that drains Link's life whenever he is inside, but upon obtaining the Phantom Hourglass, Link is able to explore the Temple without being affected by the curse for a limited amount of time. In addition to the curse, Link must contend with Phantoms, a type of enemy exclusive to the Temple. Phantoms are invincible for the most part, necessitating the use of stealth in order to get past them. [...] "Safe zones" [...] are scattered throughout the Temple, and allow Link to avoid both the Phantoms and the Temple's curse. As Link progresses through the game, he is able to access deeper levels of the Temple and stay inside for longer. The Temple, including the puzzles within, will reset whenever Link leaves, but as he obtains new items, he can unlock new routes and shortcuts that enable him to travel through the Temple quicker.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} lack of Master Chief as a main character, similar to the {{response}} to The Halo Graphic Novel; Schedeen said that [...] "Master Chief is barely a guest star in his own book", {{and that he was}} reduced to blasting aliens for much of the series. Schedeen felt that {{there was a lack of}} connections between the Ruwan plot and the Master Chief's adventures, which was never satisfactorily resolved. The comic's focus on Ruwan and Myra's subplot was also seen as a major fault: Comics Bulletin's Geoff Collins, in a review of the second issue, said that [...] "as a comic book fan I’m interested , but the Halo fans I know could [...] care less about them. And the <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> issue centers around them." [...] Schedeen was surprised to find that he only began to care about them in the final issue. The many delays in publishing were a frequent point of frustration as well. Schedeen summed up his reviews by saying that he was hopeful the production teams behind the upcoming Halo books [...] "will learn from the mistakes made here and craft stories that can consistently capture what makes Halo fun. At the very least, let's hope we don't have to wait a year between issues anymore".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over {{the execution of the}} prostitution <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode, asking, [...] "If you buy that the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan would feel the same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme." [...] Sepinwall described the story as [...] "something that so fundamentally changes the way you view a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, {{that it has to be}} just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then." [...] Todd VanDerWerff opined that,"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: No matter what we try to do to make them equal, men are always going to turn women into objects on some level, because that’s just how men perceive them." [...] VanDerWerff compared it to the [...] "Employee of the Month" [...] episode of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call [...] "The Other Woman" [...] a stronger episode.|$|E
500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E

500|$|Several of Creangă's {{characteristic}} novellas are {{infused with}} themes from Christian mythology, fictionalizing God, Saint Peter {{and the army}} of devils, most often with the comedic intent of showing such personages behaving like regular people. A defining <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> series is [...] "Dănilă Prepeleac", whose eponymous peasant hero is characterized by what Șerban Anghelescu calls [...] "idiocy serving to initiate", or, according to Gabriela Ursachi, [...] "complete, and therefore sublime, stupidity." [...] The {{first part of the}} story shows Dănilă exchanging his oxen for an empty bag—a set of dialogues which, George Călinescu argued, is almost exactly like a comedy play. In what was described as a complete reversal in characterization, the hero uses intelligence and ruse to trick and frighten several devils. Contrarily, [...] "Stan Pățitul" [...] shows its hero fraternizing with a lesser demon. Following the opening episode, in which the latter accidentally eats a bit of mămăligă dedicated by Stan to those who honor God, Satan himself condemns his subordinate to service the peasant. Călinescu highlights the naturalness of exchanges between the two protagonists, the latter of whom assumes the endearing form of a frail boy, Chirică, who ends up moving in with Stan and entering his service. The writing was also noted for other realistic elements alluding to everyday life, such as the overtly colloquial exchange between Chirică and Satan, or the episodes in which the young devil helps Stan woo a peasant woman. Although relatively young, Stan himself is referred to as stătut ("frowzy" [...] or [...] "lacking in freshness"), and the wording reflects rural attitudes about men who fail to marry during a certain age interval. Toward the end, the story focuses on a corrupt old woman who tries to trick Stan's new wife into committing adultery, but fails and is banished to the remotest area of Hell. Viewed by Călinescu as Creangă's [...] "most original manner of dealing with the fabulous", and paralleled by him with Caragiale's Kir Ianulea on account of its realist approach to the supernatural, [...] "Stan Pățitul" [...] is, according to Vianu, untraceable in its inspiration: [...] " [...] folk origin could not be identified, but it is not dismissible".|$|E
