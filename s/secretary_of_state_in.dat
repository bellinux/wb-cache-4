5|$|Former North Carolina Senator Elizabeth Dole is {{the first}} woman to have served in two {{different}} Cabinet positions in two different administrations. She was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as Secretary of Transportation in 1983, and was the Secretary of Labor during the tenure of George H. W. Bush—Reagan's successor. Czechoslovakia-born Madeleine Albright became the first foreign-born woman to serve in the Cabinet when she was appointed <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>in</b> 1997. Her appointment also made her the highest-ranking female Cabinet member at that time. Condoleezza Rice was appointed <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>in</b> 2005, and thus became the highest-ranking woman in the United States presidential line of succession in history. In 2006, Nancy Pelosi replaced Rice as the highest-ranking woman in line when she was elected Speaker of the House.|$|E

Leaving office after Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements.|$|E
5|$|It {{was clear}} that Harrison would not be re-nominated unanimously. Many of Harrison's detractors persisted in pushing for an {{incapacitated}} Blaine, though {{he announced that he}} was not a candidate in February 1892.

5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{concepts}} had become U.S. policy, Kennan began {{to criticize the}} foreign policies that he had seemingly helped begin.

His proposals were discounted by the Truman administration and Kennan's influence was marginalized, particularly after Dean Acheson was appointed <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>in</b> 1949. Soon thereafter, U.S. Cold War strategy assumed a more assertive and militaristic quality, causing Kennan to lament about what he believed was an abrogation of his previous assessments.|$|E

5|$|The curial {{office of}} Cardinal <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>in</b> many ways {{evolved from the}} roles {{formerly}} filled by cardinal-nephews. From 1644 to 1692, {{the power of the}} Cardinal Secretary of State was essentially inversely proportional to that of the Cardinal Nephew, to whom the Secretariat was subordinate. During some pontificates, for example that of Pope Pius V (1566–1572) and his nephew Michele Bonelli, the cardinal-nephew and secretary of state were one and the same.|$|E

A third-party candidate, Libertarian Eric Sundwall, was initially included in the race, but later removed from the ballot.|$|E
5|$|The music {{industry}} {{was in a}} period of transition at the time the song was published as new technologies allowed music to be recorded. U.S. copyright laws at the time did not allow music composers to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders or music rolls for player pianos. Edison Records paid popular singers like Harry Macdonough to sing the songs and then sold the recordings without paying any royalties to the composer or publisher of the music. Dresser joined with other prominent composers to seek a change in U.S. copyright laws. In 1902 Dresser met with U.S. senators and the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>in</b> Washington, D.C.
