40|$|Chain in {{both its}} forms - common (or stud-less) and <b>stud-link</b> - has many {{engineering}} applications. It {{is widely used}} as a component in the moorings of offshore floating systems, where its ruggedness and corrosion resistance make it an attractive choice. Chain exhibits some interesting behaviour in that when straight and subject to an axial load it does not twist or generate any torque, but if twisted or loaded when in a twisted condition it behaves in a highly non-linear manner, with the torque dependent upon the level of twist and axial load. Clearly {{an understanding of the}} way in which chains may behave and interact with other mooring components (such as wire rope, which also exhibits coupling between axial load and generated torque) when they are in service is essential. However, the sizes of chain that are in use in offshore moorings (typical bar diameters are 75 mm and greater) are too large to allow easy testing. This paper, which is in two parts, aims to address the issues and considerations relevant to torque in mooring chain. The first part introduces a frictionless theory that predicts the resultant torques and 'lift' in the links as non-dimensionalized functions of the angle of twist. Fortran code is presented in an Appendix, which allows the reader to make use of the analysis. The second part of the paper presents results from experimental work on both stud-less (41 mm) and <b>stud-link</b> (20. 5 and 56 mm) chains. Torsional data are presented in both 'constant twist' and 'constant load' forms, as well as considering the lift between the links...|$|E
40|$|Chain is a {{commonly}} used component in offshore moorings where its ruggedness and corrosion resistance {{make it an}} attractive choice. Another attractive property is that a straight chain is inherently torque balanced. Having said this, if a chain is loaded in a twisted condition, or twisted when under load, it exhibits highly non-linear torsional behaviour. The consequences of this behaviour can cause handling difficulties or may compromise {{the integrity of the}} mooring system, and care must be taken to avoid problems for both the chain and any components to which it is connected. Even with knowledge of the potential problems, there will always be occasions where, despite the utmost care, twist is unavoidable. Thus {{it is important for the}} engineer to be able to determine the effects. A frictionless theory has been developed in Part 1 of the paper that may be used to predict the resultant torques and movement or 'lift' in the links as non-dimensional functions of the angle of twist. The present part of the paper describes a series of experiments undertaken on both studless and <b>stud-link</b> chain to allow comparison of this theoretical model with experimental data. Results are presented for the torsional response and link lift for 'constant twist' and 'constant load' type tests on chains of three different link sizes...|$|E
