50|$|Scrub has {{developed}} {{in an area}} of the site which supports a range of species such as hawthorn, blackthorn, bramble, dog's mercury, cuckoo-pint, hart's-tongue fern and primrose. The area supports a rarity being <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore.</b>|$|E
50|$|The site {{is mostly}} {{woodland}} and managed for timber production. There are {{remnants of the}} original semi-natural woodland (beech and ash with wild cherry and yew). There are nationally restricted plants which include fingered sedge, angular Solomon's seal, <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore</b> and lily-of-the-valley.|$|E
50|$|The site {{is rich in}} wild flowers. The {{limestone}} grassland supports early purple orchid, {{fragrant orchid}} and pyramidal orchids, along with autumn gentian, vervain, yellow-wort and clustered bellflower. Wild columbine may {{also be seen as}} well as wild liquorice, adder's-tongue, <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore</b> and the small teasel.|$|E
50|$|Yeasts {{colonise}} the nectaries of <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore</b> {{and their}} presence {{has been found}} to raise the temperature of the flower, which may aid in attracting pollinators to the flower by increasing the evaporation of volatile organic compounds. It was the first species in which this effect was discovered.|$|E
50|$|Helleborus foetidus, known {{variously}} as <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore</b> , dungwort, setterwort and bear's foot, is {{a species}} of flowering plant in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae, native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, Greece and Asia Minor. It is found wild {{in many parts of}} England, especially on limestone soil.|$|E
50|$|Ground-layer {{plants are}} {{dominated}} by bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), bramble (Rubus fruticosus), common bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), great wood-rush (Luzula sylvatica). Scarce and locally uncommon plants that {{are found in the}} gorge are narrow-leaved bittercress (Cardamine impatiens), <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore</b> (Helleborus foetidus), wood barley (Hordelymus europaeus) and wood fescue (Festuca altissima).|$|E
50|$|On deeper soils in the {{northern}} part and in more level areas, hazel and ash coppice occurs. Here oak is more abundant, and crab apple can be found. Diligent search may yield butcher's-broom and green hellebore, whilst at the southern end, is <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore.</b> There is also a fine colony of stinking iris, its orange seeds persisting through the winter.|$|E
50|$|Spring flowers include woodruff, primrose, bluebell, wood anemone, yellow {{archangel}} and {{the common}} dog-violet. Summer flowers include broad-leaved helleborine, <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore,</b> nettle-leaved bellflower. Grasses include wood barley (Hordelymus europaeus) and wood millet. Ferns are recorded in the quarry areas, such as hart's-tongue and soft shield-fern. Quaking-grass and glaucous sedge grow at the north edge of the wood, encroaching from the adjacent pasture. The stream area supports blue water-speedwell, brooklime and alternate-leaved golden-saxifrage.|$|E
50|$|A {{population}} of the nationally scarce plant <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore</b> (Helleborus foetidus) grows on scree slopes in the combe, near Cleeve Toot; it is native at this site. Limestone fern (Gymnocarpum robertianum), another nationally scarce plant, is also found here on limestone scree. Other flowers include the autumn gentian, autumn ladies'-tresses and yellow-wort. The site also supports a varied collection of butterflies, with over 30 species recorded. These include grizzled and dingy skippers, brown argus and green hairstreak.|$|E
50|$|The Common {{is noted}} for its wild flowers, with {{thriving}} communities of yellow archangel (Galeobdolon luteum), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa). Spurge-laurel (Daphne laureola) is sparsely but widely distributed. The Common {{is also home to}} such interesting species as <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore</b> (Helleborus foetidus), green hellebore (H. viridis ssp. occidentalis), bird's nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), violet helleborine (Epipactis purpurata), the extreme rarity E. x schulzei (first British record here, 1931), and green-flowered helleborine (E. phyllanthes).|$|E
50|$|Other {{woodland}} species {{found in}} Grass Wood include Wild Strawberry (Fragaria vesca), Red Campion (Silene dioica), Wood Cranesbill (Geranium sylvaticum), Primrose (Primula vulgaris), Bugle (Ajuga reptans), St John's wort (Hypericum hirsutum), {{and a few}} Columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris) are found at woodland edges. There are scarce clumps of Stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and of <b>Stinking</b> <b>Hellebore</b> (Helleborus foetidus). The grassland species of Lady's-mantle (Alchemilla glabra), Great Burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis), Melancholy Thistle (Cirsium helenioides) and Goldilocks Buttercup (Ranunculus auricomus) are found in clearings.|$|E
50|$|A {{large part}} of the site is covered by broadleaved {{woodland}} with sessile oak, ash and sycamore among the dominant tree species. Notable plants in the woods include <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore,</b> green-flowered helleborine and wayfaring tree. There are also areas of calcareous grassland with plants such as bloody cranesbill and lesser meadow-rue. Much of the site lies on an escarpment of Carboniferous limestone and there are three cave systems: Ogof Hesp Alyn, Ogof Hen Ffynhonnau and Ogof Nadolig. Lead ore, zinc ore, limestone and calcite were formerly mined in the area.|$|E
50|$|Goblin Combe is a 52 ha {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) originally notified in 1999, with 9 ha being managed as {{a nature}} reserve by the Avon Wildlife Trust. A {{population of the}} nationally scarce plant <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore</b> (Helleborus foetidus) grows on scree slopes in the combe, near Cleeve Toot; it is native at this site. Limestone fern (Gymnocarpum robertianum), another nationally scarce plant, is also found here on limestone scree. Other flowers include the autumn gentian, autumn ladies'-tresses and yellow-wort. The site also supports a varied collection of butterflies, with over 30 species recorded. These include grizzled and dingy skippers, brown argus and green hairstreak.|$|E
50|$|Westridge Wood (unit 1) and Conygre Wood (unit 3) are the {{two main}} areas of ancient {{woodland}}, which are mostly beech. Ash and pedunculate oak are widespread, and other trees include field maple and locally small-leaved lime. Historically the woods were managed as coppice and old stools remain present. The woodland is now high forest with an understorey, and a rich flora which is characteristic of beech woods. Ground flora includes nettle-leaved bellflower, goldenrod, spurge laurel and tutsan. <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore</b> and wood barley (Hordelymus europaeus) may also be found. The site {{is one of only}} two United Kingdom sites for the nationally rare limestone woundwort which is found and monitored in Old London Road reserve (unit 2). It is also now reported present in Westridge Wood and Conygre Wood.|$|E
50|$|An Indian {{study of}} seven bee species and 9 plant species found 45 species from 16 genera {{colonise}} the nectaries {{of flowers and}} honey stomachs of bees. Most {{were members of the}} Candida genus; the most common species in honey stomachs was Dekkera intermedia and in flower nectaries, Candida blankii. Yeast colonising nectaries of the <b>stinking</b> <b>hellebore</b> have been found to raise the temperature of the flower, which may aid in attracting pollinators by increasing the evaporation of volatile organic compounds. A black yeast has been recorded as a partner in a complex relationship between ants, their mutualistic fungus, a fungal parasite of the fungus and a bacterium that kills the parasite. The yeast has a negative effect on the bacteria that normally produce antibiotics to kill the parasite, so may affect the ants' health by allowing the parasite to spread.|$|E
