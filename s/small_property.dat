The Board primarily concerned itself with slave control, except for one ordinance banning horse racing on city streets. Other ordinances created volunteer fire department companies, required the removal of dead animals from the town, and created a streets overseer who was able to order males to work on streets adjacent to their property. The town also enacted a <b>small</b> <b>property</b> tax and obtained some revenue from issuing business licenses.|$|E
25|$|Charles and Bartholomew Beale {{helped with}} {{work in the}} studio in their youth, where they painted draperies and sculpted ovals; these ovals were a {{critical}} piece in Mary Beale's head portraits. Young Charles Beale, the third son and named after his father, showed great talent in painting and went to study miniature painting on 5 March 1677. He enjoyed painting miniature sculptures from 1679 to 1688, when his eyesight started to fail him. From then on, he worked on full scale portraits. Bartholomew Beale, the second son, started with painting but instead turned to medicine. In 1680, he studied at Clare Hall, Cambridge and graduated MB in 1682.

25|$|In 1898, she {{enrolled}} {{for further}} graduate studies at Cornell University but fell seriously ill {{and had to}} drop out. During her recovery, she dreamt of building her own house and was encouraged by her friend, architect Bernard Maybeck, to sketch her ideas. After buying a <b>small</b> <b>property</b> near her beloved Blackberry Canyon in Berkeley with an inheritance, she hired an architect, William Knowles, to prepare the construction drawings. The House focuses on natural light and views of the San Francisco Bay. The home's exterior is clad with brown shingles as typical for First Bay Tradition houses. The interior featured local unpainted redwood paneling and built-in window seats that could be transformed into beds for visitors. In 1908 she added a studio on {{the upper part of}} the property which would later serve as her architectural office. For many years, Lillian Bridgman lived with her sister, Irene, a nurse, sometimes staying in the studio and renting out the front house to boarders.|$|E
25|$|Establishing {{a school}} in Oxford Street, Nicholson taught mathematics, architecture, {{surveying}} and building technology, and he continued to develop the centrolinead, in recognition of which he received the Gold Isis Medal and the sum of 20 shillings from the Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts in 1814, and a Silver Medal in 1815. In c. 1816 he sat for portrait artist James Green, the painting being donated to the National Portrait Gallery in London in 1961. The period between 1810 and 1829, during which Nicholson lived in London, was his most prolific as an author. During this time he published Mechanical Exercises (1812), The Builder and Workman's New Director (1822), and The Architectural Dictionary, in two volumes (1812 and 1819). This work was considered {{the most important of}} the numerous works that were to make his reputation as a national authority on building technology {{at a time when the}} building industry was changing rapidly under the influence of scientific research. In addition to practical books relating to building and architecture, Nicholson also wrote about purely scientific, and sometimes rather esoteric subjects. His Treatise on Practical Perspective (1815) included a discussion and full instructions on the use of the centrolinead, while his mathematical works included such titles as An Introduction to the Method of Increments (1817), Essays on the Combinatorial Analysis (1818), and The Rudiments of Algebra (1819). His Essay on Involution and Evolution (1820) earned him the commendation of the Académie des Sciences in Paris. In 1826, at the age of 61, Nicholson visited France and, by the time of his return, had gained sufficient familiarity with the language to be able to translate books on various mathematical subjects. The following year, he began work on an ambitious project entitled The School of Architecture and Engineering, intending to complete it in 12 affordable volumes, costing just 1s 6d each, but he was forced to abandon the work when the publisher, J. and C. Adlard of London was declared bankrupt and only five volumes were ever produced, this being the only project he left unfinished. Suffering a heavy financial loss himself, and in order to economise, Nicholson left London for Morpeth in Northumberland in 1829, where he lived in a <b>small</b> <b>property</b> left to him by a relative. In the meantime, he published A Popular and Practical Treatise on Masonry and Stone-cutting (1828), in which he solved the problem of cutting stones to the pecise shapes required for the construction of a strong skew arch and presented his solution in a form that was useful to other engineers and stonemasons, enabling the stones to be prepared from s at the quarry in advance of the actual construction of the bridge.|$|E

According to his own account, Hubbard spent much of his time prospecting unsuccessfully for gold. Towards the end of his stay on Puerto Rico he appears to have done some work for a Washington, D.C. firm called West Indies Minerals Incorporated, accompanying a surveyor in an investigation of a <b>small</b> <b>property</b> near the town of Luquillo, Puerto Rico.

500|$|In 1864 the International Workingmen's Association (sometimes {{called the}} [...] "First International") united diverse revolutionary {{currents}} including French followers of Proudhon, Blanquists, Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and social democrats. Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation. Karl Marx became a leading {{figure in the}} International {{and a member of}} its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the mutualists, opposed Marx's state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and <b>small</b> <b>property</b> holdings. Woodcock also reports that the American individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and William B. Greene had been members of the First International. In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom (LPF), Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF). They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow {{of the state and the}} collectivisation of property.|$|E

500|$|Following their oath, the {{plotters}} left London {{and returned}} to their homes. [...] The adjournment of Parliament gave them, they thought, until February 1605 to finalise their plans. [...] On 9June, Percy's patron, the Earl of Northumberland, appointed him to the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms, a mounted troop of 50bodyguards to the King. This role gave Percy reason to seek a base in London, and a <b>small</b> <b>property</b> near the Prince's Chamber owned by Henry Ferrers, a tenant of John Whynniard, was chosen. [...] Percy arranged {{for the use of}} the house through Northumberland's agents, Dudley Carleton and John Hippisley. [...] Fawkes, using the pseudonym [...] "John Johnson", took charge of the building, posing as Percy's servant. [...] The building was occupied by Scottish commissioners appointed by the King to consider his plans for the unification of England and Scotland, so the plotters hired Catesby's lodgings in Lambeth, on the opposite bank of the Thames, from where their stored gunpowder and other supplies could be conveniently rowed across each night. [...] Meanwhile, King James continued with his policies against the Catholics, and Parliament pushed through anti-Catholic legislation, until its adjournment on 7July.|$|E
500|$|As a {{professional}} gambler he was undoubtedly a skilled player, once rated amongst the world's top ten backgammon competitors. He won the StJames's Club tournament and was Champion of the West Coast of America. He gained the moniker [...] "Lucky" [...] Lucan, but his losses easily outweighed his winnings, and in reality he {{was anything but}} lucky. He had interests in thoroughbred horses; in 1968 he paid more in race entry fees than he received in winnings. Despite some arguments over money, his wife remained largely ignorant of his losses, retaining the use of accounts at Savile Row tailors and various Knightsbridge shops. Following the births of George (1967) and Camilla (1970), she suffered post-natal depression. Lucan became increasingly involved in her mental well-being, and in 1971 took her for treatment at a psychiatric clinic in Hampstead, where she refused to be admitted. Instead, she agreed to home visits from a psychiatrist and a course of anti-depressants. In July 1972 the family holidayed in Monte Carlo, but Veronica quickly returned to England, leaving Lucan with their two elder children. The combined pressures of maintaining their finances, paying for Lucan's gambling addiction and Veronica's weakened mental condition took their toll on the marriage; two weeks after a strained family Christmas in 1972, Lucan moved into a <b>small</b> <b>property</b> in Eaton Row.|$|E
