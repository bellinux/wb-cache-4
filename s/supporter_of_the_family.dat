50|$|My father's {{family came}} from Tuxedo Park, and they {{offered to take}} us kids and pay for our education, on the {{condition}} that Mama never see us again. Mama was an orphan who had come here from London, but so far as my father’s family was concerned, she was strictly from the gutter. I have to give Mama credit—she refused to give us up… So I became the <b>supporter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> and I had to take my father’s place in many, many ways. I was expected to make up for everything that had ever gone wrong in Mama’s life. She became obsessed with me, pouring out her pent-up love—her alleged love—on me, and it's been heavy on my shoulders ever since. Mama still thinks I owe everything to her.|$|E
50|$|On 15 March 1451, Malory and 19 {{others were}} ordered to be arrested. Nothing came of this and, in the {{following}} months, Malory and his cohorts allegedly committed a series of crimes, especially violent robberies, rising past 100. At one point, {{he was arrested and}} imprisoned in Maxstoke Castle, but he escaped, swam the moat, and returned to Newbold Revel. Most of these crimes, if they occurred, seem to have been targeted at the property and followers of the Duke of Buckingham. Malory was a <b>supporter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> of Buckingham's former rival, the Duke of Warwick, so {{there may have been a}} political motive behind either Malory's attacks (assuming that he committed them) or Buckingham and others bringing charges against him. It is possible that Malory's enemies tried to slander him, and there is evidence that the Duke of Buckingham was Malory's long-time enemy.|$|E
40|$|Findings in this ethnographic {{study of}} the Philadelphia Lao-American {{community}} echo sociological research (Pessar 1995; Foner 1998, 1999; Zhou and Nordquist 1994) which documents gender identity shifts in immigrant families as women gain greater autonomy and equality in the household. While these changes may have profound effects on women 2 ̆ 7 s access to second language resources, this connection has received little research attention {{in the field of}} sociolinguistics. ^ This study examines the experiences of Lao women in an urban, working class community, investigating the interplay between gender identity shifts and second language socialization. Research findings concern three main themes: changing gender identities in the U. S.; women 2 ̆ 7 s access to English language socialization; and the formation of language ideologies. Lao women have gained greater economic independence and decision-making power within the family as a result of access to wage labor and knowledge of American cultural attitudes, laws and public benefits. English acquisition is a significant avenue through which women gain access to information about American culture and available resources. ^ Concerning the second research finding regarding women 2 ̆ 7 s access to second language socialization, several researchers (Goldstein 2001; Holmes 1999; and Rockhill 1993) have demonstrated that immigrant women have limited access to English language socialization, while men have greater opportunities for naturalistic second language acquisition through workforce participation. In this working class Lao-American community, however, neither male nor female workers report significant use of English, as their coworkers are primarily other Southeast-Asian refugees. However, domestic language events connected to care of children and the home, tasks more frequently performed by women, often required more contact with native English speakers. ^ The third research finding demonstrates how changing gender identities contribute to the formation of language ideologies. While Lao women experience expanded opportunities for enacting their gendered identities in the U. S., Lao men often experience a narrowing of opportunities, having lost traditional sources of power and the ability to be the sole economic <b>supporter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> The development of language ideologies, specifically the belief that men are more proficient English speakers than women, play an important part in men 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to mitigate this loss of status. ...|$|E
