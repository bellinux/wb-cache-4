40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{shed light on}} the {{fundamental}} actuation capabilities of multi-rotors, such as force-moment decoupling and ability to robustly fly still in place after the loss of propellers. These two actuation properties are formalized through the definition of some necessary algebraic conditions on the control force and control moment input matrices of generically tilted multi-rotors. Standard quadrotors are not able to robustly fly still at a constant spot after the loss of a propeller. The increased number of actuators of a hexarotor does not always help to overcome this limitation. To deeply understand this counterintuitive result, we apply the developed theory on the analysis of fail-safe robustness of hexarotor platforms, and clarify the role of the tilt angles and locations of the propellers in the vehicle. We show that standard star-shaped hexarotors are unable of robust <b>static</b> <b>hovering</b> after a propeller failure, while both the tilted star-shaped hexarotor and the Y-shaped hexarotor possess this important property. The analysis is validated with both simulation and experimental results testing the control of six-rotor vehicles subject to rotor loss...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} use of orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) -multiplexing to {{increase}} the capacity of free-space data transmission to moving platforms, with an added potential benefit of decreasing the probability of data intercept. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize the performance of an OAM-multiplexed, free-space optical (FSO) communications link between a ground station and a moving unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV). We achieve a total capacity of 80 Gbit/s up to 100 -m-roundtrip link by multiplexing 2 OAM beams, each carrying a 40 -Gbit/s quadrature-phase-shift-keying (QPSK) signal. Moreover, we investigate for <b>static,</b> <b>hovering,</b> and moving conditions the effects of channel impairments, including: tracking errors, propeller-induced airflows, power loss, intermodal crosstalk, and system bit error rate (BER). We find the following: (a) when the UAV hovers in the air, the power on the desired mode fluctuates by 2. 1 dB, while the crosstalk to the other mode is - 19 dB below the power on the desired mode; and (b) when the UAV moves in the air, the power fluctuation on the desired mode increases to 4. 3 dB and the crosstalk to the other mode increases to - 10 dB. Furthermore, the channel crosstalk decreases {{with an increase in}} OAM mode spacing.

40|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} ground static tests of a tenth scale powered {{model of a}} lift/cruise fan {{airplane}} have been conducted to define its low speed performances and handling qualities. The model was powered by three 5. 5 -in diameter turbopowered simulators; one located in the forebody while the remaining two were installed in tilting nacelles mounted on the aft body.

50|$|The {{flight testing}} and engine {{development}} received no government funding; the plane's funding came entirely from Hawker. The first engines had barely enough thrust {{to lift the}} plane off the ground due to weight growth problems. Flight tests were initially conducted with the aircraft tethered, with the first free hover achieved on 19 November 1960. The first, and difficult, transition from <b>static</b> <b>hover</b> to conventional flight was achieved on 8 September 1961. The RAF was {{not much of a}} convert to the VTOL idea, and described the whole project as a toy and a crowd pleaser. The first prototype P1127 made a very heavy landing at the Paris Air Show in 1963.|$|R
500|$|The first Avrocar, #58-7055, {{rolled out}} of the Avro Malton factory in May 1959. From 9 June to 7 October 1959, it was tested in a <b>static</b> <b>hover</b> rig. Unfortunately, hot gas from the exhaust was found to mix back into the intakes in hover, {{reducing}} engine thrust. In addition, the fan generated lift only from a small area of its surface, lowering overall thrust available. The ducts also proved to have higher losses than expected, {{and a series of}} modifications were not able to solve this problem to any large degree. These problems reduced maximum lift at higher altitudes out of the ground effect to , less than the empty weight of the aircraft at [...] This meant the aircraft would be incapable of hovering out of the ground effect. Following these tests, the vehicle was sent to NASA Ames for a wind tunnel testing.|$|R
50|$|Formally, Orpheus is a {{modified}} sonata form with a secondary key area containing two themes. The second theme lacks {{the energy of}} the first, remaining a <b>static</b> motif <b>hovering</b> over oscillating major and minor harmonies. Nevertheless, it contains an especially poignant quality. This theme is presented by various solo instruments to a primarily harp accompaniment. The orchestration, together with the style, suggests an interpretation of this theme as Orpheus' voice.|$|R

40|$|International audienceStandard hexarotors {{are often}} mistakenly {{considered}} 'by definition' fail-safe multi-rotor platforms {{because of the}} two additional propellers when compared to quadrotors. However this is not true, in fact, a standard hexarotor cannot statically hover with 'only' five propellers. In this paper we provide a set of new general algebraic conditions to ensure <b>static</b> <b>hover</b> for any multi-rotor platform with any number of generically oriented rotors. These are elegantly formulated as the full-rankness of the control moment input matrix, and the non-orthogonality between its null-space and the row space of the control force input matrix. Input saturations and safety margins are also taken into account with an additional condition on the null-space of control moment input matrix. A deep analysis on the hoverability properties is then carried out focusing on the propeller loss in a hexarotor platform. Leveraging our general results we explain why a standard hexarotor is not robust {{and how it can}} be made robust thanks to a particular tilt of the rotors. We finally propose a novel cascaded controller based on a preferential direction in the null-space of the control moment input matrix for the large class of statically hoverable multi-rotors, which goes far beyond standard platforms, and we apply this controller to the case of failed tilted hexarotor...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an adaptive information fusion method {{to improve the}} accuracy and reliability of the altitude measurement information for small unmanned aerial rotorcraft during the landing process. Focusing on the low measurement performance of sensors mounted on small unmanned aerial rotorcraft, a wavelet filter is applied as a pre-filter to attenuate the high frequency noises in the sensor output. Furthermore, to improve altitude information, an adaptive extended Kalman filter based on a maximum a posteriori criterion is proposed to estimate measurement noise covariance matrix in real time. Finally, {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method is proved by <b>static</b> tests, <b>hovering</b> flight and autonomous landing flight tests...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Hummingbird is a 15 () -lb. gross weight, remotely piloted helicopter (RPH) with a 50 -lb. payload and a rotor radius of 10. 25 ft. It {{is powered by}} a 25 h. p. air cooled two-cylinder Westlake engine. As such it represents one of the largest RPH's in the world. It was purchased from Gorham Model Products in 1992 to provide a suitable rotor craft research flight test platform for the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Naval Postgraduate School. The helicopter was delivered disassembled and was accompanied by an ample supply of replacement and spare parts. Also included was a second helicopter in a partially assembled condition that had been previously flown. Assemblies provided comprised the chassis, main rotor transmission, rotor head assembly and tailboom with tail rotor gear box and rotor. The task undertaken by this thesis was to fabricate one complete fully operable RPH and to design, fabricate and install whatever new assemblies that were required for its NPS mission and to make up for deficiencies in the previous design. The work completed required: (1) Design, fabrication and installation of a new skid-type landing gear system; (2) Redesign, and incorporation of a new engine mount system; (3) Modification of the engine and main rotor transmission coupling; (4) Upgrade of the electrical system and elongation of the nose section; and (5) Initial engine testing.

40|$|The flow physics {{involved}} in low Reynolds number flow is investigated computationally {{to examine the}} fundamental flow properties involved with Micro Air Vehicles (MAV).  Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to validate 2 -D, 3 -D <b>static</b> and <b>hover</b> experimental data at Reynolds numbers around 60, 000, with particular attention paid {{to the prediction of}} laminar separation bubble (LSB) on the upper surface of the airfoil.  The TURNS and OVERFLOW flow solvers are used with a low Mach preconditioner to accelerate convergence. CFD results show good agreement with experimental data for lift, moment, and drag for 2 -D and static 3 -D validations.  However, 3 -D hover thrust and Figure of Merit results show less agreement and are slightly overpredicted for all measured collectives.

40|$|The {{acquisition}} {{and interpretation of}} ice thickness data from a mobile platform has for some time been a goal of the remote sensing community. Such data, once obtainable, is of value in monitoring the changes in ice thickness over large areas, and in mapping the potential hazards to traffic in shipping lanes.

40|$|Doubly special {{relativity}} (DSR) {{is an effective}} model for encoding quantum gravity in flat spacetime. To incorporate DSR into general relativity, one could use "Gravity's rainbow", where the spacetime background felt by a test particle would depend on its energy. In this scenario, one could rewrite the rainbow metric g_μν(E) in terms of some orthonormal frame fields and use the modified equivalence principle to determine the energy dependence of g_μν(E). Obviously, the form of g_μν(E) depends on {{the choice of the}} orthonormal frame. For a static black hole, there are two natural orthonormal frames, the <b>static</b> one <b>hovering</b> above it and freely falling one along geodesics. The cases with the static orthonormal frame have been extensively studied by many authors. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate properties of rainbow black holes in the scenario with the free-fall orthonormal frame. We first derive the metric of rainbow black holes and their Hawking temperatures in this free-fall scenario. Then, the thermodynamics of a rainbow Schwarzschild black hole is studied. Finally, we use the brick wall model to compute the thermal entropy of a massless scalar field near the horizon of a Schwarzschild rainbow black hole in this free-fall scenario.

40|$|We {{present the}} vision-based {{estimation}} of the position and orientation of an object using a single camera relative to a novel target that incorporates the use of moir 6 patterns. The objective is to acquire the six degree of freedom estimation that {{is essential for the}} operation of vehicles in close proximity to other craft and landing platforms. A target contains markers to determine relative orientation and locate two sets of orthogonal moir 6 patterns at two different frequencies. A camera is mounted on a small vehicle with the target in the field of view. An algorithm processes the images extracting the attitude and position information of the camera relative to the target utilizing geometry and 4 single-point discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) on the moir 6 patterns.

30|$|Long {{time has}} passed from {{lifetime}} of fixed-wing vehicles that such vehicles due to optimization of energy consumption have been widely drawn into attention, yet they have constantly suffered {{from the lack of}} power of maneuverability, at the affairs pertaining to unmanned vehicles. For instance, small air flasks can easily be controlled so far as there do not exist wind and turbulence. Under this state, natural lifting force causes moving aerial vehicle, yet causes decreasing its power of maneuverability. Helicopters have numerous advantages than fixed-wing vehicles and balloons especially at control and the reason for this can be known in their ability in take off and land at small area of space as well as high power of maneuverability. In addition, <b>static</b> flight (<b>hover)</b> has been {{regarded as one of the}} capabilities of aerial vehicles, mentioned top of aims. On the other hand, these advantages lead to difficulty in control of helicopters for which different sensors as well as rapid processing boards are required. Unmanned aerial robots have been regarded as efficient and practical solutions to cope with this challenge in helicopters. Building unmanned aerial robots include synergic combination at different stages including design, selection of sensors and development of controllers. All the stages are fulfilled in an integrative and parallel way, so that, each one affects another one. To build autonomous unmanned aerial robots, high information on position and direction is required. Such information is provided through self-stabilizing sensors such as inertial navigation system (INS). Global positioning system (GPS) and/or sensors such as sound navigation and ranging (SONAR) [5]. With regard to increasing trend of research at the area of unmanned vehicles especially quadrotors, the present research will intend to examine, simulate and control aerial robots [6].|$|R
