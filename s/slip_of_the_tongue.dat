40|$|Keyword : <b>Slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tongue,</b> Speaking <b>The</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> {{science and}} technology forces us to learn English. Moreover, it should be given {{in teaching and learning}} process in all level of education. In any case, every human being wants to have a good quality in such English skills especially speaking. Nevertheless, sometimes people make a mistake called speech error when they say something. Speech error falls under <b>the</b> category <b>of</b> language production in psycholinguisticsÂ’ field. <b>Slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> can be defined as one of types in speech error which occurs unintentionally. One <b>of</b> phenomena <b>of</b> <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> can be recognized when speakers know the word, but it just will not come to be spoken. There are freshmen who have high scores and were active in the class, but they might still make some errors called <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> writer wants to find out and identify <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> that occur in ESP speaking class of English Department at University of Muhammadiyah Malang. Purpose: <b>The</b> specific purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study was to find out <b>the</b> kinds <b>of</b> <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> found on freshmen in ESP speaking class of English Department at University of Muhammadiyah Malang. Besides, <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> this study was to identify how <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> occurred on freshmen in ESP speaking class of English Department at University of Muhammadiyah Malang. Method: The descriptive qualitative research design was employed in this study. The data were collected from freshmen utterances (speech) in ESP speaking class at English department. The instruments used by the writer were observation checklist and interview guide. While taking samples <b>of</b> this study, <b>the</b> writer used purposive sampling. The writer took the freshmen who had high scores and were active in the class. The representative samples in this study consisted of 20 freshmen from ten (10) classes. Findings and Discussion: As <b>the</b> finding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study, it can be concluded that there are 97 <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> made by <b>the</b> freshmen in ESP speaking class. Some cases in this point were deletion, substitution, addition, anticipation, reversal, and perseveration. Deletion slips are affected by substitutions and anticipations. Besides, <b>the</b> numbers <b>of</b> additions are affected by anticipations, perseveration, and reversal. Yet, there were two types <b>of</b> <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> namely blend and shift/misderivation that did not occur in their utterances. <b>Slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> that occurred in freshmen utterances were affected by several factors. Those factors occurred when the freshmen had problems with vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar. Besides, there were also mental conditions such as happy, afraid, shy, and anxious that led the freshmen to make <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue...</b>|$|R
25|$|Throughout {{his career}} in the Shu government, Meng Guang was notorious for making public outbursts on {{numerous}} occasions and for being very unbridled in his speech. As a result, his colleagues generally disliked or detested him. There were also instances where he carelessly divulged state secrets (probably due to a <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue)</b> and discussed politics in inappropriate settings. However, he got off lightly because he held much prestige among the literati for his status as a learned Confucian scholar. Meng Guang's behaviour had a huge negative impact on his career: he never made it to higher positions – his highest appointment was Minister of Finance (大司農) – and never received any honours/privileges (e.g., a marquis title). Two of his colleagues, Minister of Ceremonies Xin Cheng (鐔承) and Minister of the Household Pei Jun (裴儁), were younger and less experienced than him, yet they made it to positions higher than his.|$|E
500|$|Coke's {{behaviour}} {{during the}} trial has been repeatedly criticised; on this weak evidence, he called Raleigh a [...] "notorious traitor", [...] "vile viper" [...] and [...] "damnable atheist", perverting the law and using every <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> {{as a way of}} further showing Raleigh's guilt. Raleigh was found guilty and imprisoned in the Tower of London {{for more than a decade}} before finally being executed. It is generally concluded that the trial was biased strongly against Raleigh, although the assessment of Coke varies. While Magruder, in the Scottish Law Review, writes that Coke's [...] "fair fame was tarnished and outraged" [...] by his part in the trial, Boyer notes that Coke was, above all, loyal. He prosecuted Raleigh in that fashion because he had been asked to show Raleigh's guilt by the king, and as Attorney General, Coke was bound to obey.|$|E
500|$|Established acts {{benefited from}} the new {{commercial}} climate, with Whitesnake's self-titled album (1987) selling over 17 million copies, outperforming anything in Coverdale's or Deep Purple's catalogue before or since. It featured the rock anthem [...] "Here I Go Again '87" [...] as one of 4 UK top 20 singles. The follow-up <b>Slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tongue</b> (1989) went platinum, but according to critics Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato, [...] "it was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board success of Whitesnake". Aerosmith's comeback album Permanent Vacation (1987) would begin a decade long revival of their popularity. Crazy Nights (1987) by Kiss was the band's highest charting release in the US since 1979 and the highest of their career in the UK. Mötley Crüe with Girls, Girls, Girls (1987) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria (1987) hit their commercial peak, the latter producing seven hit singles (a record for a hard rock act). Guns N' Roses released the best-selling début of all time, Appetite for Destruction (1987). With a [...] "grittier" [...] and [...] "rawer" [...] sound than most glam metal, it produced three top 10 hits, including the number one [...] "Sweet Child O' Mine". Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s, such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this period with their respective albums Pride (1987) and Long Cold Winter (1988) both going multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles. In {{the last years of}} the decade, the most notable successes were New Jersey (1988) by Bon Jovi, OU812 (1988) by Van Halen, Open Up and Say... Ahh! (1988) by Poison, Pump (1989) by Aerosmith, and Mötley Crüe's most commercially successful album Dr. Feelgood (1989). New Jersey spawned five Top 10 singles, a record for a hard rock act. In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November, the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks; the albums were OU812, Hysteria, Appetite for Destruction, and New Jersey. A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s, and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s, among them Extreme, Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse. Skid Row also released their eponymous début (1989), reaching number six on the Billboard 200, but they were {{to be one of the}} last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era.|$|E

2500|$|When {{diagnosing}} allochiria, it {{is important}} to consider the sensory and the motor aspects of the problem. [...] In absence of knowledge there are a number of ways in which the various symptoms may be overlooked or misinterpreted and as the condition goes frequently unrecognized. [...] One rare example in medicine that causes a wrong diagnosis of allochiria is due to the unawareness of a few simple facts than to any failure in judgment. [...] It is evident that the details of the sensory symptoms get overlooked when testing a patient's localizing capacity. The observer neglects to inquire expressly as to the side to which the sensation is referred. [...] This is evident when patients with allochiria show no fault in sensorial perception and localization. However, even if the patient mentions the wrong side, it is sometimes being just regarded as a <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> and matter may not be pursued any further. [...] Looking at the motor aspect of allochiria, the symptoms again are described in a misleading way because the symptoms are less obvious. [...] Unless motor manifestations are carefully analyzed, they may be interpreted as clumsiness or weakness. [...] Moreover, when patients complained of weakness and awkwardness of right side—examinations apparently confirmed that the truth of this statement and defect was marked as acts consciously performed and was present only in relation to such acts. [...] If a patient says that he cannot tell on which side the certain stimulus is applied—existence of allochiria is confirmed, provided that sensibility is intact.|$|E
40|$|As {{a social}} person, {{human beings are}} always interrelated with others. Here, <b>the</b> {{function}} <b>of</b> language is very important thing {{to be used by}} people in the world to communicate with each other. Talking about speech, it is realized that there is relationship between speech and <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> because <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> speech errors. Meanwhile, as human beings, every one of us seems to produce <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> and therefore it is interesting to be researched. Fromklin (in Clark, 1977 : 273) said that <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> is said to have occurred when the speaker’s actual utterance differs in some way from the intended utterance. It involves unintentional movement, addition, deletion, blending, or substitution of material within an utterance and can be phonological, morphological, lexical or syntactic. It is not <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> intentional ungrammaticality, ignorance, language play, or motor dysfluencies. <b>Slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> has 8 types, they are: anticipations, perseverations, reversals/ exchanges, blends, shifts/misderivations, substitutions, additions and deletions. However, this research used qualitative design as it’s method of analyzing and collecting the data. To get the original and valid data, the researcher used the following steps: Firstly, the researcher followed <b>the</b> speaking class <b>of</b> English Letters and Language Department Students of UIN Malang and observes every word uttered by the students. Secondly, while observing, he also recorded all utterances that were spoken by the students. Taking note was also done to record context <b>of</b> utterances. Thirdly, <b>the</b> researcher transcribed every word or sentence uttered by the students. Fourthly, the researcher selected the utterances that are related to <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> researcher arranged the data which are appropriate with <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research. Based on the analysis, this research only found 6 types from 8 types <b>of</b> <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue,</b> they are: reversals/exchanges, blends, shifts/misderivations, substitutions, additions and deletions. Anticipations and perseverations were not found. Most <b>of</b> case <b>of</b> <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> found in this research is shifts/ misderivations (11 data), followed by additions (8 data), substitutions (5 data), deletions (3 data), reversals/exchanges (2 data) and blends (1 data). For the English Department students, this research may give benefit especially on <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> psycholinguistics study.
