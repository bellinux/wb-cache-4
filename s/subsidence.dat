30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that the rupture occurred in both shallow and deep parts of the Nicobar region (areas B and C); this result was further obtained by Lorito et al. ([2010]). Two large left lateral fault mechanism aftershocks (Mw 7.2, Mw 7.5) occurred in the Nicobar region. The depths of the aftershocks obtained by Global CMT were 12 and 33 km, respectively, and these aftershocks were considered to be a reactivation of the fracture zone of the subducted oceanic plate triggered by the main shock. Unless the rupture occurred in the shallow near-trench region, a positive Coulomb stress change for the two aftershocks was not produced (Delescluse et al. [2012] On the other hand, the <b>subsidences</b> of approximately 3 m in the Nicobar Islands and Great Nicobar were not explained only by the shallow slip; to cause these <b>subsidences,</b> the deep part slip is necessary. These facts support both the shallow and deep part slips in the Nicobar region obtained by our result; however, these <b>subsidences</b> may be caused by not only coseismic slip but also postseismic slip in the deep part.|$|R

40|$|Differential SAR {{interferometry}} {{allows for}} the detection and mapping of ground <b>subsidences,</b> usually attributable to human activities, associated with the extraction of fluids beneath the surface, or underground mining… Limiting factors for monitoring slow <b>subsidences</b> are mainly temporal coherence loss and varying atmospheric conditions between the acquisitions of images. Such variations induce a path difference generating InSAR artifacts that cannot be corrected if only one interferogram is available. On urban areas, the coherence remains often high over long time scales. The main problem then {{appears to be the}} atmospheric heterogeneities. This kind of artifacts can be easily detected on the different interferograms we generated on the city of Paris. Significant phase variations are clearly visible, and can not be associated with topographic fringes, nor with displacements. Several techniques exist in order to eliminate or reduce the effect of atmospheric artifacts: a solution consists in summing and averaging interferograms, but requires several interferograms over the same site. The advantages of a novel approach based on complex correlation of interferograms are presented here, in particular robustness when only a few interferograms are available (two interferograms are enough, under given hypotheses). These algorithms were tested in the context of automatic detection of atmospheric artifacts by means of correlation of interferometric triplets. On the city of Paris, this method reveals 2 subsiding zones. One zone has the same location as an important underground working site, which took place from 1995 to 1997. The existence of <b>subsidences</b> in the area was known already from ground truth data. Their spatial extent can now be mapped by interferometry, and the temporal evolution of the <b>subsidences</b> is also examined here...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the impact of}} salinisation on the aquatic mollusc fauna in fl ooded mine <b>subsidences</b> in the Karvina region (Czech Republic). The results of the previous research on salinity in fl ooded mine <b>subsidences</b> show {{that some of them}} contain a high content of dissolved inorganic substances (above 1000 mg·l- 1). These substances can affect the vegetation and animals occurring in the water and the surrounding area. The phylum of Mollusca was selected as a model group for the fi eldwork as it includes species with the proven bioindication potential. The occurrence of aquatic mollusc species was studied at 10 sites. The sites were selected based on the content of dissolved substances (the salinity gradient from 1000 mg·l- 1. A total of 12 aquatic mollusc species were found, including one species identifi ed as a potential bioindicator of the negative effect of salinisation on aquatic biota. The analysis showed statistically signifi cant positive correlations between the content of dissolved inorganic substances and the presence of alien species Potamopyrgus antipodarum (J. E. Gray, 1843). The gradient of salinity signifi cantly affects the species composition of the mollusc fauna in fl ooded mine <b>subsidences</b> and may affect the biodiversity of this group.

5|$|The Hawaiian–Emperor {{seamount}} chain {{is a series}} of volcanoes and seamounts extending across the Pacific Ocean. The chain has been produced by the movement of the ocean crust over the Hawaii hotspot, an upwelling of hot rock from the Earth's mantle. As the oceanic crust moves the volcanoes farther away from their source of magma, their eruptions become less frequent and less powerful until they eventually cease to erupt altogether. At that point erosion of the volcano and <b>subsidence</b> of the seafloor cause the volcano to gradually diminish. As the volcano sinks and erodes, it first becomes an atoll island and then an atoll. Further <b>subsidence</b> causes the volcano to sink below the sea surface, becoming a seamount and/or a guyot. This list documents the most significant volcanoes in the chain, ordered by distance from the hotspot; however, there are many others that have yet to be properly studied.|$|E

60|$|Rise of the Sea-level Connected with Glacial Epochs, a Cause of Further Denudation.--There is {{also another}} {{powerful}} agent {{that must have}} assisted {{in the destruction of}} any such surface deposits or markings. During the last glacial epoch itself there were several minor oscillations of the land, without counting the great submergence of over 1,300 feet, supposed to be indicated by patches of shelly clays and gravels in Wales and Ireland, and also in a few localities in England and Scotland, since these are otherwise explained by many geologists. Other <b>subsidences</b> have no doubt occurred in the same areas during the Tertiary epoch, and some writers connect these <b>subsidences</b> with the glacial {64} period itself, the unequal amount of ice at the two poles causing the centre of gravity of the earth to be displaced when, of course, the surface of the ocean will conform to it and appear to rise in the one hemisphere and sink in the other. If this is the case, <b>subsidences</b> of the land are natural concomitants of a glacial period, and will powerfully aid in removing all evidence of its occurrence. We have seen reason to believe, however, that {{during the height of the}} glacial epoch the extreme cold persisted through the successive phases of precession, and if so, both polar areas would probably be glaciated at once. This would cause the abstraction of a large quantity of water from the ocean, and a proportionate elevation of the land, which would react on the accumulation of snow and ice, and thus add another to that wonderful series of physical agents which act and react on each other so as to intensify glacial epochs.|$|R
