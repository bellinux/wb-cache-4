5000|$|Ethnochoreology (also dance ethnology, dance anthropology) is {{the study}} of dance through the {{application}} of a number of disciplines such as anthropology, musicology, ethnomusicology, ethnography, etc. The word itself is relatively recent and etymologically means “the study of ethnic dance”, though this is not exclusive of research on more formalized dance forms, such as classical ballet, for example. Thus, ethnochoreology reflects the relatively recent attempt to apply academic thought to why people dance and what it means. It is not just the study or cataloging of the thousands of external forms of dances—the dance moves, music, costumes, etc.— {{in various parts of the}} world, but the attempt to come to grips with dance as existing within the social events of a given community as well as within the cultural history of a community. Dance is not just a static representation of history, not just a repository of meaning, but a producer of meaning each time it is produced—not just a living mirror of a culture, but a <b>shaping</b> <b>part</b> of culture, a power within the culture: ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the aims}} {{of this paper is}} to develop {{knowledge}} about scaffolding as meaning for learning when students in compulsory and upper secondary school use digital educational material. The other aim is to investigate if teachers support or prevent the students ’ learning process when they are working with ICT during a Learning Design Sequence (LDS). The theoretical framework is primarily based on a socio-cultural perspective drawn from Neo-Vygotskian theories. The results indicate that scaffolding occurs in all parts of a learning design sequence but are most common in the <b>shaping</b> <b>part</b> in this study. Most of the teachers and students, in this study, think that using digital educational material requires more and other forms of scaffolding. The results concerning teacher interventions indicate that teachers interact both sup-portively and restrictively for the students ’ learning process. Some reasons for that are connected to the content of the intervention and whether teachers intervene together with the students or not...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A novel {{adaptive}} fuzzy trajectory tracking algorithm of Stewart platform based {{motion platform}} is proposed to compensate path deviation and degradation of controller’s performance due to actuator torque limit. The algorithm {{can be divided}} into two parts: the real-time trajectory <b>shaping</b> <b>part</b> and the joint space adaptive fuzzy controller part. For a reference trajectory in task space whenever any of the actuators is saturated, the desired acceleration of the reference trajectory is modified on-line by using dynamic model of motion platform. Meanwhile an additional action with respect to the difference between the nominal and modified trajectories is utilized in the non-saturated region of actuators to reduce the path error. Using modified trajectory as input, the joint space controller incorporates compute torque controller, leg velocity observer and fuzzy disturbance observer with saturation compensation. It can ensure stability and tracking performance of controller in present of external disturbance and position only measurement. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of proposed control scheme...|$|E

40|$|Part-based {{representation}} {{has become}} an essential representation for objects. Different <b>parts</b> of a <b>shape</b> have various importance to shape perception. Concerned by the contributions of local parts to the perception of global shapes, we introduce an importance measure of <b>shape</b> <b>parts</b> {{from the viewpoint of}} their “reconstructability”. Given one <b>shape</b> <b>part</b> as a local observation, we estimate the global object shapes through a proposed novel shape reconstruction method. The reconstruction quality is determined by part geometry variation and part uniqueness. Then a conditional entropy formulation is introduced to measure the part importance considering the reconstruction quality, part uniqueness and variation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefit of the proposed part importance to object detection applications. Moreover, psychological experiments are conducted to further support the consistency of our importance measure with human perception towards <b>shape</b> <b>parts.</b> 1...|$|R
3000|$|Network- or IP-level {{emulation}} {{is targeted}} at {{the evaluation of}} transport protocols or distributed applications. It is based on only a few parameters, mainly: bandwidth, delays, and packet losses, which are the effects perceived at the transport level. Traffic shapers such as Dummynet [7], NetEm [8], ModelNet [9], or NISTNet [10] can enforce such parameters on real IP packets that pass through the shaper. In addition, Netbed/Emulab [11] or ModelNet [9] are large testbeds federating and coordinating several such traffic shapers, using various approaches to dynamically configure a traffic shaper during emulation. In [12] a trace-based emulation system using traffic shapers is proposed, where the parameters used are derived from previously captured traces. The traces are processed during a so-called [...] "distillation" [...] phase to produce an emulation model made of bandwidth, delays, and losses, that will be interpreted by the traffic <b>shaping</b> <b>part</b> of the emulator. This allows the reproduction of the conditions that were captured with the original traces. Finally, some IP-level emulation systems are based on real-time discrete event simulation, like NCTUns [13].|$|E

We present a new framework and its implementation for generic object classification from raw range images, combining structural and functional concepts. The framework addresses low and mid level problems for the decomposition of range images into primitive <b>shape</b> <b>parts,</b> presenting concepts for the classification of <b>shape</b> <b>parts,</b> and calculation of part properties and relations. New concepts are described, addressing the different aspects of generic class descriptions by functional parts. A mapping of functionality (and functional parts) to the primitive <b>shape</b> <b>parts</b> is presented, introducing functional part recognizers. Our approach mainly supports a top-level recognition process in which classes are verified using a verification tree in which functional parts and their realization hypotheses are explored. An algorithm for an effective traversing of the verification tree is presented, in which probabilities of hypotheses and classes are estimated. An experimental system applying our classification concepts to several classes was implemented and tested on a database of real raw range images of objects...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{automatic}} recognition of functional parts of man-made 3 D shapes in the presence of significant geometric and topological variations. We observe that under such challenging circumstances, the context of a part within a 3 D shape provides important cues for learning the semantics of shapes. We propose to model the context as structural relationships between <b>shape</b> <b>parts</b> and use them, in addition to part geometry, as cues for functionality recognition. We represent a 3 D shape as a graph interconnecting parts that share some spatial relationships. We model the context of a <b>shape</b> <b>part</b> as walks in the graph. Similarity between <b>shape</b> <b>parts</b> can then be defined as the similarity between their contexts, which in turn can be efficiently computed using graph kernels. This formulation enables us to: (1) find part-wise semantic correspondences between 3 D shapes in a nonsupervised manner and without relying on user-specified textual tags, and (2) design classifiers that learn in a supervised manner the functionality of the shape components. We specifically show that the performance of the proposed context-aware similarity measure in finding part-wise correspondences outperforms geometry-only-based techniques and that contextual analysis is effective in dealing with shapes exhibiting large geometric and topological variations...|$|R
