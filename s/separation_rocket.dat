40|$|The Apollo Mission employs {{more than}} 210 {{pyrotechnic}} devices per mission. These devices are either automatic of commanded from the Apollo spacecraft systems. All devices require high reliability and safety {{and most are}} classified as either crew safety critical or mission critical. Pyrotechnic devices have {{a wide variety of}} applications including: launch escape tower separation, <b>separation</b> <b>rocket</b> ignition, parachute deployment and release and electrical circuit opening and closing. This viewgraph presentation identifies critical performance, design requirements and safety measures used to ensure quality, reliability and performance of Apollo pyrotechnic/explosive devices. The major components and functions of a typical Apollo pyrotechnic/explosive device are listed and described (initiators, cartridge assemblies, detonators, core charges).

40|$|The {{design of}} the space shuttle solid rocket booster (SRB) {{subsystems}} for reuse posed some unique and challenging design considerations. The separation of the SRBs from the cluster (orbiter and external tank) at 150, 000 ft when the orbiter engines are running at full thrust meant the two SRBs had to have positive separation forces pushing them away. At the same instant, the large attachments that had reacted launch loads of 7. 5 million pounds thrust had to be servered. These design considerations dictated the design requirements for the pyrotechnics and <b>separation</b> <b>rocket</b> motors. The recovery and reuse of the two SRBs meant they had to be safely lowered to the ocean, remain afloat, and be owed back to shore. In general, both the pyrotechnic and recovery subsystems have met or exceeded design requirements. In twelve vehicles, there has only been one instance where the pyrotechnic system has failed to function properly...|$|E
50|$|All {{versions}} of UA120 {{shared a common}} design, with the only significant differentiating factor being {{the length of the}} motor. It was a segmented design, with between five and seven motor segments possible. A solid propellant, polybutadiene acrylonitrile, was used as fuel. The stage had an external diameter of 120 inches. Attitude control in flight was provided by means of a hydraulic thrust vector control system, with an external nacelle containing hydraulic fluid attached to the side of each booster. Solid fueled <b>separation</b> <b>rockets,</b> used to jettison the spent boosters, were affixed at {{the top and bottom of}} the stage. Thrust-termination capability, necessary for manned rockets such as the Space Shuttle or Manned Orbiting Laboratory, was to be provided by two pyrotechnically triggered ports on the forward closure, which when opened would allow for the non-propulsive venting of exhaust gasses. The forward end of the stage contained an aerodynamic nose cone, an ignitor, <b>separation</b> <b>rockets,</b> and the forward attachment ring. The aft end contained additional <b>separation</b> <b>rockets,</b> the nozzle, and a heat shield.|$|R

The Mercury spacecraft was unmanned and carried no launch escape system. The mission was to conduct a suborbital test flight and reentry of the spacecraft. The capsule had live posigrade <b>separation</b> <b>rockets,</b> but dummy retrorockets. Several other systems were missing including the cabin pressurization system and the astronaut couch.

5000|$|At around T+126 seconds, {{pyrotechnic}} fasteners {{released the}} SRBs and small <b>separation</b> <b>rockets</b> pushed them laterally {{away from the}} vehicle. The SRBs parachuted back to the ocean to be reused. The Shuttle then began accelerating to orbit on the main engines. Acceleration at this point would typically fall to [...]9 g, and the vehicle would take on a somewhat nose-up angle to the horizonit used the main engines to gain and then maintain altitude while it accelerated horizontally towards orbit. At about five and three-quarter minutes into ascent, the orbiter's direct communication links with the ground began to fade, at which point it rolled heads up to reroute its communication links to the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite system.|$|R

5000|$|Cabin {{ejection}} {{systems are}} much more complex than ejection seats. They require devices to cut cables and conduits connecting the cabin and fuselage. The cabin must have aerodynamic stabilization devices to avoid tumbling after ejection. The large cabin weight mandates a very large parachute, with a more complex extraction sequence. Air bags must deploy beneath the cabin to cushion impact or provide flotation. To make on-the-pad ejections feasible, the <b>separation</b> <b>rockets</b> {{would have to be}} quite large. In short, many complex things must happen in a specific timed sequence for cabin ejection to be successful, and in a situation where the vehicle might be disintegrating. If the airframe twisted or warped, thus preventing cabin separation, or debris damaged the landing airbags, stabilization, or any other cabin system, the occupants would likely not survive.|$|R

50|$|OSO C {{never made}} it to orbit. Liftoff took place on 25 August 1965 and all went well through the second stage burn. During the {{coasting}} phase prior to third stage <b>separation,</b> its <b>rocket</b> motor ignited prematurely.

The OSO spacecraft could not attain orbital velocity and instead fell back into the atmosphere and burned up. The failure was suspected to have been caused by a modification to the igniter mechanism in the third stage after some minor technical difficulties experienced on the previous Delta C launch (TIROS 10 on 2 Jul).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} for severing or weakening a variety of materials. The technique employs embedding explosive cords into parallel grooves that are cut into a surface of a material. The cords are initiated simultaneously to produce shock waves that progress toward the centerline between the cords and the lower surface of the material. Intersecting incident and reflected waves augment at the centerline to fail or weaken the material in tension. No harmful debris is produced {{on the opposite side}} of the material from the explosive cords. The primary focus of the effort described in this paper was to fracture the F- 16 aircraft trilaminate canopy. Also, complete severance was achieved in 2024 -T 4 aluminum plate stock. Possible applications are through canopy egress and crew module severance from military aircraft and <b>separation</b> of <b>rocket</b> vehicle stages and payloads.

40|$|Flow <b>separation</b> in <b>rocket</b> nozzles is {{undesirable}} {{because of}} its unsteady and nonsymmetric nature, which leads to dangerous side-loads. At {{the initial stages of}} start-up, when a thrust optimized contour (TOC) noz-zle operates under overexpanded conditions, free shock separation (FSS) takes place. Under certain conditions, this free separated §ow reattaches back to the nozzle wall and forms restricted shock separation (RSS). The appearance of restricted shock separated §ow depends upon the nozzle contour in a well-de¦ned range of nozzle pressure ratios (NPR) and is characterized by a cap-shock pattern. The §ow transition process from FSS to RSS §ow con¦gurations is a complex phenomenon and has been an area of interest for a few decades now. In the present study, an attempt has been made to understand the formation of the cap-shock pattern and the RSS §ow con¦guration in a thrust optimized contour (TOC) nozzle. The presented research work consists of two parts. In the ¦rst part of the paper, numerical investigation of §ow transition (FSS−→RSS) has been performed to understand the formation of the cap-shock pattern, which {{is believed to be the}} main cause for this §ow transition from FSS to RSS. Axisymmetric numerical calculations on a wide range of NPRs (1525) are performed to reproduce the forward transition process and are found to be in good agreement with the exper-iments. In the second part, some light has been shed on various aspects of RSS §ow regime. Three-dimensional (3 D) numerical simulations have been performed on a wide range of NPRs, i. e., 25. 0, 30. 0, 38. 0, 41. 0, and 46. 0. Detailed analysis of these numerical results allows examining the evolution of the separation point and the cap-shock pattern with respect to the NPR. Furthermore, some insights based on the axial mo-mentum along the nozzle axis and radial momentum distributions across the quadruple point are given...|$|R
