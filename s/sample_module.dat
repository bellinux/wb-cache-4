30|$|In this paper, two {{different}} cascaded reconstruction networks are proposed to meet different sampling methods. Firstly, we propose a compatibly sampling reconstruction network (CSRNet), which is employed to reconstruct high-quality images from compressively sensed measurements sampled by a random sampling matrix. In CSRNet, deep reconstruction network module can obtain an initial image with acceptable quality, {{which can be}} further improved by residual network module based on convolutional neural network. Secondly, {{in order to improve}} the sampling efficiency of CS, an automatically <b>sampling</b> <b>module</b> is designed, which has a fully connected layer to learn a sampling matrix automatically. In addition, the residual reconstruction module is presented, which can match the <b>sampling</b> <b>module.</b> Both the <b>sampling</b> <b>module</b> and its matching residual reconstruction module form a complete compressive sensing image reconstruction network, named ASRNet. As compared with CSRNet, ASRNet can achieve more than 1 dB gain. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed networks outperform several state-of-the-art iterative reconstruction algorithms and deep-learning-based approaches in objective and subjective quality.|$|R

The 1 cm 2 electrode, CNT or Pt/CNT paper, was carefully trimmed and mounted on thin cardboard to ensure flatness and then mounted onto the Lakeshore sample holder (part number 750 SC 10 - 50) with “solvent and acid free water soluble glue” (Henkel Pritt). The electrical contact was made by placing small ohmic contacts on {{the four corners of}} the supported film using silver conductive ink (DuPont Silver paint 5000). The contacts were hand painted between each corner of the 1 cm 2 electrode and silver contact points 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the Lakeshore sample holders. Mounted samples were cured at 70 °C in a hot air oven for 30 min to ensure contact dryness. Manual resistance measurements were firstly obtained to check the integrity of contacts according to the Van der Pauw geometry which is geometry independent. Connections were made according to the (R 12, 12; R 23, 23; R 34, 34; and R 41, 41) configuration for each prepared electrode after mounting in a Lakeshore sample holder and a voltage applied between each terminal successively. The Van der Pauw geometry was used for IV curve measurement starting at − 1.0 to 1.0 mA with a step size of I = 0.1000 mA and a dwell time of 5 s. Thereafter a variable field measurement was obtained for each sample between 10 and 1 kG at a step size of 1 kG and dwell time of 10 s at a current of 1 mA. The mode chosen was linear sweep with field reversal and geometry A + B to minimize any lack of symmetry.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} system employing a diffusion-limited <b>sampling</b> <b>module</b> and a direct sampling ion trap for {{quantitative assessment of}} subsurface fluids was developed and field tested. The <b>sampling</b> <b>module</b> is deployable with a cone penetrometer. It can be retrieved and/or remain as an implant for an indefinite time period. The device geometry, comprised of two planar membranes enclosing a diffusion cell, provides good implant ruggedness and reliable service in the field. Also, the <b>sampling</b> <b>module</b> is protected within a push pipe housing to extend implant service life. Subsurface volatile organic compound (VOC) vapors, in nanoliter amounts, diffuse through the sampler membrane wall by a diffusion-limited process that is independent of the soil permeability. Sample vapors are transported to the surface for analysis by direct sampling ion trap, or other analytical devices. Metered pressurized or reduced pressure transport (carrier) gas is utilized for sample transport to the surface. The vapors obtained are a function only of the fluid partial pressure and the vapor conductance of the sampler. Thus, quantitative analytical data is obtained regardless of soil conditions. The <b>sampling</b> <b>module</b> was deployed in the field at Dover Air Force Base at depths of 5 to 8. 5 feet by the US Army Site Characterization and Analysis Penetrometer System (SCAPS).

We have previously provided definitions of fundamental timing operators that explicitly considered tolerances on property durations and intersample jitter [1]. In this work we refine the model and formalize the analysis of the Held for operator of [1] in the PVS theorem prover. We formalize different implementation environments incorporating nonuniform samples with bounded jitter and for one of the environments provide a full formal proof of necessary and sufficient conditions for when it is possible to implement a Held for requirement. We briefly describe how these results can then be used to formally verify a <b>sample</b> <b>module</b> implementing a requirement that utilizes the Held for operator and describe an example application. ...|$|E

40|$|Background and objective: Objective of {{the study}} was to explore self-perceived health status, health {{determinants}} and its associations with sociodemographic factors among urban community members in Lithuania. Materials and methods: Data were obtained from a European survey on urban health, conducted as part of the EURO-URHIS 2 project. The postal questionnaire survey of 3200 adults from Kaunas and Šiauliai (Lithuania) was conducted in 2010. A total of 1407 valid questionnaires were analyzed. Statistical analysis was carried out by using SPSS 17. 0 inside Complex <b>Sample</b> <b>module</b> that takes design effects into account. Results: Younger respondents (aged 19 – 64 years) perceived most of the health status indicators better than the older ones (65 + years), while they were less likely to report healthy lifestyle and less often perceived their neighborhood as being socially cohesive than the older ones. Men less frequently experienced psychological problems, indicated regular contacts with friends and/or family and had a greater tendency to be overweighed and obese, daily smokers and drinkers compared to women. Those having secondary or lower educational level perceived most of the health status indicators worse than those with university educational level. Respondents living with a partner less often experienced psychological problems than those living alone. Respondents who indicated having enough money for daily expenses more often perceived their health and health determinants better.

40|$|Objectives: The use and {{combined}} use of psychotropic {{drugs and alcohol}} among older adults is a growing public health concern and should be constantly monitored. Relevant studies are scarce in Germany. Using data {{of the most recent}} national health survey, we analyse prevalence and correlates of psychotropic drug and alcohol use among this population. Methods: Study participants were people aged 60 – 79  years (N= 2508) of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults 2008 – 2011. Medicines used during the last 7  days were documented. Psychotropic drugs were defined as medicines acting on the nervous system (ATC code N 00) excluding anaesthetics (N 01), analgesics/antipyretics (N 02 B), but including opiate codeines used as antitussives (R 05 D). Alcohol consumption in the preceding 12  months was measured by frequency (drinking any alcohol-containing beverages {{at least once a week}}/a day) and quantity (alcohol consumed in grams/day; cut-offs: 10 / 20  g/day for women/men defining moderate and risky drinking). SPSS complex <b>sample</b> <b>module</b> was used for analysis. Results: 21. 4 % of study participants use psychotropic medications, 66. 9 % consume alcohol moderately and 17. 0 % riskily, 51. 0 % drink alcohol at least once a week and 18. 4 % daily, 2. 8 % use psychotropic drugs combined with daily alcohol drinking. Among psychotropic drug users, 62. 7 % consume alcohol moderately, 14. 2 % riskily. The most frequently used psychotropic medications are antidepressants (7. 9 %) and antidementia (4. 2 %). Factors associated with a higher rate of psychotropic drug use are female sex, worse health status, certified disability and polypharmacy. Risky alcohol consumption is positively associated with male sex, smoking, upper social class, better health status, having no disability and not living alone. Conclusions: Despite the high risk of synergetic effects of psychotropic drugs and alcohol, a substantial part of older psychotropic drug users consume alcohol riskily and daily.

This will lead to higher service level for end users, faster repair times, better control over service transactions, an open market for compatible applications and an easy plug-and-play installation. Manufacturers are currently {{in the process of}} developing their own specific modules and there is an increasing need for test and verification software to certify OMSI conformance. In order for phone manufacturers to be able to efficiently verify that their OMSI modules and catalogs support and comply with the OMSI standard, there is a need for automated module tests and manual catalog tests. Development of such tests is the main purpose of this Master thesis work. The implementation of the different verification processes have been divided into different sub-projects to create a more structured view of the OMSI Test Suite project and easier management. The first part of the thesis work deals with the module verification process, second part with the client verification process while the third and final part deals with the catalog verification process.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to examine}} the {{relationships}} among reported medical advice, diabetes education, health insurance and health behavior of individuals with diabetes by race/ethnicity and gender. METHOD: Secondary analysis of data (N = 654) for adults ages 3 ̆e or = 21 years with diabetes acquired through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 2007 - 2008 comparing Black, non-Hispanics (BNH) and Mexican-Americans (MA) with White, non-Hispanics (WNH). The NHANES survey design is a stratified, multistage probability sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized U. S. population. Sample weights were applied in accordance with NHANES specifications using the complex <b>sample</b> <b>module</b> of IBM SPSS version 18. RESULTS: The findings revealed statistical significant differences in reported medical advice given. BNH [OR = 1. 83 (1. 16, 2. 88), p = 0. 013] {{were more likely than}} WNH to report being told to reduce fat or calories. Similarly, BNH [OR = 2. 84 (1. 45, 5. 59), p = 0. 005] were more likely than WNH to report that they were told to increase their physical activity. Mexican-Americans were less likely to self-monitor their blood glucose than WNH [OR = 2. 70 (1. 66, 4. 38), p 3 ̆c 0. 001]. There were differences by race/ethnicity for reporting receiving recent diabetes education. Black, non-Hispanics were twice as likely to report receiving diabetes education than WNH [OR = 2. 29 (1. 36, 3. 85), p = 0. 004]. Having recent diabetes education increased the likelihood of performing several diabetes self-management behaviors independent of race. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in reported medical advice received for diabetes care by race/ethnicity. The results suggest ethnic variations in patient-provider communication and may be a consequence of their health beliefs, patient-provider communication as well as length of visit and access to healthcare. These findings clearly demonstrate the need for government sponsored programs, with a patient-centered approach, augmenting usual medical care for diabetes. Moreover, the results suggest that public policy is needed to require the provision of diabetes education at least every two years by public health insurance programs and recommend this provision for all private insurance companie...|$|E

Compared to children aged 7 years or above, children aged 6 years or below had significant higher blood lead levels (1999 - 2000 : 1. 24 [1. 20 - 1. 28] vs 2. 08 [2. 01 - 2. 26]; 2001 - 2002 : 1. 03 [1. 00 - 1. 06] vs 1. 65 [1. 57 - 1. 73]; 2003 - 2004 : 1. 03 [1. 01 - 1. 06] vs 1. 69 [1. 61 - 1. 78]; 2005 - 2006 : 0. 86 [0. 84 - 0. 88] vs 1. 41 [1. 35 - 1. 48]; 2007 - 2008 : 0. 85 [0. 83 - 0. 88] vs 1. 46 [1. 40 - 1. 54]; 2009 - 2010 : 0. 72 [0. 70 - 0. 74] vs 1. 15 [1. 10 - 1. 19]; 2011 - 2012 : 0. 59 [0. 57 - 0. 61] vs 0. 93 [0. 88 - 0. 99]; P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: There is continuous decreasing trend in blood lead level in the US population during the period 1999 - 2012. The blood lead level in children aged 6 years or below is of concern...|$|E
