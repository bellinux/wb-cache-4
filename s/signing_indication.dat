5000|$|Blumenberg created {{what has}} come to be called 'metaphorology', which states that what lies under metaphors and {{language}} modisms, is the nearest to the truth (and the farthest from ideologies). His last works, especially [...] "Care Crosses the River" [...] (Die Sorge geht über den Fluss), are attempts to apprehend human reality through its metaphors and involuntary expressions. Digging under apparently meaningless anecdotes of the history of occidental thought and literature, Blumenberg drew a map of the expressions, examples, gestures, that flourished in the discussions of what are thought to be more important matters. Blumenberg's interpretations are extremely unpredictable and personal, all full of <b>signs,</b> <b>indications</b> and suggestions, sometimes ironic. Above all, it is a warning against the force of revealed truth, and for the beauty of a world in confusion.|$|R

Method. A retrospective review of six patients {{at the age of}} 16 − 79 years (mean 39) in the period from 1996 to 2003, treated with the extended ankle and foot fasciotomy. There were four males undergoing the delayed treatment of war injuries to the lower extremity, and two females with atherosclerotic occlusive disease (a. illiacae dex and a. poplitealis dex.). The average ishemic time in the wounded patients was 22 hours (range, 14 − 30 hours), and ischemic time in occlusive disease (range, 48 − 72 hours). Clinical <b>signs,</b> <b>indications,</b> surgical access and the technique of extended ankle and foot fasciotomy was reported. Results. The obtained results were classified as early and late.

The satisfactory functional results were achieved in 4 of the patients, 1 had a small edema, while amputation was performed in 1 patient. Conclusion.

We analyze the client-side requirements for a general annotation system that is applicable in mobile as well as stationary settings.

The first technique uses visual markers for digital annotations of individual items in printed photos. The second technique addresses the annotation of street <b>signs</b> and <b>indication</b> panels. It is based on image matching supported by interactively established 4 -point correspondences...|$|R

But we have {{naturally}} speculated among ourselves, {{and we have}} asked ourselves the following questions:— (1) Does the essential aetiology of fibrositis lie within the bone? (2) Does the marrow of the metaphysis of bone play a more important part and active part in the metabolism of the body than has been hitherto recognised? (3) Are the generally accepted symptoms and signs of fibrositis merely external manifestations of some disease whose true site does not lie where the symptoms are felt and the indefinite signs detected? (4) Are these symptoms and <b>signs</b> <b>indications</b> of some derangement of a normal physiological function or interplay between bone marrow and muscle? (5) Has this work pointed {{the way to the}} recognition of another sub-group of muscular rheumatism? The technique of this method is not difficult to acquire by starting with simple muscles such as the gluteal region, but since practical demonstra-tion is always more profitable preliminary arrangements have been made for demonstrating the technique by two of my collaborators—Mr. L.

40|$|Background: Operative {{intervention}} for thoracic trauma typically requires thoracotomy. We hypothesized that thoracoscopy may be safely and effectively utilized for the acute management of thoracic injuries. Materials and Methods: The Trauma Registry of a Level I trauma center was queried from 1999 through 2010 for all video-assisted thoracic procedures within 24 h of admission. Data collected included initial vital <b>signs,</b> operative <b>indication,</b> intraoperative course, and postoperative outcome. Results: Twenty-three patients met inclusion criteria: 3 (13 %) following blunt injury and 20 (87 %) after penetrating trauma. Indications for urgent thoracoscopy included diaphragmatic/esophageal injury, retained hemothorax, ongoing hemorrhage, and open/persistent pneumothorax. No conversions to thoracotomy were required and no patient required re-operation. Mean postoperative chest tube duration was 2. 9 days and mean {{length of stay}} was 5. 6 days. Conclusion: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is safe and effective for managing thoracic trauma in hemodynamically stable patients within the first 24 h post-injury...|$|R
