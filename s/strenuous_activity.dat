25|$|On August 10, {{after a day}} of <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity,</b> Roosevelt {{exhibited}} {{an illness}} characterized by fever, ascending paralysis, facial paralysis, prolonged bowel and bladder dysfunction, and numbness and hypersensitivity of the skin. Most of the symptoms resolved themselves, but he was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down.|$|E
25|$|A muscular {{diaphragm}} helps mammals to breathe, {{especially during}} <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity.</b> For a diaphragm to work, the ribs must not restrict the abdomen, so that {{expansion of the}} chest can be compensated for by reduction in {{the volume of the}} abdomen and vice versa. Diaphragms are known in caseid pelycosaurs, indicating an early origin within synapsids, though they were still fairly inefficient and likely required support from other muscle groups and limb motion.|$|E

25|$|At Norfolk State University in February 1999, a Delta pledge {{was hospitalized}} in an Intensive Care Unit {{after a series}} of {{physical}} beatings and <b>strenuous</b> <b>activities.</b> Nine sorority members, two of whom were about to graduate, were expelled from the university in May.|$|R
25|$|Ascending slowly is {{the best}} way to avoid {{altitude}} sickness. Avoiding <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity</b> such as skiing, hiking, etc. in the first 24 hours at high altitude reduces the symptoms of AMS. Alcohol and sleeping pills are respiratory depressants, and thus slow down the acclimatization process and should be avoided. Alcohol also tends to cause dehydration and exacerbates AMS. Thus, avoiding alcohol consumption in the first 24–48 hours at a higher altitude is optimal.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said (by the present-day {{explorer}} Ranulph Fiennes amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity.</b> Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.|$|E
25|$|Medical therapy {{of chronic}} aortic {{insufficiency}} that is stable and asymptomatic {{involves the use}} of vasodilators. Trials have shown a short term benefit in the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, nifedipine, and hydralazine in improving left ventricular wall stress, ejection fraction, and mass. The goal in using these pharmacologic agents is to decrease the afterload so that the left ventricle is somewhat spared. The regurgitant fraction may not change significantly, since the gradient between the aortic and left ventricular pressures is usually fairly low at the initiation of treatment. Other rather conservative medical treatments for stable and asymptomatic cases include low sodium diet, diuretics, digoxin, calcium blockers and avoiding very <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E

25|$|Kangaroos have single-chambered stomachs quite {{unlike those}} of cattle and sheep. They {{sometimes}} regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then swallow it again for final digestion, {{but this is}} a different, and more <b>strenuous,</b> <b>activity</b> than it is in ruminants, and does not take place as frequently. Different species of kangaroos have different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses, whereas some other species (e.g. the red kangaroo) include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi. Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular, usually spending the days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding.|$|E
25|$|Jumping {{is a very}} <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity</b> {{that places}} high {{physical}} demands on the horse. The primary stresses affect the suspensory apparatuses of the hind legs during take-off and the forelegs during landing, though the galloping and turning associated with jumping also place torque on the joints. Most injuries, chronic or acute, begin with strain; as structures in the horse's body absorb the shock of take-off and landing, they acquire small amounts of damage. Over time, this damage leads to inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and ligaments (desmitis). The most common injuries in the forelimb occur to the interosseous ligaments and the superficial digital flexor tendons and less commonly, the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon. Strain on the superficial digital flexors is greater when jumping higher fences, so horses {{may no longer be}} suitable for competitive jumping after damaging that apparatus.|$|E
500|$|The Holdens {{lived in}} {{suburban}} Norbiton, Surrey (now Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames) until 1902, {{when they moved}} to Codicote in Hertfordshire. Around 1906, they moved to Harmer Green near Welwyn, where Holden designed a house for them. The house was plainly furnished and the couple lived a simple life, described by Janet Ashbee in 1906 as [...] "bananas and brown bread on the table; no hot water; plain living and high thinking and <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity</b> {{for the betterment of}} the World". The couple had no children together, though Margaret had a son, Allan, from her marriage. Charles and Margaret Holden lived at Harmer Green {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E

He can almost never become tired because of his immense stamina, which allows him to do <b>strenuous</b> <b>activities</b> for days on end.|$|R
30|$|Present {{knowledge}} of the pathogenesis of capsular ligamentous knee injuries requires an assessment that is as complete as possible and is made {{as early as possible}} of any tears, {{in order to avoid the}} possibility that a late or insufficient diagnosis might lead to functional instability and progressive joint damage.

2500|$|The {{advanced}} cynodonts {{have very}} mammal-like rib cages, with greatly reduced lumbar ribs. This {{suggests that these}} animals had more developed diaphragms, were capable of <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity</b> for fairly long periods and therefore had high metabolic rates. On the other hand, these mammal-like rib cages may have evolved to increase agility. However, the movement of even advanced therapsids was [...] "like a wheelbarrow", with the hindlimbs providing all the thrust while the forelimbs only steered the animal, in other words advanced therapsids were not as agile as either modern mammals or the early dinosaurs. So {{the idea that the}} main function of these mammal-like rib cages was to increase agility is doubtful.|$|E

30|$|Typically, {{patients}} who sustain a complete ACL tear report symptomatic instability with pivoting in sports or <b>strenuous</b> <b>activities</b> [3]. Patients diagnosed with ACL partial tears have a less predictable outcome. Although many continue to experience instability, some do not, and identifying both groups {{can be challenging}} [3]. Moreover, as there are no clear guidelines, diagnosing partial tears and tailoring treatment for individual patients can be difficult [3, 25].|$|R

60|$|It was a {{scene of}} <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity,</b> filled with hurriedly moving figures, but its {{coloring}} had lost something of its former vividness. The blue of the sky was softer, the light less strong; the varying hues of lemon and copper and ocher had become subdued; the shadows were no longer darkly blue but a cool restful gray. The rushing winds that had swept the wide plain all summer had come to rest; the air was sharp and still.|$|E
60|$|Appleby {{was glad}} he had little leisure for {{reflection}} {{during the rest of}} the day, which was passed in <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity.</b> There were defences to be improvised, and ambulance corps to organize, barricades built, and men driven to their posts from the wine‐shops, for Candotto’s Peninsulares would shortly arrive. They never came, however, but instead of them two hundred dusty men with rifles from Brena Abajo marched in, and a horde of peons from every aldea in the vicinity armed with staves and machetes followed them when dusk was closing down. Then once more the bells clashed exultantly above the clamorous town.|$|E
60|$|In some respects, Vane {{was glad}} {{to be back in the}} western city. At first, the ease and leisure at the Dene had their charm for him, but by degrees he came to chafe at them. The green English valley, hemmed in by its {{sheltering}} hills, was steeped in too profound a tranquillity; the stream of busy life passed it by with scarcely an entering ripple to break its drowsy calm. One found its atmosphere enervating, dulling to the faculties. In the new West, however, one was forcibly thrust into contact with a <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity.</b> Life was free and untrammeled there; it flowed with a fierce joyousness in natural channels, and one could feel the eager throb of it.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{traditional}} beliefs, <b>strenuous</b> <b>activities,</b> such as heavy lifting, farm work, and even {{driving a car}} {{may lead to a}} miscarriage or stillbirth, however this may sometimes be unavoidable by the rural poor. Regular activity, however, would promote easy birth by making the abdomen [...] "loose" [...] (tong klon) and therefore aiding in the downward rotation of the baby. Idleness and frequent resting, on the other hand, complicates birth.|$|R
5000|$|Direct-to-consumer {{and other}} {{advertisements}} for HIV {{drugs in the}} past were criticized for their use of healthy, glamorous models rather than typical HIV+ patients and by featuring patients in unrealistically <b>strenuous</b> <b>activities,</b> such as mountain climbing.

40|$|Music {{is known}} to be capable of {{reducing}} perceived exertion during <b>strenuous</b> physical <b>activity.</b> The current interpretation of this modulating effect of music is that music may be perceived as a diversion from unpleasant proprioceptive sensations that go along with exhaustion. Here we investigated the effects of music on perceived exertion during a physically strenuous task, varying musical agency, a task that relies on the experience of body proprioception, rather than simply diverting from it. For this we measured psychologically indicated exertion during physical workout with and without musical agency while simultaneously acquiring metabolic values with spirometry. Results showed that musical agency significantly decreased perceived exertion during workout, indicating that musical agency may actually facilitate physically <b>strenuous</b> <b>activities.</b> This indicates that the positive effect of music on perceived exertion cannot always be explained by an effect of diversion from proprioceptive feedback. Furthermore, this finding suggests that the down-modulating effect of musical agency on perceived exertion may be a previously unacknowledged driving force for the development of music in humans: making music makes <b>strenuous</b> physical <b>activities</b> less exhausting...|$|R

60|$|Three weeks {{had passed}} since his {{interview}} with Austin before Jefferson was ready to sail, and {{he spent most of}} the time in <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity.</b> He had cabled to England for a big centrifugal pump and a second-hand locomotive-type boiler, while, when they arrived, Macallister said that five hundred pounds would not tempt him to raise full steam on the latter. He also purchased a broken-down launch, and, though she was cheap, the cost of her and the pump, with other necessaries, made a considerable hole in his remaining Â£2,000. It was for this reason he undertook to make the needful repairs himself, {{with the help of a}} steamer's donkey-man who had somehow got left behind, while Austin and Macallister spent most of the week during which the Estremedura lay at Las Palmas in the workshop he had extemporised. He appeared to know a little about machinery, and could, at least, handle hack-saw and file in a fashion which moved Macallister to approbation, while Austin noticed that the latter's sardonic smile became less frequent as he and the American worked together.|$|E
60|$|It {{was growing}} dusk, of a thick, hot evening, when Leland at last pulled up his jaded horses, and, {{turning in the}} iron saddle, raised his hand in signal. Behind him, a {{drawn-out}} line of machines and plodding teams were moving on at measured distances, binder after binder, half-hidden by the tall oats that went down before them with a harsh crackle. Where they passed, men toiled hard among the flung-out sheaves, and the trampling of weary horses, rasp and tinkle of the knives, and the clash of the binders' wooden arms rang far across the great dusky plain. The sounds of <b>strenuous</b> <b>activity</b> had risen since the sun first crept up above the vast sweep of grass, and continued through the burning heat of the day; but now they ceased suddenly, and men, stripped to coarse blue shirt and trousers of dusty jean, wiped their dripping faces, and straightened their aching backs before they loosed the teams. Their hoarse voices came up to Leland, with the clatter of flung-down poles and the tramp of horses among the stubble, as he got down from his binder.|$|E
