40|$|Purpose - In {{recent years}} {{consumers}} in Belgium {{have shown a}} great interest for foods from the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> The difference with the conventional chain {{is that in the}} <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> the primary products are locally processed and sold directly by the producer to the consumer. The <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> has different microbiological quality and safety aspects in comparison with the conventional chain. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate these aspects. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology consists of analyzing the available scientific literature and results of microbiological analyses on foods from the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> Findings - The main findings were that Listeria monocytogenes was frequently detected (15 percent) in sampled raw dairy products whereas Salmonella was not isolated in 1, 023 samples. Human pathogenic vero (cyto) toxin-producing Escherichia coli and Campylobacter spp. are potential hazards, in particular for products that are not thermally treated. Data with regard to E. coli counts showed a greater variability in products from the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> compared to the conventional chain. Research limitations/implications - The paper discusses strengths and weaknesses with impact on microbial quality and safety in operation of food safety management in the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> vs the conventional chain. Originality/value - This is the first paper that assesses the risks from the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> vs the conventional chain and that makes recommendations for operators in the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|R

40|$|Esperienze di filiera corta nell’agro-alimentare: un’indagine esplorativa in provincia di Trento - Experiences of <b>short</b> food <b>supply</b> chain: an explorative {{research}} {{in the province of}} Trento In the recent years there has been an increasing interest in the scientific literature for the so-called "Alternative Food Networks" which try to redefine the relationship between producers and consumers. Particularly interesting is the <b>short</b> food <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> which allows both producers to get back some added value and consumers to have better food "with the farmers’ face on it". Moreover, some part of the literature stressed that a <b>shorter</b> food <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> promotes the rise of a new and more territorially based rural development. The investigation approach has been mainly sociological or geographical and mostly based on case studies. Little attention has been devoted to quantify the involved farmers’ population. Since <b>shorter</b> food <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> are becoming increasingly present in the Italian market, the aim of the paper is to contribute to deepen the knowledge about these experiences, starting from the specific context of the Autonomous Province of Trento. First of all, a census of the empirical variety of <b>short</b> food <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> has been made. In addition to three farmer’s markets, one box scheme (Biocesta) and other similar initiatives, farmers open their farms to consumers and visitors. The integration of three different databases allowed us to estimate the number of farms involved in the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> It represents the 12, 8 % of the full time farms. In order to shed light on structural conditions, economic performance and farmers’ perceptions, we surveyed a convenience sample of 36 farms involved in the most innovative forms of <b>short</b> food <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> The surveyed farms are of small dimensions; the farmers are well educated and they are fully involved in the <b>short</b> food <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> Most part of the farms is highly diversified: the average number of products is 4. 4 and the diversification is strengthened trough some processing. Only 28 % of the sample sells the whole production through the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain: this confirms that the major part of farms does not abandon the conventional system when opting for a <b>shorter</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> Investigating the motivations that draw farmers to move towards a <b>shorter</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> shows that a better valorisation of their products represents the most important one. Nevertheless, other non-monetary reasons enter into the decision and gain top ranking positions such the direct contact with consumers and the enhancement of professional competences. The option for a <b>shorter</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> seems to have very interesting consequences. Actually, it pushed the 72 % of farms to increase product diversification; it induced some farms to switch to organic production, to recover unusual vegetables and antique fruit cultivars, to pay greater attention to the landscape, to offer new services inside the farm and to strength the relations with other farms and the territory. These results support the idea that the <b>short</b> food <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> enhances the multifunctional role of farms.

40|$|The {{supply chain}} {{management}} of foods is commonly associated with modernistic large-scale production. This involves long transport distances of foods to reach consumers. In the case of local foods, supply chains are shorter. Based on {{a case study of}} five local foods producer's supply of their products to a common retailer, the supply chain of local foods is modelled conceptually and modes of development are pointed out based on contingency theory and {{supply chain management}} literature. Findings reveal that since these chains are transparent, reciprocal interdependency is abundant mainly because human perception creates a sufficient understanding of the operations management issues pertinent within this simple inter-organisational structure. Local foods supply chains are similar to service supply chains. This includes that both are short in nature and associated with bi-directional interaction between the customer and supplier. Developing <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> in local foods supply is associated with improving the exchange economy found in <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> This also implies that development of local foods supply is associated with two paths which may be complementary. First, the use of improved intensive technology associated with reciprocal interdependency to develop efficiencies in the bi-directional and somewhat complex interaction. Alternatively local foods suppliers may seek to reduce this form of reciprocal interdependency thereby increasing the impact of pooled interdependencies and enabling using mediating technology involving standardising interaction such as through increased standardised products and packaging as well as automation of information connectivity...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a new form}} of food {{production}} and distribution organisation, as part of small-scale and local agriculture, has been gaining ground. Generically termed <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> (SSCs), this new model of food procurement comprises various forms such as community-supported agriculture, box schemes and solidarity purchase groups. Consumer participation in SSCs is dictated by deep motivations: while consumers are principally encouraged by the desire to preserve local producers, as well as the social and environmental aspects of farming, the attraction of SSCs is also tied to different and more complex ways of perceiving food quality. The quality issue in SSCs is not only seen in the light of classic attributes, such as taste and safety, but also in terms of social criteria built on the basis of aspects of products linked to social and environmental domains. This study provides an empirical assessment of consumers participating in SSCs to ascertain whether, and to what extent, those actively involved in an SSC show differences in terms of what is more personal and subjective, such as universal values and food-related lifestyles, compared with those who do not participate. In order to assess such relationships, data were collected from a solidarity purchase group in Sicily (southern Italy). For comparison, a group of consumers in conventional food outlets were also interviewed in the same city. Data were analysed with the propensity score matching method. Our results show that the decision to participate in a solidarity purchase group is especially dictated by profound ideological and emotional considerations.

As a matter of fact, the excessive amount of participants taking part in all the phases of the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> has created the basis for an increase of environmental impacts due to many factors: the implementation of farming methods, which are {{getting more and more}} intensive, put pressure on the environment, on the sustainability of the agricultural industrial production process and increase the number of kilometres the goods have to travel in order to be distributed. Moreover, the extension of the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> has produced a decrease of its share of value-added to the benefit of the farmers and, as a consequence, has excluded many small producers from the market and caused a negative impact on rural areas (unemployment, depopulation due to migration). From the customers’ point of view, the increase of intermediaries has created an informative asymmetry due to the impossibility to track their shipment as well as to a lowering of their quality standards, caused by an increasingly standardized production process. During the last years, the interest of policy-makers in <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> has grown. It appears to be a tool able to incentivize a sustainable agricultural productions and to provide environmental, economic and social benefits. In fact, the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> other than reducing costs, which are cut down by decreasing the number of intermediaries that take the product from the producer to the consumer, creates a positive environmental externalities and, above all, promotes the local areas.
