5000|$|Task Review: Connexus {{represented}} {{and sold}} flats at a high-end development in Canary Wharf and a mid-range development in Clapham. Although the high-end team had no floor {{plans to use}} and opted not to use an incomplete <b>show</b> <b>flat,</b> the enthusiasm of Richard and Vana led to good sales from clients, yet in comparison, Scott hampered the mid-range team's sales, as he stumbled in pitches and demonstrated no information about the development's site. Meanwhile, Versatile represented and sold flats at a high-end development in Stratford and a mid-range development in Lewisham, the former being chosen due to the poor approach by Joseph and Selina with its developers. While the mid-range team sold well thanks to Charleine's contribution, both Joseph and Selina made only one high-end sale, as they struggled due to a failure to acquire information about their <b>show</b> <b>flat</b> or the development itself. Their performance effectively led the team to losing the task.|$|E

One of them, the Jagiellonski Channel (Kanał Jagielloński), leads to the Nogat River, along which navigation to Gdańsk is common. The Elbląg Canal (Kanał Elbląski) connecting Lake Drużno with Drwęca River and Lake Jeziorak is a popular tourist site.|$|E
5000|$|In 1918, {{after the}} end of the war, Blanchard moved to Paris, where she would spend the rest of her life.

5000|$|Starts {{with the}} arrival of the new {{residents}} into the new block of flats, Mirador de Montepinar. On the top floor, there are two flats, A and B: In flat A live the brothers Sergio and Joaquín Arias. Sergio is an actor by trade and a playboy by nature, while Joaquín is an unlucky-in-love estate agent, constantly battling to keep his job and sell the <b>show</b> <b>flat</b> on the ground floor. In Flat B live Javi Maroto, president of the community, and his wife Lola Trujillo. As president, Javi is often inundated with petty complaints from the residents, who include his parents, Vicente Maroto and Gregoria Gutiérrez, who live below him in apartment 2B. They share a floor with Amador Rivas, Maite Figueroa Espinosa and their 3 children (apartment 2A); and Germán Palomares, a defaulter whose identity is completely unknown. In flat 1A live Cristina Aguilera, a woman whose wedding was recently called off by her fiancé, who ran off with another woman, and Silvio Ramírez, a gay man from Cuba who often poses as her boyfriend, and even as her fiancé in the final episode. In flat 1B lives Leo Romaní, vice-president of the community who has an on-off relationship with Cristina. In flat 1C live Antonio Recio, a seafood wholesaler, and his wife Berta Escobar. On the ground floor below there are four spaces: flat A is the building's <b>show</b> <b>flat,</b> which is occupied by Izaskun Sagastume and Mari Tere Valverde, a couple of elderly friends who become squatters in the flat and stay using mischievous, and often legally doubtful, means, but end up purchasing the flat for a token sum of 1 euro. In flat B reside Enrique Pastor, a civil servant, his wife Araceli, her mother Rosario (Charo), and his teenage son Francisco (Fran). They are joined later in the series by Julián, Enrique's father [...] The two other spaces on the ground floor are occupied by a hairdresser's shop, owned by Araceli and staffed by Fabio Sabatani, a gay Argentinian and friend of Silvio, and Sandra Espinosa, a young insecure hairdresser; and the estate agents' office where Joaquín works alongside Eric Cortés and their boss Raquel Villanueva. Other recurring characters are Máximo Ángulo (Maxi), the community's doorman and husband (separated) of Izaskun, and Coque Calatrava, the ex-convict gardener.|$|E

50|$|OMNIMAX theatres {{are used}} in theme parks and North American museums, {{particularly}} those with a scientific focus, where {{the technical aspects of}} the system may be highlighted as part of the attraction. The projection room is often windowed to allow public viewing and accompanied by informational placards like other exhibits. The screen may be a permanent fixture, such as at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois; Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the St. Louis Science Center; Boston's Museum of Science; Richmond's Science Museum of Virginia; Birmingham, Alabama's McWane Science Center and US Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, AL; the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal and Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland, OH; or lowered and raised as needed, such as at the Canadian Museum of History (where it shares an auditorium with a standard IMAX screen). The entire dome can be raised to <b>show</b> <b>flat</b> screen features and lowered for dome features. For the flat screen theaters, before the feature begins, the screen can be backlit to show the speakers and girders behind it. While the majority of museum installations focus on educational and documentary films, on special occasions, entertainment films are also shown, such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. The largest in North America are at Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New Jersey and the Telus World of Science in Vancouver, BC, both of which have dome screens 27 m in size.|$|E
5000|$|P. kevani {{is known}} solely from the holotype DORCM G.13,675, a nearly {{complete}} 2.0-m-long skull and mandible housed at Dorset County Museum, Dorchester, England. The specimen was collected at Wyke Siltstone bed of Osmington Bay, from the Rasenia cymodoce ammonite zone, Kimmeridge Clay Formation of the Ancholme Group, {{dating to the}} early Kimmeridgian. DORCM G.13,675 was collected {{over a period of}} eight years as pieces up to 60 kg in mass weathered out of the sea-cliff of Black Head. Most pieces were collected from loose or fallen blocks without any permits required, while other parts were collected in situ and purchased from land owners. They were first identified as a pliosaurid skull by Richard Edmonds, Earth Sciences Manager for Dorset and East Devon Coast World Heritage Site Team. Due to its large size and completeness, the specimen gained extensive media coverage, and its acquisition was announced publicly in October 2009. Additional elements were later donated by Patrick Clarke and purchased from Shirley Swaine. DORCM G.13,675 went on display in Dorchester County Museum in July 2011, after being in preparation between March 2010 and March 2011. Preparation of the lower jaws took 200 hours and a further 365 hours were needed to complete preparation of the skull. P. kevani was first described and named by Roger B. J. Benson, Mark Evans, Adam S. Smith, Judyth Sassoon, Scott Moore-Faye, Hilary F. Ketchum and Richard Forrest in 2013. The specific name honors Kevan Sheehan, the owner of a small café overlooking the sea at Osmington Mills, who collected most of the holotype during daily walks along the foreshore. Benson et al. (2013) diagnosed the species based on four autapomorphies of the holotype. The subrectangular sheet of the maxilla extends anteriorly on alveolar surface of the premaxilla to contact the distalmost premaxillary alveolus, while in other species of Pliosaurus an interdigitating premaxilla-maxilla suture is located midway between the mesialmost maxillary and distalmost premaxillary alveoli. Its pineal foramen is surrounded by a raised rim, while other thalassophoneans have a shallow fossa containing anteroposteriorly oriented grooves or ridges, that extends anteriorly from the pineal foramen. The mesial postsymphysial dentary alveoli are everted to face dorsolaterally, and not dorsally as seen in other species. Finally, the lateral surface of the mandible dorsoventrally [...] posteriorly, while other thalassophoneans <b>show</b> <b>flat</b> or weakly convex lateral surface of the postedentary bones. P. kevani also possesses a unique combination of characters, including: high dentary alveolar count including 22 postsymphysial alveoli and an estimated total count of 36-37; high count of symphysial dentary alveoli including at least 7, estimated as 14-15; subtrihedral teeth, possessing a suboval cross-section with slightly flattened labial surface bearing only thinly distributed enamel ridges; pronounced mediolateral expansion of caniniform regions of the premaxilla and maxilla; six closely spaced premaxillary alveoli; anisodont premaxillary dentition; and premaxilla-parietal suture located level with the anterior region of the orbit.|$|E
