40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three empirical studies about the informational content of options trading on subsequent equity returns and around major corporate events, such as mergers and acquisitions, and bankruptcies. The first chapter examines the informational content of options trading on acquirer announcement returns. I show that implied volatility spread predicts positively on the cumulative abnormal return (CAR), and implied volatility skew predicts negatively on the CAR. The predictability is much stronger around actual merger and acquisition (M&A) announcement days, compared with pseudo-event days. The prediction is weaker if pre-M&A stock price has incorporated part of the information, but stronger if acquirer’s options trading is more liquid. Finally, I find that higher relative trading volume of options to stock predicts higher absolute CARs. The relation also exists among the target firms. In the second chapter, I reassess the presence of pre- bankruptcy-filing informed and insider trades by examining the information content of options trading before bankruptcy announcements. I find that bankruptcy filing returns are not significantly related to pre-filing insider stock trading. However, filing returns are significantly negatively related to pre-filing insider and informed options trading. The informational content of options trading reduces with options illiquidity {{and the amount of}} information impounded into pre-filing stock prices. In the third chapter, I use data on signed option volume to study which components of option volume predict returns and resolve the apparent inconsistency in the literature. I find no evidence that trades related to synthetic short positions in the underlying stocks contain more information than trades related to <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> <b>positions.</b> Purchases of calls that open new positions are the strongest predictor of returns, followed by call sales that close out existing purchased call positions. The signed O/S measures also predict announcement returns for both earnings announcements and unscheduled corporate events. Overall the results indicate that the role of options in providing embedded leverage is the most important channel why options trading predict stock returns. published_or_final_versionEconomics and FinanceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
2500|$|An {{investor}} or speculator may “buy protection” {{to hedge}} {{the risk of}} default on a bond or other debt instrument, regardless of whether such investor or speculator holds an interest in or bears any risk of loss relating to such bond or debt instrument. In this way, a CDS is similar to credit insurance, although CDS {{are not subject to}} regulations governing traditional insurance. Also, investors can buy and sell protection without owning debt of the reference entity. These [...] "naked credit default swaps" [...] allow traders to speculate on the creditworthiness of reference entities. CDSs can be used to create <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> and short <b>positions</b> in the reference entity. [...] Naked CDS constitute most of the market in CDS. [...] In addition, CDSs can also be used in capital structure arbitrage.|$|R
40|$|The {{prices of}} the option and futures of a stock both reflect the market’s {{expectation}} of futures trends of the stock’s price. Their prices normally align with each other within a limited window. When they do not, arbitrage opportunities arise: an investor who spots the misalignment {{will be able to}} buy (sell) options on one hand, and sell (buy) futures on the other and make risk-free profits. In this paper, we focus on put-callfutures parity arbitrage opportunities. The upper bound of a futures bid price, denoted by Fbt, is given by: Fbte –ra(T–t) ≤ Cat – Pbt + Xe –rb(T–t) + TC (1) Here, T is the expiration date and t is today, i. e. T–t is the remaining time to maturity; Cat is the option’s call premium at the ask, Pbt is the option’s put premium at the bid. X is the exercise price for the option. TC is the transaction cost. ra is the interest rate on the borrowing to finance the futures. rb is the interest rate to lend. If condition (1) is violated then the arbitrageur {{will be able to make}} a risk free profit equal to: Fbte –ra(T–t) – [Cat – Pbt + Xe –rb(T–t) + TC]> 0 (2) When condition (1) is violated, a short arbitrage profit can be realized by shorting futures and protecting it by a <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> futures <b>position</b> by (i) buying a call option, (ii) shorting a futures option, and (iii) borrowing the present discounted value of the futures price and lending the same for the exercise price [9].

Pairs trading could be viewed alternatively as a mechanism to hedge both sector and market risks. When there is a financial crisis, two stocks both decline in value; but then the pair trade would result to a gain on the short position and an offsetting loss on the <b>long</b> <b>position.</b> This will yield a profit close to zero in spite of the large market movement. It is clear that this is a self-funding strategy as short sale proceeds may be utilised in creating the <b>long</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{recently}} developed a HIVconsv vaccine strategy, consisting of combined conserved regions of HIV- 1, to adequately cover viral diversity. To evaluate efficacy in nonhuman primates, an equivalent SIV-derived immunogen SIVconsv {{was designed and}} delivered as plasmid DNA or <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides. DESIGN: Rhesus macaques lacking protective MHC class I alleles Mamu-A* 001  :  01, B* 008  :  01, B* 017  :  01 were immunized with either SIVconsv <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides (S) alone or in combination with plasmid DNA encoding the same conserved regions (D) using SSS or DDSS regimens. METHODS: The SIVconsv <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptide vaccine consisted of 46 approximately 30 -amino acid-long peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA- 720 and adjuvanted with pegylated type I interferon and imiquimod. RESULTS: Both SSS and DDSS regimens generated high frequencies of SIV-specific IFN-γ-producing cells comparable with reported adenoviral vector systems. Strong polyfunctional CD 4 ⁺ T-cell and modest CD 8 ⁺ T-cell responses were generated, which were of central memory T-cell phenotype. Furthermore, SIVconsv-specific antibody responses were induced capable of recognizing the Env glycoprotein. Eight weeks after the last immunization, control and SIVconsv-vaccinated animals were challenged intrarectally with 10 MID 50 of pathogenic SIVmac 251. Two out of six animals in the DDSS group were protected against infection, while all 14 animals in the SSS and two control groups were infected. Vaccine induced SIV-specific IgG responses in mucosal washes prechallenge were highest in the two protected animals. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that vaccine-elicited responses towards conserved regions can afford partial protection against a high-dose intrarectal SIVmac 251 challenge...|$|R
