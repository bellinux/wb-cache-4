30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this is the first study to {{systematically}} assess the role of lithium maintenance treatment on calcium metabolism, including iPTH levels and 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol concentrations in patients with bipolar disorder. In our study, iPTH levels were significantly higher in patients with bipolar disorder undergoing psychopharmacological treatment that included lithium for at least 6 months (lithium group) compared to patients with bipolar disorder receiving psychopharmacological treatment that excluded lithium (non-lithium group). In line with this, group affiliation (lithium versus non-lithium) was the only variable explaining iPTH concentrations. Furthermore, none of our patients with iPTH concentrations above the reference range would have been detected using current screening recommendations (Livingstone and Rampes 2006; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2009).</b>|$|E

30|$|This study {{employed}} a qualitative research approach {{in order to}} explore the hurdles affecting women entrepreneurs’ business in Iringa. This approach has been useful for exploring and understanding the meaning that individuals or groups ascribe to social or human problems (Cresswell 2014). An ethnography research strategy was used to explore socio-cultural phenomena about women entrepreneurs. This strategy is appropriate in contexts {{where there is a}} need to gain insights, through observations, about women entrepreneurs in their business context and activities and understand the issues they face from their points of view and perspectives (<b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2009,</b> & Denscombe 2013). Ethnography allows for a high level of congruence between concepts and observations as it involves prolonged participation in the social life of the group over a period of time and description of things witnesed first-hand (Denscombe 2013). Ethnography strategy has been the most powerful influence on the transformation of qualitative research into a kind of postmodern research attitude, which is opposed to the more or less codified application of specific method (Flick 2009). Participant observations that lasted for 2 months were used to collect information on food processing, challenges, and how women market their products (Flick 2009). Observations took a considerable amount of time in order to describe group of women entrepreneurs who share the similar socio-cultural challenges in doing business (Gliner et al. 2009).|$|E
30|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{evidence-based}} consensus on the optimal surgical approach in lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism, several studies have been published regarding the different treatment options (Bendz et al. 1996; Järhult et al. 2010; Saunders et al. 2009; Abdullah et al. 1999; Awad et al. 2003; Carchman et al. 2008). Some advocate removal of all four glands where others apply a more focused approach. In order to determine the optimal treatment for LIH, one has to understand its pathophysiology. However, the underlying mechanism by which lithium induces hyperparathyroidism has not been elucidated yet. Since lithium was thought to induce hyperplastic changes to all four glands (based on the idea that all glands are exposed equally) rather than the formation of one or multiple adenomas, (Abdullah et al. 1999), routine complete neck exploration was the surgical procedure of choice for a long time. The overall prevalence of multiglandular disease, however, has a broad variance ranging from only 13 % to 52 % (Järhult et al. 2010; Abdullah et al. 1999; Awad et al. 2003; Carchman et al. 2008). And therefore, the notion that the remaining parathyroid glands will render pathological with time is perhaps premature and lacks sufficient evidence (Järhult et al. 2010; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2009).</b> This would support a more selective approach and more extensive preoperative imaging as is common nowadays in primary hyperparathyroidism. At this moment, {{it is too early to}} advocate a certain surgical approach since both theories find equal supports in the literature. Furthermore, when there is reluctance to surgery, a relative new class of drugs called calcimimetics has been shown to lower the serum calcium level. Even though the results are promising, one must realize that this is not a definitive therapy (Houweling et al. 2012; Rothe et al. 2011).|$|E
30|$|Lithium is used {{effectively}} {{in the treatment of}} bipolar disorder over the last 60 years, and despite the availability of many pharmacotherapeutic options, it remains the cornerstone of long-term prophylaxis (Cade 1949). Hypercalcemia associated with lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism (LIH) is a common, but easily overlooked, complication of lithium treatment. Monitoring of serum calcium levels is therefore recommended in the International Society for Bipolar disorders (ISBD) consensus guidelines for the safety monitoring of bipolar disorder treatments since <b>2009</b> (Ng <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2009).</b> The first case of LIH was published in 1973 (Garfinkel <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1973). The reported prevalence of hypercalcemia in patients on lithium therapy varies among studies from 15 % to 60 % (Bendz <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1996; Ananth and Dubin 1983; Davis <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1981; Järhult <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2009; Christensson 1976; Szalat <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2009; Khandwala and Van Uum 2006).|$|R

More specifically, malnutrition can refer to a state of under-nutrition (from insufficient intake or impaired utilisation), or over-nutrition (from excessive calorie intake and/or inadequate physical activity) (Escott-Stump 2012). Either state leads to altered body composition and function (<b>Saunder</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010). It is important however, that the term ‘under-nutrition’ is not confused with being underweight (e.g. often represented by Body Mass Index [BMI] < 18.5  kg/m 2). Under-nutrition is a term used synonymously with protein-energy deficiency, where there is a loss of body cell mass with signs of subcutaneous fat loss and skeletal muscle wasting and therefore (Escott-Stump 2012; <b>Saunder</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010); under-nutrition can occur irrespective of individuals’ BMI (<b>Saunder</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010). Malnutrition, in this study protocol, refers to ‘under-nutrition’, meaning protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) (Escott-Stump 2012).|$|R
30|$|Immune cells {{present in}} the skin, such as {{mononuclear}} cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and mast cells, also express TRPV 1, and TRPV 1 activation directly affects the function of these cells (Saunders et al., 2009; Basu and Srivastava 2005; Ständer et al., 2004). Indeed, activation of TRPV 1 in mononuclear cells induced cell death, and this response was reversed by a TRPV 1 antagonist (<b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2009).</b> Capsaicin promotes DC maturation, which is abrogated in TRPV 1 −/− DC cells. In an in vivo mouse model, injected capsaicin mediated the maturation and migration of skin DCs to the draining lymph nodes in TRPV 1 +/+ but not in TRPV 1 −/− mice, confirming an important role for this channel in the innate immunity process (Basu and Srivastava 2005). Nevertheless, the potential inflammatory role of TRPV 1 in DCs remains controversial, as evidenced by another study that did not find TRPV 1 expression in DCs or the induction of calcium elevation by capsaicin. However, the neuropeptide SP activated DCs by eliciting robust Ca 2 + elevation, suggesting that DC maturation and migration are dependent on CNI. Taken together, the potential inflammatory role of TRPV 1 in DCs remains unclear {{and needs to be}} investigated. The involvement of mast cell degranulation during CNI in response to capsaicin is a related process that occurs indirectly via the release of peptide transmitters from sensory neurons (Bunker et al., 1991; Frydas et al., 2013). Nonetheless, TRPV 1 activation by capsaicin has evoked Ca 2 + elevation in numerous mast cell lines. Capsaicin-elicited Ca 2 + did not induce mast cell degranulation but triggered the release of IL- 4 (Bı́ró et al., 1998), which is known to be involved in AD associated with the recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages, CD 3 + lymphocytes, and epidermal dendritic T lymphocytes (Zhao et al., 2016).|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} Central Government has {{investigated}} {{ways in which}} to streamline Local Government Authorities (LGA), {{in order to provide}} better value services to its citizens. Following a Local Government Review (LGR) of two-tier councils, six district councils and one County Council were merged to form two unitary councils; namely Cheshire West and Chester Council and Cheshire East Council. This study investigates the extent of staff operation transformation following the adoption of flexible mobile working initiatives within the Cheshire East Council ICT Strategy. The adoption of such initiatives allows the organisation to tackle issues of accommodation, staff well-being and service delivery. To do this, the researcher uses a mixture of inductive and deductive approaches (supported by a contemporary literature review and a conceptual model), in order to investigate the research aim. Following a phenomenological philosophy, the researcher “seeks an understanding of human behaviour” (Hagyard & Keenan, 2006; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al,</b> <b>2009,</b> p. 116) to support the investigation into the extent of staff operation transformation. The data collection for this study is achieved through a research strategy of a survey approach, in which the researcher employs the use of two questionnaires distributed to two groups of respondents. Employing the methodological considerations from Chapter 3 leads the researcher to believe that the extent of staff operation transformation at this stage (year 1) is substantial. The researcher deduces this as the majority of employees adapt their work practices to suit working in a flexible, mobile manner. Staff efficiency is increased, their work-life balance is improved, and, they now have a choice of where they work from. In addition, the organisation benefits from tangible changes, such as reduced sickness absence, reduced overall travel costs, and improved use of existing office space.

30|$|Our {{findings}} support the systematic review by <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2009),</b> which indicates that lithium may cause an increase in serum calcium levels. Our study also supports the results by Mak et al. (1998), which demonstrated that patients with affective disorders on lithium therapy show significantly elevated parathyroid hormone levels starting at 6 months of lithium treatment and maintaining them {{until the end of}} the study at 24 months compared to baseline. In contrast to Mak et al. (1998), in our study, Aac concentrations were also significantly increased in the lithium group compared to the non-lithium group. However, in the study by Mak et al. (1998), Aac concentration was numerically highest at the end of the study period (i.e., at 24 months). In our study, the patients in the lithium group were on lithium for an average of 157.70 ± 114.64 months. Therefore, with increasing length of lithium intake, the hypercalcemic properties of iPTH may dominate and may have contributed to this significant increase in Aac concentrations compared to the control group (non-lithium treated patients) in our study. In addition, neither Aac concentrations were increased in individuals with elevated iPTH levels nor was there a positive significant correlation between iPTH levels and Aac concentrations in the lithium group, as has been shown in lithium-independent normocalcemic or hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism (Shlapack and Rizvi 2012; Silverberg and Bilezikian 2003). In contrast, calcium levels were exclusively predicted by group affiliation. These findings strongly argue in favor of the idea, as suggested by Mak et al. (1998), that lithium may modulate the direct hypercalcemic action of iPTH by its iPTH-independent direct actions on organs affecting calcium metabolism, such as the kidney and the bones. In the study by Mak et al. (1998), fasting urinary calcium excretion was decreased throughout the study period compared to the baseline. As alkaline phosphatase was unchanged, this may hint to decreased bone resorption (the opposite of the expected physiological effect of increased iPTH levels) and may have contributed to the statistically unchanged Aac concentrations throughout the study period. In this context, it seems noteworthy that in a case–control study, adjusted for psychotropic drug use, lithium treatment was associated with a decreased risk of fractures potentially pointing at bone anabolic properties (Vestergaard et al. 2005).|$|E

40|$|Within {{qualitative}} research choice of research participants is, invariably, constrained {{by what is}} practicable. Whilst {{in an ideal world}} we may wish to collect data from participants in a particular organization or a number of organizations, our abilities to do this are dependent upon gaining access to these organizations and our intended participants, as well as being granted permission to collect the data we require. Once physical access has been granted and permission obtained (Gummesson, 2000), whilst occasionally {{it may be possible to}} collect data from the total population, for example all an organization’s employees; for most research projects this will be impossible. As a condition of our access, our potential population of research participants may be constrained to a smaller sub group. The resources we have available to support our research may also constrain the amount of data we can collect and analyse, almost invariably resulting in it only being practicable to collect data from a sample of our population of research participants (Fink, 2003; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2009</b> a). Consequently for virtually all {{qualitative research}} it will be necessary to consider carefully how we will choose those research participants, our sample, from whom we will collect data to answer our research question and meet our research aim. This chapter takes as its starting premise that there is a clear connection between our research aim and our research design (Kvale and Brinkmann, 2009). Our choice of research participants should be determined by the focus of our research, thereby enabling us to meet of our research aim and answer our research question. Choosing research participants is likely to be difficult until we are clear regarding the focus of our research. The chapter commences with a discussion of the main concerns and debates associated with choosing participants for qualitative organisational research. Within this I consider the importance of gaining access, the need for the sample to enable collection of appropriate data, the use of different non-probability sample selection techniques and the number of participants needed. These are illustrated subsequently by two examples drawn from my own and colleagues’ research experiences. The first focuses on selection of a single case study, issues of access and purposive sampling techniques. The second explores the use of a self-selection sample to choose participants drawn from a variety of organizations, and issues associated with sample size.

40|$|Predicting the {{positions}} of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) requires a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic nature of the atmosphere. For objects in LEO the most significant orbit perturbation is atmospheric drag, which {{is a function of}} the local atmospheric density from a layer in the atmosphere called the thermosphere. For long-term predictions of satellite orbits and ephemerides, any density trend in the thermosphere is a necessary consideration, not only for satellite operators, but also for studies of the future LEO environment in terms of space debris. Numerous studies of long-term thermospheric density change have been performed. Predictions by Roble & Ramesh (2002), along with evidence by Keating (2000), Emmert et al. (2004), Marcos et al. (2005), Qian et al. (2006) and Emmert et al. (2008), strongly suggest the existence of such a phenomenon. Therefore, the objective of the research presented in this thesis is to provide a novel method to evaluate quantitatively thermospheric density change. Satellite drag data is an effective medium through which one can investigate local thermospheric density and changes thereof. There are many ways of determining atmospheric density, but inferring thermospheric density from satellite drag data is a relatively cost-effective way of gathering in-situ measurements. To do this, knowledge about a satellite’s physical properties that are intrinsic to atmospheric drag is required. A study by <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2009)</b> highlighted problems with estimating a satellite’s physical properties directly from data given explicitly by Two-Line Element (TLE) sets. This prompted an investigation into ways to estimate ballistic coefficients: a required satellite parameter associated with drag coefficient and area-to-mass ratio. A novel way of estimating satellite ballistic coefficients was derived and is presented in this thesis. Additionally, novel consideration of atmospheric chemical composition was applied on long-term drag coefficient variability. Using a quantitative estimate of a ballistic coefficient one can propagate numerically a satellite’s orbit and predict the effects of atmospheric drag. Given an initial satellite orbit from TLE data, one approach is to use an orbital propagator to predict the satellite’s state at some time ahead and then to compare that state with TLE data at the same epoch. The difference between the semi-major axes of the initial orbit and that after the orbit propagation is then integrated and can be used to estimate the global average density. The method employed in this study utilises this process. To achieve this, a specially developed, computer-based, numerical orbital propagator was written in the programming language C/C++. The underlying theories and implementation tests for this propagator are presented in this thesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} control systems (MCS) concept has evolved significantly the past decades with extensive studies that explore {{not only the}} concept itself but as well its relation to diverse variables such as performance, innovativeness and organisational learning. Nonetheless, inaccuracy is still present according to some researchers. (Tessier & Otley, 2012; Ferreira & Otley, 2009) By means of a systematic review (Tranfield et al., 2003), an interpretive analysis that embodies academic literatures in the area is presented. As a result, this thesis provides a synthesis delineation of the interactive {{management control}} systems’ concept. For {{the purpose of the}} study, a systematic selection of published and non-published academic literatures was conducted. (<b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2009).</b> Simons (Levers of control. Boston, Mass. : Harvard Business School Press, 1995) was used as a starting point in order to generate criteria for the subsequent identification of relevant sources and get a grounding understanding of the topic before taking the challenge in form of a literature review in order to establish a distinction of the concept. This paper differs from prior studies in the field because of its attempt to clarify the concept of interactive control systems in a systematic manner which will allow the reader to have a see-through approach on all the procedures undertaken for the study. 111 articles were retrieved and following screening and abstract analysis 17 studies (including Simons, 1995 and Bisbe et al., 2005) were selected for the discussion of this qualitative literature review. In contrast to the existing literatures in the MCS field, I conceptualise the findings in 2 categories order to distinct the concepts of interactive MCS from interactive use of MCS. The main contribution of the study is the finding that {{there is a difference between}} interactive control systems and interactive use of control systems. Interactive MCS as such has a functionalist view and are designed to deliver interactiveness regardless of the context or the actors. And interactive use of control systems concerns the enactment of any control systems in an interactive manner. Therefore, the context (innovative environment) and the actor are taken into account in order for the systems to deliver positive effects. In addition, Evidences show that the interactive MCS as such are progressive instruments and characterised by effective and regular discussion among the users. Which lead to positive effects on strategy, workplace and innovation. Interactive use of MCS on the other hand are desirable in a context of R&D where the actor have required knowledge to facility the enactment. Additionally, MCS field interpret the concept of ICS more as interactive use of MCS than as such as interactive control system. When it comes to the connection to innovation, findings are contradictory as there are both positive and negative effects on business variables such innovation. ...|$|E

Furthermore, lithium is listed as one of the causes of primary hyperparathyroidism, a biochemical syndrome characterized by increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from one or more of the parathyroid glands (Sitges-Serra and Bergenfelz 2007; Broome and Solorzano 2011). Most cases are sporadic in nature and caused by a single adenoma (85 %– 95 %) or multiglandular disease (5 %– 10 %) (Sitges-Serra and Bergenfelz 2007). In case of lithium treatment, a decrease in parathyroid sensitivity to calcium has been suggested as the principal mechanism of action for the increased secretion of parathyroid hormone resulting in hypercalcemia, the biochemical hallmark of primary hyperparathyroidism (Haden et al. 1997). Consequently, monitoring calcium levels before initiating lithium therapy and every 6 months thereafter has been suggested as the primary screening parameter for lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism (Livingstone and Rampes 2006; Broome and Solorzano 2011). If calcium levels are found to be elevated, measuring intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels has been recommended as the next step (Livingstone and Rampes 2006). According to the ‘International Group for The Study of Lithium Treated Patients’[*], between 10 % and 42 % of patients on lithium therapy develop hypercalcemia and up to 29 % develop hyperparathyroidism (Schleicher and Kampf 2013). The available data show that most of the studies conducted so far are case control studies, and none of the studies focus exclusively on patients with bipolar disorders in the test or control groups (<b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2009).</b> In general, the number of participants included in these studies is relatively small, and only a few of these studies employed parathyroid test systems complying with today's quality standards (Souberbielle et al. 2006). In addition, one of the more recent studies suggests that following 6 months of lithium treatment, patients have significantly increased parathyroid hormone concentrations without an increase in serum calcium levels (Mak et al. 1998). This ‘normocalcemic’ subtype of lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism will consequently remain unrecognized if calcium is used as the sole and primary screening instrument as is currently recommended. Interestingly, in a community-based cohort of elderly men, higher (and high normal) plasma PTH levels were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality in the absence of hypercalcemia (Hagstrom et al. 2009). Missing these cases of isolated higher parathyroid levels is of particular concern as bipolar disorder per se is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (Fiedorowicz et al. 2008). Furthermore, additional studies suggest an association between elevated parathyroid hormone levels and cognitive deficits in the absence of hypercalcemia (Jorde et al. 2006; Roman et al. 2005). Therefore, we set out to answer the following hypotheses: [...]...|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} Digital Identity investigates how {{particular}} groups of adults {{over the age}} of 30 use Facebook and Twitter to share personal information online. The research explores whether individuals construct their identity in the same way in a digital context as they do in the ‘real world’. The study examines voluntary sharing of information rather than information collected and collated by third parties, approaching the research from an individual’s point of view to create, not just a footprint, but a Digital Identity. This study explores the notion of Identity, and establishes the common characteristics and differences between the concepts of Identity Theory (Burke & Stets 2009), Social Identity Theory (Tajfel 1959, 1963, 1969) and Impression Management (Goffman 1956); and how they relate to the digital self. There are overlapping elements of identity formation that influence the way individuals create themselves through Role, the self, Audience, and Symbols. The importance of role, emphasized in all theories of identity, is used as the context for this study. The participants came from three different groups: Academics, Stay-at-home Parents and Business Executives. The phenomenon of identity is personal and needs to be conducted at a close and subjective level. Interpretivism is crucial to understand our individual differences as social actors and to allow us to interpret the everyday social roles in accordance with the meaning given to those roles (<b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2009).</b> The strategy of the study is ethnographic, taking the researcher close to the ‘reality’ of people’s lives (Becker and Greer 1960) using interviews and observations. By investigating people’s use of Facebook and Twitter the research interprets how individuals formed their Digital Identity. The analysis framework for this investigation is guided by the work of Klein and Myers (1999, p. 72) with their principles of the hermeneutic circle; contextualization; interaction between the researchers and the subjects; abstraction and generalization; dialogical reasoning; multiple interpretations and suspicion steering the analysis. The three groups, Academics, Stay-at-home Parents and Business Executives, have very different ways of approaching how they presented themselves online. The findings of this research illustrate that individuals form a Digital Identity in a similar way to Identity Theory with the self, Audience, Role and Symbols all being important. Individuals claim that they are presenting their ‘real’ selves online although they create specific social rules. The audience is no longer definable and mediated but is one block of known and unknown people. Individuals create their identity {{in the same way as}} they do in the real world but there are external factors that influence their presentation of self. The fundamental difference in the way that Digital Identity is formed is the interaction with the technology. This difference forms the basis of the beginnings of a Theory of Digital Identity which states that while the elements of role, self, symbols and audience are all used to create Digital Identity they do so in the context of smart technology that interacts and distorts Identity. So while individuals create their identity in the same way as they do in the ‘real world’ they have the addition of external factors that influence their presentation of self...|$|E
40|$|Strategic {{planning}} {{has been}} used extensively both in the private {{as well as in}} the public sector to improve the performance of organisations. This study examines the strategic planning practices carried out in the high-performing banking industry in the Indonesian context. Although the importance of strategic planning, organisational context, and organisational performance has been acknowledged in academic and practitioner literature, only limited studies examine the strategic planning practices and their interrelationship with organisational context, and organisational performance. To the best of the researcher’s knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the issue in the case of Indonesia. A qualitative research approach was adopted as the framework for this study. This study seeks to explore and document the strategic planning practices (changes) in the high-performing banking industry and the role of organisational context to facilitate strategic planning. The data collection method employed in-depth semi-structured and unstructured interviews of both key informants (managers, heads of planning departments, and planning members) as well as non-planning members in each identified organisation. Documents were analysed to validate and add to the interview data. The research was carried out between May 2011 and February 2012 for the first period of data collection and during September 2012 to the end of October 2012 for the second period of data collection in six high-performing banks in Indonesia. The six banks were selected because of their engagement in strategic planning and their high performance status. Research reports from a panel of industry experts were used to first define a bank as high performing in the first instance, and then to select the six highest performing banks for the study. The field data were collected and then analysed using the six steps suggested by Creswell (2009). A systematic approach as recommended by Braun and Clarke (2013), <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2009),</b> and Yin (2009), and Opperman et al. (2013) was also utilised for identifying, analysing, and describing patterns and themes across a dataset to enrich steps suggested by Creswell to strengthen and sharpen the data analysis in this case study. This study has provided valuable findings regarding the strategic planning practices in the Indonesian banking industry: key findings include the fact that all six banks in this study have accomplished all the common strategic planning activities presented in this study, the fundamental role of the CEOs in strategic planning has been proven, and managers’ commitment to and involvement in the strategic planning process (particularly managers in the division of strategic planning and planning members) has been identified, among other relevant findings. This study then presented a number of research agenda that need to be dealt with such as: First, future research can replicate this study by investigating across industries including private, government, non-profit organisation, and small medium enterprises to observe whether comparable results can be reached. Second, further research that investigating strategic planning practices across countries is needed. Third, formal strategic planning systems in which flexibility was limited had led the banks to high organisational performance. Therefore, further empirical research is needed that seek to compare each planning approach against organisational performance in relatively stable business environments...|$|E

Obesity-associated hypothalamic inflammation was first reported in a rat model of diet-induced obesity (De Souza <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2005), which was further confirmed by other groups (Zhang <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2008, Kleinridders <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2009,</b> Milanski <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2009,</b> Ozcan <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2009,</b> Posey <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2009,</b> Holland <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2011 a). The observation that genetic interventions that disrupt neuronal inflammation can block both obesity and hypothalamic leptin resistance during feeding with a high-fat diet supports such role of inflammation in NAFLD pathogenesis. Several signaling pathways of the innate immune system {{have been identified as}} candidate mediators of hypothalamic inflammation during high-fat diet feeding, including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS 3), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the induction of ER stress and autophagy defects (De Souza <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2005, Zhang <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2008, Kleinridders <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2009,</b> Milanski <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2009,</b> Ozcan <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2009,</b> Posey <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2009,</b> Holland <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2011 a).|$|R
