It is, however, formed as a synthesis <b>side</b> <b>product</b> when producing certain chlorophenols or chlorophenoxy acid herbicides. It may also be formed along with other polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofuranes in any burning, especially if certain metal catalysts such as copper are present (see dioxins and dioxin-like compounds).|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that phosphoramidites activated with 1H-tetrazole react, to a small extent, with the O6 position of guanosine. Upon oxidation with I2 /water, this <b>side</b> <b>product,</b> possibly via O6-N7 migration, undergoes depurination. The apurinic sites thus formed are readily cleaved {{in the course of}} the final deprotection of the oligonucleotide under the basic conditions (see below) to give two shorter oligonucleotides thus reducing the yield of the full-length product. The O6 modifications are rapidly removed by treatment with the capping reagent as long as the capping step is performed prior to oxidation with I2/water.|$|E
5|$|To furnish a {{functional}} oligonucleotide, all the protecting groups {{have to be}} removed. The N-acyl base protection and the 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection may be, and is often removed simultaneously by treatment with inorganic bases or amines. However, the applicability of this method {{is limited by the}} fact that the cleavage of 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection gives rise to acrylonitrile as a <b>side</b> <b>product.</b> Under the strong basic conditions required for the removal of N-acyl protection, acrylonitrile is capable of alkylation of nucleic bases, primarily, at the N3-position of thymine and uracil residues to give the respective N3-(2-cyanoethyl) adducts via Michael reaction. The formation of these side products may be avoided by treating the solid support-bound oligonucleotides with solutions of bases in an organic solvent, for instance, with 50% triethylamine in acetonitrile or 10% diethylamine in acetonitrile. This treatment is strongly recommended for medium- and large scale preparations and is optional for syntheses on small scale where the concentration of acrylonitrile generated in the deprotection mixture is low.|$|E

5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a <b>side</b> <b>product</b> of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} water content, sample concentration and reaction time on anthocyanidin from degradation of proanthocyanidin and <b>side</b> <b>products</b> was studied by high performance liquid chromatography diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Proanthocyanidin was extracted from calyces of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza by 70 % acetone solvent, purified by Sephadex LH- 20 column chromatography, and {{was prepared to}} reaction solvents with different water content and sample concentration, then was analyzed with the butanol/HCl method. In addition, the <b>products</b> and <b>side</b> <b>products</b> were characterized by HPLC-DAD. The yield of anthocyanidin was increased with the increasing the water content (from 5 % to 15 %) of reaction solvents, but the yield of <b>side</b> <b>products</b> was declined. When the water content was above 15 %, the yield of anthocyanidin and <b>side</b> <b>products</b> was decreased with the increasing the water content. However, there is no great effect of sample concentration and reaction time on the yield of anthocyanidin and <b>side</b> <b>products.</b> HPLC-DAD is a powerful method {{for the analysis of}} the content and structure unit of proanthocyanidin...|$|R

25|$|Camphor can be {{produced}} from alpha-pinene, which is abundant in the oils of coniferous trees and can be distilled from turpentine produced as a <b>side</b> <b>product</b> of chemical pulping. With acetic acid as the solvent and with catalysis by a strong acid, alpha-pinene readily rearranges into camphene, which in turn undergoes Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement into the isobornyl cation, which is captured by acetate to give isobornyl acetate. Hydrolysis into isoborneol followed by oxidation gives racemic camphor. By contrast, camphor occurs naturally as D-camphor, the (R)-enantiomer.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the atomic}} radii (e.g. in Fig. 4) are only {{slightly}} less than the distance between bonded atoms, the iconic spheres intersect, and in the CPK models, this was achieved by planar truncations along the bonding directions, the section being circular.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{technological}} methane production methods. Methane created from biomass in industrial plants via biological route is called biogas.
