40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{two types}} of alternating current (ac) generators that are becoming popular for use in small-scale distributed generation and in autonomous (or standalone) power systems. For the induction generator (IG), two modes of operation are identified, namely operation on the power grid and operation in the isolated mode. Single-phase operation is emphasized due to its applicability in remote rural regions where electrification is both costly and difficult to carry out. In the case of gridconnected operation, a number of practical phase-balancing schemes for a three-phase IG are proposed and analyzed. The method of symmetrical components {{is found to be}} a versatile tool for analyzing all the circuit configurations to be studied, including the Smith connection. Microcontroller-based multi-mode operation of an IG with the Smith connection is also investigated. When operated in the stand-alone mode, the IG is more commonly known as the selfexcited induction generator (SEIG). In this thesis, a unified approach that combines the method of symmetrical components and the pattern search method of Hooke and Jeeves is used to analyze a three-phase SEIG which supplies asymmetrical or single-phase loads. Its applicability is tested on various SEIG schemes, including the Steinmetz connection, modified Steinmetz connection (MSC), the simplified Steinmetz connection (SSC), the self-regulated self-excited induction generator (SRSEIG), and SEIG with the Smith connection (SMSEIG). For certain studies, the above approach is used in association with an iterative procedure in order to obtain the solution. A coupled circuit and field approach based on a two-dimensional finite element method (2 -D FEM) is proposed for analyzing a grid-connected IG with the Steinmetz connection. The technique of coupling the <b>single-phase</b> <b>circuit</b> equations to the field domain equations is set forth and a rotor circuit model that accounts for the nonuniform current distribution in the rotor winding is also presented. A voltage and frequency control scheme that employs an SEIG with slip-ring rotor, namely the SESRIG, is also proposed and investigated. The feasibility of using an external rotor resistance as a control parameter is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally. The study on the permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is focused on autonomous power system applications. A PMSG with inset rotor, which possesses an inverse saliency characteristic, is found to give satisfactory performance when supplying isolated loads. Zero voltage regulation and other extremum conditions are deduced based on the two-axis model. A saturated two-axis model that gives a more accurate prediction of the load characteristic is developed. For a more rigorous analysis, a coupled circuit and field, time-stepping 2 -D FEM is also proposed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the influences of arcing and conductor deflection due to magnetic forces on the accuracy of fault locator algorithms in electrical distribution networks. The work also explores the possibilities of using the properties of an arc to identify two specific types of faults that may occur on an overhead distribution line. A new technique using the convolution operator is introduced for deriving differential equation algorithms. The first algorithm was derived by estimating the voltage as an array of impulse functions while the second algorithm was derived using a piecewise linear voltage signal. These algorithms were tested on a simulated <b>single-phase</b> <b>circuit</b> using a PI-model line. It was shown that the second algorithm gave identical results as the existing dynamic integration operator type algorithm. The first algorithm used a transformation to a three-phase circuit that did not require any matrix calculations as an equivalent sequence component circuit is utilised for a single-phase to ground fault. A simulated arc was used to test the influence of the non-linearity of an arc on the accuracy of this algorithm. The simulations showed that the variation in the resistance due to arcing causes large oscillations of the algorithm output and a 40 th order mean filter was used to increase the accuracy and stability of the algorithm. The same tests were performed on a previously developed fault locator algorithm that includes a square-wave power frequency proximation of the fault arc. This algorithm gave more accurate and stable results even with large arc length variations. During phase-to-phase fault conditions, two opposing magnetic fields force the conductors outwards away from each other and this movement causes a change in the total inductance of the line. A three dimensional finite element line model based on standard wave equations but incorporating magnetic forces was used to evaluate this phenomenon. The results show that appreciable errors in the distance estimations can be expected especially on poorly tensioned di stribution lines. New techniques were also explored that are based on identification of the fault arc. Two methods were successfully tested on simulated networks to identify a breakingconductor. The methods are based on the rate of increase in arc length during the breaking of the conductor. The first method uses arc voltage increase as the basis of the detection while the second method make use of the increase in the non-linearity of the network resistance to identify a breaking conductor. An unsuccessful attempt was made to identifying conductor clashing caused by high winds: it was found that too many parameters influence the separation speed of the two conductors. No unique characteristic could be found to identify the conductor clashing using the speed of conductor separation. The existing algorithm was also used to estimate the voltage in a distribution network during a fault for power quality monitoring purposes...|$|E

Its objective is to estimate node voltage waveforms in a network after it has been subject to an electromagnetic transient. This work focuses on TSE using the numerical integrator substitution (NIS) method to model the system transients. The objective of this work is to further extend TSE with NIS, to include non-linear and distributed parameter elements. The intended application for TSE is to serve as an analysis tool for post-disturbance root cause analysis.
