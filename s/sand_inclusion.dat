It uses geometric reasoning for automating the design of casting methods elements - cores, mold cavity layout, feeders, feedaids and gating channels. Fast and intelligent simulation technology is employed to visualize mold filling and casting solidification in near-real time. Foundry engineers can quickly import a 3D model of cast part, create methods elements, simulate the casting, predict internal defects (like shrinkage porosity and <b>sand</b> <b>inclusion),</b> and modify the methods design to improve quality and yield. Product designers can improve the casting design for manufacturability by minor modifications, such as fillets at junctions. This enables better compatibility between part requirements and process capability, leading to zero defects.|$|E

Recent research has applied existing acoustic scattering models to predict ultrasonic attenuation in relatively simple cement-based materials with good results. The goal of the current research is to extend this past work and to investigate the influence of elastic inclusions in order to simulate a more realistic microstructure: a cement paste matrix material that contains both <b>sand</b> <b>inclusions</b> and air voids. The <b>sand</b> <b>inclusions</b> simulate fine aggregates as they are present in real civil engineering structures, while the air voids provide an additional microstructure that is present in concrete components. This research considers an independent scattering model as well as a self-consistent effective medium theory approach in order to model the scattering attenuation due to the <b>sand</b> <b>inclusions</b> in the cement paste matrix. The research develops a reliable measurement technique essential to assess the wave attenuation of the particulate materials. Subsequently, the ultrasonic wave attenuation is measured in cement paste specimens of various types. The measured attenuation is then compared to the model predictions and the results are discussed.

40|$|Lamellar {{cast iron}} {{is a very}} {{important}} technical alloy and the most used material in the casting production, and especially in the automotive industry which is the major consumer. Beside the many great properties, it is inclined to form casting defects of which some can be prevented, and some may be repaired subsequently. Shrinkage porosity is a randomly returning problem, which is difficult to understand and to avoid. This defect is a volumetric deficiency which appear as cavities inside the casting in connection to the casting surface. Another frequent defect is the metal expansion penetration. This defect is a material surplus squeezed to the casting surface containing <b>sand</b> <b>inclusion</b> from the mold material. Shrinkage porosity is usually mentioned together with metal expansion penetration as the formation mechanism of both defects have common roots. It is also generally agreed, that these type of defects are related to the volumetric changes occurring during solidification. Additionally, the formation of these defects are in connection with the coherency of the primary austenite dendrites. The purpose of this work was to develop knowledge on factors affecting a volume-change related casting defect formation in order to minimize the presence of these defects in engine component production. This was done by extending the existing solidification investigation methods with novel solutions. Introduction of expansion force measurement in the determination of dendrite coherency combined with multi axial volume change measurement refine the interpretation of the solidification. Comparison of registered axial and radial linear deformation in cylindrical samples indicated an anisotropic volume change. Different methods for dendrite coherency determination have been compared. It was shown that the coherency develops over an interval. Dependent on the added inoculant the coherency is reached at different levels of fractions of a solidified primary phase. It is also shown, that inoculation has an effect on the nucleation and growth of the primary phase. Quantitative image analysis has been performed on the primary phase in special designed samples designed to provoke shrinkage porosity and metal expansion penetration. It was found, that the inter-dendritic space varies within a casting. This was explained by the coarsening of the primary dendrites which originates from differences in the local time of solidification. QC 20131210 </p...|$|E

Copyright © 2015 CRCPress/BalkemaBecause of its {{favorable}} {{creep properties}} and low gas permeability, salt rock {{is viewed as}} an attractive host medium for nuclear waste disposals and natural resources storage. Under high stress and temperature conditions, diffusive mass transfer in salt rock can result in crack rebonding and strength recovery. In order to track the evolution of voids between salt crystals with lower load levels but higher healing rates than what is practically encountered in underground storage, we carried out creep loading tests on table salt. We used different loading conditions and inclusion materials to study the potential recurrence of topological patterns at grain boundaries. We developed a dedicated multi-stage image processing procedure to enhance microscopic image quality, and presented a slicing method to track the evolution of microstructure in different sections of the sample. This allowed us to analyze not only the evolution of average void size and orientation, but also {{the evolution of the}} fabric. We found that creep deformation is due to pore shrinkage along a diagonal direction across the sample, without significant grain rearrangement.

40|$|ABSTRACT We present sedimentological {{observations}} from the Tiskilwa Till in northern Illinois, and the Sky Pilot Till in northern Manitoba, that indicate deposition of these tills by subglacial defor-mation. These generally homogenous tills grade downward into more heterogeneous tills that incorporate underlying sediment into their matrix, indicating entrainment of older sediments by sediment defor-mation. Deformed <b>sand</b> <b>inclusions</b> within these tills imply deformation of the tills and inclusions prior to deposition. The Tiskilwa Till has rela-tively high fabric strength throughout its thickness, whereas fabric {{strength in the}} Sky Pilot Till generally increases up-section in 2 to 3 m thick increments. Fabric orientations in both tills rotate up-section, possibly due to changes in ice-flow direction associated with the thic-kening and thinning of ice, and changes in ice-flow divide location. In both the Tiskilwa and Sky Pilot Tills, the change in fabric orientation occurs over intervals of ~ 1 m, suggesting that the maximum depth of deformation was ≤ 1 m insofar as any greater depth of deformation would have reoriented till fabric during maximum ice extent and retreat. In {{the case of the}} Sky Pilot Till, the up-section increase in macrofabric strength indicates that strain increased up-section. These data suggest that these tills were deposited in a time transgressive manner as strain migrated upwards with the delivery of new till either released from the ice base or advected from up-ice.

ABSTRACT: Reports of many functional deficiencies are these days rampant in many aluminium products flooding the Nigeria markets. These emanate from the local aluminium manufacturing, cottage foundry industries and much more from goods imported in the country. The study investigates the metallurgical properties of as-received and cast aluminium alloy samples used in the floating piston/calliper of the automobile hydraulic master brake cylinder. Commercially available aluminium alloy is procured from which callipers were cast and characterised. The study compares the physical properties by Hardness test, microstructural properties using high resolution metallurgical microscope, X-Ray Diffraction, chemical composition using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. The as-received samples are characterised by poor metallurgical qualities such as variation in weight and density, low HBN, low tensile strength, high porosity and <b>sand</b> <b>inclusions</b> from the previous poor casting practices, hence abnormalities result under usage. The aluminium alloy was technically cast at pouring temperature higher than 750 oC using sand mould of high permeability. The casting gave higher HBN values of eutectic-AlSi structured aluminium alloy.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} micromechanical {{modeling of}} materials using computational homogenization. On this topic, theoretical and computational issues are discussed, and numerical investigations of different material systems are performed. The material systems considered are; metal matrix composites, metal sheets with stiff inclusions, metal sheets containing voids, <b>sand</b> with <b>inclusions</b> of gravel and <b>sand</b> with <b>inclusions</b> of clay. A numerical tool suitable when modeling complex micromechanical systems is developed and evaluated. A homogenization technique, using a representative volume element (RVE) {{is the foundation}} of the method. To be able to handle large problem sizes a parallel solution scheme is developed. A speedup investigation shows good performance of the implementation. Different boundary conditions acting on the representative volume element are shown to affect the overall response significantly. The numerical tool is in the following work used to solve problems where the behavior of heterogeneous material systems is investigated on a local and on a global scale. Anisotropic effects originating from considering heterogeneous material structures are studied for a material system consisting of a metal matrix containing stiffer inclusions. For plane strain conditions this material system represents a metal matrix composite and for plane stress conditions it is representing a metal sheet with stiff inclusions. A Bauschinger effect as well as anisotropic hardening characteristics is found despite the solely isotropic material models used on the local level. The formability of voided metal sheets is studied using a plane stress assumption. The size dependence of the formability of voided metal sheets is investigated using a nonlocal material model containing a constitutive material length scale. It is found that the formability of the material system is dependent on the nonlocal material model. Changes in the void distribution as well as in local material parameters are also found to have a large influence on the formability. Studies of soil systems, where a bulk of <b>sand</b> is containing <b>inclusions</b> of gravel or clay, are also conducted. The behavior of these systems is examined when altering the inclusion material, the inclusion shape and the bulk material properties.

40|$|In this work, a micromechanical {{model is}} used in order to predict the failure surface of cement {{concrete}} subject to multi-axial compression. In the adopted model, the concrete material is schematised as a composite with the following constituents: coarse aggregate (gravel), fine aggregate (sand) and cement paste. The cement paste contains some voids which grow during the loading process. In fact, the non-linear behavior of the concrete is attributed {{to the creation of}} cracks in the cement paste; the effect of the cracks is taken into account by introducing equivalent voids (inclusions with zero stiffness) in the cement paste. The three types of <b>inclusions</b> (namely gravel, <b>sand</b> and voids) have different scales, so that the overall behavior of the concrete is obtained by the composition of three different homogenizations; {{in the sense that the}} concrete is regarded as the homogenized material of the two-phase composite constituted of the gravel and the mortar; in turn, the mortar is the homogenized material of the two-phase composite constituted of the <b>sand</b> <b>inclusions</b> and a (porous) cement paste matrix; finally, the (porous) cement paste is the homogenized material of the two-phase composite constituted of voids and the pure paste. The pure paste represents the cement paste before the loading process, so that it does not contain voids or other defects due to the loading process. The abovementioned three homogenizations are realized with the predictive scheme of Mori-Tanaka in conjunction with the Eshelby method. The adopted model can be considered an attempt to find micromechanical tools able to capture peculiar aspects of the cement concrete in load cases of uni-axial and multi-axial compression. Attributing the non-linear behavior of concrete to the creation of equivalent voids in the cement paste provides correspondence with many phenomenological aspects of concrete behavior. Trying to improve this correspondence, the influence of the parameters of the evolution law of the equivalent voids in the cement paste is investigated, showing how the parameters affect the uni-axial stress-strain curve and the failure surfaces in bi-axial and tri-axial compression...|$|R

40|$|The Reactive Powder Concretes (RPC), {{composed}} of Portland cement, silica fume, crushed quartz, fine sand and steel fibres, exhibit a very dense microstructure which limits the penetration of aggressive agents. They appear {{suitable for the}} storage of nuclear waste. This study aimed to determine experimentally {{the evolution of the}} RPC microstructure during a leaching attack by pure water, and to supply data required for the RPC long-term prediction of durability under these severe conditions. The steel fibres and mineral <b>inclusions</b> (<b>sand</b> and quartz) were considered as inert materials in the degradation process. Thus RPC matrices, and also a pure cement paste, and a cement and silica fume paste, were studied. The materials were characterised before and after a leaching test: microstructure by means of scanning electron microscopy, porosity, chemical and mineralogical composition, and diffusivity. A superficial degradation proceeds along a straight leaching front related to the dissolution of the remaining anhydrous cement silicates (C 3 S & C 2 S). The leaching of mineral species is controlled by the ionic diffusions from the material towards the aggressive solution. The degradation kinetics is proportional to the square root of time. As long as a sound core remains, the global behaviour of the partly degraded material is determined by the properties of the sound core. Two models related to the matrix transformation were used: DIFFU-Ca which characterised the leaching of calcium, and the 3 D computer simulation of Portland cement hydration and microstructure development, from BENTZ & GARBOCZI. The digital results show a good agreement with the experimental values. This validates the hydration rates predicted with BENTZ & GARBOCZI and the phenomenology implemented in DIFFU-Ca. At the end of the study, it could be said that RPC appears as a suitable candidate for nuclear waste storage.
