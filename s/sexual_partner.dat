5|$|With The Birds a box-office success, Hitchcock and Hedren {{begin work}} on Marnie. However, Hedren finds the film's content (including a marital-rape scene) and Hitchcock's {{obsession}} with her mentally and emotionally exhausting. The director is frustrated {{by what he}} sees as Hedren's coldness towards him. During a conversation with writer Evan Hunter, Hitchcock admits that he has erectile dysfunction and his only <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> is his wife (screenwriter Alma Reville). He later declares his love for Hedren; she walks away, leaving him frustrated and further rejected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Three studies (N= 329) using U. S. {{community}} samples {{examined the}} relative contributions of self-reported “sex, ” gender identity, and {{actual number of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> to the question how many <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> individuals desire over the lifetime. In Study 1, the more “feminine ” a participant identified, not self-reported sex, was significant-ly related to the desired number of <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b> Study 2 a showed that a person’s actual number of <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> also correlated with the desired number. In Study 3, Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) (Bem Psychological Review, 88 : 354 – 364 1981) femininity scores and actual number of <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> significantly predicted desired number of <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> separately for men and women. These results suggest that non-evolutionary variables drive the “problem of number ” in mate preference...|$|R
25|$|A nonscientific survey {{conducted}} in 2007 by condom-maker Durex measured promiscuity by a {{total number of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b> The survey found Austrian men had {{the highest number of}} sex partners of males globally with 29.3 <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> on average. New Zealand women had the highest number of sex partners for females in the world with an average of 20.4 <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b> In all of the countries surveyed, except New Zealand, men reported more <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> than women.|$|R

5|$|The {{abundance}} of nerve endings in the clitoris, {{the majority of}} which exist specifically for sexual enjoyment, make it the human female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. Sexual stimulation of the clitoris can produce female sexual arousal and orgasm, and may be achieved by masturbation or with a <b>sexual</b> <b>partner.</b> The most effective sexual stimulation of the organ is usually through manual or oral stimulation (cunnilingus), {{often referred to as}} direct clitoral stimulation; in cases involving sexual penetration, these activities may also be referred to as additional or assisted clitoral stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Globally, condoms are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a <b>sexual</b> <b>partner.</b> Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E
5|$|Crowley's {{inheritance}} {{was running}} out. Trying to earn money, {{he was hired}} by George Montagu Bennett, the Earl of Tankerville, to help protect him from witchcraft; recognising Bennett's paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction, Crowley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuperate. In 1907, he also began taking in paying students, whom he instructed in occult and magical practice. Victor Neuburg, whom Crowley met in February 1907, became his <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> and closest disciple; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to Tangier, Morocco. The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine, where he and Crowley engaged in sadomasochism. Crowley continued to write prolifically, producing such works of poetry as Ambergris, Clouds Without Water, and Konx Om Pax, as well as his first attempt at an autobiography, The World's Tragedy. Recognising the popularity of short horror stories, Crowley wrote his own, some of which were published, and he also published several articles in Vanity Fair, a magazine edited by his friend Frank Harris. He also wrote Liber 777, a book of magical and Qabalistic correspondences that borrowed from Mathers and Bennett.|$|E

The global average number of <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> is nine. Thais have sex with 10.6 different people on average during their lifetime.|$|R
50|$|Sperm {{competition}} risk also influences males' {{choice of}} female partners. Men {{prefer to have}} as low of a sperm competition risk as possible, and they therefore tend to choose short-term <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> {{who are not in}} a sexual relationship with other men. Women who are perceived as the most desirable short-term <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> are those who are not in a committed relationship and who also do not have casual <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> while women who are in a committed long-term relationship are the least desirable partners. Following the above, women who are at an intermediate risk of sperm competition, that is women who are not in a long-term relationship but who do engage in short-term mating or have casual <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> are considered intermediate in desirability for short-term <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b>|$|R
50|$|The same {{observation}} can {{be applied}} more generally to social networks defined by other relations than friendship: for instance, most people's <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> have had (on the average) {{a greater number of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> than they have.|$|R
5|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{the major}} mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV {{are present in the}} seminal fluid, which is passed from a male to his <b>sexual</b> <b>partner.</b> The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants appear that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.|$|E

25|$|It is {{recommended}} that <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> be tested and potentially treated.

5000|$|For {{those who}} are not monogamous, {{reducing}} the number of one's <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> particularly anonymous <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> may also reduce one's potential exposure to STIs.

25|$|Nudity {{in front}} of a <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> is widely accepted, but not in all cases.

25|$|Although SDN is much {{related to}} <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> {{preferences}} in males, {{it does not}} show the same relationship to partner preferences in females. Evidence shows that SDN in medial preoptic area is not the prerequisite {{for the expression of}} male-typical sexual behaviour and <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> preferences in females. One piece of evidence comes from the study on female Japanese macaque, which routinely court, mount (with pelvic thrust), compete for, and even prefer certain female sexual partners over certain males. The part of the brain examined is the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc), a homologue of SDN-POA. Comparison of the AHdc nucleus volumes between Japanese macaque and rhesus macaque (a closely related sister species of Japanese macaque) shows that there is {{no significant difference between the}} volume of AHdc in more male-typical macaques and that in female-typical macaques.|$|E

40|$|Background: While {{behavioral}} {{factors such}} as early age of sexual debut, inconsistent use of condoms and multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> have been studied in Africa, less is known about how characteristics such as impulsivity and externalizing behaviors relate to HIV-related sexual risk-taking in that region. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a culturally adapted behavioral disinhibition index in a sample of adolescents and young adults in Malawi. We then sought to examine the relationship between the index and sexual risk behavior as measured by multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> and number of lifetime <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b> Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from 2342 participants in rural Malawi aged 15 to 29 years. We constructed a disinhibitory behavior score (DBS) using questions assessing disinhibitory behaviors. Bivariate analyses were conducted to assess the relationships among the individual DBS component behaviors. We utilized multivariable logistic regression to determine the association of the DBS with multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> and negative binomial regression to model the relationship between the DBS and number of lifetime <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b> Findings: Nearly all the DBS component behaviors were significantly associated in the bivariate analyses. The DBS was associated with having multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> (OR 1. 97; 95 % CI 1. 57 – 2. 48) in the multivariable logistic regression analysis.
