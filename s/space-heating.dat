An average reduction {{of close to}} 90 % on uncontrolled manual time usage was recorded. This, when translated into the energy savings resulting from the markedly lower electrical fan-power consumptions and mechanically extracted <b>space-heat</b> requirements, revealed that a realistic saving of over Â£ 650 per fume cupboard variable cost (1989 prices) per annum could be made in circumstances where, previously, the fume cupboard had been largely (over 90 % of the time) left on. The cost of assembling and fitting the controllable equipment (all done on site) was such that the simple payback for the operation may be as short as two months. Realistic savings in excess of Â£ 20 000 per annum resulting from this exercise are estimated.

50|$|Where a <b>space-heating</b> {{water boiler}} is employed, the {{traditional}} arrangement in the UK {{is to use}} boiler-heated (primary) water to heat potable (secondary) water contained in a cylindrical vessel (usually made of copper)—which is supplied from a cold water storage vessel or container, usually in the roof space of the building. This produces a fairly steady supply of DHW (Domestic Hot Water) at low static pressure head but usually with a good flow.

40|$|Space heating is {{the largest}} energy end use, {{consuming}} more than 7 quintillion joules of site energy annually in the U. S. building sector. A few recent studies showed discrepancies in simulated <b>space-heating</b> energy use among different building energy modeling programs, and the simulated results are suspected to be underpredicting reality. While various uncertainties are associated with building simulations, especially when simulations are performed by different modelers using different simulation programs for buildings with different configurations, {{it is crucial to}} identify and evaluate key driving factors to <b>space-heating</b> energy use in order to support the design and operation of low-energy buildings. In this study, 10 design and operation parameters for <b>space-heating</b> systems of two prototypical office buildings in each of three U. S. heating climates are identified and evaluated, using building simulations with EnergyPlus, to determine the most influential parameters and their impacts on variations of <b>space-heating</b> energy use.

The simulated <b>space-heating</b> energy use is further benchmarked against those from similar actual office buildings in two U. S. commercial-building databases to better understand the discrepancies between simulated and actual energy use. In summary, variations of both the simulated and actual <b>space-heating</b> energy use of office buildings in all three heating climates can be very large. However these variations are mostly driven by a few influential parameters related to building design and operation.

40|$|The Manufactured Home Energy Audit (MHEA) is {{an energy}} audit tool {{designed}} specifically to identify recommended weatherization measures for mobile homes {{as part of the}} U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Weatherization Assistance Program. A field validation of MHEA was performed using billing/delivery data collected on 86 mobile homes heated primarily by electricity, natural gas, or propane to assess the audit's accuracy and the validity of its recommendations. The validation found that MHEA overpredicts the annual <b>space-heating</b> energy savings of weatherization measures to be installed in mobile homes, which leads to low realization rates, primarily because of its large overprediction of annual pre-weatherization <b>space-heating</b> energy consumption. However, MHEA's annual <b>space-heating</b> energy savings estimates and realization rates can be improved considerably using MHEA's built-in billing adjustment feature. In order to improve the accuracy of MHEA's annual <b>space-heating</b> energy savings estimates and realization rate, the cause of MHEA's overprediction of annual pre-weatherization <b>space-heating</b> energy consumption needs to be further investigated and corrected. Although MHEA's billing adjustment feature improved MHEA's annual <b>space-heating</b> energy savings estimates, alternative methods of making the correction that may provide improved performance should be investigated. In the interim period before permanent improvements to MHEA can be made, the following recommendations should be followed: (a) do not enter into MHEA insulation thicknesses of 1 in. or less and especially zero (0 in.) unless such low levels have been verified through visual inspection of several parts of the envelope area in question; (b) use MHEA's billing adjustment feature to develop a list of recommended measures based on adjusted energy savings if possible, especially in mobile homes that have several major energy deficiencies; and (c) do not use MHEA's "evaluate duct sealing" option at this time (although certainly seal all duct leaks and use diagnostics as appropriate to find leakage sites and quantify improvements) ...|$|E

The results have shown by increasing WWR from 5 % to 59 %, the winter months <b>space-heating</b> energy supply to the solid-wall detached house slightly decreases with triple vacuum glazed windows whilst a gradual rise was noticed with single glazed windows. A small increase in solar gains, i. e. 5. 6 kWh, was predicted for a room with a triple vacuum glazed window compared to a triple glazed air filled window. However, with similar increment to WWR, the house achieved higher solar gains with single glazed windows. The notable winter and annual <b>space-heating</b> energy savings of 14. 58 % (EUR 49. 2) and 15. 31 % (EUR 105. 4), respectively, were obtained with a solid-wall detached house retrofitted with triple vacuum glazed windows compared to single glazed windows. In the overall fabric heat loss, the heat loss calculations show a prominent reduction from 12. 92 % to 2. 69 % when replacing single glazed windows to triple vacuum glazed windows. However, the <b>space-heating</b> energy cost savings can be more significant when the solid-wall insulation is improved to 2010 UK building regulations.

Despite of significant achievements in the vacuum glazing science a practical benefit of retrofitting triple vacuum glazing to consumers in terms of energy saving is unclear, partly due to which it poses challenges in bringing vacuum glazing technology in the UK market for mass production. This research forms a part of novel contribution in vacuum glazing science presenting the refurbishment technology of an experimentally achievable thermal performance of triple vacuum glazing to existing UK solid wall dwelling by investigating inter-dependent performance of triple vacuum glazing on to the solid wall insulation, in comparison to triple air-filled glazing. Dynamic thermal modelling and steady state analyses were carried out. From the transient model simulations, an annual <b>space-heating</b> load input to an un-insulated solid wall house retrofitted with triple air-filled glazed windows and triple vacuum glazed windows were predicted to be 23883. 6 kWh (84. 92 %) and 23320. 5 kWh (84. 47 %). With a similar comparison but to an externally insulated solid walls, the heat load inputs were predicted to be 10995. 7 kWh (72. 18 %) and 10309. 1 kWh (70. 63 %). The steady-state heat loss calculations indicated the percentage of heat loss reduction, when replacing triple air-filled glazed windows to triple vacuum glazed windows, to be approximately 1. 58 % for un-insulated solid walls and 3. 02 % for an externally insulated solid walls.
