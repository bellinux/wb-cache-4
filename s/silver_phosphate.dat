30|$|It is {{necessary}} to note that in silicate glasses, the formation of nanoparticles on the surface was also both predicted [9] and experimentally observed [10]. However, in silicate glasses, the silver-sodium ion exchange and annealing in hydrogen result in silver nanoparticles growth predominantly in the subsurface layer [8]. In contrary, our results show that in phosphate glass, the main sink for neutral silver atoms is the glass surface. Thus, the formation of nanoisland silver films {{in the course of}} reactive diffusion is more efficient in phosphate rather than in silicate glass. Such a difference may originate from a higher solubility of neutral <b>silver</b> in <b>phosphate</b> matrixes in comparison with silicate ones.|$|R

The technique uses high-temperature elemental analyzer (EA) -pyrolysis interfaced in continuous flow (CF) mode to an isotopic ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). Calibration curves were generated by synthesizing <b>silver</b> <b>phosphate</b> with a 13 ‰ spread in d 18 O values.

This compound has a layered crystal structure, but the specific topology of the V-P-O framework {{gives rise to a}} one-dimensional spin system, a frustrated alternating chain. Low-field magnetization measurements and band structure calculations show that Ag(2) VOP(2) O(7) is close to the dimer limit with the largest nearest-neighbor interaction of about 30 K. High-field magnetization data reveal the critical fields μ_ 0 H_c 1 of about 23 T (closing of the spin gap) and μ_ 0 H_c 2 of about 30 T (saturation by full alignment of the magnetic moments). From H_c 1 to H_c 2 the magnetization increases sharply similar to the system of isolated dimers.

40|$|Polymers are {{currently}} widely used {{to replace a}} variety of natural materials {{with respect to their}} favourable physical and chemical properties, and due to their economic advantage. One of the most important branches of application of polymers is the production of different products for medical use. In this case, it is necessary to face a significant disadvantage of polymer products due to possible and very common colonization of the surface by various microorganisms that can pose a potential danger to the patient. One of the possible solutions is to prepare polymer with antibacterial/antimicrobial properties that is resistant to bacterial colonization.

40|$|AbstractOptical {{properties}} such as {{optical absorption}} and radiophotoluminescence (RPL) spectra of <b>silver</b> (Ag+) -doped <b>phosphate</b> glass {{before and after}} x-ray irradiation were investigated in this study.

The fine characterisation of the chemical setting of silver-doped and reference cements was performed using FTIR spectroscopy. We showed that the formation of apatite was enhanced from the first hours of maturation of C-Ag(L) cement in comparison with the reference cement, whereas a longer period of maturation (about 10 h) was required to observe this increase for C-Ag(S) cement, although in both cases, silver was present in the set cements mainly as <b>silver</b> <b>phosphate.</b> The role of silver nitrate on the setting chemical reaction is discussed and a chemical scheme is proposed. Antibacterial activity tests (S. aureus and S. epidermidis) and in vitro cytotoxicity tests (human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSC)) showed that silver-loaded CaCO 3 –CaP cements had antibacterial properties (anti-adhesion and anti-biofilm formation) without a toxic effect on HBMSC cells, making C-Ag(S) cement a promising candidate for the prevention of bone implant-associated infections...|$|E

The structure of these glasses, investigated using infrared spectra, shows that MoO 3 and P 2 O 5 are the glass formers, {{the role of the}} last one being more important as the MoO 3 content decreases. The densities of the glasses, measured using the displacement method show that the addition of Ag 2 O to the binary MoO 3 -P 2 O 5 system causes a constant increase in the density of the glasses. AC conductivity measurements of the glasses were conducted in open atmosphere from 5 Hz to 100 kHz by use of a HP 4142 impedance-meter in the temperature range of 303 - 423 K. The glasses exhibited high ion conductivities in the range of 10 - 4 to 10 - 1 Sm- 1 at room temperature. The conductivities of the glasses increase and the activation energies of the conduction process decrease with the Ag 2 O content. The total conductivity of the glasses was recorded using the two electrodes method.

Conduction and relaxation mechanisms in these glasses were studied using impedance spectroscopy in a frequency range from 10 Â Hz to 13 Â MHz and a temperature range from 323 Â K to 623 Â K. The dependence of electrical data on frequency was analyzed in the framework of the Nyquist's plot and Jonscherâs power law. The semicircles observed in the plots indicate a double relaxation process. The studied materials exhibit a significant contribution of bulk and interfacial effect to electrical conduction and to non-Debye relaxation process. The dc conductivity (Ïdc) follows Arrhenius behavior with temperature. The ac and dc conductivities of the samples were found to increase with the increase in temperature. The conductivity variation for P 2 O 5 -Na 2 O-ZnO glasses doped with various concentrations of AgNO 3 was explained by the presence of ionic contribution. The dielectric characterizations include measurements involving the variation of the dielectric constant as well as the dielectric loss with frequency.
