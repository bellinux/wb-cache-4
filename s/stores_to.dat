5|$|Initially, the {{excitement}} generated by Pac-Mans home release prompted retail <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> expand their inventory to sell video games. Drugstores began stocking video game cartridges, and toy retailers vied for new releases. Kmart and J. C. Penney competed against Sears {{to become the}} largest vendor of video games. The game's release also led {{to an increase in}} sales of the Atari 2600 console.|$|E

50|$|Claremont {{was laid}} out by Jacob May. In 1853 he moved his <b>store</b> <b>to</b> a point along the Trace Road. In 1855, when the O & M Railroad was built, he moved his <b>store</b> <b>to</b> a site along the railroad, and the present village of Claremont came into existence.|$|R
5|$|A further block (also {{known as}} Annexe Market or Triangular Block) {{consisting}} of two separate structures (the Fish Market and the Red House) was built between 1886 and 1899. The Fish Market, built by John Mowlem & Co., was completed in 1888, one year after Sir Horace Jones' death. The Red House, with its imposing red brick and Portland stone façade, was built between 1898 and 1899 for the London Central Markets Cold Storage Co. Ltd.. It {{was one of the}} first cold <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> be built outside the London docks and continued to serve Smithfield Market until the mid-1970s.|$|E

Hollis had been a Computer Renaissance franchisee. CEO John Morgan said that whereas Music Go Round's used musical equipment did not depreciate, Computer Renaissance's aging computers did.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Saomai made {{landfall}} in China, local Red Cross chapters provided residents left homeless with emergency supplies, such as blankets, clothing, medicine, and disinfectant. After {{the storm}} moved ashore, the Wenzhou government blocked street {{access to the}} areas with the heaviest damage. Officials ordered <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> cease selling items that were unrelated to storm recovery. By 11days after landfall, 80% of the factories in Wenzhou had reopened. The city of Fuding provided ¥104.9million (RMB, $13.2million USD) toward reconstructing, as well as ¥5,000 (RMB, $625 USD) for each family.|$|E

In 1946 it was the nation’s first department <b>store</b> <b>to</b> give credit to African-Americans, as well as employ them as salespeople and executives. The store’s restaurant {{was the first in}} downtown Cincinnati to serve African-American customers.|$|R

5|$|In 1995, Bruce and Utsler {{attempted}} {{to obtain a}} contract with a major record label. The duo eventually {{signed a contract with}} the short-lived Jive Records sub-label Battery Records, which released the group's third studio album, Riddle Box, on October 10, 1995. After Battery/Jive Records showed little interest in promoting the album, Insane Clown Posse funded the promotion of Riddle Box independently. This effort led the group to Dallas, Texas, where it persuaded several music retail <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> stock the album. Sales averaged 1,500 copies per week as a result.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Oregon House Bill 3466, {{which would}} have recriminalized {{marijuana}} in Oregon, died. According to bill sponsor Jerry Grisham (R–Beavercreek), HB 3466 was meant to counter a circulating initiative petition called The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act of 1997, {{which would have}} allowed state liquor <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> sell marijuana and permitted hemp production for paper, fabric, oil, and protein. Taxes on these products would go to schools to replace funding allegedly lost by Measure 5. The petition was sponsored by a political action committee named Pay for Schools by Regulating Cannabis.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to granting local governments wide latitude over liquor sales, New Jersey law has some other unusual features. Corporations {{are limited to}} two retail distribution licenses, making it impractical for chain <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> sell alcoholic beverages; this restriction, in conjunction with municipal ordinances, severely limits supermarket and convenience store chains from selling beer {{as they do in}} many other states. State law treats drunk driving as a traffic offense rather than a crime, and permits individual municipalities to define the scope of underage drinking laws.|$|E

5|$|On 24 January 2009, Ofcom allowed {{electrical}} {{retailers to}} be granted a licence to rebroadcast DAB signals within their <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate DAB radio sets within their stores. The United Kingdom consumer charity, Which? warned that consumers who could not get an adequate DAB signal could be misled by the in-store sets. The Digital Radio Development Bureau replied to the Which? report stating that stores contain a steel structure which produce a faraday cage effect where DAB signals are blocked out. The DRDB recommended that consumers should check DAB coverage online with their postcode before purchasing a DAB radio to avoid disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Supplies for {{the advance}} were transported over land and by sea {{but it was}} only with great {{difficulty}} that two infantry divisions of XXI Corps and three mounted divisions of Desert Mounted Corps were maintained in the advance at such distances from base. The Navy transported <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> the mouths of the Wadi Hesi and the Nahr Sukherier as these lines were secured. The railhead was being pushed forward as rapidly as possible, but did not reach Deir Suneid until 28 November. So it was a considerable distance over which the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps worked to bring up supplies.|$|E

5|$|The French made {{numerous}} {{efforts to}} supply their colonies during this period, attempting to use fast frigates to bring food and military <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> the Caribbean past the British blockades, themselves {{a response to}} Napoleon's Continental System, but often losing the vessels in the process. One such attempt {{was made by the}} French frigate Topaze, despatched from Brest to Cayenne with a large cargo of flour. Driven away from Cayenne by Portugal (allies of Britain, and fighting France themselves in be Peninsular War), who had recently captured the colony, Topaze took refuge under the gun batteries of Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian was {{a former}} two-decked 44-gun frigate, but had been armed en flûte and loaded with <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> {{be taken to the}} British colony at Botany Bay. In {{addition}} to these stores, consisting of seeds, plants, farm machinery and livestock with a total value of some £70,000, the Guardian was also to transport a number of convicts and their overseers. Aboard the Guardian was a young midshipman named Thomas Pitt, the son of politician Thomas Pitt, and nephew of Prime Minister William Pitt.|$|E
5|$|The National Hotel Artist Lofts (NHAL) is an Artspace-developed {{property}} featuring twenty-seven live/work units {{designated as}} affordable housing for artists. The project brought {{new life to}} the historic E.S. Levy Building, which was left abandoned for twenty years. Originally built as the Tremont Opera House in 1870, the structure was extensively renovated to serve various functions, from offices and <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> the National Hotel. The building also housed the U.S. National Weather Bureau's Galveston office under Isaac Cline during the 1900 Storm.|$|E

5|$|The Parental Advisory label (abbreviated PAL) is {{a warning}} label first {{introduced}} by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1985 and later adopted by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in 2011. It is placed on audio recordings in recognition of excessive profanities or inappropriate references, {{with the intention of}} alerting parents of potentially unsuitable material for younger children. The label was first affixed on physical 33 1/3 rpm records, compact discs and cassette tapes, and it has been included on digital listings offered by online music <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the growing popularity of the latter platform.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} {{launched}} on 7 July 1810 as two combined forces of British sailors, soldiers, sepoys and Royal Marines landed at separate beaches. Although {{a number of}} men were drowned in the heavy surf, {{the majority of the}} invasion force reached the beaches safely and marched inland, attacking French outposts as they approached the capital. Recognising that his demoralised garrison would be unable to defend Saint Denis and that the militia would take too long to mobilise, the French commander Colonel Chrysostôme de Sainte-Suzanne surrendered the island, its garrison and its <b>stores</b> <b>to</b> Rowley.|$|E
5|$|Within {{six years}} from {{when it was}} founded, Monster had $50 million in annual {{revenues}} and 400 employees.

Lee kept the company private and grew the business, despite pressure to go public.|$|E
