50|$|CPVC shares {{most of the}} {{features}} and properties of PVC. It is also readily workable, including machining, welding, and forming. Because of its excellent corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures, CPVC is ideally suited for self-supporting constructions where temperatures up to 200 °F (90 °C) are present. Due to its specific composition, dealing with CPVC requires a specialized <b>solvent</b> <b>cement,</b> with high strength <b>solvent</b> <b>cement</b> variants being first introduced in 1965 by Genova Products, then followed by other products such as IPS's Weld-On line. The ability to bend, shape, and weld CPVC enables its use {{in a wide variety}} of processes and applications. It exhibits fire-retardant properties.|$|E

5000|$|PVC/CPVC - {{rigid plastic}} pipes similar to PVC drain pipes but with thicker walls {{to deal with}} {{municipal}} water pressure, introduced around 1970. PVC stands for polyvinyl chloride, {{and it has become}} a common replacement for metal piping. PVC should be used only for cold water, or for venting. CPVC can be used for hot and cold potable water supply. Connections are made with primers and <b>solvent</b> <b>cements</b> as required by code.|$|R
50|$|Weld-On is a {{division}} of IPS Corporation, a manufacturer of <b>solvent</b> <b>cements,</b> primers, and cleaners for PVC, CPVC, and ABS plastic piping systems. Weld-On products are commonly used for joining plastic pipes and fittings. Weld-On also manufactures specialty products from repair adhesives for leaking pipes, pipe thread sealants / joint compounds, to test plugs for pipeline pressure testing. Their products are most commonly utilized in the irrigation, industrial, pool & spa, electrical conduit, and plumbing industries.|$|R

50|$|The {{additive}} manufacturing process permits curvilinear designs {{that are too}} expensive or impossible to do by subtractive methods. From the P-15, it was integrated with the DefDist V5 lower receiver, resulting in the WarFairy Charon V0.1. Further advantage was taken {{of the nature of}} FDM polymer printing {{to make it possible for}} printers with small work envelopes to produce large items, i.e., the Charon was designed to be printed in sections and then assembled with <b>solvent</b> <b>cement.</b>|$|E
40|$|Manufacturers {{that use}} certain {{adhesives}} and related manufacturing processes {{must consider the}} impact they have on worker health, safety, and the environment. Product manufacturers must find alternate replacements for solvent-based adhesives and <b>solvent</b> <b>cements.</b> In addition, processes that use ozone-depleting solvents for hand-wipe cleaning operations as well as vapor degreasing must find suitable alternates {{in order to be}} environmentally compliant. Likewise, manufacturers that use etching solutions that contain chrome must find a replacement. This paper identifies some of the specific problems associated with using certain adhesives and manufacturing processes. Environmentally acceptable alternative adhesives and processes are presented...|$|R
2500|$|Roughly {{half of the}} world's {{polyvinyl}} chloride resin manufactured annually is used for producing pipes for municipal and industrial applications. In the water distribution market, it accounts for 66% {{of the market in}} the U.S., and in sanitary sewer pipe applications, it accounts for 75%. Buried PVC pipes in both water and sanitary sewer applications that are [...] in diameter and larger are typically joined by means of a gasket-sealed joint. [...] The most common type of gasket utilized in North America is a metal reinforced elastomer, commonly referred to as a Rieber sealing system. Its light weight, low cost, and low maintenance make it attractive. [...] However, it must be carefully installed and bedded to ensure longitudinal cracking and overbelling does not occur. [...] Additionally, PVC pipes can be fused together using various <b>solvent</b> <b>cements,</b> or heat-fused (butt-fusion process, similar to joining HDPE pipe), creating permanent joints that are virtually impervious to leakage.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} follow the {{progress}} of cement hydration by analytical techniques, the ongoing hydration reactions must be stopped by complete removal of free water. A comparison between solvent exchange, oven drying and vacuum drying, using thermal analysis, is presented for early-age hydrated cement pastes. Results show that oven drying at 105 °C accelerates hydration, causes dehydration of some hydrated cement phases and favours carbonation. Solvent exchange with ethanol, ether and methanol results in a strong absorption and an incomplete removal of solvents. FT-IR and XRD gave evidence {{of the formation of}} carbonate-like phases due to an interaction upon heating, i. e. during thermal analysis, between the strongly absorbed <b>solvents</b> and the <b>cement</b> compounds or hydrates. Vacuum drying reveals reliable results as no interaction products can be formed and the Ca(OH) 2 content, determined by thermal analysis, gives a good approximation of the real amount of Ca(OH) 2. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{progress}} of hydration at early ages in cement-based materials by thermal analysis, FT-IR and XRD, the ongoing hydration reactions should be stopped after different periods of time by complete removal of the free water from the material, i. e. the water which has not yet participated in the hydration reactions. The replacement of the cement paste pore water by a low surface-tension organic fluid is a common technique to stop the hydration prior to thermal analysis. However, it seems that an interaction is taking place between the organic liquid and the cement hydrates which results {{in the formation of}} carbonate-like compounds and an underestimation of the real calcium hydroxide content by thermal analysis. The solvent exchange drying technique is studied for different times of storage in the organic <b>solvent</b> and for <b>cement</b> pastes of different ages. TGA and DSC graphs of these pastes are compared with pastes vacuum dried at 2. 5 × 10 - 2 mbar. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a {{conceptual}} model-based optimization is performed for designing two waste solvent treatment technologies: (i) hybrid process distillation assisted by pervaporation and (ii) distillation/incineration. This task was performed resorting to conceptual models or shortcuts for each unit operation involved, which {{are characterized by}} their abilities to {{capture the essence of}} the process at a low computational cost. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was applied to evaluate the environmental impact of both alternatives. Optimal values for the utilities, i. e., cooling water, electricity and steam needed for distillation and pervaporation were used as the input data to perform the environmental analysis with LCA. Ecosolvent v. 1. 0. 1 was used to calculate inventories data related to the incineration technology (waste <b>solvent</b> incineration and <b>cement</b> kiln) of the first cut of the distillation step for the case distillation/incineration and for treatment of column residues of both alternatives investigated. Applied to the mixture isopropyl alcohol-water, optimal values for per-pass IPA recovery and distillate composition were determined for the alternative distillation/incineration and distillation/pervaporation, respectively. From the analysis of the economic figures, it was concluded that solvent recovery through the hybrid process is the better option mainly due to the savings in the cost of fresh solvent. The LCA results, performed in SimaPro 7. 3, show that the main impact is related to the solvent production. Thus, solvent recovery is the best option if minimization of the use of resources is paramount. Nevertheless incineration in a cement kiln becomes relevant in terms of human health for the avoided use of fuels. Furthermore, it was concluded that both process optimization with the aid of conceptual models and LCA are key tools in the decision-making process to determine which technology is the most appropriate for the treatment of waste solvents...|$|R
