6000|$|... "Mr. Chalmers, in {{his late}} {{excellent}} edition of Sir David Lindsay's works, has refuted the chimerical derivation of Snawdoun from <b>snedding,</b> or cutting. It was probably derived from the romantic legend which connected Stirling with King Arthur, to which {{the mention of the}} Round Table gives countenance. The ring within which justs were formerly practised in the Castle park, is still called the Round Table. Snawdoun is the official title of one of the Scottish heralds, whose epithets seem in all countries to have been fantastically adopted from ancient history or romance.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{competition}} on academic outcomes {{is likely to}} depend on whether parents are informed about schools' effectiveness or valued added (which {{may or may not}} be correlated with absolute measures of their quality), and on whether this information influences their school choices, thereby affecting schools' market outcomes. To explore these issues, this paper considers Chile's <b>SNED</b> program, which seeks to identify effective schools, selecting them from within "homogeneous groups" of arguably comparable institutions. Its results are widely disseminated, and the information it generates is quite different from that conveyed by a simple test-based ranking of schools (which in Chile, turns out to largely resemble a ranking based on socioeconomic status). We rely on a sharp regression discontinuity to estimate the effect that being identified as a <b>SNED</b> winner has on schools’ enrollment, tuition levels, and socioeconomic composition. Through five applications of the program, we find no consistent evidence that winning a <b>SNED</b> award affects these outcomes. This suggests that information on school effectiveness [...] at least as it is calculated and delivered by the <b>SNED</b> [...] might not much affect school markets. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the characteristics}} of Chilean teachers and the institutional context of teachers’ labor market. Salary trends, from 1990 on, are analyzed to show the effects {{on the behavior of}} those applying to study pedagogy; in addition teachers’ salaries are compared to those of other similar workers. The paper also studies the incentives implicit in the current salary structure for teachers and offers a preliminary assessment {{of the impact of the}} National System of Performance Assessment (<b>SNED)</b> on student outcomes. The <b>SNED</b> is examined for two reasons: until recently, it was the sole monetary incentive associated with teacher evaluations; and similarly, it is the sole incentive that evaluates teachers’ performance according to students’ results on standardized tests. Finally, the paper presents the opinions of teachers and principals about performance evaluation and monetary incentive payments associated with them. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) {{is a major}} component of tumors and a significant contributor to cancer progression. In this study, we use proteomics to investigate the ECM of human mammary carcinoma xenografts and show that primary tumors of differing metastatic potential differ in ECM composition. Both tumor cells and stromal cells contribute to the tumor matrix and tumors of differing metastatic ability differ in both tumor- and stroma-derived ECM components. We define ECM signatures of poorly and highly metastatic mammary carcinomas and these signatures reveal up-regulation of signaling pathways including TGFβ and VEGF. We further demonstrate that several proteins characteristic of highly metastatic tumors (LTBP 3, <b>SNED</b> 1, EGLN 1, and S 100 A 2) play causal roles in metastasis, albeit at different steps. Finally we show that high expression of LTBP 3 and <b>SNED</b> 1 correlates with poor outcome for ER−/PR−breast cancer patients. This study thus identifies novel biomarkers that may serve as prognostic and diagnostic tools. National Cancer Institute (U. S.) (Tumor Microenvironment Network, grant no.

500|$|One {{week before}} Lathrop's death, he {{negotiated}} {{the sale of}} the News-Miner to Charles Willis [...] "Bill" [...] Snedden. Snedden was an efficiency expert and former printer who had been employed by Henry Kaiser during WWII. After the war, he began troubleshooting newspapers. Through 1949 and 1950, Snedden did an efficiency study of the News-Miner and recommended about $100,000 in upgrades. Lathrop was unwilling to spend that much on the newspaper, and <b>Snedded</b> suggested that if Lathrop was unwilling to upgrade, Snedden would be interested in purchasing the paper. The two men worked out a verbal agreement before Lathrop was killed in a coal train accident.|$|R
40|$|Background:Lumefantrine, an {{antimalarial}} molecule {{has very}} low and variable bioavailability owing to its extremely poor solubility in water. It is recommended {{to be taken}} with milk to enhance its solubility and bioavailability. The aim of {{present study was to}} develop a Self Nanoemulsifying Delivery system (<b>SNEDs)</b> of lumefantrine (LF) to achieve rapid and complete dissolution independent of food-fat and surfactant in dissolution media. Methods:Solubility of LF in oil, co-solvent/co-surfactant and surfactant solution and emulsification efficiency of surfactant were analyzed to optimize the LF loaded self nanoemulsifying preconcentrate. Effect of LF-oleic acid complexation on emulsification, droplet size, zeta potential and dissolution were investigated. Effect of milk concentration and fat content on saturation solubility and dissolution of LF was investigated. Dissolution of marketed formulation and LF-SNEDs was carried out in pH 1. 2 and pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer. Results:LF exhibited very high solubility in oleic acid owing to complexation between tertiary amine of LF and carboxyl group of oleic acid (OA). Cremophore EL and medium chain monoglyceride were selected surfactant and co-surfactant, respectively. Significantly smaller droplet size (37 nm), shift in zeta potential from negative to positive value, very high drug loading in lipid based system (> 10 %), no precipitation after dissolution are the major distinguish characteristics contributed by LF-OA complex in the <b>SNED</b> system. Saturation solubility and dissolution study in milk containing media pointed the significant increment in solubility of LF in the presence of milk-food fat. LF-SNEDs showed > 90 % LF release within 30 min in pH 1. 2 while marketed tablet showed almost 0 % drug release. Conclusion:Self nanoemulsification promoting ionic complexation between basic drug and oleic acid hold great promise in enhancing solubility of hydrophobic drugs...|$|R
5000|$|Can we {{make any}} generalizations about the {{membership}} of verbs in Types I and II? Most obviously, the Type II verbs all end in [...] and , though that is just like the members of Type I. Less obviously they are all without exception basic vocabulary. Note well {{that this is a}} claim about Type II verbs and not a claim about basic vocabulary: there are basic home-and-hearth verbs in Type I, too. But there are no denominative verbs in Type II, that is, verbs like to gut, to braid, to hoard, to bed, to court, to head, to hand. There are no verbs of Latin or (a little harder to spot) of French origin; all stems like depict, enact, denote, elude, preclude, convict are Type I. Furthermore, all novel forms are inflected as Type I: all native speakers of English would presumably agree that the preterites of to sned and to absquatulate would most likely be <b>snedded</b> and absquatulated.|$|R
