6000|$|If, then, {{we leave}} out of {{consideration}} the etymological myths and numerical absurdities of the English or Welsh legends, and look {{only at the}} facts disclosed {{to us by the}} <b>subsequent</b> <b>condition</b> of the country, we shall find that the early Anglo-Saxon settlements took place somewhat after this wise. In the extreme north, the English apparently did not care to settle in the rugged mountain country between Aberdeen and Edinburgh, inhabited by the free and warlike Picts. But from the Firth of Forth to the borders of Essex, a succession of colonies, belonging to the restricted English tribe, occupied the whole provincial coast, burning, plundering, and massacring in many places as they went. First and northernmost of all came the people whom we know by their Latinised title of Bernicians, and who descended upon the rocky braes between Forth and Tyne. These are the English of Ida's kingdom, the modern Lothians and Northumberland. Their chief town was at Bebbanburh, now Bamborough, which Ida [...] "timbered, and betyned it with a hedge." [...] Next in geographical order stood the people of Deira, or Yorkshire, who occupied the rich agricultural valley of the Ouse, the fertile alluvial tract of Holderness, and the bleak coast-line from Tyne to Humber. Whether they conquered the Roman capital of York, or whether it made terms with the invaders, we do not know; but it is not mentioned as the chief town of the English kings before the days of Eadwine, under whom the two Northumbrian chieftainships were united into a single kingdom. However, as Eadwine assumed some of the imperial Roman trappings, it seems not unlikely that a portion at least of the Romanised population survived the conquest. The two principalities probably spread back politically in most places as far as the watershed which separates the basins of the German Ocean and the Irish Sea; but the English population seems to have lived mainly along the coast or in the fertile valley of the Ouse and its tributaries; for Elmet and Loidis, two Welsh principalities, long held out in the Leeds district, and the people of the dales and the inland parts, as we shall see reason hereafter to conclude, even now show evident marks of Celtic descent. Together the two chieftainships were generally known by the name of Northumberland, now confined to their central portion; but it must never be forgotten that the Lothians, which at present form part of modern Scotland, were originally a portion of this early English kingdom, and are still, perhaps, more purely English in blood and speech than any other district in our island.|$|E

It calculates {{the mean and}} standard deviation of select parameters contained in the incoming flight data stream. If the standard deviation of the data falls below defined constraints, the engine is assumed to be at a steady-state operating point, and the mean measurement data at that point are archived for <b>subsequent</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring purposes. The fundamental design of the steady-state data filter is completely generic and applicable for any dynamic system. Additional domain-specific logic constraints are applied to reduce data outliers and variance within the collected steady-state data. The filter is designed for on-line real-time processing of streaming data as opposed to post-processing of the data in batch mode. Results of applying the steady-state data filter to recorded helicopter engine flight data are shown, demonstrating its utility for engine condition monitoring applications...|$|E
40|$|Individuals who do {{not possess}} the verbal skills to express {{meaningful}} choice {{in the absence of}} its consequences may have difficulty indicating their preference for protracted activities that are unavailable until some time in the future (e. g., taking a walk, riding a bike). When we examined the preferences of 4 individuals with developmental disabilities by showing them pictorial representations of various activities, their initial choices showed no clear preferences. In a <b>subsequent</b> <b>condition,</b> selecting a photograph resulted in brief access to the depicted activity. When selections produced differential consequences (i. e., access to the activity), clear preferences emerged. In addition, 3 individuals' preferences were later shifted to an initially less preferred but more socially desirable option by superimposing additional reinforcement contingencies for engaging in the less preferred activity. Results are discussed in terms of the conditions under which choice functions as an indicator of preference and how those conditions may be altered {{to improve the quality of}} choice making without limiting access to preferred options...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The modern {{manufacturing}} plants are generally equipped with complex and continuous running machines and equipment. These are characterized with high speeds heavy working loads high temperatures and pressures etc. The shutdown costs are very large {{in case of}} such complex plants. Any breakdown or malfunctioning in such cases {{is not only a}} costly affair but it also raises the question of safety of plant itself and persons working there in. This initiates the need for prediction of failure of machines as well in advance so as to initiate the corrective action. The condition monitoring and <b>subsequent</b> <b>condition</b> based maintenance is an effective measure in this regard. However in a factory same maintenance practice is neither desirable nor required for all equipment and machines and a routine practice is to use mixed maintenance scheme. As the predictive maintenance efforts are very expensive hence the design of predictive maintenance scheme itself becomes a task of utmost care. This paper suggests a stepwise procedure for design of predictive maintenance program and also discusses the justification factors, choice of monitoring techniques and various related facts regarding predictive maintenance. The paper also includes a case study of condition monitoring and thereby arranging a predictive maintenance for sugar industry. Index Terms – condition monitoring, Predictiv...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. How little {{do we need}} to {{perceive}} 3 -D shape in monocular natural images? The shape-from-texture and shape-from-shading perspectives would motivate that 3 -D perception vanishes once low-level cues are disrupted. Is this the case in human vision? Or can top ^ down influences salvage the percept? In this study we probe this question by employing a gauge-figure paradigm similar to that used by Koenderink et al (1992, Perception & Psychophysics 52 487 ^ 496). Subjects were presented degraded natural images and instructed to make local assessments of slant and tilt at various locations thereby quantifying their internal 3 -D percept. Analysis of subjects ' responses reveals recognition to be a significant influence thereby allowing subjects {{to perceive}} 3 -D shape at high levels of degradation. Specifically, we identify the `medium-blur ' condition, images approximately 32 pixels on a side, to be the limit for accurate 3 -D shape perception. In addition, we find that degradation affects the perceived slant of point-estimates making images look flatter as degradation increases. A <b>subsequent</b> <b>condition</b> that eliminates texture and shading but preserves contour and recognition reveals how bottom ^ up and top ^ down cues can combine for accurate 3 -D shape perception. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the basics and first test {{results of a}} model based approach using qualitative modeling to perform Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) on HVAC and R systems. A quantized system describing the qualitative behavior of a dynamical system is established by transforming numerical inputs into qualitative values or states. Then, the qualitative model is used to determine system-states or outputs that may occur in the future. The qualitative model determines {{the probability that a}} <b>subsequent</b> <b>condition</b> might occur. The model can then be used for FDD purposes by comparing the expected states of the faultless system with the occurring states of the real process. The paper presents the first results of the model, trained with measurement data of an air handling unit (AHU) heating coil. The authors plan to extend the model to further AHU components and to test them against real data to assess their performance for FDD and their economic viability in terms of engineering efforts and costs by comparing them with a rule-based FDD system. It is then planned to implement and test the models on several large HVAC and R systems operating at two major European airports in the framework of the FP 7 European project CASCADE ICT for Energy Efficient Airports...|$|E
40|$|Power curve {{measurements}} {{provide a}} conventional and {{effective means of}} assessing {{the performance of a}} wind turbine, both commercially and technically. Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issues make it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate wind speed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system records, however, often contains significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence of wind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. To use this raw data for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates which would make the actual fault detection unreliable and potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic outlier exclusion method developed around a Copula based joint probability model. This approach has the capability of capturing the complex multivariate nonlinear relation between parameters based on their univariate marginal distributions through the use of Copula; data points that deviate significantly from the consolidated power curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After data filtering in this manner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retaining the same dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make <b>subsequent</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring more effective in the reliable detection of faults...|$|E

Exposure to a compound composed of a novel CS and a remotely preexposed CS resulted in the novel CS subsequently conditioning better than a novel CS exposed in compound with a recently preexposed CS. The results were interpreted to mean that stimulus-alone exposures produce a loss in associability which recovers across time, that this restoration deepens the loss in associability, and that this deepening is regulated by a common error term. 13 page(s...|$|R
