3000|$|To {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} of fault location system, several <b>short-circuit</b> <b>tests</b> need [...] to be conducted before being brought into service in autotransformer (AT) feeding systems for high-speed railways in China. However, no systematic algorithm yet exists to evaluate {{the consistency of the}} current distribution of <b>short-circuit</b> <b>tests.</b> A methodology is proposed in this paper to address this problem. Based on Kirchhoff’s current law and the generalized method of symmetrical components, the current deviations of the AT feeding systems are analysed and then normalized with the short-circuit current as they vary greatly with systems and short-circuit sites. It is also found that the short-circuit current varies with the calculation methods, and its unbiased standard deviation also reflects the consistency of the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>test.</b> The mean and maximum of the current deviations, as well as the unbiased standard deviation of the short-circuit current, show the consistency of the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>test</b> from different aspects, although the last two items are highly relevant. Therefore, a unified evaluation index is defined as the sum of the three items, and then applied in two case studies to test its performance. The results show that, the proposed index can clearly distinguish the consistency of the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>tests</b> and may be used to sort the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>tests</b> for fault location systems. Besides, some <b>short-circuit</b> <b>tests</b> may have very poor consistency indices, and thus are not applicable to the tuning of fault location systems. In the authors’ opinion, the determination of the threshold of the proposed index needs further investigation.|$|R

40|$|High Power Laboratory in Ludvika has {{facilities}} for <b>short-circuit</b> <b>testing</b> of high voltage equipment like circuit breakers, disconnectors, surge arresters, transformers, switchgear cubicles, etc.; simulating the test conditions as in real power transmission network. In {{order to provide}} such an extremely high short-circuit current up to 100 kA, two specially designed turbo-generators are being used with a total capacity of 4000 MVA. Each of generators during the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>test</b> is excited by a separate driven exciter to provide the excitation current. Flying excitation method {{which is used to}} provide the right value of test current and voltage is described more in detail in Chapter 2. The excitation system has to be properly set in order to satisfy requirements of <b>short-circuit</b> <b>testing.</b> Therefore correct value of excitation time and an exciter voltage has to be chosen in advance to fulfil the criteria of <b>short-circuit</b> <b>testing.</b> The no-load characteristics of generators have been measured and an analysis of obtained data was made to get the needed excitation time characteristics. The study of collected data from previous single-phase <b>short-circuit</b> <b>tests</b> showed that it is best to use the same excitation times for the operating sequences open (O), open-close-open (O-CO) and close-open (CO) in order to provide the correct short-circuit current at interruption for a given connection of generator winding, and frequency. For operating sequence close (C) is also recommended to use the same excitation time determined in the study for whole range of short-circuit current at the generator side within the same generator winding connection, frequency and use of the generators.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} that arises when performing <b>short-circuit</b> <b>tests</b> to large loops involving substation connectors is the inductive component of the loop impedance. Transformers used to perform <b>short-circuit</b> <b>tests</b> have a secondary winding with very few turns, producing a very low output voltage. The increase in the reactive component of the impedance, which is related to loop size, limits the current output capacity, because the reactive component tends to saturate {{the output of the}} transformer and absorbs large amounts of reactive power. This paper analyzes a simple method to minimize the power requirements when conducting <b>short-circuit</b> <b>tests,</b> based on the reduction of reactive power consumption during the test. It is based on placing a wired conductor forming a closed inner loop concentric with the testing loop. The decrease of reactive power is related to the effect of the mutual inductance between the inner and outer loops.

30|$|However, in {{the field}} of {{electrical}} engineering, a synchronous machine is easily characterized through two simple tests procedures: a no-load and a <b>short-circuit</b> <b>test.</b> During those tests, there are no more mechanical coupling: the rotation speed is set to a constant value Ω _ 0. Thus, the electromagnetic torque T_EM of high oscillating frequency is no more related to the problem, and allows to take a quite important time-step in order to compute a full mechanical rotation with a reduced number of snapshots (in our case 122). Furthermore, the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>test</b> considers the case where both the value of R and L is zero in the circuit equation (11) whereas the no-load case consists in not taking into account the circuit coupling.

30|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{consistency}} evaluation of the current distributions obtained from <b>short-circuit</b> <b>tests.</b> It is clear that the consistency of current distribution can be evaluated by to what extent Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) is met in the AT feeding system. Therefore, the current deviations at each node are to be calculated. As the current deviations vary with the fault site and system short-circuit capacity, they are normalized by the short-circuit current. The maximum and mean of the normalized current deviations are selected as the evaluation indices. The short-circuit current is estimated with the generalized method of symmetrical components (GMSC). It is found that the short-circuit current varies greatly with the utilized equation, and its standard deviation may also be selected as an index. To obtain a unified index, the three indices are summed. The unified index is then used in two case studies, and the results show that it can clearly distinguish the consistency of the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R
