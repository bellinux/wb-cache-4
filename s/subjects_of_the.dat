5|$|Christian metal bands {{exist in}} most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genre the band is rooted in, {{regularly}} providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith but often it does.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial. Some argue that circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage forum shopping, while other {{scholars argue that}} variation among circuits allows local courts to experiment with new laws that reflect the values of local residents. Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law.|$|E
5|$|Education {{remained}} mostly {{focused on}} the training of future clergy. The basic learning of the letters and numbers remained {{the province of the}} family or a village priest, but the secondary <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trivium—grammar, rhetoric, logic—were studied in cathedral schools or in schools provided by cities. Commercial secondary schools spread, and some Italian towns had more than one such enterprise. Universities also spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. Lay literacy rates rose, but were still low; one estimate gave a literacy rate of ten per cent of males and one per cent of females in 1500.|$|E
50|$|Each {{of these}} {{sentences}} contains two verbal predicates. Each time the control verb {{is on the}} left, and the verb whose arguments are controlled is on the right. The control verb determines which expression is interpreted as <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verb on the right. The first three sentences are examples <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> control, since <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control verb is also <b>the</b> understood <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subordinate verb. The second three examples are instances of object control, because <b>the</b> object <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control verb is understood as <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subordinate verb. <b>The</b> argument <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix predicate that functions as <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embedded predicate is the controller. The controllers are in bold in the examples.|$|R
5000|$|As second {{complement}} of certain transitive verbs. These are mostly raising-to-object verbs, {{as described above}} for the bare infinitive; however, in some cases, it is <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main clause that is <b>the</b> logical <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infinitival clause, as in [...] "John promises Mary to cook", where the person who will cook is John (<b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main sentence), and not Mary (the object).|$|R

5|$|From the start, all <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IB Diploma Programme were {{available}} in English and French, and it was mandatory for all students to study both a first and a second language. In 1974, bilingual diplomas were introduced that allowed students to take {{one or more of}} their humanities or science subjects in a language other than their first. The IB Diploma Programme subjects became available in Spanish in 1983.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, William Baziotes, David Hare, Robert Motherwell and Mark Rothko {{founded the}} <b>Subjects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Artist School, which held artists' discussions in a loft at 35 East Eighth Street, Manhattan {{which came to}} be known as Studio 35. A closed panel {{symposium}} took place from April 21 to 23, 1950. It was organised by Robert Goodnough and moderated by Richard Lippold, Robert Motherwell and Alfred H. Barr, Jr. director of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). The purpose was the framing of an art movement.|$|E
5|$|Members {{belong to}} either the Civil or the Military Division. Prior to 1815, the order had only a single class, Knight Companion (KB), which no longer exists. Recipients of the Order are now usually senior {{military}} officers or senior civil servants.

25|$|When the infinitive has a <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> its own (that is, when <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infinitive is not co-referential {{either with}} the <b>subject</b> or <b>the</b> object <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{governing}} verb form), then this word {{stands in the}} accusative case. When <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infinitive {{is the same as}} <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main verb (when the subjects are co-referential), then it is usually neither expressed nor repeated within the infinitival clause. This omission is noticed also when <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infinitive, although not <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> governing verb, is constructed in a higher syntactic level, e.g. as (any) object <b>of</b> <b>the</b> governing verb in any oblique case, or as a dative of interest with an impersonal verb or verbal expression. But even in this case an accusative may be present or—more usually—understood by a predicate adjective, participle etc. in the accusative. These three main constructions available are desctribed in some detail in the sections below.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{sentence}} is the agent, the verb is {{marked with the}} agent trigger prefix, m-. However, when <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{sentence is}} the patient, the verb is marked with the patient trigger suffix, -in.|$|R

5|$|The ballad {{speaks of}} the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that {{occurred}} there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.|$|E
5000|$|In the singular, the {{subordinate}} clause can agree either with the relative pronoun or with <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main sentence, though {{the latter is}} seldom used.

5|$|The {{flag was}} {{a tool of}} Japanese imperialism in the {{occupied}} Southeast Asian areas during Second World War: people {{had to use the}} flag, and schoolchildren sang Kimigayo in morning flag raising ceremonies. Local flags were allowed for some areas such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and Manchukuo. In Korea which was part of the Empire of Japan, the Hinomaru and other symbols were used to declare that the Koreans were <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire.|$|E
5|$|Another {{commonly}} held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 tornado outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew {{and several other}} people take shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike and safely ride out a tornado as it passes by. However, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado, and the <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Due to the Venturi effect, tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass. Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and {{at each of the}} three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.|$|E
5|$|Cossacks {{were first}} semi-nomadic, then also settled East Slavic {{people of the}} Dnieper River area, who practiced brigandage and plunder, and, renowned for their {{fighting}} prowess, early in their history assumed a military organization. Many of them were, or originated from run-away peasants from the eastern and {{other areas of the}} Commonwealth or from Russia; other significant elements were townspeople and even nobility, who came from the region or migrated into Ukraine. Cossacks considered themselves free and independent of any bondage and followed their own elected leaders, who originated from the more affluent strata of their society. There were tens of thousands of Cossacks already early in the 17th century. They had frequently clashed with the neighboring Turks and Tatars and raided their Black Sea coastal settlements. Such excursions, executed by formal <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish king, were intolerable {{from the point of view}} of foreign relations of the Commonwealth, because they violated peace or interfered with the state's current policy toward the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5|$|From 1945 to 1947, {{eighteen}} human {{test subjects}} were injected with plutonium without informed consent. The tests {{were used to}} create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body {{in order to develop}} safety standards for working with plutonium. Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of Plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge. Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s. The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives of the <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors. The episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the Hippocratic Oath.|$|E
5|$|In Turkey and Persia, {{nationalist}} {{work had}} begun by 1909, {{under the leadership}} of Sardar Ajit Singh and Sufi Amba Prasad. Reports from 1910 indicate that Germany was already contemplating efforts to threaten India through Turkey, Persia, and Afghanistan. Germany had built close diplomatic and economic relationships with Turkey and Persia from the late 19th century. Von Oppenheim had mapped Turkey and Persia while working as a secret agent. The Kaiser toured Constantinople, Damascus, and Jerusalem in 1898 to bolster the Turkish relationship and to portray solidarity with Islam, a religion professed by millions of <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Empire in India and elsewhere. Referring to the Kaiser as Haji Wilhelm, the Intelligence Bureau for the East spread propaganda throughout the region, fostering rumours that the Kaiser had converted to Islam following a secret trip to Mecca and portraying him as a saviour of Islam.|$|E

The original brass engraved grave plaque used, along with a wooden propeller, are also displayed.
