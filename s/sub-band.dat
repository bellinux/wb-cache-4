25|$|The Philadelphia {{chromosome}} is designated Ph (or Ph') chromosome and designates the shortened chromosome 22. It {{arises from}} the translocation, which is termed t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2). This means there is a translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22, with breaks happening in region (3), band (4), <b>sub-band</b> (1) of the long arm (q) of chromosome 9 and region (1), band (1), <b>sub-band</b> (2) of the long arm (q) of chromosome 22. Hence the chromosome breakpoints are written as (9q34.1) and (22q11.2), respectively, using ISCN standards. Notation omitting the sub-bands is also commonly seen: t(9;22)(q34;q11).|$|E

30|$|The {{direction}} of a reflection event is simple and symmetrical. This simplicity means that the signal energy is usually concentrated in two direction <b>sub-bands.</b> The energy in these two <b>sub-bands</b> is equal and greater than that in the other four <b>sub-bands</b> because it contains energy from both the signal and the noise. For the two <b>sub-bands</b> with maximal energy, c is set to 1.5; c is set to 2.5 – 3 for the other <b>sub-bands</b> {{in the case of}} synthetic data.|$|R

25|$|In 1991, {{there were}} two {{available}} proposals that were assessed for an MPEG audio standard: MUSICAM (Masking pattern adapted Universal Subband Integrated Coding And Multiplexing) and ASPEC (Adaptive Spectral Perceptual Entropy Coding). As proposed by the Dutch corporation Philips, the French research institute CCETT, and the German standards organization Institute for Broadcast Technology, the MUSICAM technique was chosen due to its simplicity and error robustness, {{as well as for}} its high level of computational efficiency. The MUSICAM format, based on <b>sub-band</b> coding, became the basis for the MPEG Audio compression format, incorporating, for example, its frame structure, header format, sample rates, etc.|$|E
25|$|Gileño (also Apaches de Gila, Apaches de Xila, Apaches de la Sierra de Gila, Xileños, Gilenas, Gilans, Gilanians, Gila Apache, Gilleños) {{referred}} to several different Apache and non-Apache groups at different times. Gila refers {{to either the}} Gila River or the Gila Mountains. Some of the Gila Apaches were probably later known as the Mogollon Apaches, a Chiricahua <b>sub-band,</b> while others probably coalesced into the Chiricahua proper. But, since the term was used indiscriminately for all Apachean groups west of the Rio Grande (i.e. in southeast Arizona and western New Mexico), the reference in historical documents is often unclear. After 1722, Spanish documents start to distinguish between these different groups, in which case Apaches de Gila refers to the Western Apache living along the Gila River (synonymous with Coyotero). American writers first used the term {{to refer to the}} Mimbres (another Chiricahua subdivision).|$|E
25|$|When {{performing}} lossy audio encoding, such {{as creating}} an MP3 data stream, {{there is a}} trade-off {{between the amount of}} data generated and the sound quality of the results. The person generating an MP3 selects a bit rate, which specifies how many kilobits per second of audio are desired. The higher the bit rate, the larger the MP3 data stream will be, and, generally, the closer it will sound to the original recording. With too low a bit rate, compression artifacts (i.e., sounds that were not present in the original recording) may be audible in the reproduction. Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks. When this type of audio is compressed, artifacts such as ringing or pre-echo are usually heard. A sample of applause compressed or an excerpt of triangle instrument with a relatively low bit rate provides a good example of compression artifacts. Most subjective testings on perceptual codecs tend to avoid using this type of extremely critical sound materials however this type of artifacts generated by percussive sounds is barely perceptible on the MP3 format due to the specific temporal masking feature of the 32 <b>sub-band</b> filterbank of Layer II on which the MP3 format is based.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{doctoral}} student at Germany's University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Karlheinz Brandenburg began working on digital music compression in the early 1980s, focusing on how people perceive music. He completed his doctoral work in 1989. MP3 is directly descended from OCF and PXFM, representing {{the outcome of the}} collaboration of Brandenburg—working as a postdoc at AT Labs with James D. Johnston ("JJ") of AT Labs—with the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, Erlangen (where he worked with Bernhard Grill and four other researchers – [...] "The Original Six"), with relatively minor contributions from the MP2 branch of psychoacoustic <b>sub-band</b> coders. In 1990, Brandenburg became an assistant professor at Erlangen-Nuremberg. While there, he continued to work on music compression with scientists at the Fraunhofer Society (in 1993 he joined the staff of the Fraunhofer Institute). The song [...] "Tom's Diner" [...] by Suzanne Vega was the first song used by Karlheinz Brandenburg to develop the MP3. Brandenburg adopted the song for testing purposes, listening to it again and again each time refining the scheme, making sure it did not adversely affect the subtlety of Vega's voice.|$|E

50|$|A {{polyphase}} quadrature filter, or PQF, is {{a filter}} bank which splits an input signal into a given number N (mostly {{a power of}} 2) of equidistant <b>sub-bands.</b> These <b>sub-bands</b> are subsampled {{by a factor of}} N, so they are critically sampled.|$|R
30|$|Such {{nonuniform}} QMF decomposition provides good {{compromise between}} fine spectral resolution for low-frequency <b>sub-bands</b> and {{smaller number of}} FDLP parameters for higher bands. Furthermore, nonuniform QMF decomposition fits well into the perceptual audio coding scheme, where psychoacoustic models traditionally work in nonuniform (critical) <b>sub-bands.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Sub-band</b> coding is {{used for}} example in the G.722 codec. It uses <b>sub-band</b> {{adaptive}} {{differential pulse code modulation}} (SB-ADPCM) within a bit rate of 64 kbit/s. In the SB-ADPCM technique, the frequency band is split into two sub-bands (higher and lower) and the signals in each <b>sub-band</b> are encoded using ADPCM.|$|E

30|$|Aiming {{to improve}} {{spectrum}} efficiency and decrease interference, the authors in [47] proposed a joint clustering and spectrum sharing scheme. They group virtualized BSs into clusters and divide the frequency band into 13 <b>sub-bands.</b> The <b>sub-bands</b> are allocated to mobile devices {{based on their}} position.|$|R
50|$|The {{quantized}} <b>sub-bands</b> {{are split}} further into blocks, rectangular {{regions in the}} wavelet domain.

30|$|The {{observed}} {{signals are}} decomposed into <b>sub-bands</b> using an oversampled analysis filter bank. Here, an oversampling factor of two is chosen {{to reduce the}} aliasing effects between the adjacent <b>sub-bands</b> [30]. After the decomposition, {{the implementation of the}} proposed algorithm is performed in <b>sub-bands.</b> Figure 3 shows time domain plots of three speech signals and the observed signal. The speech signals from three speakers occur at different times and can overlap with each other in the observed signal. The overlapping signals simulate simultaneous conversation.|$|R
50|$|G.722 {{works by}} having the inbound voice signal pass through a digital filter that splits the audio signal into 0 Hz-to-4 kHz and 4 kHz-to-8 kHz audio bands. These sub-bands are then encoded using <b>sub-band</b> ADPCM. Most of the human voice energy is {{concentrated}} in {{the lower half of}} the audio band (0-4 kHz), so 48 kbit/s of the bandwidth is dedicated to the lower <b>sub-band</b> and the other 16 kbit/s is allocated to the higher <b>sub-band.</b>|$|E
50|$|By comparison, <b>sub-band</b> coders do not {{generally}} have an explicit decorrelation step, but instead exploit the already-existing reduced correlation {{within each of}} the sub-bands of the signal, due to the relative flatness of each <b>sub-band</b> of the power spectrum in many classes of signals.|$|E

This paper investigates a set of new ionospheric parameters that can be observed and mapped by SAR by exploring range and azimuth <b>sub-bands.</b> The range <b>sub-bands</b> are used to estimate the ionosphere independently of polarimetry. The azimuth <b>sub-bands</b> are related to the three-dimensional geometry of the ionosphere, as well as, to its dynamic component.
