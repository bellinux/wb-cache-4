5000|$|Amonix, Inc. is a {{solar power}} system {{developer}} based in Seal Beach, California. The company manufactures concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) products designed for installation in sunny and dry climates. CPV products convert sunlight into electrical energy {{in the same way}} that conventional <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>technology</b> does, except that they use optics to focus the solar radiation before the light is absorbed by solar cells. According to a comparative study of energy production of solar technologies, CPV systems require no water for energy production and produce more energy per megawatt (MW) installed than traditional PV systems. Amonix has nearly 70 Megawatts(DC) of CPV solar power systems deployed globally, including Southwestern U.S. [...] and Spain. In May 2012, the Alamosa Solar Generating project, owned and operated by Cogentrix Energy, began commercial operation. This is the largest CPV power plant in the world and is expected to produce enough clean renewable energy per year to power more than 6,500 homes and will avoid the emissions of over 43,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. The Alamosa Solar Generating Project is supported by a power purchase agreement (PPA), which is a long-term agreement to sell the power it will generate. Under the project’s PPA, the Public Service Company of Colorado will buy the power generated by the solar facility for the next 20 years. [...] In July 2012, Amonix set the world record for photovoltaic module efficiency at 33.5% (full regression analysis) under nominal operating conditions, verified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. [...] In April 2013, Amonix broke the record set in July 2012, demonstrating photovoltaic module efficiency at 34.9% (full regression analysis) under normal concentrator standard operating conditions (CSOC), also verified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. [...] In August 2013, Amonix announced it had achieved a 35.9% photovoltaic module efficiency rating under concentrator standard test conditions (CSTC) as calculated by NREL. [...] In June, 2014, the assets of Amonix were acquired by Arzon Solar, LLC for the purpose of continued development of CPV technology and products.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{provision}} of adequate and sustainable power {{supply to the}} country’s citizens has been a mirage since the 80 ’s when the nation neglected signals to improve its power generation capacity. The rapid population growth and increase in industrial activities necessitate the injection of <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>technology</b> into the nation’s energy mix. This paper therefore {{is an attempt to}} design a stand-alone solar photovoltaic system for residential application. in this study, direct current (DC) appliances (lighting, fan, DVD player, radio) and alternative current (AC) appliances (television, refrigerator, and blender) were considered. The total load power of these appliances is 1981 w. The array to load ratio determined as well as the daily watt-hour load shows that the use of hybrid system in this design is not recommended. To power these appliances, 64 modules with power rating 13052. 8 W under standard test condition (STC), 56 batteries in the battery bank with system battery capacity of 4900 Ah and one charge controller are required. Therefore, for sustainability, reliability and accessibility of power, the use of stand-alone <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>technology</b> is recommended...|$|E

The study proposes and models a small pilot installation on Lake Pleasant Reservoir, part of the Central Arizona Project, and finds that lifetime costs per unit energy are higher than what the Central Arizona Project currently pays for energy, assuming US median per-wattinstalled costs for commercial solar. This cost however does not factor in savings from water conservation, existing infrastructure, reduced land costs, or other benefits. The study recommends water reservoirs by hydropower dams as ideal locations for floating photovoltaic installations. Justified with a significant background on Arizona’s environmental, social, and economic sustainability, as well as regulations calling for increased renewable energy generation and reduced carbon emissions, this study recommends aggressive implementation of floating <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>technology</b> within a sustainable development paradigm...|$|E
