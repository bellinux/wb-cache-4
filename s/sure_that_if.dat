From his jobs he learned, he later averred, how eccentric, {{stubborn}} and unpredictable men, animals and machines can be. At {{the same time}} he interacted with colleagues, fellow breadwinners who had satirical disposition towards even their worst troubles. Barks later declared that he was <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> not for a little humor in their troubled lives, they would certainly go insane. It was an attitude towards life that Barks would adopt. Later he would say it was natural for him to satirize the secret yearnings and desires, the pompous style and the disappointments of his characters. According to Barks, this period of his life would later influence his best known fictional characters: Walt Disney's Donald Duck and his own Scrooge McDuck.|$|E

2500|$|Hellig Usvart was a seminal, highly {{influential}} album for the Christian {{black metal}} movement.
