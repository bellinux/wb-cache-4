5|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} conducted from 2001 to 2005 {{revealed the}} presence of water ice as well as frozen carbon dioxide {{on the surface of}} Titania, which in turn suggested that the moon may have a tenuous carbon dioxide atmosphere with a <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> of about 10 nanopascals (10−13 bar). Measurements during Titania's occultation of a star put an upper limit on the <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> of any possible atmosphere at 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar).|$|E
5|$|On September 8, 2001, Titania occulted {{a bright}} star (HIP106829) with a visible {{magnitude}} of 7.2; {{this was an}} opportunity to both refine Titania's diameter and ephemeris, and to detect any extant atmosphere. The data revealed no atmosphere to a <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> of 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar); if it exists, {{it would have to be}} far thinner than that of Triton or Pluto. This upper limit is still several times higher than the maximum possible <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> of the carbon dioxide, meaning that the measurements place essentially no constraints on parameters of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} pressure decreases with altitude, {{and this has}} an effect on the absolute pressure of the diving environment. The most important effect is that the diver must decompress to a lower <b>surface</b> <b>pressure,</b> and this requires longer decompression for the same dive profile.|$|E

40|$|The {{control of}} a {{separated}} flow over a wall-mounted hump, by means of two-dimensional zero efflux perturbations, was studied experimentally in order to generate a data set for a workshop aimed at validating CFD turbulence models. Part 1 of this paper considered details of the baseline (uncontrolled) case and a steady-suction control case. The data set for a specific zero efflux control case comprised static <b>surface</b> <b>pressures</b> together with phase-averaged dynamic <b>surface</b> <b>pressures</b> and PIV flowfield measurements. Additional static and dynamic <b>surface</b> <b>pressures</b> were acquired {{for a variety of}} control amplitudes, control frequencies and Reynolds numbers. Due consideration was given to characterizing the flow {{in the vicinity of the}} control slot, with and without external flow, and to perturbation two-dimensionality. Triple-decomposition of the fluctuating velocity and pressure fields was employed for presenting and analyzing the experimental data. This facilitated an assessment of the mechanism of separation control and the quantification of the coherent and turbulent <b>surface</b> <b>pressures,</b> Reynolds stresses and energy fluxes. Spanwise <b>surface</b> <b>pressures</b> and phase-averaged stereoscopic PIV data revealed an effectively two-dimensional flowfield despite highly three-dimensional instantaneous flow structures...|$|R

5|$|Historically, {{therapeutic}} decompression {{was done}} by recompressing the diver to the depth of relief of pain, or a bit deeper, maintaining that pressure for a while, so that bubbles could be re-dissolved, and performing a slow decompression back to the <b>surface</b> <b>pressure.</b> Later air tables were standardised to specific depths, followed by slow decompression. This procedure has been superseded almost entirely by hyperbaric oxygen treatment.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, {{a team of}} Indian, British and American astronomers {{working in}} Java (Indonesia) and Kavalur (India) claimed that they had {{detected}} a thin atmosphere during an occultation, when it and Jupiter passed {{in front of a}} star. They estimated that the <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> was around 0.1 Pa. However, in 1979, Voyager 1 observed an occultation of the star κ Centauri during its flyby of Jupiter, with differing results. The occultation measurements were conducted in the far-ultraviolet spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 200 nm, which were much more sensitive to the presence of gases than the 1972 measurements made in the visible spectrum. No atmosphere was revealed by the Voyager data. The upper limit on the surface particle number density was found to be , which corresponds to a <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> of less than 2.5 µPa. The latter value is almost five orders of magnitude less than the 1972 estimate.|$|E
5|$|Makemake was {{expected}} to have an atmosphere {{similar to that of}} Pluto but with a lower <b>surface</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, on 23 April 2011 Makemake passed in front of an 18th-magnitude star and abruptly blocked its light. The results showed that Makemake presently lacks a substantial atmosphere and placed an upper limit of 4–12 nanobar on the pressure at its surface.|$|E

5|$|Observations {{with the}} Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope, first {{described}} in 1995, revealed that Europa has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of molecular oxygen (O2). The <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> of Europa's atmosphere is 0.1μPa, or 10−12 {{times that of}} the Earth. In 1997, the Galileo spacecraft confirmed the presence of a tenuous ionosphere (an upper-atmospheric layer of charged particles) around Europa created by solar radiation and energetic particles from Jupiter's magnetosphere, providing evidence of an atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to <b>surface</b> <b>pressure,</b> and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less {{showed no signs of}} DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Callisto {{has a very}} tenuous {{atmosphere}} {{composed of}} carbon dioxide. It was detected by the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) from its absorption feature near the wavelength 4.2micrometers. The <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is estimated to be}} 7.5 bar (0.75 µPa) and particle density 4cm3. Because such a thin atmosphere would be lost in only about 4days (see atmospheric escape), it must be constantly replenished, possibly by slow sublimation of carbon dioxide ice from Callisto's icy crust, which would be compatible with the sublimation–degradation hypothesis for the formation of the surface knobs.|$|E

40|$|Restricted Access. We report {{our studies}} on the mixed Langmuir {{monolayer}} of mesogenic molecules, p-(ethoxy) -p-phenylazo phenyl hexanoate (EPPH) and octyl cyano biphenyl (8 CB), employing the techniques of surface manometry and Brewster angle microscopy. Our {{studies show that the}} mixed monolayer exhibits higher collapse pressures for certain mole fractions of EPPH in 8 CB as compared to individual monolayers. Also, a considerable reduction in the area per molecule is seen in the mixed monolayer, indicating a condensed phase. We have also studied the photostability of the mixed monolayer at different initial <b>surface</b> <b>pressures.</b> The mixed monolayer, under alternate cycles of UV and visible illumination, exhibits changes in <b>surface</b> <b>pressures.</b> This is due to the photoinduced transformation of EPPH isomers in the mixed monolayer. Our in-situ Brewster angle microscope studies for 0. 5 mole fraction of EPPH in 8 CB show a phase separation in the UV and a miscible phase in the visible, at low <b>surface</b> <b>pressures</b> (~ 5 mN/m). At higher <b>surface</b> <b>pressures</b> (~ 10 mN/m), under UV illumination, we find a phase separation which does not revert to a miscible phase under visible illumination...|$|R

His forecast calculated that the change in <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> would be , an unrealistic value incorrect by two orders of magnitude. The large error was caused by an imbalance in the pressure and wind velocity fields used as the initial conditions in his analysis.|$|E
5|$|In {{recreational}} diving terminology, in a {{bounce dive}} the diver descends {{directly to the}} maximum depth, spends very little time at maximum depth and ascends directly to the surface, preferably at an ascent rate recommended by the decompression model used, and making any necessary decompression stops. In commercial diving a bounce dive is any surface oriented dive, in which the diver is decompressed to <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> {{at the end of}} the dive and does not transfer to a hyperbaric habitat where the diver lives at pressure between dives and only decompresses at the end of a tour of duty.

40|$|AbstractFilms of {{pulmonary}} surfactant in the lung are metastable at <b>surface</b> <b>pressures</b> {{well above the}} equilibrium spreading pressure of 45 mN/m but commonly collapse at that pressure when compressed in vitro. The studies reported here determined the effect of compression rate {{on the ability of}} monolayers containing extracted calf surfactant at 37 °C to maintain very high <b>surface</b> <b>pressures</b> on the continuous interface of a captive bubble. Increasing the rate from 2 Å 2 /phospholipid/min (i. e., 3 % of (initial area at 40 mN/m) /min) to 23 %/s produced only transient increases to 48 mN/m. Above a threshold rate of 32 %/s, however, <b>surface</b> <b>pressures</b> reached > 68 mN/m. After the rapid compression, static films maintained <b>surface</b> <b>pressures</b> within ± 1 mN/m both at these maximum values and at lower pressures following expansion at < 5 %/min to ≥ 45 mN/m. Experiments with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine at 37 °C produced similar results. These findings indicate that compression at rates comparable to values in the lungs can transform at least some phospholipid monolayers from a form that collapses readily at the equilibrium spreading pressure to one that is metastable for prolonged periods at higher pressures. Our results also suggest that transformation of surfactant films can occur without refinement of their composition...|$|R
5|$|The surface {{interval}} (SI) or surface interval time (SIT) is {{the time}} spent by a diver at <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> after a dive during which inert gas which was still present {{at the end of}} the dive is further eliminated from the tissues.

5|$|Hurricane Ioke {{became one}} of five hurricanes to reach Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale in the Central North Pacific Ocean, {{and the only one}} {{originating}} in the basin. With an estimated minimum central pressure of 915mbar (27.019inHg), the cyclone attained the lowest estimated <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> for any hurricane within the basin, surpassing the previous minimum set by Hurricane Gilma in 1994. Ioke maintained at least Category4 status for 198consecutive hours, which was the longest continuous time period at that intensity ever observed for any tropical cyclone anywhere on Earth. Additionally, the cyclone remained at the equivalence of a super typhoon for 174consecutive hours, which was also a record. As a result of its extended duration and intensity, Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke accrued an Accumulated cyclone energy index of 82, which set a new worldwide record.|$|E

With weak wind shear and modest divergence of air over the system, it began to mature, although initially the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) downplayed the potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Over the next several hours, a low-level circulation center became evident and convection organized around it, prompting the JTWC to issue an updated outlook. At 1800 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the storm as a tropical depression while it was located northeast of Yap in the Caroline Islands. The JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system at 2030 UTC, and designated it Tropical Depression 25W at 1200 UTC on November 12. The system intensified gradually as it began to track quickly westward toward the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|On August14, 2015, a {{well-defined}} tropical wave, accompanied by significant <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> falls, traversed Western Africa and emerged over the Atlantic Ocean that evening. A broad surface low developed along the wave on August15. Embedded within monsoon flow, various environmental factors enabled gradual {{development of the}} disturbance, including low wind shear, above-average sea surface temperatures, moderate moisture content, and favorable diffluence. A subtropical ridge to the north steered the system generally west-northwest throughout its entire existence. On August17, the surface low became increasingly defined and convection more persistent. It subsequently acquired enough organization to be classified a tropical depression—the fourth of the 2015season—at 06:00UTC on August18. At this time, it was situated about 825mi (1,325km) west-southwest of Praia, Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|On June7, {{small area}} of low {{pressure}} developed off {{the west coast}} of India. Over the following two days, convection associated with the low gradually organized and by June9, satellite intensity estimates from the JTWC reached 55km/h (30mph). A TCFA was subsequently issued for the system before it made landfall in Gujarat early on June10. Although overland, the low maintained significant convection as it turned westward and through its re-emergence into the Arabian Sea on June11. Once back over water, convection rapidly spread westward in response to an anticyclone over the Arabian Peninsula and Afghanistan. Early on June12, the cyclone was estimated to have attained tropical storm status based on a ship report near the center of 65km/h (40mph) sustained winds and a <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg). Later that day, strong wind shear stemming from the anticyclone displaced convection from the tropical storm by more than 110km (70mi), prompting the final advisory from the JTWC. The remnants of the system were last noted on June13 dissipating over the Arabian Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Julia trace {{back to a}} {{vigorous}} tropical wave, or an equatorward low-pressure area, which emerged into the Atlantic along the western coast of Africa on September11.

As the wave moved generally westward at 10 to 15mph (16 to 24km/h), a quick increase in organization {{as well as a}} significant drop in <b>surface</b> <b>pressure</b> became notable. The system continued to organize, and several hours later, the NHC noted only a slight increase would suffice {{for the development of a}} tropical cyclone.

We found that, in general, the distributions of alveolar size, mechanical stresses, and <b>surface</b> <b>pressures</b> in the lungs were dominated by the weight of the lung and that changing the shape of the lung or chest wall had relatively little effect. Only at high states of expansion where the lung was very stiff did changing the shape of the chest wall cause substantial changes.
