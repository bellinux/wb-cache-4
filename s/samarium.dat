5|$|<b>Samarium</b> salts stimulate metabolism, but it {{is unclear}} whether this is the effect of <b>samarium</b> or other {{lanthanides}} present with it. The total amount of <b>samarium</b> in adults is about 50µg, mostly in liver and kidneys and with about 8µg/L being dissolved in the blood. <b>Samarium</b> is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and therefore is normally not a part of human diet. However, a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of <b>samarium.</b> Insoluble salts of <b>samarium</b> are non-toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samarium</b> is {{not found}} free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is {{contained}} in many minerals, including monazite, bastnäsite, cerite, gadolinite and samarskite; monazite (in which <b>samarium</b> occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%) and bastnäsite are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of <b>samarium</b> are estimated at two million tonnes; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes. Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it {{is followed by the}} US (about 5,000tonnes) and India (2,700tonnes). <b>Samarium</b> is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about 30USD/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides. Whereas mischmetal – a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1% of <b>samarium</b> – has long been used, relatively pure <b>samarium</b> has been isolated only recently, through ion exchange processes, solvent extraction techniques, and electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium(III) chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride. <b>Samarium</b> can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum. The product is then distilled to separate <b>samarium</b> (boiling point 1794°C) and lanthanum (b.p.3464°C).|$|E
5|$|With {{the average}} {{concentration}} of about 8 {{parts per million}} (ppm), <b>samarium</b> is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. It is the fifth most abundant lanthanide and is more common than elements such as tin. <b>Samarium</b> concentration in soils varies between 2 and 23ppm, and oceans contain about 0.5–0.8parts per trillion. Distribution of <b>samarium</b> in soils strongly depends on its chemical state and is very inhomogeneous: in sandy soils, <b>samarium</b> concentration is about 200 times higher at the surface of soil particles than in the water trapped between them, and this ratio can exceed 1,000 in clays.|$|E
5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, <b>samarium</b> halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic <b>samarium</b> diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of <b>samarium</b> triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|Freshly {{prepared}} <b>samarium</b> has {{a silvery}} luster. In air, it slowly oxidizes {{at room temperature}} and spontaneously ignites at 150°C. Even when stored under mineral oil, <b>samarium</b> gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish-yellow powder of the oxide-hydroxide mixture at the surface. The metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as argon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samarium</b> (and its sesquioxide) are {{paramagnetic}} at room temperature. Their corresponding effective magnetic moments, below 2µB, are the 3rd lowest {{among the}} lanthanides (and their oxides) after lanthanum and lutetium. The metal transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 14.8K. Individual <b>samarium</b> atoms can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules. They {{can also be}} doped between the C60 molecules in the fullerene solid, rendering it superconductive at temperatures below 8K. <b>Samarium</b> doping of iron-based superconductors – the most recent class of high-temperature superconductors – allows to enhance their transition temperature to 56K, which is the highest value achieved so far in this series.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samarium</b> {{carbides}} {{are prepared}} by melting a graphite-metal mixture in an inert atmosphere. After the synthesis, they are unstable in air and are studied also under inert atmosphere. <b>Samarium</b> monophosphide SmP is a semiconductor with the bandgap of 1.10eV, {{the same as}} in silicon, and high electrical conductivity of n-type. It can be prepared by annealing at 1100°C an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of phosphorus and <b>samarium.</b> Phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode, thus the heating rate has to be kept well below 1°C/min. Similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide SmAs, but the synthesis temperature is higher at 1800°C.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samarium</b> forms a cyclopentadienide Sm(C5H5)3 and its chloroderivatives Sm(C5H5)2Cl and Sm(C5H5)Cl2. They are {{prepared}} by reacting <b>samarium</b> trichloride with NaC5H5 in tetrahydrofuran. Contrary to cyclopentadienides {{of most other}} lanthanides, in Sm(C5H5)3 some C5H5 rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes η1 or edges η2 toward another neighboring <b>samarium</b> atom, thereby creating polymeric chains. The chloroderivative Sm(C5H5)2Cl has a dimer structure, which is more accurately expressed as (η5-C5H5)2Sm(µ-Cl)2(η5-C5H5)2. There, the chlorine bridges can be replaced, for instance, by iodine, hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samarium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolSm and atomic number62. It is a moderately hard silvery metal that readily oxidizes in air. Being a typical {{member of the}} lanthanide series, <b>samarium</b> usually assumes the oxidation state +3. Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably the monoxide SmO, monochalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as samarium(II) iodide. The last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis. <b>Samarium</b> has no significant biological role but is only slightly toxic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samarium</b> is a {{rare earth}} metal having a {{hardness}} and density {{similar to those of}} zinc. With the boiling point of 1794°C, <b>samarium</b> is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium; this property facilitates separation of <b>samarium</b> from the mineral ore. At ambient conditions, <b>samarium</b> normally assumes a rhombohedral structure (α form). Upon heating to 731°C, its crystal symmetry changes into hexagonally close-packed (hcp), however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity. Further heating to 922°C transforms the metal into a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase. Heating to 300°C combined with compression to 40kbar results in a double-hexagonally close-packed structure (dhcp). Applying higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900kbar. In one study, the dhcp phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700°C, confirming the transient character of this <b>samarium</b> phase. Also, thin films of <b>samarium</b> obtained by vapor deposition may contain the hcp or dhcp phases at ambient conditions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samarium</b> {{is one of}} the few {{lanthanides}} {{that form}} a monoxide, SmO. This lustrous golden-yellow compound was obtained by reducing Sm2O3 with <b>samarium</b> metal at elevated temperature (1000°C) and pressure above 50kbar; lowering the pressure resulted in an incomplete reaction. SmO has the cubic rock-salt lattice structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samarium</b> was {{discovered}} in 1879 by the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran and named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated. The mineral itself was earlier named after a Russian mine official, Colonel Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets, who thereby became {{the first person to}} have a chemical element named after him, albeit indirectly. Although classified as a rare-earth element, <b>samarium</b> is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is more common than such metals as tin. <b>Samarium</b> occurs with concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including cerite, gadolinite, samarskite, monazite and bastnäsite, the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element. These minerals are mostly found in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia; China is by far the world leader in <b>samarium</b> mining and production.|$|E
5|$|Sintering powders of <b>samarium</b> oxide and boron, in vacuum, {{yields a}} powder {{containing}} several <b>samarium</b> boride phases, and their volume ratio {{can be controlled}} through the mixing proportion. The powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain <b>samarium</b> boride using arc melting or zone melting techniques, relying on the different melting/crystallization temperature of SmB6 (2580°C), SmB4 (about 2300°C) and SmB66 (2150°C). All these materials are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content. <b>Samarium</b> diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65 kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240°C to stabilize its growth. Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formations of SmB6.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{electrical}} resistivity in <b>samarium</b> monochalcogenides {{can be used}} in a pressure sensor or in a memory device triggered between a low-resistance and high-resistance state by external pressure, and such devices are being developed commercially. <b>Samarium</b> monosulfide also generates electric voltage upon moderate heating to about 150°C that can be applied in thermoelectric power converters.|$|E
5|$|The major {{commercial}} {{application of}} <b>samarium</b> is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization {{second only to}} neodymium magnets; however, <b>samarium</b> compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above , without losing their magnetic properties, due to the alloy's higher Curie point. The radioactive isotope samarium-153 is the active component of the drug <b>samarium</b> (153Sm) lexidronam (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong neutron absorber and is therefore added to the control rods of nuclear reactors. It is also formed as a decay product during the reactor operation {{and is one of the}} important factors considered in the reactor design and operation. Other applications of <b>samarium</b> include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and an X-ray laser.|$|E
5|$|Boisbaudran {{named his}} element samaria after the mineral samarskite, {{which in turn}} honored Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets (1803–1870). Samarsky-Bykhovets, as the Chief of Staff of the Russian Corps of Mining Engineers, had granted access for two German mineralogists, the {{brothers}} Gustav Rose and Heinrich Rose, to study the mineral samples from the Urals. In this sense <b>samarium</b> was the first chemical element to be named after a person. Later the name samaria used by Boisbaudran was transformed into <b>samarium,</b> to conform with other element names, and samaria nowadays is sometimes {{used to refer to}} <b>samarium</b> oxide, by analogy with yttria, zirconia, alumina, ceria, holmia, etc. The symbol Sm was suggested for samarium; however an alternative Sa was frequently used instead until the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Europium {{was first}} found in 1890 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who {{obtained}} basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not {{accounted for by}} <b>samarium</b> or gadolinium. However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected samples of the recently discovered element <b>samarium</b> were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and {{who was able to}} isolate it in 1901; he then named it europium.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to dihalides, the reduction also produces numerous non-stoichiometric <b>samarium</b> halides with a well-defined crystal structure, such as Sm3F7, Sm14F33, Sm27F64, Sm11Br24, Sm5Br11 and Sm6Br13.|$|E
5|$|Many {{properties}} of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and <b>samarium.</b> For example, the melting point, {{the first three}} ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater than those of neodymium and {{lower than those of}} samarium; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic (Pm3+) radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of <b>samarium</b> and less those of neodymium.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{crystalline}} binary compounds {{are known}} for <b>samarium</b> {{and one of the}} group-14, 15 or 16 element X, where X is Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb or Te, and metallic alloys of <b>samarium</b> form another large group. They are all prepared by annealing mixed powders of the corresponding elements. Many of the resulting compounds are non-stoichiometric and have nominal compositions SmaXb, where the b/a ratio varies between 0.5 and 3.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{europium}} is {{overshadowed by}} caesium-137 and strontium-90 as a radiation hazard, and by <b>samarium</b> {{and others as}} a neutron poison.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive samarium-153 is a {{beta emitter}} with a {{half-life}} of 46.3 hours. It {{is used to}} kill cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and osteosarcoma. For this purpose, samarium-153 is chelated with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and injected intravenously. The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive <b>samarium</b> in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells. The corresponding drug has several names including <b>samarium</b> (153Sm) lexidronam; its trade name is Quadramet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samarium</b> hexaboride, {{abbreviated}} SmB6, {{has recently}} {{been shown to be}} a topological insulator with potential applications to quantum computing.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samarium</b> {{is one of}} the few {{lanthanides}} that {{exhibit the}} oxidation state +2. The Sm2+ ions are blood-red in aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} <b>samarium</b> {{and its compounds}} is as catalyst and chemical reagent. <b>Samarium</b> catalysts assist decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), {{as well as the}} dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol. Samarium(III) triflate (Sm(OTf)3, that is Sm(CF3SO3)3), {{is one of the most}} efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen-promoted Friedel–Crafts reaction with alkenes. Samarium(II) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis, for example in the desulfonylation reactions; annulation; Danishefsky, Kuwajima, Mukaiyama and Holton Taxol total syntheses; strychnine total synthesis; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium(II) iodide.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of <b>samarium</b> is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have a nominal composition of SmCo5 or Sm2Co17. They have high permanent magnetization, which is about 10,000 times that of iron and is second only to that of neodymium magnets. However, samarium-based magnets have higher resistance to demagnetization, as they are stable to temperatures above 700°C (cf. 300–400°C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, and high-end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments. For example, they are used in the motors of a solar-powered electric aircraft, the Solar Challenger, and in the <b>Samarium</b> Cobalt Noiseless electric guitar and bass pickups.|$|E
5|$|Promethium is {{the only}} {{lanthanide}} and {{one of only two}} elements among the first 83 that has no stable (or even long-lived) isotopes. This is a result of a rarely occurring effect of the liquid drop model and stabilities of neighbor element isotopes; it is also the least stable element of the first 84. The primary decay products are neodymium and <b>samarium</b> isotopes (promethium-146 decays to both, the lighter isotopes generally to neodymium via positron decay and electron capture, and the heavier isotopes to <b>samarium</b> via beta decay). Promethium nuclear isomers may decay to other promethium isotopes and one isotope (145Pm) has a very rare alpha decay mode to stable praseodymium-141.|$|E
5|$|Samarium-149 {{has high}} {{cross-section}} for neutron capture (41,000barns) {{and is therefore}} used in the control rods of nuclear reactors. Its advantage compared to competing materials, such as boron and cadmium, is stability of absorption – most of the fusion and decay products of samarium-149 are other isotopes of <b>samarium</b> that are also good neutron absorbers. For example, the cross section of samarium-151 is 15,000barns, {{it is on the}} order of hundreds of barns for 150Sm, 152Sm, and 153Sm, and is 6,800barns for natural (mixed-isotope) <b>samarium.</b> Among the decay products in a nuclear reactor, samarium-149 is regarded as the second most important for the reactor design and operation after xenon-135.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-lived}} isotopes,146Sm, 147Sm, and 148Sm, primarily decay by {{emission of}} alpha particles to isotopes of neodymium. Lighter unstable isotopes of <b>samarium</b> primarily decay by electron capture to isotopes of promethium, while heavier ones convert through beta decay to isotopes of europium.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} oxide of <b>samarium</b> is the {{sesquioxide}} Sm2O3. As many other <b>samarium</b> compounds, {{it exists in}} several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of Sm2O3 is rather high (2345°C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating, but with induction heating, through a radio-frequency coil. The Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method (Verneuil process) from the Sm2O3 powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm2O3 to 1900°C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{decay mode}} for {{isotopes}} lighter than 153Eu is electron capture, {{and the primary}} mode for heavier isotopes is beta minus decay. The primary decay products before 153Eu are isotopes of <b>samarium</b> (Sm) and the primary products after are isotopes of gadolinium (Gd).|$|E
5|$|When ingested, {{only about}} 0.05% of <b>samarium</b> salts is {{absorbed into the}} {{bloodstream}} and the remainder is excreted. From the blood, about 45% goes to the liver and 45% is deposited {{on the surface of}} the bones where it remains for about 10 years; the balance 10% is excreted.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is an {{essential}} cofactor for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means {{that it may be}} substituted with cerium, praseodymium, or neodymium without ill effects, and with the smaller <b>samarium,</b> europium, or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} <b>samarium</b> has a radioactivity of 128Bq/g. It {{is composed}} of four stable isotopes: 144Sm, 150Sm, 152Sm and 154Sm, and three extremely long-lived radioisotopes, 147Sm (half-life t1/2 = 1.06 years), 148Sm (7 years) and 149Sm (>2 years), with 152Sm being the most abundant (natural abundance 26.75%). 149Sm is listed by various sources either as stable or radioactive isotope.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium alloyed with nickel (PrNi5) {{has such}} a strong magnetocaloric effect that it has allowed {{scientists}} to approach within one thousandth of a degree of absolute zero. In general, most alloys of the cerium-group rare earths (lanthanum through <b>samarium)</b> with 3d transition metals give extremely stable magnets that are often used in small equipment, such as motors, printers, watches, headphones, loudspeakers, and magnetic storage.|$|E
5|$|Samarium-doped calcium {{fluoride}} crystals {{were used as}} an active medium {{in one of the}} first solid-state lasers designed and constructed by Peter Sorokin (co-inventor of the dye laser) and Mirek Stevenson at IBM research labs in early 1961. This <b>samarium</b> laser emitted pulses of red light at 708.5nm. It had to be cooled by liquid helium and thus did not find practical applications.|$|E
