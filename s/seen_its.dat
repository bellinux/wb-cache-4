25|$|WHP {{was first}} {{established}} in 2008 and immediately set about {{developing a new}} flywheel energy-recovery system for the Williams F1 Team after the introduction of Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) into Formula One for the 2009 season.

While it was never raced in Formula One due to technical changes, WHP has since <b>seen</b> <b>its</b> technology adapted for a range of applications. For example, the Audi R18 hybrid car that won the 2012 Le Mans 24 Hours used a WHP flywheel.
