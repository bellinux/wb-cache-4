50|$|<b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> of MARPOL {{was drafted}} to {{regulate}} sewage discharges from vessels. It has entered into force internationally and {{would apply to}} ships that are flagged in ratifying countries, but because the United States has not ratified <b>Annex</b> <b>IV,</b> it is not mandatory that ships follow it when in U.S. waters. However, its requirements are minimal, even compared with U.S. rules for MSDs. <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> requires that vessels be equipped with a certified sewage treatment system or holding tank, but it prescribes no specific performance standards. Within three miles (5 km) of shore, <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> requires that sewage discharges be treated by a certified MSD prior to discharge. Between three and 12 mi from shore, sewage discharges must be treated by no less than maceration or chlorination; sewage discharges beyond 12 mi from shore are unrestricted. Vessels are permitted to meet alternative, less stringent requirements {{when they are in}} the jurisdiction of countries where less stringent requirements apply. In U.S. waters, vessels must comply with the regulations implementing Section 312 of the Clean Water Act.|$|R
40|$|The {{marine and}} {{hydrokinetic}} (MHK) environmental Impacts Knowledge Management System, dubbed “Tethys” after the mythical Greek titaness of the seas, {{is being developed}} by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to support the U. S. Department of Energy’s Wind and Water Power Program (WWPP). Functioning as a smart database, Tethys enables its users to identify key words or terms to help gather, organize and make available information and data pertaining to the environmental effects of MHK and offshore wind (OSW) energy development. By providing and categorizing relevant publications within a simple and searchable database, Tethys acts as a dissemination channel for information and data which can be utilized by regulators, project developers and researchers to minimize the environmental risks associated with offshore renewable energy developments and attempt to streamline the permitting process. Tethys also houses a separate content-related <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> data base with identical functionality to the Tethys knowledge base. <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> is a collaborative project among member nations of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Ocean Energy Systems – Implementing Agreement (OES-IA) that examines the environmental effects of ocean energy devices and projects. The U. S. Department of Energy leads the <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> working with federal partners such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). While the <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> database contains technical reports and journal articles, it is primarily focused on the collection of project site and research study metadata forms (completed by MHK researchers and developers around the world, and collected by PNNL) which provide information on environmental studies and the current progress of the various international MHK developments in the <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> member nations.

To ensure implementation of amendments of <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> in port of Klaipeda, the analysis framework model was defined by authors. The model evaluates the readiness of the port to changes brought by the amendments of MARPOL <b>Annex</b> <b>IV.</b> The scientific problem comes with perception of adequacy. Resolution MEPC. 200 (62) amending MARPOL 73 / 78 <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> states, that port reception facilities must be adequate {{to the needs of}} passenger ships using them without causing undue delay. Concept of adequacy is not defined, therefore other guidelines explaining adequacy were used: EU directive 2000 / 59 /EC and IMO resolution MEPC. 83 (44) Guidelines for ensuring adequacy of port reception facilities. Based on these sources, criteria that must be met to ensure adequacy were identified and tested in article: 1) reception facilities meet needs of ships normally using them; 2) discharge of sewage does to cause undue delay; 3) reception facilities does not provide disincentive to use them; 4) facilities are accessible; 5) facilities contribute to the improvement of the marine environment...|$|R

In later decisions the Court confirmed that by using other annexes of the peace agreement as a direct base for the analysis, not only in the context of systematic interpretation of the <b>Annex</b> <b>IV.</b> However, since the Court rejected the presented request of the appellants, it did not go into details concerning the controversial questions of the legality of the process in which the new Constitution (<b>Annex</b> <b>IV)</b> came to power and replaced the former Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

40|$|An experts' {{workshop}} was {{convened in}} Dublin Ireland September 27 th – 28 th 2010 {{in support of}} IEA Ocean Energy Systems Implementing Agreement <b>Annex</b> <b>IV.</b> PNNL was responsible for organizing {{the content of the}} workshop, overseeing the contractors (Irish Marine Institute) hosting the event, presenting material on <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> and materials applicable to the workshop intent. PNNL is also overseeing a contractor (Wave Energy Center/University of Plymouth – WEC/UP) in the collection and analysis of the <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> data. Fifty-eight experts from 8 countries attended the workshop by invitation, spending two days discussing the needs of <b>Annex</b> <b>IV.</b> Presentations by DOE (background on <b>Annex</b> <b>IV),</b> PNNL (process for developing Annex IV; presentation of the draft database for PNNL project, plans for incorporating <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> data), WEC/UP on the environmental effect matrix, and four MHK developers (two from the UK, one from Ireland and one from Sweden; each discussing their own projects and lessons learned for measuring and mitigating environmental effects, as well as interactions with consenting [permitting] processes) helped provide background. The workshop participants worked part of the time in the large group {{and most of the time}} in four smaller breakout groups. Participants engaged in the process and provided a wealth of examples of MHK environmental work, particularly in the European nations. They provided practical and actionable advice on the following: • Developing the <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> database, with specific uses and audiences • Strong consensus that we should collect detailed metadata on available data sets, rather than attempting to draw in copious datasets. The participants felt there would then be an opportunity to then ask for specific set of data as needed, with specific uses and ownership of the data specified. This is particularly important as many data collected, particularly in Europe but also in Canada, are proprietary; developers were not comfortable with the idea of handing over all their environmental effects data, but all said they would entertain the request if they specifics were clear. • The recommendation was to collect metadata via an online interactive form, taking no more than one hour to complete. • Although the idea of cases representing the “best practices” was recognized as useful, the participants pointed out that there are currently so few MHK projects in the water, that any and all projects were appropriate to highlight as “cases”. There was also discomfort at the implication that “best practices” implied “lesser practices”; this being unhelpful to a new and emerging industry. • Workshop participants were asked if they were willing to continue to engage in the <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> process; all expressed willingness. The workshop was successful in adequately addressing its objectives and through participation and interaction in the breakout sessions around the various topics. As a result of the workshop, many delegates are now better informed and have a greater understanding of the potential environmental effects of MHK devices on the marine environment. There is now a greater sense of understanding of the issues involved and consensus by those regulators, developers and scientists who attended the workshop. A strong network has also been built over the two days between European and US/Canadian technical experts in wave and tidal energy...|$|R
