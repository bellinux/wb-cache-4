5|$|After Rupert's {{retirement}} from active seafaring in around 1674, {{he was able}} to spend more time engaged in <b>scientific</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> became credited with many inventions and discoveries, although some subsequently {{turned out to be the}} innovative introduction of European inventions into England. Rupert converted some of the apartments at Windsor Castle to a luxury laboratory, complete with forges, instruments and raw materials, from where he conducted a range of experiments.|$|E

5|$|Antarctica is a {{de facto}} condominium, governed by parties to the Antarctic Treaty System that have {{consulting}} status. Twelve countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, and thirty-eight have signed it since then. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports <b>scientific</b> <b>research,</b> <b>and</b> protects the continent's ecozone. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from many nations.|$|E

These experiments involved a range of research topics, sometimes endangering the health of the COs.|$|E
5|$|GCC did not fund {{original}} <b>scientific</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> its climate claims relied {{largely on}} the World Climate Review and its successor the World Climate Report edited by Patrick Michaels and funded by the Western Fuels Association.

In 1996, GCC published a report entitled Global warming and extreme weather: fact vs. fiction written by Robert E. Davis.|$|E

5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{had offered}} to give the United States access to its <b>scientific</b> <b>research,</b> <b>and</b> Cockcroft, {{as part of the}} Tizard Mission, briefed American {{scientists}} on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The British and American projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 American offer to create a combined project. In November 1941, Frederick L. Hovde, the head of the London liaison office of the American Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> Development (OSRD), raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Percy Powell-Cotton {{was born}} in 1866, and was a Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers.

Harrison chaired the committee when Stimson was absent, but Byrnes, as the President's personal representative, was probably its most influential member.|$|E

5|$|According to {{contemporary}} rumors, Verne and d'Ennery came to difficulties over {{the treatment of}} science in the play, with d'Ennery wanting to condemn <b>scientific</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> Verne advocating a more science-friendly and hopeful approach. Verne reportedly cut some especially negative lines out of the script, and protested when d'Ennery had them reinserted for the production. Journey Through the Impossible would be their last collaboration. The play is also Verne's only contribution to the féerie genre.|$|E
5|$|Canada was an {{alternative}} source of heavy water. Cominco {{had been involved}} in heavy water research since 1934, and produced it at its smelting plant in Trail, British Columbia. On 26 February 1941, the NRC inquired about its ability to produce heavy water. This was followed on 23 July by a letter from Hugh Taylor, a British-born scientist working at Princeton University, on behalf of the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> Development (OSRD). Taylor offered a NDRC contract to produce , for which the NDRC was prepared to pay $5 per pound for low-grade and $10 for high-grade heavy water. At the time it was selling for up to $1,130 per pound.|$|E

5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{had offered}} to give the United States access to its <b>scientific</b> <b>research,</b> <b>and</b> the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American {{scientists}} on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. As part of the scientific exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. Oliphant, one of the Maud Committee's members, flew to the United States in late August 1941, and discovered that vital information had not reached key American physicists. He met the Uranium Committee, and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence, who was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Lawrence in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was a success; key American physicists {{became aware of the}} potential power of an atomic bomb. Armed with British data, Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> Development (OSRD), briefed Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace in a meeting at the White House on 9 October 1941.|$|E
