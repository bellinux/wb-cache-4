5000|$|Lablabi or Lablebi (لبلابي) is a Tunisian dish {{based on}} chick peas {{in a thin}} garlic and cumin-flavoured soup, served over small pieces of stale crusty bread. It is {{commonly}} eaten in inexpensive restaurants. Raw or <b>soft-cooked</b> <b>egg</b> is nearly always added to the hot soup mix (thus cooking), along with olive oil, harissa, additional cumin, capers, tuna and sometimes olives, garlic and vinegar or lemon or lime juice. Further garnishes may include cilantro, parsley and scallions. A traditional, but rarer, version, hergma is made with cows' trotters.|$|E
5000|$|Cooking time: There is {{substantial}} variation, with cooking time being the primary variable affecting doneness (soft-boiled vs. hard-boiled). It usually varies from 10-17 minutes for large hard-boiled eggs, 1-4 minutes for large <b>soft-cooked</b> <b>eggs.</b> Depending on altitude {{above sea level}} and humidity densities in a given climate, one may require extended amounts of time to reach the soft-boiled stage, and in fact, may never reach a fully hard stage.|$|R
