5|$|In October 2010, Microsoft {{suggested}} {{on one of}} its websites that a Windows Phone {{version of}} Angry Birds was in development. Rovio complained that Microsoft had not asked permission to make <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement,</b> noting that at that time it had not committed to design a Windows Phone version. Although Rovio asked Microsoft to revise its site to remove references to the game, a Windows Phone version was ultimately released in June 2011.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in Detroit, Mansour entered {{religious}} orders then earned {{a doctorate in}} biochemistry. She served {{as the president of}} Mercy College of Detroit from 1971 to 1983. She ran unsuccessfully for public office in 1982, in the process provoking comment from the Archbishop of Detroit. The Governor of Michigan appointed her to lead the state's social services department, and she was confirmed in early 1983. During this time, the Archbishop of Detroit and Vatican officials asked Mansour declare herself against abortion—her department was responsible for abortion services funded through Medicaid. Mansour refused to make <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement,</b> and two months after her confirmation as director she was required by the Vatican to decide whether she was to continue as director or as a nun. She chose to give up her vows as a nun. After serving out her appointment she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1988.|$|E

25|$|Declaration against interest: A {{statement}} that would incriminate or expose the declarant to liability {{to such an}} extent that it can be assumed he would only make <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> if it were true. It would be assumed that one would lie to further one's interests, so a statement against his interests (such as exposing oneself to criminal or civil liability) likely would not be made unless it were true.|$|E

But Steitz never responded. Kean was particularly interested in Steitz's source of information to make <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement,</b> since he also indicated there were no surviving records and the court-ordered search also turned up no relevant records.|$|E
25|$|Diplomatic {{recognition}} is an explicit, official, unilateral {{act in the}} foreign policy of states in regards to another party. Not having issued <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> {{does not necessarily mean}} the state has objections to the existence, independence, sovereignty or government of the other party. Some states, by custom or policy, do not extend formal recognitions, on the grounds that a vote for membership in the UN or another organisation whose membership is limited to states is itself an act of recognition.|$|E

25|$|Schiller {{asserts that}} when a person utters a {{statement}} in a situation they are doing so for a specific purpose: {{to solve the problem}} that habit could not handle alone. The meaning of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> is whatever contribution it makes to accomplishing the purpose of this particular occurrence of thought. The truth of the statement will be if it helps accomplishes that purpose. No utterance or thought can be given a meaning or a truth valuation outside the context of one of these particular occurrences of thought. This account of Schiller’s is a much more extreme view than even James took.|$|E
25|$|Many {{assemblers}} support predefined macros, {{and others}} support programmer-defined (and repeatedly re-definable) macros involving sequences of text lines in which variables and constants are embedded. This sequence of text lines may include opcodes or directives. Once a macro {{has been defined}} its name {{may be used in}} place of a mnemonic. When the assembler processes <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement,</b> it replaces the statement with the text lines associated with that macro, then processes them as if they existed in the source code file (including, in some assemblers, expansion of any macros existing in the replacement text). Macros in this sense date to IBM autocoders of the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Reith's {{attempts}} to broadcast statements by the Labour Party and TUC leaders were {{blocked by the}} Government; in partial response, he personally vetoed a statement that Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, wished to make, {{in the belief that}} allowing <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> would give Winston Churchill both motive and opportunity to take over the BBC—something which Churchill had continually advocated {{since the beginning of the}} Strike. Reith admitted to his staff that he would have preferred to allow the Labour and TUC leaders to broadcast directly.

5000|$|... "Commonplace" [...] is a {{translation}} of the Latin term locus communis (from Greek tópos koinós, see literary topos) which means [...] "a theme or argument of general application", <b>such</b> as <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> of proverbial wisdom. In this original sense, commonplace books were collections of such sayings, such as John Milton's commonplace book. Scholars have expanded this usage to include any manuscript that collects material along a common theme by an individual.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, an {{optimized}} implementation may execute {{much faster}} than the alternative, because it is often implemented by using an indexed branch table.

When implemented as <b>such,</b> <b>a</b> switch <b>statement</b> essentially becomes <b>a</b> perfect hash.|$|R
500|$|At the 1903 Ohio Republican convention, Foraker filed a {{resolution}} to endorse Roosevelt for re-election. [...] This would normally have been introduced at the 1904 convention, but Foraker hoped to use the resolution {{to take control of}} the Ohio party from Hanna. [...] The resolution placed Hanna in a difficult position: [...] if he supported it, he proclaimed he would not run for president; if he opposed it, he risked Roosevelt's wrath. [...] Hanna wired Roosevelt, who was on a western trip, that he intended to oppose it and would explain all when both men were in Washington.

[...] <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> would normally have meant membership in COMECON, but Vietnam was not a member, wanting to establish its sovereignty.

[...] Corrales later clarified in the Wildcard Round that she said <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> because of the low turnout in the Davao auditions and the even lower Gold Pass output.
