40|$|Abstract This study {{investigated}} the preservation of information resources in selected <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> in Ibadan North Local Government Area of Oyo State, Nigeria. The study examined the existence of preservation of information policies in <b>school</b> <b>libraries,</b> preservation measures in place, preservation equipment and materials available in <b>school</b> <b>libraries,</b> level of support given to preservation by the school management, level of training given to library staff on preservation in <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> and barriers to effective preservation of information resources in <b>school</b> <b>libraries.</b> The study adopted a descriptive survey research design and the instruments used were structured questionnaire administered to the school principals, vice-principals and school librarians and observational checklist which required a visit to those selected schools and observed some available information resources and existence of preservation on those materials. Ten (10) government secondary schools were randomly selected in Ibadan North Local Government Area of Oyo State, Nigeria while one hundred and forty five (145) respondents participated. Descriptive statistics methods were used to analyse the collected data. Findings from the study revealed that <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> based its acquisitions on textbooks, reference resources and fiction materials with 145 (100 %), 143 (98. 6 %) and 136 (93. 8 %) respectively without considering other vital information resources such as serials and electronic resources. There was an existence of preservation policies on information resources in selected <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> with 96 (66. 2 %) but the usage of the policies was very low with 44 (30. 3 %). Therefore the low use of preservation policies in <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> had affected the positive enhancement of the existing preservation policies in <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> with 58 (40. 0 %). Dusting and regular floor mopping were the available preservation measures put in place with 145 (100 %); fans with 98 (67. 6 %) were the available preservation equipment and materials; the level of school management support to preservation was very high with 90 (62. 1 %) {{and the level of}} staff training given on preservation of information resources based on school orientation programme with 124 (85. 5 %). The results also showed that lack of fund and inadequate infrastructure on the aspects of preservation of information resources were the major confrontations in selected <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> with 134 (92. 4 %) and 109 (74. 8 %) respectively. It can be concluded that preservation of information resources in selected <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> in Ibadan North Local Government Area of Oyo State, Nigeria was given priorities as level of school management supports for preservation of information resources was very high. It is therefore recommended that <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> should be adequately funded by all tiers of governments and the existing preservation policies on information resources in <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> should be reviewed.
