40|$|INTRODUCTION: The Episure Autodetect <b>syringe,</b> a {{spring-loaded}} <b>syringe,</b> is a loss-of-resistance <b>syringe</b> with {{an internal}} compression that applies constant {{pressure on the}} plunger. As the principle of loss-of-resistance {{is the same for}} adult and for pediatric patients, the Episure Autodetect <b>syringe</b> should be able to identify correctly the epidural space also in pediatric patients. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out for all pediatric patients, in which the Episure Autodetect <b>syringe</b> was used for locating the epidural space between 2007 and 2011 in our department. RESULTS: In 17 pediatric patients (9 months- 14 years, 7. 5 - 43 kg weight), the Episure <b>syringe</b> was used. In all 17 patients, the epidural space was correctly identified using the spring-loaded <b>syringe</b> as evidenced by satisfactory analgesia. No accidental dural punctures or false loss-of-resistances were observed. CONCLUSION: The spring-loaded Episure Autodetect <b>syringe</b> might be a potentially useful loss-of-resistance <b>syringe</b> for identification of the epidural space in pediatric patients...|$|R
5|$|Redfield and Alomar {{board the}} tanker and {{encounter}} Gionne, who escapes after dropping {{a case of}} syringes; Alomar keeps several. When Redfield and Alomar reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Redfield and Alomar defeat. Valentine radios in, telling Redfield and Alomar that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Alomar realizes that Gionne's <b>syringes</b> are doses of the drug. Redfield and Alomar follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the <b>syringes</b> Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Redfield and Alomar disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Redfield and Alomar through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Redfield and Alomar are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Valentine and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Redfield and Alomar fire rocket-propelled grenades at Wesker, killing him. In the game's final cutscene, Redfield wonders if the world is worth fighting for. Looking at Alomar and Valentine, he decides {{to live in a}} world without fear.|$|E
5|$|Some {{survivors}} of Hurricane Liza {{complained that they}} had only received one ration {{of food and water}} within 3 days of the passage of Liza. Subsequently, armed troops guarded gangs of looters that damaged additional homes. An effort was made to cure people who were suffering from sickness, but by midday on October3, after treating more than 5,000persons, the effort had been halted {{due to a lack of}} sterile cotton vital for administrating the shots. Medical workers attempted to vaccinate all survivors for typhoid fever and tetanus, but the supply of <b>syringes</b> ran short. A large memorial service was held on October2 in a nearby church.|$|E
5|$|Flamethrower, {{double piston}} and gunpowder-activated: Although the single piston {{flamethrower}} was first {{developed in the}} Byzantine Empire during the 7th century, the 10th-century Chinese flamethrower, or Pen Huo Qi, boasted a continuous stream of flame by employing double piston <b>syringes</b> (which had been known since the Han Dynasty) spouting Greek fire which had been imported from China's maritime trade contacts in the Middle East. It was first used in battle 932 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960), and the earliest illustration {{is found in the}} early Song Dynasty military manuscript Wujing Zongyao of 1044, which also described the device in full. Unlike the Greek model which employed a furnace, the Pen Huo Qi was ignited by an incendiary gunpowder fuse.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing <b>syringes</b> and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E
5|$|BioShock is a first-person shooter with {{role-playing}} game customization and stealth elements, and {{is similar}} to System Shock 2. The player takes the role of Jack as he is guided through Rapture towards various objectives. The player collects various weapons and plasmids as they work their way through enemy forces. The player can switch between one active weapon and one active plasmid at any time, allowing them to find combination attacks that can be effective against certain enemies, such as first shocking a Splicer then striking them down with a wrench. Weapons are limited by ammunition that the player collects; many weapons have secondary ammo types {{that can be used}} instead for additional benefits, such as bullets that inflict fire damage. Plasmid use consumes a serum called EVE which can be restored using EVE <b>syringes</b> collected by the player. The player has a health meter that decreases when they take damage. The player can restore their health with medical packs found throughout Rapture. If the player's health reduces to zero, they will be regenerated at the last Vita-Chamber that they passed with limited amounts of health and EVE. A patch for the game allows players to disable these Vita-Chambers, requiring players to restart a saved game if the character dies.|$|E
25|$|Delaware and Missouri use {{a lethal}} {{injection}} machine designed by Massachusetts-based Fred A. Leuchter {{consisting of two}} components: the delivery module and the control module. Two staff members each have a station in which they key on the machine and depress two stations' buttons to be ready in case of mechanical failure. Each person presses one station button on the console which travels to a computer which starts all three injections electronically. The computer then deletes who actually started the <b>syringes,</b> so the participants are not aware if their syringe contained saline {{or one of the}} drugs necessary for execution (to assuage guilt {{in a manner similar to}} the blank cartridge in execution by firing squad). The delivery module has eight <b>syringes.</b> The end <b>syringes</b> (i.e., <b>syringes</b> 7 and 8) containing saline, <b>syringes</b> 2, 4 and 6 containing the lethal drugs for the main line and <b>syringes</b> 1, 3 and 5 containing the injections for the back-up line. The system was used in New Jersey before the abolition of the death penalty in 2007. Illinois previously used the computer, and Missouri and Delaware use the manual injection switch on the delivery panel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Vancouver, Canada {{recently}} opened a medically supervised safer injecting facility (SIF) {{in an effort}} to reduce HIV and overdose risk and public injection drug use. We sought to examine factors associated with <b>syringe</b> sharing among SIF users. SIF users were randomly recruited into a prospective cohort of SIF users known as the Scientific Evaluation of Supervised Injecting (SEOSI) cohort. We examined the prevalence and correlates of used <b>syringe</b> borrowing among baseline HIV-negative participants and used <b>syringe</b> lending among baseline HIV-infected participants. Between 22 March 2004 and 22 October 2004, 479 baseline HIV-negative subjects (48 [10 %] <b>syringe</b> borrowing events) and 103 baseline HIV-infected participants (17 [16. 5 %] <b>syringe</b> lending events) were recruited into the cohort. For baseline HIV negative participants, <b>syringe</b> borrowing was positively associated with public drug use (p< 0. 001) and requiring help injecting (p= 0. 001), whereas exclusive SIF use was inversely associated with <b>syringe</b> sharing (p= 0. 019). For baseline HIV-infected participants, <b>syringe</b> lending was positively associated with daily cocaine injection (p= 0. 022) and shooting gallery use (p= 0. 007). Although ongoing injection-related HIV risk behavior was reported among some SIF users, rates of <b>syringe</b> sharing were substantially lower than the rate observed previously in this community and it is noteworthy that exclusive SIF use was associated with reduced <b>syringe</b> sharing.
