40|$|Abstract — The area of robotic {{surgical}} {{systems has}} to deal with several important safety aspects to ensure that the patient and the Operating Room staff are safe. A robotic surgical system has to fulfill <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> and to ensure that the system reacts like its specification. To this end, a verification process is necessary. In this paper an architecture for robotic surgery is modeled using the framework of Hybrid Input/Output Automata (HIOAs).

Exploiting the modularity and compositionality theory of HIOAs, the verification of the system is performed...|$|E
40|$|The use of COTS {{software}} components within safety-critical systems {{has been suggested}} as potentially bringing substantial benefits in terms of cost and time savings. However, {{the success of a}} COTS-based safety-critical system development depends largely upon systematic COTS selection, evaluation and integration that take into account application specific safety concerns. Due to the lack of such a systematic approach, current practices often make early decisions on the use of COTS software products without adequate consideration of safety, which makes it extremely difficult, or impossible in some cases, to certify the final COTS-based safety-critical system (i. e. inability to establish an acceptable safety case). This thesis defines and demonstrates a coherent approach to COTS selection, evaluation and integration, which works towards final system certification. Within the approach, application <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> derived for the expected COTS functionality are used as evaluation and selection criteria.

40|$|Many {{computer-based}} systems {{make use}} of large amounts of data to determine their operation. This may be to allow dedicated control systems to be adapted to a particular situation, or to allow standardised hardware and software elements to be configured for a specific application. This latter category includes many COTS products that are configured for a given purpose {{through the use of}} data. While data is clearly crucial to the correct operation of these data-intensive systems, there is much evidence to suggest that it is often overlooked.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology, with supporting tool, for formal modeling {{and analysis of}} software components in cyber-physical systems. Using our approach, developers can integrate a simulation of logic-based specifications of software components and Simulink models of continuous processes. The integrated simulation is useful to validate the characteristics of discrete system components early in the development process. The same logic-based specifications can also be formally verified using the Prototype Verification System (PVS), to gain additional confidence that the software design complies with <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements.</b> Modeling patterns are defined for generating the logic-based specifications from the more familiar automata-based formalism. The ultimate aim of this work is to facilitate the introduction of formal verification technologies in the software development process of cyber-physical systems, which typically requires the integrated use of different formalisms and tools. A case study from the medical domain is used to illustrate the approach. A PVS model of a pacemaker is interfaced with a Simulink model of the human heart.

We aim to assess their current level, and the factors associated with their implementation. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 315 hospitals and cardiology departments in the Czech Republic, France, Poland and Spain. Employing bi-variate statistics and logistic regression analysis, we assess quality and <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> for cross-border patients and their association with hospital characteristics, cross-border care arrangements, proximity to EU borders, the hospital's quality improvement system, and country. Results Certain quality and <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> are frequently met (administrative support or informed consent using forms in various EU languages) while others are widely absent (case-managers, contacts to patients' general practitioners). Due to communication problems, it is often not possible to inform patients about their condition and treatment. Discharge summaries are rarely available in other than the vernacular languages, and medication upon discharge and arranging back-transfer occur occasionally only. Logistic regression analysis suggests a strong effect of country-level covariates (followed by type of hospital, hospital size and hospital's quality improvement system), but covariates are not consistently associated with higher rates of implementation. Hospitals with existing cross-border care collaboration do not differ substantially from hospitals without such arrangements. Conclusion Cross-border {{patients have}} <b>specific</b> quality and <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> that are not always met.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a formal, executable model of the requirements for portions of the Vertical Navigation (VNAV) function of a Flight Management System and have conducted a software safety analysis on the model. In particular, we have performed a Functional Hazard Assessment {{in order to identify}} the potentially hazardous conditions associated with the VNAV function. We then conducted a Fault Tree Analysis and a Failure Mode Effects Analysis in order to identify the general categories of errors that relate to safety. By comparing these general categories to the system architecture, we were able to develop a list of <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> for the VNAV function. We then used formal methods tools to verify that the VNAV model satisfied the safety requirements. We provide an overview of the safety analysis performed to date on the VNAV model, and compare and contrast these results to a similar analysis performed on the mode logic of a Flight Guidance System. Because the Flight Guidance System model was constructed entirely from Boolean logic it was easily analyzable with model checkers. The VNAV model involves continuous logic, (altitude and position values), and requires the use of theorem provers.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{architecture}} definition and the preliminary safety assessment of flight control systems of light rotary-wing UAVs for civil applications. The methods and tools {{to be used for}} these activities are standardised for conventional manned aircraft, while they are currently a matter of discussion among aerospace specialists in case of UAVs flying into unsegregated airspaces. In addition, certification concerns are even more problematic for light UAVs (from 20 to 150 kg), since the airworthiness permission is granted by national authorities. The lack of <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> actually entails the system engineers to analyse the existing standards for military applications and the certification guidelines used for civil airborne systems, up to derive the safety objectives for the UAV development. In this work, after a brief survey on available certification documents for defining the reference safety objectives, the most relevant functional failures of a light rotary-wing UAV are identified and analysed via Functional Hazard Assessment. Different system architectures are then compared by means of Fault-Tree Analysis, using the failure rate data of modern commercial components. The activity allows {{to point out that the}} key elements for safety are the flight control computers, the servoactuators for the flight controls and the communication link. In particular, the number of computers, the type of signal processing they implement, as well as the technological solution for servoactuators have a dramatic impact on UAV reliability, and they must be regarded as crucial choices for the development of these systems...|$|E

40|$|How {{safety is}} {{perceived}} {{in conjunction with}} consumer products {{has much to do}} with its presentation to the buying public and the company reputation for performance and safety. As the automobile industry implements integrated vehicle safety and driver aid systems, the question of public perception of the true safety benefits would seem to parallel the highly automated systems of commercial aircraft, a market in which perceived benefits of flying certainly outweigh concerns of safety. It is suggested that the history of critical aircraft systems provides a model for the wide-based implementation of automated systems in automobiles. The <b>requirement</b> for <b>safety</b> in aircraft systems as an engineering design parameter takes on several forms such as wear-out, probability of catastrophic failure and mean time between replacement or repair (MTBR). For automobile systems as in aircraft, it is a multidimensional topic encompassing a variety of hardware and software functions, fail-safe or fail-operational capability and operator and control interaction. As with critical flight systems, the adherence to <b>specific</b> federal <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> is also a cost item to which all manufacturers must adhere, but that also provides a common baseline to which all companies must design. Long a requirement for the design of systems for military and commercial aircraft control, <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> standards have produced methodologies for analysis and system mechanization that would suggest the operational safety design methods needed for automobiles. Ultimately, tradeoffs must be completed to attain an acceptable level of safety when compared to the cost for developing and selling the system. As seen with commercial aircraft, acceptance of product safety by the public is not based on understanding strict technical requirements but is primarily the result of witnessing many hours of fault free operation, and seeking opinions of those they feel are knowledgeable.

40|$|In a {{companion}} abstract, the "Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment" (MECA) payload for Mars Surveyor Program 2001 (MSP 2001) {{is described in}} terms of its capabilities for addressing exobiology on Mars. Here we describe how the same payload elements perform in terms of gathering data about surface dust on the planet. An understanding of the origin and properties of dust is important to both human exploration and planetary geology. The MECA instrument is specifically designed for soil/dust investigations: it is a multifunctional laboratory equipped to assess particulate properties with wet chemistry, camera imagery, optical microscopy (potentially with LTV fluorescence capability), atomic force microscopy (AFM; potentially with mineral-discrimination capabilities), electrometry, active & passive external materials-test panels, mineral hardness testing, and electrostatic & magnetic materials testing. Additionally, evaluation of soil chemical and physical properties as a function of depth down to about 50 cm will be facilitated by the Lander/MECA robot arm on which the camera (RAC) and electrometer are mounted. Types of data being sought for the dust include: (1) general textural and grain-size characterization of the soil as a whole [...] for example, is the soil essentially dust with other components or is it a clast-supported material in which dust resides only in the clast interstices, (2) size frequency distribution for dust particles in the range 0. 01 to 10. 00 microns, (3) particle-shape distribution of the soil components and of the fine dust fraction in particular, (4) soil fabric such as grain clustering into clods, aggregates, and cemented/indurated grain amalgamations, as well as related porosity, cohesiveness, and other mechanical soil properties, (5) cohesive relationship that dust has to certain types of rocks and minerals as a clue to which soil materials may be prime hosts for dust "piggybacking", (6) particle, aggregate, and bulk soil electrostatic properties, (7) particle hardness, (8) particle magnetic properties, (9) bulk dust geochemistry (solubility, reactivity, ionic and mineral species). All of these quantities are needed in order for the human exploration program to make assessments of hazards on Mars, and to better enable the production on earth, of soil/dust simulants that can act as realistic test materials in terms of those properties that render dust a contaminant. Such properties include the small grain size that enables penetration of space-suit joints, mechanical interfaces and bearings, seals, etc., and presents difficulty for filtration systems. Size also plays a critical role in the potential for lung disease in long-term habitats. The properties of grain shape and hardness are important parameters in determining the abrasiveness of dust as it enters mechanical systems, or bombards helmet visors and habitat windows in dust-laden winds. Adhesive electrostatic and magnetic properties of dust will be prime causes of contamination of space suits and equipment. Contamination causes mechanical malfunction, tracking of dirt into habitats, "piggybacking" of toxins on dust into habitats, changes in albedo and efficiency of solar arrays and heat exchangers, and changes in electrical conductivity of suit surfaces and other materials that may have <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> regarding electrical conductivity. Other potentially hazardous properties of dust include the possibility of high solubility of some component grains (rendering them reactive), and toxicity of some materials [...] grains of superoxidants and heavy metals (there is always the slim, but not inconceivable possibility of biogenic components such as spores). Because Mars has no active surface aqueous regime, volcanic emissions, meteoritic debris, weathering products, and photochemical products of Mars have nowhere to go except reside in the surface; there are few mechanical or chemical (buffering) processes to remove the accumulation of eons. From a planetology perspective, there are many enigmatic issues relating to dust and the aeolian regime in general. MECA will be able to address many questions in this area. For example, if MECA determines a particular particle size distribution (size and sorting values), {{it will be possible to}} make inferences about the origin of the dust - - is it all aeolian, or a more primitive residue of weathering, volcanic emissions, and meteoritic gardening? Trenching with the Lander/MECA robot arm will enable local stratigraphy to be determined in terms of depositional rates, amounts and cyclicity in dust storms and/or local aeolian transport. Grain shape will betray the origin of the dust fragments as being the product of recent or ancient weathering, or the comminution products of aeolian transport [...] the dust-silt ratio might be a measure of aeolian comminution energy.

Finally, the buffer is sealed with a concrete lid. Th concrete materials provide favourable chemical conditions for the overpack allowing it to confine the radionuclides during the thermal phase. In addition, they also ensure shielding protection during construction and transport. A self-compacting concrete (SCC) and a Traditional Vibrated Concrete (TVC) are bein considered for the choice of the cementious buffer, enclosing the radwaste. The use of SCC will ease considerably the precast process and complies with all other requirements regarding strength, durability, chemical interactions, [...] .

Also the effect of gamma radiation and elevated temperatures on hardening SCC based mortar and hardened SCC was investigated. Finally, the prediction of the avoidance of through-going cracks in the concrete buffer is ensured by means of simulations, after implementation of the obtained test results, and by means of large scale tests, with temperature measurements, displacement and deformation registrations, for the validation of the simulation results of the early-age behaviour of the Supercontainer...|$|R

One of the major causes is construction employers or employees??? negative attitudes toward <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> imposed by different construction safety documents, such as construction safety regulations and project safety plans. Such attitudes towards <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> include ignorance, negligence and disobedience and the first two {{can be dealt with}} by raising construction project participants??? awareness of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> through better construction safety planning. The huge number of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> from different construction safety documents may hinder project participants from carefully searching through them for identifying applicable <b>safety</b> <b>requirements.</b> In addition, current approaches and tools for raising awareness of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> are not sufficient. For example, traditional keyword-based search through a large number of construction safety specifications can help find <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> which contain the search keywords. However, there will be other requirements which are semantically relevant but are not found just because they do not contain these specific keywords. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a formalized approach to automating the identification of applicable construction <b>safety</b> <b>requirements.</b> This approach should enable identifying <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> more efficiently (i. e. saving time in the identification process) and effectively (i. e. better identify both directly and inferentially relevant requirements), and make it feasible to more easily raise project participants??? awareness of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements.</b> To address the above need, a Construction Safety Documents Management Framework is developed in this research. The developed Framework comprises the following components: (1) a computer interpretable model for representing <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> of construction <b>safety</b> documents to enable automated reasoning about them; (2) a semantically-rich model for representing concepts acquired from construction safety documents which describe contextual information to which the imposed requirements apply; and (3) reasoning mechanisms to reason about the above two models for evaluating concepts and <b>safety</b> <b>requirements???</b> applicability to given project contexts. For the representation of construction <b>safety</b> <b>requirements,</b> the Ordered Hierarchy of Content Object (OHCO) approach is adopted to build the representation model; Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used in this research to implement the OHCO-based model. Ontological modeling, on the other hand, is leveraged to model semantically-rich concepts that describe construction contexts. In addition, the developed reasoning mechanisms utilize the ontological relationships between modeled concepts to automatically evaluate each concept???s applicability. Construction <b>safety</b> <b>requirements???</b> applicability then can be evaluated by reasoning about the requirements??? applicability conditions and exceptions, which are represented using concepts defined in the concept ontologies. <b>Safety</b> <b>requirements</b> can be classified according to their evaluated applicability. The approach is validated for Job Hazard Analysis documents through computational experiments in multiple representation and reasoning test cases. The validation results show that the developed Framework can successfully evaluate the applicability of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> imposed by these JHA documents and identify <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> applicable to given contexts. During the validation, the advantages, limitations and practical implications of the developed Framework are discovered. The potential directions of future research on improving the Framework to reinforce its capability and to remove its limitations are lastly presented...|$|R

30|$|In {{the early}} stage of the system design, we should create a hazard source log {{based on the results}} of hazard {{analysis}} (including PHA, SHA, SSHA, IHA, and OSHA) and maintain the hazard log throughout the entire safety life cycle. <b>Safety</b> <b>requirements</b> can be considered from two aspects, i.e., the functional <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> and the <b>safety</b> integrity <b>requirements.</b> <b>Safety</b> functional <b>requirements</b> are the actual safety-related functions which the system, subsystem, or equipment is required to carry out. <b>Safety</b> integrity <b>requirements</b> define the level of safety integrity required for each safety-related function.|$|R
40|$|Present {{considerations}} of innovative, next-generation reactor concepts with improved safety and sustainability characteristics have motivated IAEA {{to launch a}} series of Consultancy Meetings to interpret the applicability and make {{a proposal for a}} possible revision of its Safety Standards for these advanced reactor designs. This paper summarizes results of the first step taken to critically review the applicability of IAEA Safety Standards for “Design of Nuclear Power Plants” (NS-R- 1) and “Safety Assessment for Facilities and Activities” (GSR Part 4). Efforts have been made to generalize the <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> with due consideration given to the <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> features that are associated with fast reactors and high temperature gas-cooled reactors. Insights from the Fukushima Dai-ichi TEPCO events have also been considered to incorporate lessons learned. JRC. F. 5 -Nuclear Reactor Safety Assessmen...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{has shown}} that the lack of {{traceability}} between <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> and both architecture and failure propagation models is a key reason for the incompleteness and inconsistency of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements,</b> and, consequently, a root cause of safety incidents. In this regard, this paper presents checks for the automatic detection of incompleteness and inconsistency of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> with respect to failure propagation models and architecture. First, the notion of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> completeness and consistency was decomposed into small manageable pieces called <b>Safety</b> <b>Requirement</b> Completeness and Consistency Criteria. Breaking the complex notions of completeness and consistency into finer grains was important to allow systematic and precise elaboration of the completeness and consistency checks. Next, each <b>Safety</b> <b>Requirement</b> Completeness and Consistency Criteria was formalized using Set Theory notation, which, despite being a lightweight formalism, is sufficiently accurate to represent problem-specific knowledge, and {{can be used as a}} solid basis for automation using different technology platforms. Last, in order to concretize the checks formalized with Set Theory notation, they were realized with OCL, chosen because its expressions do not have the ambiguity of natural languages and are not difficult to use in real development environments, unlike more formal specification languages such as Z. It has been observed that these checks are solid and practical enough to support safety engineers in detecting incomplete and inconsistent <b>safety</b> <b>requirements,</b> and, consequently, for improving the detection of incompleteness and inconsistency of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> with respect to architecture and failure propagation models...|$|R
