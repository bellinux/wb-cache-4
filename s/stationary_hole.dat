40|$|We {{examine the}} {{dynamics}} of a single hole in the gapless phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model, focusing on the slow-hole regime where the bare hopping amplitude t is {{much less than the}} Kitaev exchange energy J. In this regime, the hole does not generate gapped flux excitations and is dressed only by the gapless fermion excitations. Investigating the single-hole spectral function, we find that the hole propagates coherently with a quasiparticle weight that is finite but approaches zero as t/J → 0. This conclusion follows from two approximate treatments, which capture the same physics in complementary ways. Both treatments use the stationary limit as an exactly solvable starting point to study the spectral function approximately (i) by employing a variational approach in terms of a trial state that interpolates between the limits of a <b>stationary</b> <b>hole</b> and an infinitely fast hole and (ii) by considering a special point in the gapless phase that corresponds to a simplified one-dimensional problem.

40|$|We {{introduce}} three {{approaches to}} generate curvature invariants that transform covariantly under a conformal transformation of a four dimensional spacetime. For any black hole conformally {{related to a}} <b>stationary</b> black <b>hole,</b> we show how a set of conformally covariant invariants can be combined to produce a conformally covariant invariant that detects the event horizon of the conformally related black hole. As an application we consider the rotating dynamical black holes conformally related to the Kerr-NUT-(Anti) -de Sitter spacetimes and construct an invariant that detects the conformal Killing horizon along with a second invariant that detects the conformal stationary limit surface. In addition, we present necessary conditions for a dynamical black hole to be conformally related to a <b>stationary</b> black <b>hole</b> and apply these conditions to the ingoing Kerr-Vaidya and Vaidya black hole solutions {{to determine if they}} are conformally related to <b>stationary</b> black <b>holes</b> for particular choices of the mass function. While two of the three approaches cannot be generalized to higher dimensions, we discuss the existence of a conformally covariant invariant that will detect the event horizon for any higher dimensional black hole conformally related to a <b>stationary</b> black <b>hole</b> which admits at least two conformally covariant invariants, including all vacuum spacetimes.

40|$|We give {{a new and}} conceptually simple {{approach}} to obtain the “first law of black hole thermodynamics ” from a basic thermodynamical property that entropy (S) for any <b>stationary</b> black <b>hole</b> is a state function implying that dS must be an exact differential.

From these conditions {{we are able to}} explicitly calculate the semiclassical Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, considering the most general metric represented by the Kerr-Newman spacetime. We extend our method to find the corrected entropy of <b>stationary</b> black <b>holes</b> in (3 + 1) dimensions. For that we first calculate the corrected Hawing temperature considering both scalar particle and fermion tunneling beyond the semiclassical approximation. Using this corrected Hawking temperature we compute the corrected entropy, based on properties of exact differentials.

40|$|It {{has been}} well known since the 1970 s that <b>stationary</b> black <b>holes</b> do not generically support scalar hair.

40|$|We {{consider}} the effective theory of large D <b>stationary</b> black <b>holes.</b> By solving the Einstein equations with a cosmological constant using the 1 /D expansion in near {{zone of the}} black hole we obtain the effective equation for the <b>stationary</b> black <b>hole.</b> The effective equation describes the Myers-Perry black hole, bumpy black holes and, possibly, the black ring solution as its solutions. In this effective theory the black hole is represented as an embedded membrane in the background, e. g., Minkowski or Anti-de Sitter spacetime and its mean curvature is given by the surface gravity redshifted by the background gravitational field and the local Lorentz boost. The local Lorentz boost property of the effective equation is observed also in the metric itself. In fact we show that the leading order metric of the Einstein equation in the 1 /D expansion is generically regarded as a Lorentz boosted Schwarzschild black hole. We apply this Lorentz boost property of the <b>stationary</b> black <b>hole</b> solution to solve perturbation equations.
