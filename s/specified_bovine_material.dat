40|$|Due to {{some form}} of heart valve disease, {{approximately}} 250000 patients worldwide undergo surgery to receive a new heart-valve each year. In about 70 % of the cases a mechanical heart valve is used despite the fact that permanent anticoagulant therapy for the patient is required. The remaining 30 % of the patients receive a bioprosthesis, made from porcine or <b>bovine</b> <b>material.</b> Since a porcine heart is similar to a human heart also complete porcine valves can be used. If <b>bovine</b> <b>material</b> is used, the valve leaflets are made from sheets of pericardium. Either bioprostheses which are constructed by mounting valve leaflets on a supporting rig (a stent) or complete stentless porcine valves including leaflets and root (wall) are used. Although the bioprosthetic valve has initially in many ways a superior performance compared to the mechanical valve, the reason why it is currently only employed in such a relatively small patient population is because after several years it is prone to increased incidents of degeneration, calcification and cusp rupture. These phenomena occur especially in young adults. Modern mechanical valves, on the other hand, are durable and have excellent flow characteristics, but have the propensity for thrombo-embolic complications, necessitating life long anticoagulation therapy with the result of increased risk of bleeding. This has triggered the desire to develop a better, i. e. more durable bioprosthesis and many attempts have been described in literature...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the institutional factors that shape regulatory officials' perceptions of risks {{to human health}} and safety and their attitudes towards associated regulation. In particular, the paper {{considers the}} extent to which the perceptions of risk and regulation of officials responsible for monitoring and enforcement are aligned with regulatory requirements, and, if not, what factors explain those perceptions. Moreover, the paper considers the impact of officials' perceptions and attitudes on policy processes and outcomes. Empirically, the paper considers three UK risk regulation regimes: occupational exposure to radon, chemical migration from plastics food packaging, and BSE-related controls on <b>specified</b> <b>bovine</b> offal. Analysis of those cases suggests that conventional accounts that contrast 'rational' bureaucratic expertise against 'irrational' lay perspectives can miss the institutional 'irrationalities' that shape officials' perceptions of risk and associated behaviour. In particular, the paper suggests that complex risk regulation regimes are vulnerable to a phenomenon of 'institutional attenuation'. That term refers to institutional processes that serve to diminish inspectors' perceptions or awareness of a risk, and/or diminish inspectors' perceptions of the policy importance of associated regulations. Furthermore, the paper shows how such institutional attenuation can contribute to ineffective monitoring and enforcement of some risk regulation regimes...|$|R

Methods: Around 30 dissected donor eyes and 9 cell lines provided the human specimens and 25 eyes and 20 primary cell cultures provided the <b>bovine</b> <b>material.</b> Appropriate samples were exposed to 10 - 7 M DEX for up to 14 days. LC tissue and cells were stained with Phalloidin-Alexa 488 to identify F-actin and all samples were examined by confocal or epifluorescent microscopy.

Two materials are of natural origin and two are synthetic bone substitutes.  Methods: Macrophage activation and cytokine release were assessed using SEM analysis and a sandwich ELISA kit while the activity of human osteoclast-like cells was studied quantifying calcium released from the substrata studied together with SEM analysis of cell morphology and pit formation on the bone substitutes.  Results: Hydroxyapatite {{proved to be the}} greatest macrophage activator, while the <b>bovine</b> derived <b>material</b> {{turned out to be the}} only bone substitute that does not induce macrophages to release IFNg. No material had direct induction of osteoclast precursor differentiation even if mature osteoclasts showed the highest activity on the human derived material followed by bone ceramic, while the <b>bovine</b> derived <b>material</b> was the substrate with the least osteoclast activity.  Conclusions: The four materials reacted differently with the cells tested and between them, the bovine derived bone, being the lowest macrophage and osteoclast activator may be considered a good bone substitute for clinical situations requiring greater time of permanence of the material at the site of implantation, while human derived bone will be more suitable for clinical applications that require lower time of permanence...|$|R

Estimating the number of individuals who were exposed to the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) infectious agent and may be susceptible to vCJD will help to clarify related public health concerns and plan strategies. In this paper, we explore this estimate by describing the probability of potential exposure due to dietary intake throughout the BSE epidemic period from 1980 to 1996 as a stochastic Poisson process. We estimate the age- and gender-specific exposure intensities in food categories of beef and beef-containing dishes, burgers and kebabs, pies, and sausages, separating the two periods of 1980 - 1989 and 1990 - 1996 due to the <b>specified</b> <b>bovine</b> offal legislation of 1989. The estimated total number of (living) exposed individuals during each period is 5, 089, 027 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 4, 514, 963 - 6, 410, 317), which was obtained by multiplying the population size of different birth cohorts by the probability of exposure via dietary intake and the probability of survival until the end of 2013. The estimated number is approximately doubled, assuming a contamination rate of [Formula: see text]. Among those individuals estimated, 31, 855 (95 % CI 26, 849 - 42, 541) are susceptible to infection.

40|$|In this work, new {{analytical}} methods {{for the detection}} of animal proteins in animal feed and by-products are described. Due to the enforcement of legislation against transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of the European Union and of the planned relaxation of this, it needs urgent development of species-specific detection methods, in particular to prevent the entry of <b>bovine</b> <b>material</b> in the feed chain. The aim of this study was the development and validation of immunological methods for species-specific detection of processed animal proteins in feed as alternative methods of microscopy. Therefore, first a number of possible tissue markers of animal origin have been identified and tested for their potential suitability on the basis of sequence comparisons and literature searches. Due to the extreme stability and heat resistance, the species-specific differences in sequence and the abundant presence in meat and bone meal the bone protein osteocalcin has proved to be particularly suitable and was therefore selected as the target protein for the detection systems to be developed. One focus of this work was the development and optimization of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which should enable the detection of <b>bovine</b> <b>material.</b> To limit the assay specificity on cattle, both species- and sequence-specific polyclonal antibodies have been generated against bovine osteocalcin and tested for their suitability. In combination with a commercial monoclonal antibody directed against osteocalcin a sandwich ELISA {{for the detection of}} bovine osteocalcin has been developed. Based on the methodology of the elaborated ELISA, a real-time immuno-PCR (RT-iPCR) should be developed as another strategy for sequence-specific detection of osteocalcin. It should be verified whether a higher sensitivity of the osteocalcin-detection compared to the developed sandwich ELISA might be achieved. Finally, it was investigated whether an immunological detection system for bovine osteocalcin is developable using phage display methodology. Therefore, based on a sequence analysis, a specific amino acid sequence of bovine osteocalcin was chosen for the isolation of specifically binding phage. Isolated phage with positive binding affinity against bovine osteocalcin were used in an ELISA for the detection of bovine osteocalcin and the interacting peptide was characterizes by the use of DNA sequencing. After optimization of individual work steps, the efficiency for those systems was verified. The possibilities and limitations of the developed detection methods based on reference materials and commercial samples were investigated. It could be demonstrated, that both the developed ELISA, as well as the RT-iPCR enable the detection of bovine osteocalcin with a sensitivity of 1 ng osteocalcin with distinctive specificity. For both systems a remarkable detection limit of 0. 1 % bovine meat and bone meal could be determined in plant feed. Therefore a bovine meat and bone meal was used, which was even treated at 145 °C, which is above the statutory requirements. Moreover, it was demonstrated that due to the use of individual in vitro selected phage clones in a direct ELISA both pure bovine osteocalcin, as well as a high processed bovine meat and bone meal could be detected. The results demonstrate the possibility of species-specific, selective detection of animal proteins in animal feed, based on known osteocalcin sequences. The described osteocalcin assay could be the basis for a validated detection method for ensuring the compliance of the feed ban and therefore lead to an improvement in the fight against transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. A far-reaching application of the developed ELISA method for the species-specific detection of animal proteins in feed for other species is possible...|$|R

40|$|Tissue factor, a known {{initiator}} {{of blood}} coagulation, {{was found to}} be active in Triton X- 100. A system consisting of tissue factor, factor VIIa, calcium ions, and coagulation factor X generated activated factor X at an appreciable rate. Based on this observation, we coupled human and bovine factor VII to a solid support. Each column bound tissue factor, solubilized in Triton X- 100, in a species-specific manner. These interactions required calcium ions; when the columns were washed with detergent containing calcium ions, no tissue factor was eluted. When calcium ions were omitted from the eluant, tissue factor emerged as a sharp peak. Human tissue factor was extracted from an acetone brain powder into 2 % Triton X- 100. This extract, made 10 mM in CaCl 2, was passed over a factor VII column. Human factor VII (1. 2 mg) was coupled to 30 ml of Affi-Gel 15. This column bound approximately equal to 15 micrograms of human tissue factor. The eluted material was approximately equal to 25 % pure. Final purification was achieved by gel filtration after chymotryptic digestion of contaminants. The tissue factor activity was stable to this treatment. The molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate/PAGE (approximately equal to 46, 000) was also unchanged by chymotrypsin. The final material was a single band on PAGE, demonstrated similar resistance to tryptic and chymotryptic digestion as bovine tissue factor, and had approximately the same specific coagulant activity as the previously purified <b>bovine</b> <b>material.</b> Tissue factor was also purified from human placenta, yielding a similar protein. A partial 28 -residue sequence of the latter has been obtained...|$|R
