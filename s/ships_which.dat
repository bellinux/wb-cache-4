5|$|Flotilla is a {{three-dimensional}} simultaneous turn-based strategy space combat video game {{set in a}} randomly generated galaxy. The player and computer-controlled opponents issue orders to their <b>ships,</b> <b>which</b> are carried in a simultaneous and real-time fashion {{over a period of}} 30 seconds. The game then freezes, and the player and opponents issue new orders to their <b>ships,</b> <b>which</b> are again performed for 30 seconds. This process repeats until one party is defeated. Orders are separated into three groups: attack move, flank move and focus fire. An attack move orders the ships to move and fire simultaneously; a flank move increases the ship's speed but deactivates weapons until the ship stops moving; and focus fire increases fire rate but significantly reduces the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{passenger}} terminal situated in Constanța North has an annual traffic capacity of 100,000 people. In 2014, the port was visited by 92 passenger <b>ships</b> <b>which</b> had on board around 69,910 tourists.|$|E
5|$|According to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast, UB-11 {{had been}} {{assigned}} to the Kiel Periscope School by September 1915. Uboat.net reports that UB-11' undertook no war patrols and had no successes against enemy <b>ships,</b> <b>which</b> may indicate that the vessel remained in use only as a training vessel.|$|E

5|$|In 1853 Commodore Matthew Perry led the Perry Expedition, a {{squadron}} of four <b>ships</b> <b>which</b> sailed to Japan to establish normal relations with Japan. Perry's two technologically advanced steam-powered ships and calm, firm diplomacy convinced Japan to end three centuries of isolation and sign Treaty of Kanagawa with the U.S. in 1854. Nominally a treaty of friendship, the agreement soon {{paved the way for}} the opening of Japan and normal trade relations with the United States and Europe.|$|E
5|$|The 6th century {{marked the}} rebirth of Roman naval power. In 508, as {{antagonism}} with the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Theodoric flared up, the Emperor Anastasius I (491–518) {{is reported to have}} sent a fleet of 100 warships to raid the coasts of Italy. In 513, the general Vitalian revolted against Anastasius. The rebels assembled a fleet of 200 <b>ships</b> <b>which,</b> despite some initial successes, were destroyed by admiral Marinus, who employed a sulphur-based incendiary substance to defeat them.|$|E
5|$|The British {{colony of}} Hong Kong had been {{captured}} by Japanese forces in December 1941, and was subsequently used as a naval and logistics base. USAAF units based in China intermittently attacked the Hong Kong area from October 1942. Most of these raids involved {{a small number of}} aircraft, and typically targeted Japanese cargo <b>ships</b> <b>which</b> had been reported by Chinese guerrillas.|$|E

5|$|The Patagonian {{tensions}} heightened in 1872 and 1878, when Chilean warships seized merchant <b>ships</b> <b>which</b> {{had been}} licensed {{to operate in}} the disputed area by the Argentine government. An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. This action nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River. The Chilean Navy responded in kind, and war was only avoided by a hastily signed treaty.|$|E
5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier <b>ships</b> <b>which</b> meant that space was at a premium.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Persano was {{replaced}} by Admiral Giovanni Vacca; {{he was ordered to}} attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out. After the end of the war, the government lost confidence in the fleet and drastically reduced the naval budget. The cuts were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, as part of the wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home. Terribile was rapidly surpassed, first by central battery and then turret <b>ships,</b> <b>which</b> made the first generation of ironclads like Terribile and her sister obsolete.|$|E

5|$|An SOS was broadcast, {{which was}} {{answered}} by the Brazilian Navy, which sent three submarine chasers and three destroyers to the scene. The passengers {{were ordered to}} take to the lifeboats. Tenders and tugs also assisted in the rescue of all passengers from Magdalena without loss of life. The sea conditions at the time were smooth. At 19:00, the steam turbines had to be shut down, and power was then provided by her auxiliary diesel engines. At about 20:00, the submarine chaser Guaporé arrived and started to rescue the passengers. Other <b>ships</b> <b>which</b> assisted in the rescue were the tugs Comandante Triunfo, Dorat, Saturno and Trovão, and also the cargo ship Goiaz.|$|E
5|$|Before departing Singapore, the Japanese <b>ships,</b> <b>which</b> were {{designated}} the Completion Force, were loaded with supplies {{of oil and}} other important raw materials. This formed {{part of an effort}} to run increased quantities of supplies through the Allied blockade of Japan before the country was cut off from its empire. The Allies had learned of the Completion Force's composition and goals through intelligence gained from decrypting Japanese radio signals, and plans were developed for coordinated attacks on it by submarines and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft. As part of these preparations, 26 submarines were eventually positioned along the ships' expected route.|$|E
5|$|Both sides had {{suffered}} severe damage and casualties, but both were also {{aware that the}} battle would inevitably be rejoined and so {{the aftermath of the}} British defeat was one of frenzied activity at Gibraltar, Algeciras and Cadiz. While the British and French squadrons conducted hasty repairs, the French and Spanish fleet at Cadiz was prepared for a rescue mission, a heavy squadron arriving at Algeciras on 12 July. As the squadron departed with Linois's squadron, it was attacked again by Saumarez's squadron at the Second Battle of Algeciras and caught at night by faster and more manoeuvrable <b>ships,</b> <b>which</b> resulted in the British inflicting heavy losses on the Spanish rearguard but failing to destroy the French squadron for a second time.|$|E

Superman and Batman arrive {{in the middle of}} the fight and defeat Luther's forces and subdues Luthor who is arrested for treason. While Luthor is sentenced to death, Superman and Batman privately meet again and reflect that the world can use both of them to protect it, revealing their knowledge of each other's secret identities and their promise not to expose the other.|$|E
5|$|In 1675, {{after the}} victory at Fehrbellin and the Brandenburg-Prussian advance in Swedish Pomerania during the Scanian War, Frederick William decided to {{establish}} a navy. He engaged Dutch merchant and shipowner Benjamin Raule as his advisor, who after a first personal meeting with Frederick William in 1675 settled in Brandenburg in 1676 and became the major figure of Brandenburg-Prussia's emerging naval and colonial enterprise. The Brandenburg-Prussian navy was established from ten <b>ships</b> <b>which</b> Frederick William leased from Raule, and achieved first successes {{in the war against}} Sweden supporting the siege of Stralsund and Stettin and the invasion of Rügen. In Pillau (now Baltiysk) on the East Prussian coast, Raule established shipyards and enlarged the port facilities.|$|E
5|$|In April 1916 a German battlecruiser {{squadron}} with accompanying cruisers and destroyers bombarded {{the coastal}} ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. Although the ports had some military importance, the main {{aim of the}} raid was to entice out defending <b>ships</b> <b>which</b> could then be picked off either by the battlecruiser squadron or by the full High Seas Fleet, which was stationed at sea ready to intervene if an opportunity presented itself. The result was inconclusive: nearby Royal Navy units were too small to intervene so largely kept clear of the German battlecruisers, and the German ships withdrew before the first British fast response battlecruiser squadron or the Grand Fleet could arrive.|$|E

5|$|In Britain the Admiralty {{considered}} {{plans for}} a major relief of Gibraltar, opting to send a larger, but slower fleet, rather than a smaller faster one. In September 1782 a large fleet left Spithead under Richard Howe, arriving off Cape St. Vincent on 9 October. The following evening a gale blew up, scattering the Spanish and French fleet allowing Howe to sail unopposed into Gibraltar. A total of 34 ships of the line escorted 31 transport <b>ships</b> <b>which</b> delivered supplies, food, and ammunition. The fleet also brought the 25th, 59th, and 97th regiments of foot bringing {{the total number of}} the garrison to over 7,000 Howe then sailed out and fought an indecisive battle with the combined allied fleet before withdrawing to Britain in line with his orders.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Soviet Union {{originated}} Project 1144 Orlan, {{a project}} intended {{to design and}} build a large, nuclear powered anti-submarine vessel. At the time, the Soviets did not envisage that arming surface ships with anti-ship missiles was required, as then current doctrine had it that submarines were the main platform for attacking enemy shipping. However, {{the sinking of the}} Israeli destroyer INS Eilat in 1967 by anti-ship missiles fired from an Egyptian missile boat led to a re-think of the use of surface ships in the role. The threat of US Navy surface <b>ships,</b> <b>which</b> were increasingly capable of a range of different missions, led {{to the idea of a}} single ship combining anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine capabilities crystalising.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August, one {{day after}} sinking Rosalie, Steinbrinck and the crew of UB-10 bettered their 30 June {{activities}} by sinking ten fishing smacks off Cromer. All ten <b>ships,</b> <b>which</b> ranged in size from 41 to 62 tons, were boarded and sunk by explosives. With these ten ships, the August tally for Steinbrinck and UB-10 was 7,309 tons, which accounted for {{nearly all of the}} 7,709 tons sunk by Flanders Flotilla boats that month. In addition, counting the ships sunk at the end of July, UB-10 sank 23 ships in a 13-day span, nearly half the 55 ships sunk by the flotilla in both July and August.|$|E
