This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The spectacular progress in assisted reproduc-tion technology {{that has been}} witnessed for {{the past thirty years}} resulted in emerging new ethical dilemmas as well as the revision of some perennial ones. The paper aims at a feminist approach to oocyte and <b>spare</b> <b>embryo</b> donation for research. First, referring to different concepts of autonomy and informed consent, we discuss whether the decision to donate oocyte/embryo can truly be an autonomous choice of a female patient. Secondly, we argue the commonly adopted language of gift is misleading and that calling for altruism could put female patients at risk of exploitation. Finally, we point out that the presence of gender stereo-types in the procreative area casts doubt whether even a more robust notion of informed consent manages to over-come this risk...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: One of {{the ongoing}} ethical debates in {{medically}} assisted reproduction {{is whether or not}} oocyte donors should receive financial compensations beyond their out-of-pocket expenses. In several jurisdictions, these compensations are justified with arguments of fairness and reciprocity, but concerns about a disproportionate recruitment of financially deprived women remain. Since recently, oocytes can be efficiently cryopreserved and thus oocytes are now increasingly being stored either as part of an IVF cycle or as a fertility preservation measure. Some of these oocytes will remain unused by the women from whom they were obtained. We consider whether reliance on donation of such spare oocytes may offer {{a way out of the}} debate. Materials and Methods: Literature regarding oocyte donation, financial compensation of donors, oocyte cryopreservation and donation of spare embryos was studied. Two central questions were discerned. First, does the rationale for compensating oocyte donors also apply to donors of spare oocytes? In order to determine the relevant (dis) similarities, analogies are made with current oocyte donation practices (including egg sharing) where compensations are routinely given and with the practice of <b>spare</b> <b>embryo</b> donation, where compensations are absent. Second, is this new source of donor oocytes a valid alternative to current donor recruitment practices? If the answer to the first question is ‘no’ (donors of spare oocytes should not be compensated) and that to the second question is ‘yes’ (spare oocytes will become available), we can expect that the debate regarding financial compensations for oocytes donors will automatically come to an end in the coming years. Results: Although some of the arguments for financial compensation of oocyte donors also apply to this specific case of spare oocyte donation, the claim that donors ought to be compensated is less strong due to the fact that there is no additional physical burden for these donors and that ‘left over’ material is concerned. Due to these two same reasons, it can also be expected that a higher percentage of women with spare oocytes in storage will consider donation than in the general population (that is, of women who do not have spare oocytes in storage) even in the absence of financial compensations. This new source of donor oocytes would not only offer a number of practical advantages, but would also avoid the implication of subjecting healthy women to a medical intervention that offers no health benefits for themselves and that may – on seldom occasions – even be harmful to them. Conclusions: An increased use of oocyte cryopreservation will lead to a stock of spare oocytes that is an ideal source of donor oocytes. Moreover, as there is no additional physical discomfort for the donors and as the oocytes are no longer of use to the donor herself, financial compensations are unwarranted in this particular case of oocyte donation. Therefore, if enough women are willing to donate their spare oocytes for reproduction by others, ethical concerns regarding financial compensation of oocyte donors will become redundant...|$|E
50|$|The {{selling price}} of {{processed}} and stored sperm is {{considerably more than}} the sums received by donors. Treatments with donor sperm are generally expensive and are seldom available free of charge through national health services. Sperm banks often package treatments into e.g. three cycles, and in cases of IVF or other ART treatments, they may reduce the charge if a patient donates any <b>spare</b> <b>embryos</b> which are produced through the treatment. There is often more demand for fertility treatment with donor sperm than there is donor sperm available, and this {{has the effect of}} keeping the cost of such treatments reasonably high.|$|R

40|$|Mosaicism in 4 - 8 -cell {{human embryos}} {{analysed}} by fluorescence {{in situ hybridisation}} (FISH) has been widely reported, but few studies have addressed the incidence of mosaicism in more advanced embryonic stages. In the present study we analysed <b>spare</b> human <b>embryos</b> {{in a case of}} preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for increased risk of aneuploidy because of an infertile 47,XYY man. After replacement of two embryos typed as 1818 XX at PGD, six <b>spare</b> <b>embryos</b> (not frozen because of their low quality) were re-analysed on Day 5 for PGD confirmation. Out of five embryos typed as 1818 XY at PGD, four were diploid mosaic (DM) and one was normal in all cells. The sixth embryo, typed as 18 XYY/ 1818181818 X at PGD, was a DM. In spite of the bias of our small series of morphologically low-quality embryos, the surprisingly high proportion of mosaics (which confirms previous findings) questions the validity of PGD, but supports the strategy of transferring only the embryos where two blastomeres gave normal and concordant results at PGD. More data are required to understand the clinical significance of early diploid mosaicism (and its impact on implantation rate) and to determine whether some diploid mosaic embryos might be considered safe for transfer.

40|$|Every day, {{people die}} {{because there are}} {{insufficient}} tissues available for transplantation. The development of cloning and embryonic stem (ES) cell line technologies offers real hope for developing better sources of tissues for transplantation. Moreover, these new technologies may mean that damaged tissue (for example, after a stroke or heart attack) can be replaced with normal functioning tissue rather than scar tissue. Research into 'therapeutic cloning' {{and the development of}} ES cell lines is illegal in several States in Australia. It is time to review that legislation in order to allow destructive embryo research. My argument is that at least research should be allowed on <b>spare</b> <b>embryos</b> from assisted reproduction; that it is only one moral view (of several plausible ones) of the status of the embryo which precludes producing embryos for research; that this view is mistaken and so it is morally permissible to produce embryos for research into therapeutic cloning...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} effect of supplementation of serum and Plasmanate, a {{commercial}} serum substitute, to culture medium on the IVF outcome. Methods: One hundred eighty-nine subfertile couples were prospective randomized into the serum and the Plasmanate group during their IVF treatment. In vitro experiment was also performed to determine the fraction of Plasmanate that might affect embryo development. Results: The pregnancy rate were similar in both groups. The fertilization rate, the number of gestational sacs and good quality <b>spare</b> <b>embryos</b> suitable for cryopreservation {{were higher in the}} serum group than the Plasmanate group. However, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Significantly more embryos in the former cleaved to more than 4 cells at the time of transfer than the latter (p < 0. 05). Ultrafiltration study showed that this inhibitory effect resided in the low molecular weight fraction (< 30 -kD) of Plasmanate. Conclusions: Serum is slightly better than Plasmanate as a protein supplement. However, Plasmanate may still be used for short term embryo culture in assisted reproduction. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{efficacy}} of homologous oviductal cell coculture {{on the success}} of a human in vitro fertilization program was investigated in a prospective randomized control clinical trial. Methods and Results: One hundred eighty-one couples were randomized into the control and the coculture groups. Pronuclear-stage zygotes were either cultured in Earles' balanced salt solution supplemented with 15 % preovulatory serum (control) or cultured with human oviductal cells (coculture) for 24 hr before embryo transfer. There was no difference {{in the age of the}} patients, indication for treatment, number of oocyte retrieved or fertilized, or number of embryo replaced between the two groups. The pregnancy rates per transfer for the control and the coculture group were 12. 8 and 19. 3 %, respectively. The number of viable fetus was significantly higher (P < 0. 01, chi-square test) in the coculture group (25 / 264) than in the control group (8 / 262).

Key words: cryopreservation/embryo donation/ethics/preimplantation human embryos The two cases described by de Lacey and Norman (2004) involved decisions about the fate of extra cryopreserved human preimplantation embryos after the birth of impaired babies.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effect of co-culture with human oviductal cells on human <b>embryos.</b> <b>Spare</b> <b>embryos</b> from gamete intra-Fallopian transfer (GIFT), pronuclear stage transfer (PROST) and in-vitro fertilization/embryo transfer (IVF/ET) programmes were either cultured in serum-supplemented Earle's balanced salt solution alone, or co-cultured in the same solution with oviductal cells from the pronuclear stage (day 1 post-insemination) or two-to four-cell stage (day 2 post-insemination). The co-cultured embryos appeared to have a higher developmental potential (higher rate of blastocyst formation and lower fragmentation rate), although there was no statistical difference in their rate of development, degree of fragmentation and stages attained, when compared with conventionally cultured embryos. The percentage of hatching blastocysts was significantly higher (P < 0. 05, Fisher's exact test) for embryos co-cultured from day 1 post-insemination (38 %) than for embryos which had not been co-cultured (7 %). The blastocyst hatching rate for embryos co-cultured from day 2 post-insemination was 15 %. It was therefore concluded that co-culture of human embryos with oviductal cells could improve the development of the embryos in vitro. The degree of improvement was more pronounced when the co-culture started at an earlier stage. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|IVF laws in Victoria, Australia {{provide that}} human embryos must not remain in storage {{in excess of}} 5 years. Studies {{reviewing}} the fate of surplus human embryos reveal that close to 90 % of couples choose to discard their excess embryos and that hundreds of embryos are disposed of annually. It {{has been argued that}} human embryos are a valuable resource {{and that there is a}} need to consider educational programmes to encourage couples to donate <b>spare</b> <b>embryos</b> to other infertile couples, rather than discard them. Surveys show that one reason that so few embryos are donated is that couples attach great significance to genetic parenthood. Advances in reproductive technology may necessitate a review of biological definitions of family and the importance of genetic relatedness. It can be argued that it is unreasonable to conclude that genetic ties are so significant that embryos should be discarded rather than donated and raised by non-genetically related parents. It is suggested that education programmes should encourage reflection on people's beliefs about the importance of genetic relatedness with regard to what makes a family. Open embryo donation or directed embryo donation programmes might cause couples to change their minds, or alleviate their anxiety about donating embryos to others...|$|R
40|$|In 2004, the Italian {{parliament}} comprehensively regulated medically assisted reproduction. Law 40 / 2004 has outlawed several {{techniques and}} tightly compressed {{the freedom of}} {{research in the area of}} human reproduction and regenerative medicine. This article analyses the post- 2004 political, bioethical and legal debate on assisted reproduction in Italy. The analysis is grounded on empirical evidence on fertilisation outcomes released in 2007 and 2008 by the Italian government, on recent amendments related to the regulation of preimplantation genetic diagnosis and on the debates on the status of <b>spare</b> <b>embryos</b> as for their availability for scientific researches. The analysis shows that Law 40 / 2004 has failed to improve the access of infertile couples to assisted reproduction techniques and keeps supporting practices that the other jurisdictions have rejected because they are unwise from a clinical standpoint. Moreover, Law 40 / 2004 created severe limitations to scientific researches in the fields of medical embryology, gynaecology and regenerative medicine. With the political support of some Italian political parties and the Catholic Church, Law 40 / 2004 disregards the expectations of the majority of Italian citizens, international guidelines of good clinical practice, international codes of medical ethics, the interests of infertile couples and the social and economic relevance of biomedical research...|$|R
40|$|PRINCIPLES: Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESC) hold enormous potential for regenerative medicine. So far, the majority of hESC lines have been derived from the isolated inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts of variable quality, and several of them from low-grade embryos. Moreover, most of the lines have been obtained in media containing animal components such as foetal bovine serum. We aimed to derive hESC lines in xeno-free conditions using <b>spare</b> <b>embryos</b> frozen in Switzerland before 2001. METHODS: In cooperation with Swiss IVF centres we collected up to 199 donated embryos frozen between 1988 and 2000 {{at different stages of}} development. RESULTS: Embryo quality at thawing showed wide variability, reduced quality and low survival upon culture. Using early arrested embryos (n= 46), we report here the first Swiss hESC line, called CH-ES 1, derived from a single blastomere of an arrested four-cell-stage embryo. Despite its polyploidy, already present at the third passage, CH-ES 1 expressed ESC markers of pluripotency and differentiated into all three germ layers in embryoid bodies in vitro and in teratomas in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: As the destruction of viable developing <b>embryos,</b> even <b>spare</b> ones, raises serious ethical concerns, deriving hESC lines from arrested embryos may be an alternative approach to avoid embryo destruction. However, given the reduced derivation efficiency they should not be considered a unique and/or selective source of hESC lines...|$|R

We have assessed the incidence and pattern of mosaicism during in vitro development of human embryos from early-cleavage stages to morula and blastocyst. Fifty <b>spare</b> <b>embryos</b> were fixed for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21 on days 2 or 3 (4 - to 10 -cell stage) (n = 16), on day 4 (morula stage) (n = 14), on day 5 (pre-expanded blastocyst) (n = 5), and the expanded blastocyst stages (n = 15). Blocked embryos (no cleavage observed within the last 24 hr) were not included. A total of 2367 cells were analyzed. Four early-cleavage stage embryos were found uniformly diploid; all of the others were mosaic for the chromosomes analyzed (mean diploid nuclei 48. 3 % +/- 28. 7). All of the embryos at more advanced developmental stages, except one fully normal morula, had mosaic chromosome constitutions, with an increase in the percentage of diploid cells in morulae, pre-expanded, and expanded blastocysts, respectively (mean diploid nuclei 78. 6 % +/- 11. 7, 66. 0 % +/- 20. 8, 79. 6 % +/- 12. 8), in comparison with earlier stages.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} regulations, guidelines and societal debates in eight member states of the EC about a) embryonic and fetal tissue transplantation (EFTT), and b) the use of human embryonic stem cells (hES cells) for research into cell therapy, including 'therapeutic' cloning. There {{appears to be a}} broad acceptance of EFTT in these countries. In most countries guidance has been developed. There is a 'strong' consensus about some of the central conditions for 'good clinical practice' regarding EFTT. International differences concern, amongst others, some of the informed consent issues involved, and the questions whether an intermediary organisation is necessary, whether the methods of abortion may be influenced by the possible use of EFT, and whether EFTT should only be used for the experimental treatment of rare disorders. The potential use of hES cells for research into cell therapy has given a new impetus to the debate about (human) embryo research. The therapeutic prospects with regard to the retrieval and research use of hES cells appear to function as a catalyst for the introduction of less restrictive regulations concerning research with <b>spare</b> <b>embryos,</b> at least in some European countries.

40|$|Technically, {{the term}} embryo {{refers to the}} {{products}} of conception after implantation into {{the wall of the}} womb, usually nearly two weeks after fertilization, up until the eighth week. Embryos contain stem cells which, according to scientists, could be used to cure a wide range of conditions. Stem cells can be coaxed into growing cells of any other type, which makes them potentially very useful indeed. However, removing stem cells from an embryo will kill the embryo, which some people object to. From the mid 1970 s, IVF was being developed and research was carried out on the <b>spare</b> <b>embryos</b> produced. This research helped to improve IVF techniques, as well as to better understand the earliest stages of human development. Research also shed light on a variety of inheritable disorders. In Turkish Law, assisted reproduction treatment (ART) services are regulated with the Regulation of Assisted Reproductive Treatment Centers Act (RAPTCA) The Regulation was issued in 1987, but it has been amended several times since. Also, article 90 of the Turkish Penal Code covers some aspects of research on embryos. At the same time, the Biomedicine Convention (Oviedo Convention), signed by Turkey and which entered into force in 2003, has binding regulations about this issue.

40|$|Several {{states have}} banned {{therapeutic}} cloning, {{and the federal}} government is considering legislation that would do the same. Some of these laws, including the proposed federal legislation, make it a crime not only to engage in therapeutic research on a cloned embryo, but also for a patient to use any medicine derived from such research, even if the cloning took place {{in a country where the}} research is lawful. Under the United States Constitution, government action restricting freedom in this way must have at least a rational basis if it is to be upheld in court. Opponents of therapeutic cloning argue not that medicines derived from therapeutic cloning will be unsafe or ineffective, but rather that the embryonic stem cells used in therapeutic cloning represent potential life that must be protected. I will argue, however, that this concern is not the real reason most individuals oppose therapeutic cloning. Indeed, this 2 ̆ 2 potential life 2 ̆ 2 argument is ignored daily when some <b>spare</b> <b>embryos</b> produced as a byproduct of routine fertility treatments are destroyed while others are used for research. As I will argue below, this disparate treatment reveals that the real basis for the ban on therapeutic cloning is repugnance at the idea of cloning, driven by a sense that cloning is unnatural.

40|$|The {{continued}} {{significance of}} {{human embryonic stem}} cell research and recent advances in human somatic cell nuclear transfer and human gamete and embryo gene editing have given rise to renewed debates on the donation and use of human embryos and oocytes for research, therapies, and commercial applications. Sociological studies of cell and tissue donation have also indicated that the ethical procedures and social and moral values that surround the donation and use of human reproductive tissues for research do often differ across countries. This chapter addresses the donation of human embryos for human {{embryonic stem cell research}} in China. The chapter is based on interviews with 15 IVF clinicians, 15 stem cell researchers, and 15 IVF patients who were asked to donate their embryos for hESC research. Part I focuses on the role and enactment of informed consent procedures. A question that I ask in this respect is what ideas are communicated to potential embryo donors, so that the donation of their <b>spare</b> <b>embryos</b> for hESC research appears reasonable and justifiable? Based on interview data I will illustrate a variety of rhetorical practices and strategies that underpin informed consent procedures. These range from the responsible facilitation of informed choice that emphasizes patient autonomy and the right to refuse donation to more problematic rhetorical practices that involve the provision of false facts and patient deception. Part II discusses these findings in light of the regulatory context in which human embryonic stem cells are produced, banked, and distributed in China. To illustrate the specific effects of this regulatory system, I will draw on a comparison with the regulatory situation in the UK. The chapter concludes that there is often a significant gap between {{the ways in which the}} value and use of donated embryos is described to patients and the actual forms of value that these tissues gain in the context of research, distribution, and commercial use.

We demonstrate that the efficiency of both ICM isolation and ES cell derivation using this strategy is significantly superior to whole-blastocyst culture or laser drilling technology itself.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this report we {{investigate}} whether chromatin anomalies in human spermatozoa can influence fertilization after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We have examined the sperm chromatin packaging quality using the chromomycin A 3 (CMA 3) fluorochrome and the presence of DNA damage in spermatozoa using in-situ nick translation. When comparing the spermatozoa of patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and ICSI distinct differences are evident in that ICSI males have a higher CMA 3 fluorescence, indicating spermatozoa with loosely packed chromatin, and more spermatozoa containing endogenous DNA nicks. When examining the unfertilized oocytes of ICSI patients we found that men who had a high percentage of anomalies in their chromatin, i. e. > 30 % CMA 3 fluorescence and > 10 % nicks, had more than double the number of unfertilized oocytes containing spermatozoa that had remained condensed. The observation that failed fertilized oocytes, injected with spermatozoa from patients with a higher percentage of sperm nuclear anomalies, contain more condensed spermatozoa indicates that a selection process against these spermatozoa may be in place at the time of fertilization. In the second part of the study we show that <b>spare</b> ICSI <b>embryos</b> have significantly lower rates of development to the blastocyst stage compared with those developed after routine IVF.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the frequency and type of chromosome segregation patterns in cleavage stage embryos obtained from male carriers of Robertsonian (ROB) and reciprocal (REC) translocations undergoing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) at our reproductive center. We used FISH to analyze chromosome segregation in 308 day 3 cleavage stage embryos obtained from 26 patients. The percentage of embryos consistent with normal or balanced segregation (55. 1 % vs. 27. 1 %) and clinical pregnancy (62. 5 % vs. 19. 2 %) rates were higher in ROB than the REC translocation carriers. Involvement of non-acrocentric chromosome(s) or terminal breakpoint(s) in reciprocal translocations was associated with an increase in the percent of embryos consistent with adjacent 1 but with a decrease in 3 ∶ 1 segregation. Similar results were obtained in the analysis of nontransferred embryos donated for research. 3 ∶ 1 segregation was the most frequent segregation type in both day 3 (31 %) and <b>spare</b> (35 %) <b>embryos</b> obtained from carriers of t(11; 22) (q 23;q 11), the only non-random REC with the same breakpoint reported in a large number of unrelated families mainly identified by the birth of a child with derivative chromosome 22. These results suggest that chromosome segregation patterns in day 3 and nontransferred embryos obtained from male translocation carriers vary with the type of translocation and involvement of acrocentric chromosome(s) or terminal breakpoint(s). These results should be helpful in estimating reproductive success in translocation carriers undergoing PGD...|$|R

The prevalence of mosaicism {{is important in the}} context of preimplantation genetic screening in which the chromosomal status of an embryo is determined by the analysis of a single cell from that embryo. METHODS: Here we report a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the chromosomal constitution of human preimplantation embryos. In 36 studies, out of 2117 citations that met our search criteria, data were provided extensively enough to allow classification of each analysed embryo with prespecified criteria for its chromosomal makeup. The main outcome of this classification was the prevalence of chromosomal mosaicism in human preimplantation embryos. RESULTS: A total of 815 embryos could be classified. Of these, 177 (22 %) were diploid, 599 (73 %) were mosaic, of which 480 (59 % {{of the total number of}} embryos) were diploid-aneuploid mosaic and 119 (14 % of the total number of embryos) were aneuploid mosaic, and 39 (5 %) contained other numerical chromosomal abnormalities. The distribution of the embryos over these categories was associated with the developmental stage of the embryos, the method used for analysis and the number of chromosomes analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Diploid-aneuploid mosaicism is by far the most common chromosomal constitution in <b>spare</b> human preimplantation <b>embryos</b> after IVF. This undermines the reliable determination of the ploidy status of a cleavage-stage embryo based on the analysis of a single cell. Future research should determine the origin and developmental potential of mosaic embryos. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{presence}} and distribution of the intracellular calcium channel regulating type I inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptors (IP 3 R) in human immature and mature oocytes, pronuclear zygotes and cleaved embryos using a specific antibody. Two approaches were used: (i) fluorescence immunocytochemistry using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and (ii) Western blotting. With confocal microscopy, the receptors {{were found in the}} oocytes, fertilized zygotes as well as cleaved embryos at all stages studied. The pattern and distribution of the receptor staining in the oocytes changed gradually from a diffuse granular patchy one at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage to a reticular and predominantly peripheral one through the metaphase and metaphase II (MII) stages. After fertilization, the distribution changed gradually to both, peripheral and central in the zygotes and early 2 - 4 -cell embryos and predominantly perinuclear in the 6 - 8 -cell embryos. Furthermore, an overall increase in the staining intensity was observed from GV to MII stage oocytes and from zygotes to 6 - 8 -cell embryos. We also studied the spatial distribution of the receptor in detail by constructing three-dimensional images from the serial optical sections obtained on the CLSM. Peculiar peripheral aggregates of receptor clusters were noted in the MII stage oocytes, zygotes and some blastomeres from early cleaved embryos. Finally, Western blots performed on the extracts of 72 in-vitro matured oocytes and 50 <b>spare</b> cleavage stage <b>embryos</b> showed positive bands at similar to 260 kDa. These findings coincide with and thus possibly represent the dynamic changes occurring in the cellular Ca 2 + release systems through oocyte maturation, fertilization and early embryogenesis. Thus, type I IP 3 R are likely to play a role during these stages of early development in the huma...|$|R
