40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{quantify}} maximum acceptable torques (MATs) in 16 healthy male industrial workers while performing six motions: <b>screw</b> <b>driving</b> clockwise with a 40 mm handle and a 39 mm yoke handle, flexion and extension with a pinch grip, ulnar deviation with a power grip (similar to knife cutting), and a handgrip task (similar to a pliers task). Background: Psychophysical studies on repetitive motions of the wrist and hand were previously reported on women; however, it is not clear how men will psychophysically respond to similar motions. Method: A psychophysical methodology was used in which the participant adjusted the resistance on the handle. Repetition rates for these tasks were 15 and 25 per minute. Participants performed the tasks for 7 hours per day, 5 days per week, and for 12 days. Symptoms were recorded by the subjects at the end of each hour. Results: The mean MATs ranged from 1. 15 Nm to 1. 88 Nm for <b>screw</b> <b>driving,</b> 2. 26 Nm to 3. 71 Nm for pinch flexion and extension, 3. 88 Nm to 4. 07 Nm for ulnar deviation, and 11. 47 Nm to 13. 98 Nm for the handgrip task. The higher the repetition rate, the lower the MAT. Depending on the type of task and repetition rate, these values represented 15 % to 35 % (median of 23 %) of their maximum isometric torque. Application: Based on aforementioned findings, a table of MATs and derived acceptable forces for six tasks at different percentage capabilities of the male industrial populations is formulated...|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} study {{presented in this}} paper consists of two series of tests concerned with jointing performance of wood screws for particleboard. In the first series of test, withdrawal test of wood wcrews from the face or edge of particleboard were performed. In withdrawal tests, the sizes of wood screw and pilot hole were varied and the driving torque was also measured. In the second series of tests, two specimens (rail and post) of particleboard were constructed in the form of L-type with wood screws, Knife thread insert nuts or adhesive, and the rail was placed in the flat position. The bending load (out-of-plane force) was applied to it, and static and repetitive bending tests of L-type construction were carried out. And from the measured results, the angular stiffness of the L-type construction was calculated from Eq. (82 ̆ 7). The results obtained are as follows. (1) Under a constant diameter of wood <b>screw,</b> <b>driving</b> torque and withdrawal resistance increase with increase of the length of screw. However, under a constant length of wood <b>screw,</b> <b>driving</b> torque increases with increase of the diameter of screw, but withdrawal resistance decreases. These results indicate that it is more effective to use longer wood screws than to use thicker screws. (2) Withdrawal resistance of each size of wood screw is affected by the diameterratio of pilot hole to wood screw and it shows the largest value at the diameter ratio 0. 5. Considering a labor efficency at the jointing work, however, it seems better to use the diameter ratio 0. 6 to 0. 7. (3) The bending fracture load of L-type constructinos connected with wood screws is affected considerably by the length of wood screw and is under control of the internal bond strength of particleboard. The angular stiffness of L-type construction depends on both withdrawal resistance and the resistanceto the deformation of the wood screw caused by bending load. The fracture load and the angular stiffness show larger values in the case that the L-type construction is connected with insert nuts than those in the case of wood screws. (4) The strength and the stiffness of L-type construction are improved by jointing with both wood screws and adhesive. Especially, by use of epoxy resin, the strength increases remarkably. (5) The fatigue strength of L-type construction connected with each type of joints is in proportion approximately to their static strength. パーティクルボードを供試材料として,その接合部の性能を評価するための基礎資料を得る目的から,案内孔寸法と木ねじのねじ込みトルクおよび引抜き抵抗との関係,ならびに木ねじ,ねじ込み式ナットおよび接着剤による接合部の静的あるいは繰返し曲げ荷重に対する強度および剛性について基礎実験を行ない,以下の結論を得た.

40|$|AbstractWith {{the aging}} of human society and the rapid {{development}} of transportation industry, the disease rates of bone and joint are also in constant increase, making the biological healing and regeneration of articular cartilage as a core issue of joint surgery in basic and clinical. In general, the regeneration capacity of articular cartilage injury difficult to selfrepair {{is considered to be}} limited. At present, many new technologies and methods have been used for clinical treatment, but it only can relieve the pain of the patients. Human knee joint has two main movement patterns: rolling and sliding. Rolling, as a typical representative of the articular cartilage, is very similar to the mechanical environment in vivo. Accordingly, we first proposed and developed this rolling depression loading device with perfusion system for the mechanobiology researching on in vitro articular cartilage, which includes rolling control system, compression adjusting system and circulating perfusion system. The innovation of the biological reactor is the combination of the rolling loading system and circulation of grouting system. The roll controlling system is achieved by roller rolling back and forth through stepper motor <b>driving</b> <b>screw</b> rod. The compressive system could produce uniform, controlled compressions by relatively sliding of two wedge blocks. The circulating perfusion system is mainly finished by controlling the peristaltic pump. It can provide an environment which is closer to the normal physiological condition of articular cartilage. Rolling depression loading is useful to clarify the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and apply biomechanical factors to prevent and treat osteoarthritis and repair cartilage.

50|$|The type of {{edge damage}} also varies among {{different}} tools. But a distinction is necessary between the intended use, what the tool maker designed the tool for, and actual use. This {{is an important}} distinction to note as tools {{can be used for}} more than its intended function or designed for several purposes. An often noted example from modern culture are screwdrivers which are designed for <b>driving</b> <b>screws</b> but are regularly used to open cans of paint. This type of multi-purpose tool is noted in lithic assemblages by ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological studies. Basic edge damage types include step fractures, snap fractures, micro-flake scars, and edge rounding. Fractures are differentiated by looking at both fracture initiation and propagation. Fracture initiation is defined as where and how the fracture of an edge begins. Fracture propagation is defined by the path a crack follows, and the degree of the crack’s growth. Fractures are often used to note how tools are created but also used in wear studies. For example, fracturing can help note whether a tool was used in an outward bending action rather than a downward force which can cause a flake to detach and create damage. In addition to flake scars, abrasion, edge rounding, and striations occurring after tool use, one must be careful to note whether this was from actual use or from handling after excavation/collection. Alterations to a tool’s edge or surface can result from improper handling or storage. For example, two artifacts within the same bag can cause wear marks from constant interaction, also the bags themselves have been noted to cause wear on artifacts.|$|R

3000|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of a single pile shows the maximum load a pile can withstand under different modes of loading (compression, tension, lateral, etc.). The axial {{bearing capacity}} of a pile, q, is normally derived from frictional shaft capacity developed along the pile surface, q [...] s, and toe capacity derived from soil resistance under the toe of the pile, q [...] t [...]. The contribution {{of each of these}} bearing capacity components depends on the type of the soil as well as pile characteristics. The shaft resistance of piles is dependent on the interaction of the pile shaft and adjacent soils as well as the method of installation (i.e., <b>driving,</b> cast-in-place, and <b>screw</b> piling). Pile <b>driving</b> is normally performed using an impact or vibratory hammer depending {{on the nature of the}} soil and design regulations. Different types of pile foundations including precast concrete pile, timbers, steel and composite piles can be installed using driving techniques. However, this technique might generate different levels of soil displacement depending on the geometry of the pile during pile driving. This soil displacement may be advantageous in cohesionless soils, as it could densify the surrounding soil and increase the shaft capacity of the pile. In cohesive soils, on the other hand, the pile driving may cause soil disturbance and alter the soil structure around the pile, and induce excess pore water pressure which, in turn, can reduce the pile capacity. According to De Mello [1], the process of change in soil structure can be divided into four stages. The first stage is the remoulding of the structure of the soil around the pile, which occurs during pile driving. The second stage is the variations in the state of stress of the soil and the pile, which is referred to as the formation of excess pore water pressure. This excess pore water pressure will reduce the effective stress of the soil and, hence, the shear strength of the soil for a specific period of time after driving. The third stage is defined as the dissipation of excess pore water pressure, which occurs at a certain rate depending on the soil permeability. Lastly, it is the increase in the soil strength overtime due to dissipation of the excess pore water pressure, and soil aging.|$|R
