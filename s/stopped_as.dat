5|$|An unusually {{heavy rain}} storm {{affected}} a GO train on July 8, 2013, when a record-breaking 123mm fell {{over a few}} hours. A Richmond Hill-bound GO train encountered flood waters in the Don Valley and <b>stopped.</b> <b>As</b> the crew worked to change {{the direction of the}} train, flood waters continued to rise and submerged the tracks behind the train. The train itself began to flood, and approximately 1,400 passengers had to be rescued by boat.|$|E
5|$|Another {{follow-up}} {{game called}} Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny was planned, which {{revolved around the}} Spear of Longinus. Development was outsourced to a small Canadian studio, but eventually <b>stopped</b> <b>as</b> LucasArts did not have experience with the supervision of external teams. Elaine Lee loosely reworked the story into another four-part comic book series, released from April to July 1995.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 {{there was}} another major fish kill, with over 200 dead fish found near the Fofanny water {{treatment}} works. There were approximately 150 trout and 55 salmon killed. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency investigated the incident and identified a potential source. It was revealed that an emergency discharge was carried out at Fofanny Water Treatment Work from 5am to 7am, due to a generator failure. The discharge was <b>stopped</b> <b>as</b> soon as personnel arrived at the site. Northern Ireland Water claimed the discharge was necessary to maintain the drinking water supply from Fofanny Dam. Measures have been since {{been put in place}} to prevent a similar incident in the future.|$|E
5|$|Level-5 {{worked with}} {{localization}} company Shloc to translate Wrath of the White Witch for Western regions; the two studios collaborated for many weeks. The team found great difficulty when localizing {{the game for}} Western regions, particularly due to the large amounts of text and audio that required translation. Other {{minor changes to the}} artwork and animation also occurred, such as making Oliver bow in a Western manner. By December 12, 2012, development on the localized version of Wrath of the White Witch <b>stopped</b> <b>as</b> the game was submitted for manufacturing. It was released in North America on January 22, 2013, in Australia on January 31, and in Europe on February 1.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had {{a chance}} to take the lead before half-time. Phil Neal {{advanced}} down the right hand side of the pitch and found Dalglish who passed to Graeme Souness, who ran late through the Real defence. His subsequent shot was not held by Agustín Rodríguez, but Souness was unable to get to the rebounded ball. Real had the first chance of the second half. Liverpool's defence had <b>stopped</b> <b>as</b> they thought Cunningham was offside, however he was not and Camacho advanced towards Ray Clemence in the Liverpool goal. Clemence came off his line and ran towards the Real midfielder, Camacho attempted to lob the ball over the keeper, but his shot went over the goal.|$|E

5|$|The intergiro {{classification}} {{was marked}} by a blue jersey.

Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its life, the platform's {{software}} {{has been}} upgraded {{several times and}} although these upgrades were due to be <b>stopped</b> <b>as</b> part of plans to retire the A-10 in February 2014, Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James ordered that the latest upgrade, designated Suite 8, continue in response to Congressional pressure. Suite 8 software includes IFF Mode 5, which modernizes the ability to identify the A-10 to friendly units. Additionally, the Pave Penny pods and pylons are being removed as their receive-only capability {{has been replaced by}} the AN/AAQ-28(V)4 LITENING AT targeting pods or Sniper XR targeting pod, which both have laser designators and laser rangefinders.|$|E
5|$|For {{the points}} classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for {{finishing}} {{a stage in}} the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The Cima Coppi for this Giro was the Col Agnel, {{but it was not}} climbed due to avalanches that prevented the riders from being able to pass on the roads.

5|$|In the past, some {{visitors}} {{would write}} {{their names on}} the Wall, or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised {{the sanctity of the}} Wall. Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper Havatzelet in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be <b>stopped</b> <b>as</b> it constituted a desecration. More recently the Yalkut Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness. Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a halachic point of view. Blasphemous graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began to peel away.|$|E
5|$|The corps, part of Georg-Hans Reinhardt's Third Panzer Group, {{was located}} at Kalinin, 160km (100mi) {{northwest}} of Moscow. It was worn out, {{at the end}} of a long and tenuous supply line (Model had been promoted on 28 October, and needed two weeks just to get to Kalinin), and the cold weather was starting to hamper the Germans. Nevertheless, morale remained high, and the final push towards Moscow began shortly after his arrival. Model was a whirlwind of energy, touring the front and exhorting his troops to greater efforts: he also ran roughshod over the niceties of protocol and chains of command, and, in general, left his staff trailing in his wake. By 5 December, XLI Panzer Corps' 6th Panzer Division had reached Iohnca, just 35km (22mi) from the Kremlin. There, the advance <b>stopped,</b> <b>as</b> the winter took hold. Temperatures dropped 20 to 40°C below zero, weapons and vehicles froze solid, and the Germans were forced to call a halt to offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, as Australia faced a large deficit on {{the first}} innings, Bert Oldfield played a long innings in support of Bill Ponsford, who scored 85. In {{the course of the}} innings, the English bowlers used bodyline against him, and he faced several short-pitched deliveries but took several fours from Larwood to move to 41. Having just conceded a four, Larwood bowled fractionally shorter and slightly slower. Oldfield attempted to hook but lost sight of the ball and edged it onto his temple; the ball fractured his skull. Oldfield staggered away and fell to his knees and play <b>stopped</b> <b>as</b> Woodfull came onto the pitch and the angry crowd jeered and shouted, once more reaching the point where a riot seemed likely. Several English players thought about arming themselves with stumps should the crowd come onto the field. The ball which injured Oldfield was bowled to a conventional, non-bodyline field; Larwood immediately apologised but Oldfield said that it was his own fault before he was helped back to the dressing room and play continued. Jardine later secretly sent a telegram of sympathy to Oldfield's wife and arranged for presents to be given to his young daughters.|$|E

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Kane and Rob Van Dam <b>stopped,</b> <b>as</b> Kane {{engaged in a}} feud against Shane McMahon. In a {{scenario}} on the August 25, 2003 episode of Raw, Kane attempted to throw McMahon into a dumpster that was set on fire, but McMahon avoided it and threw Kane into the dumpster. On September 8, 2003 during an episode of Raw, Eric Bischoff scheduled a Last Man Standing match between Kane and McMahon for Unforgiven. In that match, Kane defeated McMahon after McMahon was unable {{to respond to a}} ten count. After SummerSlam, Eddie Guerrero began a rivalry with John Cena over the WWE United States Championship. Guerrero retained the championship in two title defenses that took place on SmackDown!. Guerrero then engaged in a feud with Big Show. At No Mercy, Big Show defeated Guerrero via pinfall to win the WWE United States Championship.|$|E
5|$|Unexpectedly, the {{weakening}} trend <b>stopped,</b> <b>as</b> the steering winds {{came from the}} same direction behind the hurricane. It slowed down slightly, and on September 26 the eye of the hurricane became much more distinct. Humberto quickly re-intensified and reached peak winds of 105mph (170km/h), while located about 200 miles (320km) south-southeast of Sable Island, off the coast of Nova Scotia. Just as quickly it strengthened, the hurricane began weakening again. The eye became distorted as the convection became asymmetrical, due to the cooler waters and stronger westerlies. Initially, the NHC forecast Humberto to become extratropical. On September 27, it turned more eastward and later to the east-southeast, and Humberto weakening to tropical storm status about 400 miles (645km) southeast of Newfoundland. The cloud pattern became increasingly elongated and removed from the center, and late on the 27th, the circulation of Humberto degenerated into an open trough in the far northern Atlantic Ocean. The remnants were expected to be absorbed quickly by a larger extratropical storm to its north.|$|E
