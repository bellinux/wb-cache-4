The present case report is of a 30 -year-old woman who presented with <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>neck,</b> which was diagnosed as pilomatricoma only after excision. The idea of reporting {{this case is that}} pilomatricoma is not rare in occurrence but rarely diagnosed because of lack of confirmation of excised swelling and it is imperative that it should be kept in the differential diagnoses of all superficial skin tumors by dermatologists and surgeons...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} a rare case of angiosarcoma thyroid in Indian subcontinent with its suc-cessful management. Case report: A 60 -year-old male with <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>neck</b> for 20 years with sud-den {{increase in the}} size during last 3 months. Fine needle aspiration cytology suggested anaplastic carcinoma. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with central and lateral neck dissection. On histopathology, the diagnosis of angiosarcoma was suspected. Immunohisto chemistry con-firmed the diagnosis of angiosarcoma. Post-operative chemoradiation was given with no recur-rence at 10 months of follow up. Conclusion: Though rare, angiosarcoma should be included as differential diagnosis in cases of long standing goiters with recent rapid increase in size. Immuno-histochemistry is crucial for diagnosis and {{should be considered in}} these patients. Early and prompt diagnosis will help in providing curative treatment in such patients...|$|E
40|$|Radiation induced {{carotid artery}} {{stenosis}} (RICS) is a known complication of {{head and neck}} radiation therapy. Latency period of carotid stenosis following radiation is prolonged and sometimes it may be up to 20 years [1]. Underlying pathophysiology of carotid stenosis following radiation {{is thought to be}} accelerated atherosclerosis or panarteritis triggered by radiation [2, 3]. Surgical carotid endarterectomy is diff icult and challenging in this situation because of associated scarring of vessel wall and tissue planes, involvement of long segment, presence of both intracranial and extracranial stenosis and inadequate wound healing and closure following the procedure [4, 5]. Carotid angioplasty and stenting is more appropriate and provide maximum benefit in surgically inappropriate and high risk patients such as RICS [6, 7]. We report a case of radiation induced long segment carotid stenosis with pseudoaneurysm treated by conjoined stent technique. This case is unique on account of not only long segment of stenosis but also due to presence of symptomatic pseudoaneurysm. CASE REPORT A 70 -year-old man had history of carcinoma larynx (Stage I) treated with conventional radiotherapy with the dose of 70 Gy in the year 2000. In March 2013, he presented with complaint of recurrent transient episodes of left upper limb weakness. He had six such episodes during last three months. Each episode lasted for 2 - 3 minutes and used to improve on its own. He also complained small <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>neck</b> in right submandibular area and transient weakness on left sid...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{describe}} {{our experience}} of paediatric patients with acute retropharyngeal abscess in terms of clinical presentation, diagnosis, management and complications. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was done {{for a period of}} 4 years (Jan 2009 to Jan 2013) on paediatric patients (< 15 years) with acute retropharyngeal abscess at two tertiary hospitals in Srinagar. Diagnosis was {{made on the basis of}} X-ray, CECT scan findings and confirmed on incision and drainage. Pus was aspirated from all patients and sent for culture and sensitivity. Data for clinical presentation, X-ray, CECT scan findings, causes, complications, bacteriology and management were collected. Thirty-five abscesses were drained while 5 with small abscesses on CECT were managed conservatively. Results: A total of 40 patients were diagnosed as acute retropharyngeal abscesses. Males were commonly affected, and most of the patients were less than 6 years of age. Most common symptom at presentation was fever (35) followed by neck pain (30) Dysphagia/odynophagia (22), <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>neck</b> (19). Most common clinical sign observed was oropharyngeal swelling and limitation of neck movements (30), cervical swelling/lymphadenopathy in 22 patients. Torticollosis and drooling were seen in 15 patients. Complications were seen in 8 patients. Most common X-ray finding was pre-vertebral thickening. Success rate with primary surgical drainage was 95 % while 3 patients in conservative group failed. Conclusion: Children with RPA most commonly present with restricted neck movements, fever and cervical lymphadenopathy, and rarely with respiratory distress or stridor. Surgical intervention is necessary for most of these patients...|$|E

5000|$|A ranula usually {{presents}} as {{a translucent}} blue, dome-shaped, [...] <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the tissues {{of the floor}} of the mouth. If the lesion is deeper, then there is a greater thickness of tissue separating from the oral cavity and the blue translucent appearance may not be a feature. A ranula can develop into a large lesion many centimeters in diameter, with resultant elevation of the tongue and possibly interfering with swallowing (dysphagia). The swelling is not fixed, may not show blanching and is non-painful unless it becomes secondarily infected. The usual location is usually lateral to the midline, which may be used to help distinguish it from a midline dermoid cyst. A cervical ranula presents as a <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the <b>neck,</b> with or without a <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the mouth. In common with other mucoceles, ranulas may rupture and then cause recurrent swelling. Ranulas may be asymptomatic, although they can fluctuate rapidly in size, shrinking and swelling, making them hard to detect.|$|R
