40|$|A {{field study}} {{was carried out}} {{consisting}} of three parts: 1) Posture recording (by goniometrics) of shoulder, fore arm and wrist during the tasks that the bricklayers perform using their trowel; 2) Calculation of the wrist load moment value and 3) Questioning the bricklayers about their experience after using the prototypes. From the posture recording, it was seen {{that the use of}} prototype 2 resulted in a significantly shorter exposure to an extreme wrist posture (i. e., ulnar deviation) than prototype 1 and the traditional trowel. The wrist load value was significantly lower for prototype 2 compared to prototype 1 and the traditional trowel and lower for prototype 1 compared to the traditional trowel. The bricklayers mentioned that the functionality, user friendless and work performance are better for the traditional trowel compared to both prototypes. <b>Spreading</b> <b>mortar</b> in corners and stirring mortar can be better done using the traditional trowel in stead of using the prototypes, according to the bricklayers. Further, they say that the prototypes have a good fit in the hand and that shovelling and <b>spreading</b> <b>mortar</b> using the prototypes cause less physical load on the upper extremities compared to the traditional trowel...|$|R

50|$|Block cores are {{typically}} tapered {{so that the}} top surface of the block (as laid) has a greater surface on which to <b>spread</b> a <b>mortar</b> bed and for easier handling. Most CMU's have two cores, but three- and four-core units are also produced. A core also allows for the insertion of steel reinforcement, tying individual blocks together in the assembly, {{with the goal of}} greatly increased strength. To hold the reinforcement in proper position and to bond the block to the reinforcement, the cores must be filled with grout (concrete). Reinforcement is primarily used to impart greater tensile strength to the assembly, improving its ability to resist lateral forces such as wind load and seismic forces.|$|R

30|$|The {{performance}} of the SAP {{is influenced by the}} type of SAP used and their interaction with the cementitious environment (Schröfl et al. 2012; Assmann 2013). For the SAP used in this paper the water absorption capacity estimated by <b>mortar</b> <b>spread</b> test is 24  g/g; the SAP entrained less water than expected; a possible reason might be that a considerable amount of internal water curing is not released but rather is retained in the SAP. Unfortunately, on recent results published (Assmann 2013) is shown inefficient curing for pastes and concretes with the same type of SAP, result of less water absorption of this SAP at low w/c ratio, revealed from results of imaging analysis.|$|R
40|$|The {{buttress}} {{load strength}} of that concrete brick is more {{influenced by the}} strength of its mortar, and that mortar strength depends on the water content inside. This research is done to know about the the relation between water content of that mixture-mortar with the movement strength change of the solid concrete bricks-buttress and the workability. The test material is buttress model of the solid concrete brick with 80 cm length size. The high is like 3 solid concrete brick layers with the horizontal and vertical siar is 2 cm on each independent variable in the form of variations of the water content mixture-mortar between 70 % to 115 % with a bound variable in the form of shear strength solid concrete brick buttress and the workability.

50|$|The {{standard}} {{weapon of}} a modern soldier is an assault rifle, which, like other small arms, uses cartridge ammunition in a size specific to the weapon. Ammunition is carried on the person in box magazines specific to the weapon, ammo boxes, pouches or bandoliers. The amount of ammo carried {{is dependent on the}} strength of the soldier, the expected action required, and the ability of ammunition to move forward through the logistical chain to replenish the supply. A soldier may also carry a smaller amount of specialized ammunition for heavier weapons such as machine guns and <b>mortars,</b> <b>spreading</b> the burden for squad weapons over many people. Too little ammunition poses a threat to the mission, while too much limits the soldier's mobility.|$|R
5000|$|Around 1930 Mille Smith Eastman became rather {{interested}} in Scouting. Her interest in Scouting {{continued to grow}} with each succeeding year, and in July 1930 she bought an additional 15 acre for the camp from Mr. Roy W. Pilkington. All the other tracts of land composing the camp site have been conveyed by straight warranty deeds and carry no burden. A holding company composed of nine directors was incorporated under {{the laws of the}} State of Illinois, on the May 25, 1931, as a non-profit corporation for the purpose of holding the lands and properties of the camp. Said company {{to be known as the}} Boy Scout Camp Corporation with its Illinois headquarters located at Hamilton, Illinois. The Rotary Club, up to this point had invested $3,223.80 on land, buildings and equipment. All of this was transferred to the Boy Scouts of America on December 21, 1931, and the camp’s name was changed to in July 1930. Mrs. Eastman continued to purchase and add additional tracts to the camp. On December 3, 1936, she bought a tract that gave the camp an unbroken shoreline of 7250 ft and a total of 137½ acres of land for the camp. In 1934 Mrs. Eastman began construction on a stone lodge in memory of her husband. She <b>spread</b> the <b>mortar</b> herself and laid the cornerstone in 1935. In 1942 construction took place for a home for the camp ranger. And In 1943 she provided a concrete block building; half to be used for recreation and a canteen and the other half for storage, nicknamed the Bee Hive. The Order of Eagles contributed $800.00 to build four sleeping cabins and later on in 1943, they gave an additional sum to re-roof and refit these buildings. The group of buildings was known as the [...] "Eagles' Nest". The V.F.W. of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa gave funds for a Troop cabin, which was used to house the summer Camp Staff.|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{acknowledged}} that the behaviour of concrete {{is influenced by the}} properties of its constitutive materials. The geometry of aggregates is believed to contribute to the strength and stress-strain relationship of concrete. However, advanced studies are still required to quantify the effect of such factor in determining the behaviour of concrete. This research was aimed at investigating the effect of aggregate shape and configuration on the stress-strain relationship of concrete. Four types of specimens were investigated. There was one single coarse aggregate with different shape placed in the centre part of the specimens. The specimens were subject to uni-axial compression and both the load and displacement were measured. The experiments were conducted at the Structural and Material Laboratory of Diponegoro University in Semarang. The results show that the specimen with a diamond shaped aggregate results in the lowest compressive strength. However, the initial tangent stiffness of all specimens is almost identical up to 25 % of its ultimate strength. Finite element analyses were carried out to study stress distribution in the specimens. The results show that the stresses are concentrated {{at the corner of the}} aggregates. This stress concentration initiates cracks at the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ) around the corner of the aggregates. The cracks then propagate and <b>spread</b> to the <b>mortar</b> which then reduce the stiffness of the specimens...|$|R
40|$|Restoration of {{historic}} buildings is often executed using lime mortars. A restoration mortar is considered {{compatible with the}} original building materials when it answers to certain criteria, such as the facilitation of moisture transport. This can be determined by studying porosity, permeability, and the pore size distribution of both materials. Since NHL mortars are used in restoration of the exterior, where water and moisture are ever-present, a good characterization {{in terms of their}} pore-related properties is necessary. This study therefore researched characteristics of pure NHL mortars, without metakaolin or pozzolan additives. In this study, 16 different mortar recipes were made with NHL 5, the most hydraulic NHL type. The mortars had variations in spread, sand type and grain size. The sand types varied from coarse-grained to very fine, {{in order to be able}} to study the influence of the largest and smallest grains. The spread was adapted from 120 to 180 mm by changing the water:binder ratio. This allows understanding the influence of binding water on these pore-related properties. The measured pore-related properties were linked to compressive strength measurements, so as to characterize these eminently hydraulic limes also on a mechanical level. Nearly 180 samples were tested after 90 days of curing. All mortars show a bimodal pore size distribution. Depending on the sand type and the <b>mortar</b> <b>spread,</b> the mechanical strength varied from 1 to 10 MPa and pore sizes varied from the larger to smaller pore region. This demonstrates the large influence aggregates and water have on the properties of the hardened mortar. In general, the influence of the variation in water:binder ratio was less apparent, although an excess of binding water was translated into a change towards smaller pores, higher porosity and lower compressive strength. This study demonstrates that NHL 5 lime can be a good binder for restoration mortars, in which the properties of the mortar can be adapted through variation of aggregate grain size and spread. This allows researching a possible estimation of properties before making the mortars...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis deals {{with the development of}} self-consolidating high performance concrete (SCHPC) incorporating rice husk ash (RHA) as a supplementary cementing material. Various SCHPCs were produced using the water-binder (W/B) ratios of 0. 30, 0. 35, 0. 40 and 0. 50, and RHA content in the range of 0 to 30 % of cement by weight. In addition, a number of pastes and mortars formulated from the concretes were prepared and tested for the filling ability. The paste and mortar filling abilities were tested with respect to flow time and flow spread, respectively, at various dosages of high-range water reducer (HRWR). Also, the mortars were tested for the air content at various dosages of air-entraining admixture (AEA). It was observed that the flow time of the pastes increased with lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content, whereas the flow <b>spread</b> of the <b>mortars</b> decreased with higher W/B ratio and greater RHA content. Both paste and mortar filling abilities increased with higher HRWR dosages. In addition, the air content of the mortars decreased with lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content for given AEA dosages. The fresh SCHPCs were tested for filling ability, passing ability, air-void stability, segregation resistance, unit weight and air content. The filling ability was determined with respect to slump and slump flow, inverted slump cone flow time and spread, and orimet flow time and spread. The passing ability was measured with regard to slump and slump flow with J-ring, inverted slump cone flow spread with J-ring, and orimet flow spread with J-ring. The air-void stability in several fresh SCHPC mixtures was investigated with respect to re-mixing of concrete and subsequent measurement of air content at different test stages. The test results obtained for the fresh properties showed that the inverted slump cone and orimet flow times increased with lower W/B ratio and greater RHA content. In addition, the slump flow, inverted slump cone flow spread, and orimet flow spread with and without J-ring increased considerably with lower W/B ratio and greater RHA content. However, the increases in slump with and without J-ring at lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content were not significant. The unit weight of concrete slightly decreased with higher W/B ratio and greater RHA content, and with higher air content. Achieving the target air content required greater AEA dosages for lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content. However, the presence of RHA had no adverse effect on the air-void stability of concrete. The segregation resistance of various SCHPCs was investigated by visual inspection of concrete in mixer pan, and during and after different flow tests. Slight bleeding and a thick layer of paste were noticed in mixer pan for several concretes. The dynamic segregation in the form of discontinuity or blockage of flow did not occur during the orimet and inverted slump cone flow tests for any concrete. No aggregate pile appeared in the slump flow, and orimet and inverted slump cone flow spreads of any concrete. But minor to severe mortar halos were noticed in the periphery of the flow spread of several concretes, particularly in the presence of high RHA content. The results of visual inspection suggest that both lower W/B ratio and greater RHA content improved the dynamic segregation resistance of concrete. In contrast, the higher RHA content resulted in a lower static segregation resistance, which was overcome in the presence of viscosity-enhancing admixture (VEA). The static segregation resistance of several SCHPCs was quantitatively determined by sieve and column apparatus. The segregation index given by the sieve increased with lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content, thus indicating a reduced static segregation resistance. In contrast, the segregation factor given by the column apparatus decreased with lower W/B ratio suggesting an increased static segregation resistance. However, the segregation factor increased with higher RHA content, and thus revealed a reduction in static segregation resistance. In the presence of VEA, both segregation index and segregation factor decreased significantly, indicating an improvement in the static segregation resistance of concrete. The hardened SCHPCs were tested for compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, water absorption, total porosity and electrical resistivity. Test results revealed that the compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity and true electrical resistivity increased, whereas the water absorption and total porosity decreased with lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content. The entrained air-voids decreased the compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, water absorption and total porosity, but slightly increased the electrical resistivity of concrete. In general, the hardened properties indicated good durability of the concretes. The empirical models for the filling ability (slump flow) and compressive strength of SCHPC were derived and verified with test data from this study and other data taken from the literature. The slump flow and compressive strength computed from the models were coherent with the measured values. Both filling ability and strength models were useful to develop a mixture design method for SCHPC with and without RHA...|$|R
