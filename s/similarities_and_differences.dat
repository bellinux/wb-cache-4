5|$|The next larger scale, cell biology, {{studies the}} {{structural}} and physiological properties of cells, including their internal behavior, interactions with other cells, {{and with their}} environment. This is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels, for unicellular organisms such as bacteria, {{as well as the}} specialized cells of multicellular organisms such as humans. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.|$|E

40|$|Longstanding results {{demonstrate}} that, if {{policy choices}} are defined in spaces {{with more than}} one dimension, a majority rule equilibrium fails to exist for a very general class of smooth preference profiles. However we show here that if agents perceive political <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> <b>difference</b> in “city block ” terms, then the dimension-by-dimension median can be a majority rule equilibrium even in spaces with an arbitrarily large number of dimensions; we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such an equilibrium. This result is important because city block preferences accord more closely with empirical research on human perception than do many smooth preference profiles. The implication is that, if the already extensive empirical research findings on human perceptions of <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> <b>difference</b> extend also to perceptions of political <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> <b>difference,</b> then the possibility of equilibrium under majority rule re-emerges, with implications for both non-cooperative and cooperative models of political competition...|$|R
5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> between the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that {{this might have been}} a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{story and}} its ending have been open to much interpretation; the ending was {{purposely}} left vague and unanswered by Playdead. It {{was compared to}} other open-ended books, films and video games, where the viewer is left to interpret what they have read or seen. Some reviews suggested that the game is {{a representation of the}} religious nature of Limbo or purgatory, as the boy character completes the journey only to end at the same place he started, repeating the same journey when the player starts a new game. Another interpretation suggested the game is the boy's journey through Hell to reach Heaven, or to find closure for his sister's death. Another theory considers that either the boy or his sister or both are dead. Some theories attempted to incorporate details from the game, such as the change in setting as the boy travels through the game suggesting the progression of man from child to adult to elder, or the <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> between the final screen of the game where the boy meets a girl and the main menu where what could be human remains stand in their places.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the debate}} that {{immediately}} followed the publication of On the Origin of Species centered on the <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> between humans and modern apes. Carolus Linnaeus had been criticised in the 18th century for grouping humans and apes together as primates in his ground breaking classification system. Richard Owen vigorously defended the classification suggested by Georges Cuvier and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach that placed humans in a separate order {{from any of the}} other mammals, which by the early 19th century had become the orthodox view. On the other hand, Thomas Henry Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between humans and apes. In one famous incident, which became known as the Great Hippocampus Question, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of gorillas lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Another viewpoint was advocated by Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. They agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could account for all the differences between humans and apes, especially some aspects of the human mind.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Much of {{the hype}} around {{nanotechnology}} {{relies on the}} notion that it is novel and revolutionary. A large part of that in turn relies on the purportedly revolu-tionary ability of the Scanning Tunneling Microscope to manipulate individual at-oms. However, novelty always involves a comparison of <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> <b>difference</b> with what came before. Furthermore, the novelty of the STM was negotiated and re-negotiated from the very beginning – just as the nature of nanotechnology continues to be negotiated to this day. The history of the STM sheds light on the role of prom-ise and hype in science in general and directs our attention towards science in the public sphere. 1. The Etymology of Nano In our culture, the negotiation of novelty is commonplace. Patenting, for example, is a process to decide what counts as novel. Innovations are compared against predecessors and consequential decisions are {{made on the basis of}} <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> <b>difference.</b> The same is true of the Nobel Prizes. One might even argue that all arguments can be recast as a negotiation of <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> <b>difference...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thematically related {{concepts}} like {{coffee and}} milk are {{judged to be}} more similar than thematically unrelated concepts like coffee and lemonade. We investigated whether thematic relations exert a small effect that occurs consistently across participants (i. e., a generalized model), or a large effect that occurs inconsistently across participants (i. e., an individualized model). We also examined whether difference judgments mirrored similarity or whether these judgments were, in fact, non-inverse. Five studies demonstrated the necessity of an individualized model for both perceived <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> <b>difference,</b> <b>and</b> additionally provided evidence that thematic relations affect similarity more than difference. Results suggest that models of <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> <b>difference</b> must be attuned to large and consistent individual variability in the weighting of thematic relations. ...|$|R

40|$|Thematic {{relations}} {{are an important}} source of perceived similarity. For instance, the rowing theme of boats and oars increases their perceived similarity. The mechanism of this effect, however, has not been specified previously. We investigated whether thematic relations affect similarity by increasing commonalities or by decreasing differences. In Experiment 1, thematic relations affected similarity more than difference, thereby producing a non-inversion of <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> <b>difference.</b> Experiment 2 revealed substantial individual variability in the preference for thematic relations and, consequently in the non-inversion of ratings. In sum, the experiments demonstrated a non-inversion of <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> <b>difference</b> that was caused by thematic relations and exhibited primarily by a subgroup of participants. These results indicate that thematic relations affect perceived similarity by increasing the contribution of commonalities rather than by decreasing the contribution of differences...|$|R
