40|$|Abstract 42 {{values of}} KIC {{measured}} at- 100 oC {{are related to}} the measured values of local fracture stress σf and the fracture distance Xf by the formula: KIC = β-(N+ 1) / 2 Xf 1 / 2 [σf(1 +N) / 2 N / σy(1 -N) / 2 N]. The <b>scatters</b> <b>of</b> KIC caused by σf or Xf are assessed separately at constant values of Xf or σf. It is found that at a constant Xf the <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> KIC induced by the <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> σf accounts for only 20 % <b>of</b> the total <b>scatter,</b> while at a nearly constant σf the <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> KIC caused by the <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> Xf can reach almost 100 % <b>of</b> the total <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> KIC. It means that the effect <b>of</b> the <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> Xf on the <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> KIC is much larger than that of σf. This idea is opposite to the assumption widely accepted in local approach that the distribution of various sizes of the carbide particles which present various values of σf is the main event in the statistical calculation. Instead, the random distribution of (Xf) of weakest particles with the lowest values of σf should be considered as the determining factor in statistical assessment for the cleavage fracture...|$|R

At least 20 specimens were tested to obtain the <b>scatter</b> data <b>of</b> fatigue limit, fatigue life and tensile strength, respectively. The probability distributions of fatigue limit, fatigue life and tensile strength were evaluated by using Normal distribution and Weibull distribution function.

Therefore, it can be concluded that <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> fatigue limit is small and almost coincides with that of tensile strength, while <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> fatigue life is significantly large compared to those of fatigue limit and tensile strength. The large <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> fatigue life will be due to crack nucleation and small crack growth processes, which strongly depend on local microstructure near the crack nucleation region...|$|R

For comparison, those in rolled AM 60 B alloy and die-cast A 365 -T 5 aluminum alloy were also studied. <b>Scatter</b> behavior <b>of</b> pore size was also investigated to discuss dominant factors for fatigue life scatter in die-cast materials.

5|$|In principle, {{an atomic}} {{structure}} could be determined from applying X-ray scattering to non-crystalline samples, {{even to a}} single molecule. However, crystals offer a much stronger signal due to their periodicity. A crystalline sample is by definition periodic; a crystal is composed of many unit cells repeated indefinitely in three independent directions. Such periodic systems have a Fourier transform that is concentrated at periodically repeating points in reciprocal space known as Bragg peaks; the Bragg peaks correspond to the reflection spots observed in the diffraction image. Since the amplitude at these reflections grows linearly with the number N of scatterers, the observed intensity of these spots should grow quadratically, like N2. In other words, using a crystal concentrates the weak <b>scattering</b> <b>of</b> the individual unit cells into a much more powerful, coherent reflection that can be observed above the noise. This {{is an example of}} constructive interference.|$|E
5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and <b>scattering</b> <b>of</b> photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E
