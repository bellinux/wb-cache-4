40|$|The {{increasing}} and alarming {{trend of}} degradation and deforestation of tropical peat swamp forests may contribute greatly to climate change. Estimates of carbon (C) losses associated with land use change in tropical peatlands are needed. To assess these losses we examined C stocks and peat C fluxes in virgin peat swamp forests and tropical peatlands affected by six common types of land use. Phytomass C loss from {{the conversion of}} virgin peat swamp forest to logged forest, fire-damaged forest, mixed croplands and shrublands, rice field, oil palm plantation, and Acacia plantation were calculated using the <b>stock</b> <b>difference</b> method and estimated at 116. 9 ± 39. 8, 151. 6 ± 36. 0, 204. 1 ± 28. 6, 214. 9 ± 28. 4, 188. 1 ± 29. 8, and 191. 7 ± 28. 5 Mg C ha- 1, respectively. Total C loss from uncontrolled fires ranged from 289. 5 ± 68. 1 Mg C ha- 1 in rice fields to 436. 2 ± 77. 0 Mg C ha- 1 in virgin peat swamp forest. We assessed the effects of land use change on C stocks in the peat by looking at how the change in vegetation cover altered the main C inputs (litterfall and root mortality) and outputs (heterotrophic respiration, CH 4 flux, fires, and soluble and physical removal) before and after conversion. The difference between the soil input-output balances in the virgin peat swamp forest and in the oil palm plantation gave an estimate of peat C loss of 10. 8 ± 3. 5 Mg C ha- 1 yr- 1. Peat C loss from other land use conversions could not be assessed {{due to lack of}} data, principally on soil heterotrophic respiration rates. Over 25 years, the conversion of tropical virgin peat swamp forest into oil palm plantation represents a total C loss from both biomass and peat of 427. 2 ± 90. 7 Mg C ha- 1 or 17. 1 ± 3. 6 Mg C ha- 1 yr- 1. In all situations, peat C loss contributed more than 63 % to total C loss, demonstrating the urgent need in terms of the atmospheric greenhouse gas burden to protect tropical virgin peat swamp forests from land use change and fires...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{reduced tillage}} aims {{to combine the}} {{environmental}} benefits of organic farming and conservation tillage to increase sustainability and soil quality. In temperate climates, there is currently no knowledge about its impact on greenhouse gas emissions and only little information about soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in these management systems. We therefore monitored nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4) fluxes besides SOC stocks {{for two years in}} a grass-clover ley – winter wheat – cover crop sequence. The monitoring was undertaken in an organically managed long-term tillage trial on a clay rich soil in Switzerland. Reduced tillage (RT) was compared with ploughing (conventional tillage, CT) in interaction with two fertilisation systems, cattle slurry alone (SL) versus cattle manure compost and slurry (MC). Median N 2 O and CH 4 flux rates were 13 μg N 2 O-N m− 2 h− 1 and − 2 μg CH 4 C m− 2 h− 1, respectively, with no treatment effects. N 2 O fluxes correlated positively with nitrate contents, soil temperature, water filled pore space and dissolved organic carbon and negatively with ammonium contents in soil. Pulse emissions after tillage operations and slurry application dominated cumulative gas emissions. N 2 O emissions after tillage operations correlated with SOC contents and collinearly to microbial biomass. There was no tillage system impact on cumulative N 2 O emissions in the grass-clover (0. 8 – 0. 9 kg N 2 O-N ha− 1, 369 days) and winter wheat (2. 1 – 3. 0 kg N 2 O-N ha− 1, 296 days) cropping seasons, with a tendency towards higher emissions in MC than SL in winter wheat. Including a tillage induced peak after wheat harvest, a full two year data set showed increased cumulative N 2 O emissions in RT than CT and in MC than SL. There was no clear treatment influence on cumulative CH 4 uptake. Topsoil SOC accumulation (0 – 0. 1 m) was still ongoing. SOC stocks were more stratified in RT than CT and in MC than SL. Total SOC stocks (0 – 0. 5 m) were higher in RT than CT in SL and similar in MC. Maximum relative SOC <b>stock</b> <b>difference</b> accounted for + 8. 1 Mg C ha− 1 in RT-MC compared to CT-SL after 13 years which dominated over the relative increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

The properties of substrate specificity and independent variation of particular isozymes permit the ordering of the <b>differences</b> observed among <b>stocks.</b> <b>Differences</b> can arise from several sources: bacterial variation, intrasyngenic variation, and intersyngenic variation.

Unlike the situation found in Tetra-hymena pyriformis, major intrasyngenie variations are rare in P. aurelia except in syngen 2. This lack of intrasyngenie variation is significant in view of the wide differences in geographic origin and micronuclear chromosome numbers among stocks within a syngen. It suggests that certain esterase genotypes must be under stringent selection within a syngen. The lack of intrasyngenic variation permits assessment ofintersyngenic relationships. Syngens differ in a complex way from each other, suggesting that several gene differences may be involved. The syngens can be classified {{on the basis of their}} esterases. Syngens which have been shown to be more closely related in terms of cross-mating, breeding systems, and other criteria tend to be more similar in their esterase isozymes.

40|$|Strain {{differences}} {{make the}} development of new anxiolytics more difficult. Conflicting effects of serotonergic drugs were observed, even when identical animal tests were used. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate in more detail the influence of strain or <b>stock</b> <b>differences</b> on the baseline anxiety related behaviour of rats. The effects different anxiety levels have on the application of various anxiolytics and the differences between strains and stocks in the metabolism of these anxiolytics were investigated. Furthermore, the question of whether there are differences in the central serotonergic (5 -HT) system was explored, because 5 -HT plays a major role in the creation of anxiety disorders. To get an overall picture of the influence of breeding conditions on anxiety related behaviour of rats, three stocks of Fischer rats (Winkelmann, Schönwalde and Charles River) bred in our animal unit, were compared to Fischer rats received directly from the same breeders. For these experiments the elevated plus maze-, black and white box- and modified open field-test were chosen. The results show that breeding conditions really influence the anxiety related behaviour of rats. Raised under our breeding conditions, Fischer/Schönwalde rats became less anxious, whereas Fischer/Winkelmann rats became more anxious compared to the directly received animals. The pharmacological investigations were carried out on two different Wistar stocks (Winkelmann and BgVV) and one Fischer strain from Winkelmann. For the experiments the same animal models were used as described above. The anxiolytic substances, diazepam, 8 ?OH-DPAT and ritanserin, were chosen. In all animal models the Wistar/Winkelmann rats proved to be less anxious than the Fischer/Winkelmann and Wistar/BgVV rats. Whereas Wistar/BgVV and Fischer/Winkelmann rats behaved in a similar fashion. Diazepam had an anxiolytic effect even in low doses on the more anxious Fischer/Winkelmann rats. In comparison, diazepam could not produce an anxiolytic effect on the less anxious Wistar/Winkelmann rats. With the more anxious Wistar/BgVV rats diazepam had a tendency for an anxiolysis. In all animal tests 8 -OH-DPAT had no effect on the anxiety related behaviour of all groups of rats. Also ritanserin, which was examined only in the elevated plus maze-test, was ineffective. In another experiment the blood plasma concentrations of diazepam and three of its metabolites, n?desmethyldiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam, were measured at the time the behavioural tests took place. The concentrations of these four substances were significantly higher in the Fischer/Winkelmann rats in comparison to both Wistar stocks. There were no differences between the two stocks of Wistar rats. N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam were equally abundant in the Fischer/Winkelmann rats, whereas in both stocks of Wistar rats temazepam was proportional lower. Finally, the levels of 5 -HT were measured in the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus and in the median/dorsal raphe. In the more anxious Fischer/Winkelmann rats, the level of 5 -HT was significantly higher in the prefrontal cortex as well as in the hippocampus compared to both Wistar stocks. The levels of 5 -HT in the hippocampus and the median/dorsal raphe were higher in the Wistar/BgVV rats than in the Wistar/Winkelmann rats. The application of 2, 0 mg/kg diazepam i. p. had a different effect on the central levels of serotonin. Whereas diazepam produced a significant decrease of the serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus in the more anxious Fischer/Winkelmann and Wistar/BgVV rats, there was shown to be only a small reduction in the hippocampus in the less anxious Wistar/Winkelmann rats. The level in the raphe nuclei was not influenced in any of the three groups tested by the application of diazepam. In sum, these results show that there is a large impact of breeding conditions as well as strain and <b>stock</b> <b>differences</b> on anxiety related behaviour. Moreover, differences in the baseline behaviour might have an influence on the effects of pharmacotherapeutics. Additionally, it appears that the different effects of diazepam can be traced back to a different metabolism. Differences in the central serotonergic system seem to reflect a difference in the anxiety related behaviour of the examined rat strains and stocks. Also, the effect of diazepam on the central 5 -HT system seems to depend on the rat strain being used. Therefore, strain and <b>stock</b> <b>differences</b> should be taken into consideration in future investigations and it is recommended to cite exactly in the description of a method the source of the animals. <br...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Three {{abundant}} small {{pelagic fish}} species co-occur in the Benguela upwelling ecosystem off southern Africa: sardine (Sardinops sagax), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and round herring (Etrumeus whiteheadi). It is hypothesised that populations {{of these species}} have a complex structure that reflects the complexity of their varying habitats. On {{the basis of the}} locality and timing of spawning, and morphological, meristic and parasite studies, it has been proposed that there are separate stocks of sardine in South African waters west and east of Cape Agulhas. Consequently, new operational procedures for managing the fishery are based on the premise of two such stocks, termed the west and south coast stocks respectively. In this study, it is hypothesized that the factors causing purported <b>stock</b> <b>differences</b> in sardine should also apply to anchovy and redeye. Three different approaches were used to further test the multi-stock hypothesis for sardine in southern Africa and to provide new information for understanding possible <b>stock</b> <b>differences</b> in anchovy and round herring. The population structure of sardine was investigated through studies on samples taken from the Cape west and south coasts as well as from Namibia and KwaZulu-Natal. Two dimensionless otolith shape indices, otolith elemental signatures, seven microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial DNA marker, ND 2, were used to supplement existing information on sardine. Otolith shape, while influenced by fish length and season of capture, distinguished the east coast samples from those taken elsewhere, while the otolith elemental signatures indicated differentiation among sites on a small scale and between samples taken from the west and south coast for certain elements. Both genetic indicators showed high levels of genetic diversity and variation among individuals. There were some genetic differences among sites within a single year, but overall the results suggest that the South African sardine population is well mixed, with weak evidence of genetic patchiness that is not temporally stable. This genetic pattern is evidence of sweepstake recruitment. For anchovy, two spawning locations have been identified in South African waters, but there have been no previous investigations into stock structure. The current study aimed to apply different methods to anchovy samples to determine their usefulness for differentiating population structure,. An analysis of otolith shape revealed that it was primarily influenced by the length of the fish, with no differentiation among sites, whereas an investigation into genetic differentiation using five microsatellite markers revealed high levels of genetic diversity and differentiation among sites. Since there were relatively few samples for a study of this sort, further work is recommended to investigate stock structure in South African anchovy. For round herring, only otolith shape was analysed to test for stock structure. Otolith shape was found to be primarily related to the length of the fish (as in anchovy) and sex, but no significant difference was found between coasts. There were different magnitudes of variability in the results for the three species using different methods. It is likely that the complex, variable environment causes complex patterns of mixing and micro-structuring within all three species, linked to their different niches...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Juvenile {{coho salmon}} (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri) of {{different}} stocks and three transferrin genotypes (AA, AC, and CC), all reared in identical or similar environments, were experimentally {{infected with the}} causative agent of bacterial kidney disease (BKD) or Vibrio anguillarum. Mortality due to the pathogens was compared among stocks within a species and among transferrin genotypes within a stock {{to determine if there}} was a genetic basis for resistance to disease among stocks and transferrin genotypes. Differences in resistance to BKD among coho salmon stocks have a genetic basis. Stock susceptibility to vibriosis is strongly influenced by environmental factors. Coho salmon or steelhead trout of one stock may be resistant to one disease but susceptible to another. The importance of transferrin genotype of coho salmon in resistance to BKD is stock-specific; in those stocks which showed differential resistance of genotypes the AA was the most susceptible. No differences in resistance to vibriosis among transferrin genotypes were observed. To further verify that <b>stock</b> <b>differences,</b> both genetic and environmental, did exist, vertebral and lateral series scale numbers were compared among four steelhead trout stocks (Alsea, Siletz, Rogue, and North Santiam) reared in a common environment and at the hatchery of their origin. The four stocks are genetically different from each other with respect to vertebral and scale number in almost all cases. Differences between steelhead trout of the same stock reared at two localities were significant for vertebral but not scale number. Not all meristic <b>differences</b> between hatchery-reared <b>stocks</b> were significant...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the long-term effects}} of S&P 500 index additions and deletions on a sample of stocks from 1962 to 2003 and find a significant long-term price increase for both added and deleted stocks, with deleted stocks outperforming added stocks. The long-term price increase for added stocks can be attributed to increases in institutional ownership, liquidity, and analyst coverage, and a decrease in the shadow cost in the long-term. However, while deletion has no significant effect on analyst coverage and shadow cost, we find a rebound in the institutional ownership and liquidity of deleted <b>stocks.</b> The <b>difference</b> in the long-term price increase of added and deleted stocks can be explained by analyst coverage and operating performance. © 2013...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{empirical}} stock control performance of intermittent demand estimation procedures. The forecasting methods considered are the simple moving average, single exponential smoothing, Croston's method and a new method recently developed by the authors of this paper. We first discuss the nature of the empirical demand data set (3000 stock keeping units) and we specify the stock control model to be used for experimentation purposes. Performance measures are then selected to report customer service level and <b>stock</b> volume <b>differences.</b> The out-of-sample empirical comparison results demonstrate the superior stock control performance of the new intermittent demand forecasting method and enable insights to be gained into the empirical utility of the other estimators...|$|R

In {{the past two years}} most Japanese and U. S. institutional investors have had expectations for a reversal of trends in the stock market, and advised an investing strategy that depended on getting out of (or in to) the market before an anticipated market turnaround. These results, obtained from a number of questionnaire surveys in 1989 and 1990, help explain the relative lack of portfolio diversification across countries and show the short-term nature of speculative behavior. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{comply with}} the demands of the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized {{countries}} must reliably estimate the stored carbon (C) in different pools of forest ecosystems. The main objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the biomass, C and nutrients stocks in the forest floor, understory, downed dead wood (DDW) and mineral soil of even-aged maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) stands from three contrasting regions of Portugal. Assessing the specific contribution of DDW to the C and nutrients stocks and how C concentration in the plant material differs from 0. 50, the reference value used in many practical applications, were also objectives of this research. Biomass content of forest floor was determined by a quadrat method. Sampling units of 1 m 2 were used for the understory. The line intersection method was adopted for sampling DDW and the mineral soil was sampled at three depths. Concentrations of C and nutrients were obtained by chemical analysis of samples from soil and milled plant material. Biomass and C in the trees were obtained using published equations. Total C stocks ranged between 100. 6 Mg ha– 1 and 308. 6 Mg ha– 1. Mineral soil shared up to 70 - 74 % of global stored C, being the main cause of the global C <b>stock</b> <b>differences</b> among regions. Phosphorous and potassium were at low to very low levels in the mineral soil and plant material. The contribution of DDW to the C and nutrients pools was negligible. The percentage of C in the plant material ranged between 52 % and 54 %. Key words: carbon pools; stocks; biomass; nutrients; maritime pine...|$|R
40|$|The horse {{mackerel}} (Trachurus trachurus) fishery of the Northeast Atlantic, is currently subject to assessment and {{management in the}} ICES area. Assessment of the Southern {{horse mackerel}} (ICES Divisions VIIIc and IXa) is made with Virtual Population Analysis (VPA), using time series of catch-at-age data and catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) from 1985 to present. The application of biomass-dynamic models to the assessment and catch prediction of this stock has never been attempted before. In this paper, a production model {{is applied to the}} Southern horse mackerel stock. To quantify uncertainty in parameter estimates, bootstrap confidence intervals were computed, which showed that estimates could be considered as reliable. The bootstrap standard deviations of Ft, r, MSY and FMSY were relatively small, despite the lack of trends in the available effort series. On the contrary, the catchability, q, showed a coefficient of variation of 74 %. The current level of fishing mortality for 1998 was considered as unsustainable for the resource, being well above FMSY according to the biomass-dynamic models, and above Fpa according to the age-structured model. Both models were in close agreement on the time series of fishing mortality and in the perception {{of the state of the}} <b>stock.</b> <b>Differences</b> existed in the changes in stock biomass especially over the last years. Over this time period the age-structured model showed an increasing trend in biomass. The estimates of MSY and FMSY were in accordance with the precautionary approach philosophy. The biomass-dynamic model used here was usefully applied to the Southern horse mackerel stock, giving complementary information to the age-structured model, both in the perception of the state of the stock and in the definition of management targets...|$|R
