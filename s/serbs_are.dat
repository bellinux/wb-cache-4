5|$|Designed with a V-shaped top in {{the form}} of an {{overturned}} chaika, the šajkača is narrow and typically black or grey in colour. It is usually made of soft, homemade cloth and is worn without any symbols during peacetime. During times of war, cockades featuring the Serbian double-headed eagle and the motto Only Unity Saves the <b>Serbs</b> <b>are</b> often seen on the cap. The šajkača worn by Serbian soldiers during World War I had a non-reflecting peak and was topped with a royal monogram.|$|E
5|$|After the Croatian Democratic Union won 1990 {{parliamentary}} {{elections in the}} Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs within the Republic worsened. The ethnic groups are also divided along religious lines as the Croats are Catholics while the <b>Serbs</b> <b>are</b> Orthodox Christians. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana - TO) forces to minimize resistance. On 17 August, tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, {{and parts of the}} Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. This revolt was followed in January 1991, by two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces.|$|E

5000|$|During the World War II, Bosnian <b>Serbs</b> <b>were</b> {{put under}} the rule of the fascist Ustaša regime in the Independent State of Croatia. Under Ustaša rule Serbs along with Jews and Roma people, were {{subjected}} to systematic genocide where hundreds of thousands of civilian <b>Serbs</b> <b>were</b> murdered. According to the US Holocaust Museum, 320,000-340,000 <b>Serbs</b> <b>were</b> murdered under Ustasha rule. [...] According to Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum and Research Center,"More than 500,000 <b>Serbs</b> <b>were</b> murdered in horribly sadistic ways, 250,000 were expelled, and another 200,000 were forced to convert" [...] during WWII in the Independent State of Croatia (modern-day Croatia and Bosnia).|$|R
50|$|Many historians {{describe}} the Ustasha regime’s mass killings of Serbs as meeting {{the definition of}} genocide. Some racist laws, brought from Germany, in addition to Jews and Roma, were applied to the Serbs. Vladimir Žerjavić estimates that 322,000 <b>Serbs</b> <b>were</b> killed in the Independent State of Croatia, {{out of a total}} population of 1.8 million Serbs. Thus one in six <b>Serbs</b> <b>were</b> killed, which represents the highest percentage killed in Europe, after the Jews and Roma. Of these Žerjavić estimates that about 78,000 <b>Serbs</b> <b>were</b> killed at Jasenovac and other Ustasha camps. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., between 320,000 and 340,000 <b>Serbs</b> <b>were</b> killed in the NDH.|$|R

25|$|According to the constitution, {{imposed by}} High Representative Paddy Ashdown on January 28, 2004 after local {{politicians}} {{failed to reach}} an agreement, the mayor of Mostar has to be elected by the city council with ⅔ majority. Ashdown abolished the six municipalities that were divided equally among Bosniaks and Croats {{and replaced them with}} six electoral units, ridding Mostar of duplicate institutions and costs. In the process Ashdown also reduced the number of elected officials from 194 to 35. According to the constitution the constitutive nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosniaks, Croats, and <b>Serbs)</b> <b>are</b> guaranteed a minimum of four seats and a maximum of 15 seats. 18 deputies are elected by the election units: 3 deputies from each district and 15 deputies are elected at the level of entire city. This move was opposed by the Party for Democratic Action (SDA) and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).|$|E
500|$|According {{to the top}} French {{officers}} {{involved in}} the operation, the action on Vrbanja Bridge showed the VRS that UNPROFOR's attitude had changed. Following the battle, VRS forces were observed to {{be less likely to}} engage French UN peacekeepers deployed in the city. Lieutenant Colonel Erik Roussel, an officer from FREBAT4 who had participated in the operation, stated later that [...] "since the incident, the <b>Serbs</b> <b>are</b> strangely quiet towards us." [...] A memorial to the French soldiers killed in action was unveiled on 5 April 1996, along with a plaque commemorating Dilberović and Sučić. That day, the bridge was renamed in memory of the two women.|$|E
500|$|For {{other nations}} in Yugoslavia, the {{prospect}} {{of war and the}} government's close ties to the Serbian Orthodox Church was not at all appealing. Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac, president of the Roman Catholic Conference of Bishops of Yugoslavia, bitterly wrote in his diary that, [...] "All in all, Croats and <b>Serbs</b> <b>are</b> of two worlds... that will never move closer to one another without an act of God". He also wrote, [...] "The Schism [...] is the greatest curse in Europe, almost greater than Protestantism. There is no morality, no principle, there is no truth, no justice, no honesty [...]" [...] On the same day, he publicly called on the Catholic clergy to pray for King Peter and that Croatia and Yugoslavia would be spared a war.|$|E

500|$|The {{operation}} was coordinated with Germans and NDH armed forces located near northern Partisan {{territory in the}} direction of Banja Luka. The Chetniks arrived by trains from Dubrovnik and Metković and by Italian trucks from Nevesinje. On 2–3 October they arrived in Mostar and left on 3 October. The same day, they killed one villager and committed mass looting in the village of Raška Gora, [...] north of Mostar. In the village of Gorani, [...] southwest of Mostar, three villagers were killed and, as elsewhere, they carried out looting and burning. The next day they were in Drežnica where Jevđević gave a speech that [...] "the chief enemy of <b>Serbs</b> <b>are</b> the Partisans, then the Ustaše. They need to be ruthlessly destroyed and the other left alone". Subsequently the Chetniks killed between 62 and 142 people, looted, and carried out burnings in the town.|$|E
500|$|Xhinovci {{is unable}} to return to Germany because of his appearance, as the country has a series of laws which {{prohibit}} Nazi symbols, uniforms, slogans and forms of greeting. He has expressed a great dislike of Serbs, and says {{that he would have}} to carry a concealed handgun every time he wished to visit the Serb-held section of Mitrovica. Xhinovci says that he is greatly disappointed with post-war Kosovo, as he believed that reconciliation between Albanians and Serbs would have occurred after the conflict. When asked if it was difficult to portray Hitler, Xhinovci responded: [...] "It is easy. I find myself in Hitler's character because he fought against my enemy. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Yes, <b>Serbs</b> <b>are</b> my enemies." [...] About his physical similarity to Hitler, he says: [...] "I am not a dictator like him, but it is of great financial benefit that I resemble him." ...|$|E
500|$|Pavelić and his {{followers}} intended to create an [...] "ethnically pure" [...] Croatia through the mass murder and deportation of Serbs, Jews and other non-Croats. Only about {{fifty percent of the}} NDH's 6.2 million inhabitants were Croat. Nearly two million Serbs, about one-third of the NDH's total population, now found themselves within the borders of the newly formed state. In addition, Serb-majority areas covered between 60 and 70 percent of the NDH's total landmass. [...] "The Croatian state cannot exist if 1.8 million <b>Serbs</b> <b>are</b> living in it and if we have a powerful Serbian state at our backs," [...] Croatia's future Foreign Minister Mladen Lorković explained. [...] "Therefore, we are trying to make the Serbs disappear from our regions." [...] Dido Kvaternik, a senior Ustaše official, was entrusted with [...] "cleansing" [...] Bjelovar and its surroundings. The younger Kvaternik recalled: [...] "When we triumphantly returned home from abroad and when Pavelić decided that I should take over the implementation of the measures against Serbs and Jews, I obeyed immediately and without hesitation because I knew that this question had to be resolved {{for the future of the}} Croatian people and state, and that someone had to make the sacrifice so that these odious but necessary measures could be carried out." [...] Pavelić's orders for the extermination of non-Croats in and around Bjelovar were likely delivered orally to ensure that no written evidence remained.|$|E
