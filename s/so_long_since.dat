25|$|The delays {{became so}} great that even ABC mocked the {{lateness}} with an ad campaign showing network executives waiting impatiently {{for the arrival of}} new episodes at ABC's corporate headquarters. One episode featured television critic Jeff Jarvis in an introduction, sarcastically reminding viewers {{what was going on with}} the show's plot since it had been <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> the last new episode.|$|E
500|$|Charles Rosen, who unraveled {{this unique}} {{borrowing}} of a Beethovenian structure in Schubert's A major Sonata, has {{also referred to}} Schubert's departure from the former's style in this instance: [...] "Schubert moves with great ease within the form which Beethoven created. He has, however, considerably loosened what held it together, and stretched its ligaments unmercifully... the correspondence of part to whole has been considerably altered by Schubert, and explains why his large movements often seem <b>so</b> <b>long,</b> <b>since</b> they are being produced with forms originally intended for shorter pieces. Some of the excitement naturally goes out of these forms when they are so extended, but this is even a condition of the unforced melodic flow of Schubert's music". Rosen adds, however, that [...] "with the finale of the A major Sonata Schubert produced a work that is unquestionably greater than its model".|$|E
500|$|Producer Jan Harlan {{stated that}} Kubrick [...] "would have applauded" [...] the final film, while Kubrick's widow Christiane also enjoyed A.I. Brian Aldiss admired {{the film as}} well: [...] "I thought what an inventive, intriguing, ingenious, {{involving}} film this was. There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I wrote it." [...] Of the film's ending, he wondered how {{it might have been}} had Kubrick directed the film: [...] "That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers." [...] Richard Corliss heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, saying that it was [...] "wonderful and maddening." [...] Leonard Maltin, on the other hand, gives the film two stars out of four in his Movie Guide, writing: [...] " [...] intriguing story draws us in, thanks in part to Osment's exceptional performance, but takes several wrong turns; ultimately, it just doesn't work. Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story 'Super Toys Last All Summer Long'; [...] result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities." [...] However, he calls John Williams' music score [...] "striking". Jonathan Rosenbaum compared A.I. to Solaris (1972), and praised both [...] "Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick's intentions while making it a profoundly personal work." [...] Film critic Armond White, of the New York Press, praised the film noting that [...] "each part of David’s journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema’s most thoughtful, speculative artists– Borzage, Ozu, Demy, Tarkovsky." [...] Filmmaker Billy Wilder hailed A.I. as [...] "the most underrated film of the past few years." [...] When British filmmaker Ken Russell saw the film, he wept during the ending.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 November 2008, {{two days}} after Barack Obama was elected the first black US President, Berlusconi {{referred}} to Obama as [...] "young, handsome and even tanned": On 26 March 2009 he said [...] "I'm paler , because it's been <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I went sunbathing.

60|$|Many half-forgotten {{emotions}} were awakened in the sister's mind by this visit. It was <b>so</b> very <b>long</b> <b>since</b> any other visitor had crossed their threshold; it was <b>so</b> very <b>long</b> <b>since</b> any voice of apathy had made sad music in her ears; that the stranger's figure remained present to her, hours afterwards, {{when she sat}} at the window, plying her needle; and his words seemed newly spoken, again and again. He had touched the spring that opened her whole life; and if she lost him for a short space, it was only among the many shapes of the one great recollection of which that life was made.|$|R

My sincere desire is that the world may be benefited by this plain and simple statement of the truth.” ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment with a little laugh. [...] "I expect I'm talking nonsense, and it's really not <b>so</b> very <b>long</b> <b>since</b> that kind of thing used to appeal to me.

50|$|The {{existence}} of XU was not {{revealed to the}} general public until around 1980, when the Norwegian government decided to decorate some of the XU members.

40|$|For {{almost a}} century Muhammadiyah has poured its devotion {{for the people of}} this nation in various fields.
