40|$|This {{packet of}} {{resources}} {{has been designed}} primarily to aid universities, colleges, and other institutions with Geographic Information System (GIS) expertise and equipment in reaching out to their local schools {{in an effort to}} increase teacher and student awareness of this high-growth technology and its spatial analysis core. The method presented in these materials is a one week workshop at the institution in which teachers are brought in for a GIS immersion including a GIS short course and other GIS activities. Once teachers have gained this experience, they can apply it in their teaching. They can utilize their new partnership with the key individuals at the institution as a source of support. In addition to activities involving the institution, the teacher can also begin to independently use GIS software and instructional materials in their courses. Since this packet contains a variety of elements focused on the use of GIS concepts and software in the secondary school classroom, it also is an appropriate resource for secondary school teachers and others who are attempting to implement GIS activities at this educational level. Some of the materials might even appeal to college level educators.

40|$|Abstract: The growing {{scarcity}} of potable water supplies {{is among the}} most important issues facing many cities, in particular those using single sources of water that are climate dependent. Consequently, urban centers are looking to alternative sources of water supply that can supplement variable rainfall and meet the demands of population growth. A diversified portfolio of water sources is required to ensure public health, as well as social, economical and environmental sustainability. One of the options considered is the augmentation of drinking water supplies with advanced treated recycled water. This paper aims to provide a state of the art review of water recycling for drinking purposes with emphasis on membrane treatment processes. An overview of significant indirect potable reuse projects is presented followed by a description of the epidemiological and toxicological studies evaluating any potential human health impacts.

40|$|Introduction to PRML Detection System Recently, {{researchers}} from IBM laboratories reported {{the results of}} an experiment demonstrating that an areal density of 1 gigabit per square inch could be achieved for the storage and reliable retrieval of digital data on a hard disk system. This many-fold increase in density was achieved using a number of advanced techniques. one of these techniques was a different approach to combating intersymbol interference, sometimes referred to as PRML, using partial-response (PR) signaling with maximum-likelihood (ML) sequence detection. Instead of keeping the transitions far apart using (d,k) codes, PRML allows the transitions to be close together, and the read signal, with its resulting intersymbol interference, is equalized to a frequency response known as a class 4 partial-response channel. The equalized signal is then detected by a maximum likelihood sequence estimator, i. e., a Viterbi detector. In this chapter, we will give a brief <b>summary</b> <b>o...</b>|$|E

We are addressing different questions and problems that arise when using this calculus.

Finally, we also address cognitive issues, i. e., is the calculus cognitively adequate. 1 Introduction When describing a spatial configuration or when reasoning about such a configuration, often it is not possible or desirable to obtain precise, quantitative data. In these cases, qualitative reasoning about spatial configurations may be used. Different aspects of space can be treated in a qualitative way.

40|$|The {{effects of}} N 2 O {{nitridation}} and subsequent annealing in different conditions on thermally oxidized n-type 6 H–silicon carbide (SiC) metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) interface properties were investigated. Influence of high-field {{stress on the}} MOS system was also studied. The nitrided device annealed in dry or wet O 2 is found to have lower interface-state density compared to the device annealed in N 2 because the reoxidation can reduce nitridation-induced interface damage. Furthermore, significantly less shift of flatband voltage during high-field stress for all nitrided devices indicates much better oxide reliability by replacing strained Si–O bonds with stronger Si–N bonds during nitridation. This is further supported {{by the fact that}} annealing of the nitrided device in dry or wet oxygen slightly reduces the robustness of the oxide.

30|$|In <b>summary,</b> NiFe 2 <b>O</b> 4 NPs were {{obtained}} using the sol–gel method, and the magnetic properties of NiFe 2 O 4 NPs regularly {{change with the}} sintering temperature. Notably, NiFe 2 O 4 NPs exhibit magnetic resonance in the GHz range. Through {{the study of the}} surface composition, the presence of oxygen defects, which can destroy the superexchange interaction, in the surface can be deduced. The strong surface anisotropy field for NiFe 2 O 4 NPs has an effect on the core of particles, and this leads to a strong effective anisotropy field, thereby generating high-frequency magnetic resonance for NiFe 2 O 4. ESR spectra measured at room temperature further confirm that surface magnetism plays a great role.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive survey on global routing research over {{about the last}} two decades, {{with an emphasis on}} the problems of simultaneously routing multiple nets in VLSI circuits under various design styles. The survey begins with a coverage of traditional approaches such as sequential routing and rip-up-and-reroute, and then discusses multicommodity flow based methods, which have attracted a good deal of attention recently. The family of hierarchical routing techniques and several of its variants are then overviewed, in addition to other techniques such as move-based heuristics and iterative deletion. While many traditional techniques focus on the conventional ob-jective of managing congestion, newer objectives have come into play with the advances in VLSI technology. Specifically, the focus of global routing has shifted so {{that it is important to}} augment the congestion objective with metrics for timing and crosstalk. In the later part of this paper, we summarize the recent progress in these directions. Finally, the survey concludes with a <b>summary</b> <b>o...</b>|$|E
40|$|Can music {{play a role}} in {{positive}} conflict transformation? Having developed a theoretical basis from a previous examination of the contrasting musical conflict transformation projects of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra and Hip Hop, I have collected data on an inter-religious choir in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina with an explicit conflict transformation remit. Data was collected using ethnographic interviews and participant/observations with fifteen of the choristers in an attempt to answer this question. There was no direct access to audience data and any references to audience reception are from the choir members ’ points of view. This detail highlights the issue of application of cultural findings within the choir to the wider social context. For the purposes of this paper therefore any discussions of wider social context are assumed to be mediated through the choristers themselves as members of the choir and the larger Sarajevo and Bosnian society.

A recent report on an international workshop on the role of HLA B 27 in spondyloarthritis summarizes three leading theories as to why HLA B 27 predisposes to inflammation: a) HLA B 27 presents a distinct peptide repertoire and thus has a direct effect on the immune response as would be expected by an MHC molecule; b) HLA B 27 misfolds and activates a series of intracellular events known as the unfolded protein response; c) HLA B 27 forms a dimer on the cell surface and this serves as a target for NK cells. 3.
