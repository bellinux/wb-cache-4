5|$|A luncheon at the U.S.Capitol {{has been}} part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the {{outgoing}} President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and pheasant entrees with Pinot noir wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon sponge cake with <b>sweet</b> <b>cream</b> glacé. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was Thomas Hill's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley, a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.|$|E

25|$|Dairy {{products}} are often pasteurized during production to kill pathogenic bacteria and other microbes. Butter made from pasteurized fresh cream is called <b>sweet</b> <b>cream</b> butter. Production of <b>sweet</b> <b>cream</b> butter first became {{common in the}} 19th century, {{with the development of}} refrigeration and the mechanical cream separator. Butter made from fresh or cultured unpasteurized cream is called raw cream butter. While butter made from pasteurized cream may keep for several months, raw cream butter has a shelf life of roughly ten days.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{continental}} Europe, cultured {{butter is}} preferred, while <b>sweet</b> <b>cream</b> butter dominates in the United States and the United Kingdom. Cultured butter is sometimes labeled [...] "European-style" [...] butter in the United States, although cultured butter is made and sold by some, especially Amish, dairies. Commercial raw cream butter is virtually unheard-of in the United States. Raw cream butter is generally only found made {{at home by}} consumers who have purchased raw whole milk directly from dairy farmers, skimmed the cream themselves, and made butter with it. It is rare in Europe as well.|$|E
2500|$|Lore Alford Rogers (7 February 1875 - 21 March 1975) was an American {{bacteriologist}} {{and dairy}} scientist. He {{is credited with}} discovering that butter made from pasteurized <b>sweet</b> <b>cream</b> over sour ripened cream remained fresher, while suggesting that surplus milk could be sold as concentrated sour milk products. [...] He [...] refined the steps for the manufacture of high quality Swiss cheese and, new to the United States, production of Roquefort cheese. He was instrumental in finding ways to discourage fungal growth in sweetened condensed milk and preventing losses in evaporated milk from heat coagulation. [...] His pioneering work on freeze drying bacterial cultures had immediate applications in World War I. As Chief of the Research Laboratories of the Bureau of Dairy Industry, USDA for nearly four decades, [...] Rogers was praised for a leadership style that allowed the [...] "creativity of others" [...] to be [...] "developed and expressed." [...] In retirement he gave {{back to his own}} community by co-founding the Patten Lumbermen's Museum.|$|E

6000|$|Duncan Dhu made {{haste to}} bring out the pair of pipes that was his {{principal}} possession, and to set before his guests a mutton-ham and a bottle of that drink which they call Athole brose, and which is made of old whiskey, strained honey and <b>sweet</b> <b>cream,</b> slowly beaten together in the right order and proportion. The two enemies were still on the very breach of a quarrel; but down they sat, one upon each side of the peat fire, with a mighty show of politeness. Maclaren pressed them to taste his mutton-ham and [...] "the wife's brose," [...] reminding them the wife was out of Athole and had a name far and wide for her skill in that confection.

6000|$|Before {{leaving the}} subject of fairy superstition in England we may remark that it was of a more playful and gentle, less wild and necromantic character, than that {{received}} among the sister people. The amusements of the southern fairies were light and sportive; their resentments were satisfied with pinching or scratching the objects of their displeasure; their peculiar sense of cleanliness rewarded the housewives with the silver token in the shoe; their nicety was extreme concerning any coarseness or negligence which could offend their delicacy; and I cannot discern, except, perhaps, from the insinuations of some scrupulous divines, that they were vassals to or in close alliance with the infernals, as {{there is too much}} reason to believe was the case with their North British sisterhood.[45] The common nursery story cannot be forgotten, how, shortly after the death of what is called a nice tidy housewife, the Elfin band was shocked to see that a person of different character, with whom the widower had filled his deserted arms, instead of the nicely arranged little loaf of the whitest bread, and a basin of <b>sweet</b> <b>cream,</b> duly placed for their refreshment by the deceased, had substituted a brown loaf and a cobb of herrings. Incensed at such a coarse regale, the elves dragged the peccant housewife out of bed, and pulled her down the wooden stairs by the heels, repeating, at the same time, in scorn of her churlish hospitality-- ...|$|E
