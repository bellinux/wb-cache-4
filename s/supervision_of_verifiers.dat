Recently, Zhang et al. proposed a new multisignature scheme for specified group <b>of</b> <b>verifiers.</b> However, we find that Zhang et al. ’s scheme cannot prevent a dishonest clerk of signing group from changing the signing message to another message of his choice while he is cooperating with the signers to produce a multisignature.

40|$|Independent {{verification}} is {{an important}} aspect of practice for ensuring the credibility of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). However, the independence <b>of</b> <b>verifiers</b> such as checkers, auditors, and Environmental Control Officers, may be influenced by various factors that may lead to a conflict of interest between role-players in EIA and EIA followup. Identifying these factors is, therefore, important. A total of 18 factors were identified by analysing literature from established verification professions and data derived within the South African context by means of interviews and workshops dedicated to clarifying independence <b>of</b> <b>verifiers.</b> The factors were divided into five categories: financial; commercial; professional; personal; and other. By shedding light on factors that influence the independence <b>of</b> EIA followup <b>verifiers,</b> this research aids in anticipating and avoiding potential conflicts of interest. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Supervision {{in school}} often {{discussed}} about the negative opinion of teachers because misunderstanding {{about the process}} and the concept <b>of</b> <b>supervision.</b> Thus, this descriptive study was conducted through a questionnaire survey on three schools in the Zone City Muar Johor. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the teachers’ opinions towards <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction that has been implemented at schools, identify the practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction carried out at school, identify whether there is a difference teachers’ opinion towards <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on demographic factors (gender, race and experience teaching), identify whether there is a difference practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on demographic factors (gender, race and experience teaching) and determine whether there is a significant relationship between opinion for the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction with practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction. The study sample involved 120 teachers from schools in SJK (C) Zone City Muar Johor. Questionnaires modified from previous studies were used as an instrument. The data were analyzed using SPSS and the results of the analysis were reported in the form of descriptive statistics. The reliability of the instrument using Cronbach Alpha was 0. 644 for part B and 0. 797 for part C. The results showed that teachers had a positive opinion for the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction and practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction was at a high level, the study showed no difference of opinion about the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on gender and race, and found a difference of opinion about the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on experience teaching. The findings showed there was no significant difference in teachers' opinions about practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on gender, race and experience teaching. Finally, this study proves that there was a positive and strong relationship between the opinion for the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction with practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction...|$|R
