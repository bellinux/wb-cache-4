25|$|When {{it came to}} the Ford Motor Company's hapless Edsel, Brooks {{revealed}} in his two-part series in The New Yorker that the Dearborn-based eponymous auto company had introduced the new model without much research.

Nonetheless, compression of the seat is observed and is explained in the accelerating frame (and in an inertial frame) by the force of acceleration on the seat from the car on one side, and the opposing force of reaction to acceleration by the passenger on the other. Identification of the accelerating frame as non-inertial cannot be based <b>simply</b> <b>on</b> the compression of the seat, which all observers can explain; rather {{it is based on the}} simplicity of the physical explanation for this compression.|$|E

She also dismissed claims that her candidacy was her family's revenge against her father's loss in 2004, saying that all she wants to do is serve should she be elected to the Senate. A day after the election, Poe was announced as among the winners with her having the highest number of votes. She was officially proclaimed a senator by the COMELEC board on May 2013, along with fellow Team PNoy candidates Chiz Escudero, Sonny Angara, Alan Peter Cayetano, and Loren Legarda, as well United Nationalist Alliance candidate Nancy Binay (who did not attend, opting instead to send her lawyer to represent her).|$|E

25|$|The {{observational}} method applied to consciousness {{gives us the}} science of psychology. This is the basis and the only proper basis of ontology or metaphysics, the science of being, and of the philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction as the complement of his method, by which he means inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness, and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness, those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off very clearly, {{on the one hand}} from the deductive construction of notions of an absolute system, as represented either by Schelling or Hegel, which Cousin regards as based <b>simply</b> <b>on</b> hypothesis and abstraction, illegitimately obtained; and on the other, from that of Kant, and in a sense, of Sir W. Hamilton, both of which in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology, and merely relative or phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness, he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is with him the function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but common-sense is not with him philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is simply the material on which the philosophical method works, and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers criticised {{the first}} third of Tunnels for its slow pace, but praised the {{remainder}} of the book for its fast-paced excitement, suspense, and adventure. In Britain, children's author Philip Ardagh, reviewing for The Guardian, thought the long wait for Will to discover the underground city could dull the reader's anticipation, noting that the event did not occur until page 170. He did observe, however, that when the city is reached, [...] "fantastic fun" [...] begins and that from then on its well paced, exciting and – in places – frightening and bloody." [...] He thought the characters [...] "splendidly named and drawn". In The Sunday Times of 7 July 2007, Nicolette Jones described the book as [...] "a good adventure yarn ... ut after 460 suspenseful pages it is frustratingly inconclusive." [...] She noted the book became a best-seller the month of its release based <b>simply</b> <b>on</b> [...] "stories about its discovery by [...] Barry Cunningham, who [...] "found" [...] Harry Potter." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1849, {{there were}} {{estimated}} {{to be more than}} 150,000 Canadian horses, and many were exported from Canada annually. Some were shipped to the West Indies, where they possibly contributed to gaited breeds such as the Paso Fino. By the middle of the 19th century, Canadian horses had spread through the northeastern US, where they were used for racing, as roadsters, and, due to their stamina, to pull freight wagons and stagecoaches. Many {{played a role in the}} development of other breeds, including the Morgan horse, the American Saddlebred and the Standardbred. Although used extensively in the US, no efforts were made to establish a purebred population, studbook, or breed association in that country. Thousands of horses imported to the US from Canada were used as artillery and cavalry horses in the American Civil War, where many were killed. One equine historian states that [...] "The Canadian horse played a major role in the history of that war; it has even been said that the North won <b>simply</b> <b>on</b> the fact that its soldiers had the better horse – the Canadian." ...|$|E
500|$|The navy, {{along with}} other {{military}} branches, served as dumping grounds for thousands of young, poverty-stricken, sometimes orphaned black individuals who were stuck in the 'dregs' of Brazil's cities. Many had committed or were suspected of committing crimes—though those not in legal trouble were far from safe, as some recruits were seized off the streets or <b>simply</b> <b>on</b> the losing end of settling a personal score. Such measures served as a [...] "perfect marriage of punishment and reform": people who had or were likely to commit crimes would be removed from society and trained in skills that would benefit the country. These men were commonly sent to the navy, apprenticed around the age of 14, and bound to the navy for fifteen years. João Cândido Felisberto, {{a leader in the}} later Revolt of the Lash, was apprenticed at age 13 and joined the navy at 16. Individuals forced into the navy served for twelve years. Volunteers, who perhaps unsurprisingly made up a very low percentage of recruits, signed on for nine years.|$|E
