40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{analyzing the}} influence of job motivation, leadership, and corporate culture toward employee job satisfaction, and their impact to the corporate performance. The proposed hypotheses: The job motivation have <b>significance</b> influence <b>to</b> the employee’s job satisfaction, The leadership have <b>significance</b> influence <b>to</b> the employee’s job satisfaction, The organizational culture have <b>significance</b> influence <b>to</b> the employee’s job satisfaction, The work motivation have <b>significance</b> influence <b>to</b> the corporate performance, The leadership have <b>significance</b> influence <b>to</b> the corporate performance, The organizational culture have <b>significance</b> influence <b>to</b> the corporate performance, The employee’s job satisfaction have <b>significance</b> influence <b>to</b> the corporate performance. The result of the research has evidenced that job motivation, leadership, and organizational culture are {{significantly related to the}} employee’s job satisfaction. Leadership, however, is negatively related to the employee’s job satisfaction. Job motivation is not significantly related to the corporate performance influenced by the intervening variable is employee’s job satisfaction. Leadership and organizational culture are significantly related to the corporate performance. From this result, there are two main conclutions that can be drawn in this study. First, the job motivation can not be related directly to the corporate performance if it is not connected by the employee’s job satisfaction variable. And the second conclution is that the leaderhip is negatively related to the employee’s job satisfaction.

For example, the spider Arachnocoris berytoides resembles Faiditus caudatus, a spider commensal of ants.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy.

5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards and pushing {{the ball with}} their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times.

Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, {{under the}} urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the {{spending}} of $8 million to study the collection and {{to begin the process}} of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the now government-funded collection. Historical <b>significance</b> <b>to</b> the United States was a criterion of the recommendations. Many of the pieces of equipment that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had historical <b>significance</b> <b>to</b> the DL grounds on which the site is located.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 the State Historic Preservation Board {{considered}} a boundary adjustment that removes {{a small area}} at the northeast corner but adds far more, primarily at the southeast.

Most of the new areas had been found to be consistent with those already included in the district or accidentally excluded when the district was originally designated.

5|$|Kepler {{began by}} {{exploring}} regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures {{that would come}} to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical <b>significance</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|E

To remember Krishna at any time and in any art, asserts the text, is to worship the good and the divine.|$|E
