500|$|Certain {{techniques}} and styles {{can be found}} throughout Nine Inch Nails' catalog. Songs such as [...] "Wish", and [...] "The Day the World Went Away" [...] exhibit terraced dynamics. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in [...] "Starfuckers, Inc." [...] and [...] "Burn". The band's music also occasionally contains complex time signatures, notably in [...] "The Collector", from With Teeth, and concert favorite [...] "March of the Pigs". Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements, and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song [...] "Hurt", which contains a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word [...] "I" [...] every time the B/E# dyad is played. [...] "Closer" [...] concludes with a chromatic piano motif: The melody is debuted during the second verse of [...] "Piggy" [...] on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of [...] "Heresy", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout [...] "A Warm Place", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on [...] "The Downward Spiral". On The Fragile, Reznor revisits this technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony, or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on Year Zero contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire {{second half of the}} three-minute long [...] "The Great Destroyer".

40|$|Sleep <b>spindles</b> are {{frequently}} studied for {{their relationship with}} state and trait cognitive variables, and they are thought {{to play an important}} role in sleep-related memory consolidation. Due to their frequent occurrence in NREM sleep, the detection of sleep <b>spindles</b> is only feasible using automatic algorithms, of which a large number is available. We compared subject averages of the <b>spindle</b> parameters computed by a fixed frequency (11 - 13 Hz for slow <b>spindles,</b> 13 - 15 Hz for fast <b>spindles)</b> automatic detection algorithm and the individual adjustment method (IAM), which uses individual frequency bands for sleep <b>spindle</b> detection. Fast <b>spindle</b> duration and amplitude are strongly correlated in the two algorithms, but there is little overlap in fast <b>spindle</b> density and slow <b>spindle</b> parameters in general. The agreement between fixed and manually determined sleep <b>spindle</b> frequencies is limited, especially in case of slow <b>spindles.</b> This is the most likely reason for the poor agreement between the two detection methods in case of slow <b>spindle</b> parameters. Our results suggest that while various algorithms may reliably detect fast <b>spindles,</b> a more sophisticated algorithm primed to individual <b>spindle</b> frequencies is necessary for the detection of slow <b>spindles</b> as well as individual variations in the number of <b>spindles</b> in general...|$|R

40|$|Molecular motors are {{required}} for <b>spindle</b> assembly and maintenance during cell division. How motors move and interact inside <b>spindles</b> is unknown. Using photoactivation and photobleaching, we measure mitotic motor movement inside a dynamic <b>spindle.</b> We find that dynein–dynactin transports the essential motor Eg 5 toward the <b>spindle</b> poles in Xenopus laevis egg extract <b>spindles,</b> revealing a direct interplay between two motors of opposite directionality. This transport occurs throughout the <b>spindle</b> except at the very <b>spindle</b> center and at the <b>spindle</b> poles, where Eg 5 remains stationary. The variation of Eg 5 dynamics with {{its position in the}} <b>spindle</b> is indicative of position-dependent functions of this motor protein. Our results suggest that Eg 5 drives microtubule flux by antiparallel microtubule sliding in the <b>spindle</b> center, whereas the dynein-dependent concentration of Eg 5 outside the <b>spindle</b> center could contribute to parallel microtubule cross-linking.

We observed a striking detachment of centrosomes from <b>spindles,</b> an increase in <b>spindle</b> length, and a loss of <b>spindle</b> pole focus. RNAi depletion of Ncd, another minus-end motor, produced disorganized <b>spindles</b> consisting of multiple disconnected mini-spindles, a different phenotype consistent with distinct pathways of <b>spindle</b> pole organization. Two candidate dynein-dependent <b>spindle</b> pole organizers also were investigated. RNAi depletion of the abnormal <b>spindle</b> protein, Asp, which localizes to focused poles of control <b>spindles,</b> produced a severe loss of <b>spindle</b> pole focus, whereas depletion of the pole-associated microtubule depolymerase KLP 10 A increased <b>spindle</b> microtubule density.

40|$|SummaryIn all {{eukaryotic}} cells, correct {{segregation of}} the genetic material during cell division requires proper positioning and alignment of the mitotic <b>spindle</b> {{with respect to the}} cell division plane. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the <b>spindle</b> is aligned by interphase microtubules during early mitosis [1], and by astral microtubules and cell shape during late mitosis [2]. However, the mechanisms that control <b>spindle</b> alignment in mid-mitosis are not known. The lack of such a control could lead to extensive <b>spindle</b> rotation and misalignment, which, in turn, would result in chromosome mis-segregation if <b>spindle</b> elongation were impaired [1]. Here, we show that the association of mitochondria with the <b>spindle</b> poles reduces <b>spindle</b> rotation. In wild-type cells, <b>spindles</b> with associated mitochondria did not rotate as much as free <b>spindles.</b> In a mutant lacking the centrosomin-related protein Mto 1 p, the association between mitochondria and <b>spindles</b> was reduced and the <b>spindles</b> rotated more than those in wild-type cells. We propose that there is a symbiotic relationship between mitochondria and the mitotic <b>spindle,</b> in which close association between the two organelles facilitates the positioning of both: while the <b>spindle</b> helps to segregate mitochondria equally among the nascent daughter cells [3], mitochondria decrease <b>spindle</b> rotation and thus promote <b>spindle</b> alignment...|$|R

40|$|SummaryJust as {{the size}} of an {{organism}} is carefully controlled, {{the size of}} intracellular structures must also be regulated. The mitotic <b>spindle</b> is a supramolecular machine that generates the forces which separate sister chromatids during mitosis [1]. Although <b>spindles</b> show little size variation between cells of the same type, <b>spindle</b> length can vary at least 10 -fold between different species [2]. Recent experiments on <b>spindle</b> length showed that in embryonic systems <b>spindle</b> length varied with blastomere size [3]. Furthermore, a comparison between two Xenopus species showed that <b>spindle</b> length was dependent on some cytoplasmic factor [4]. These data point toward mechanisms to scale <b>spindle</b> length with cell size. Centrosomes {{play an important role in}} organizing microtubules during <b>spindle</b> assembly [5]. Here we use Caenorhabditis elegans to study the role of centrosomes in setting <b>spindle</b> length. We show that <b>spindle</b> length correlates with centrosome size through development and that a reduction of centrosome size by molecular perturbation reduces <b>spindle</b> length. By systematically analyzing centrosome proteins, we show that <b>spindle</b> length does not depend on microtubule density at centrosomes. Rather, our data suggest that centrosome size sets mitotic <b>spindle</b> length by controlling the length scale of a TPXL- 1 gradient along <b>spindle</b> microtubules...|$|R
