This paper expands beyond traditional spreadspectrum schemes and into chaos theory in communications by presenting a novel design for a covert noncoherent binary communication system that uses chaotic signals. Three techniques are developed, with varying performance. Each system uses two chaotic signals with antipodal attractors as the information carriers. Although the two chaotic signals used are continuously generated from random starting values without containing repetitious patterns, the receiver requires neither those initial values nor does it require synchronization with the transmitter. The chaotic signals used are both spreadspectrum in the frequency domain and undetectable using matched-filter receivers, thereby achieving a level of covertness. The signal-to-noise ratio performance is presented through <b>simulated</b> <b>receiver</b> operating characteristic (ROC) curves for a comparison to binary phase shift keying.

Objective: This {{study sought to}} apply ultrasound-mediated leadless pacing technology in heart failure patients and to evaluate the effects of respiration and body posture on the acoustic window. Methods: Patients with advanced heart failure and ejection fraction ≤ 35 % were studied. An electrophysiology catheter incorporating a receiver electrode to deliver ultrasound-mediated pacing was positioned in the left ventricle. Ultrasound-mediated pacing thresholds were determined. The acoustic windows on the chest wall with the patient lying supine, titled 30 ° leftward, 30 ° rightward, and 30 ° upward were determined. The acoustic windows were also determined with computed tomography and transthoracic echocardiography. <b>Simulated</b> <b>receiver</b> movement with respiratory movement and body positioning was assessed with computed tomography. Results: Ten patients were studied. Ultrasound-mediated pacing was successful in all patients. The acoustic window measured 39. 6 ± 18. 2 cm 2. The window size decreased with rightward tilt, and increased with leftward and upward tilt. They correlated with measurements made by transthoracic echocardiography and computed tomography. Target receiver movement of 1. 2 ± 1. 4 cm horizontally and 1. 3 ± 0. 8 cm vertically were estimated by computed tomography. Conclusion: The feasibility of leadless left ventricular stimulation was shown acutely in heart failure patients.

40|$|International audienceThe {{northern}} Canadian Cordillera (NCC) is {{an active}} orogenic belt in northwestern Canada characterized by deformed autochtonous and allochtonous structures that were emplaced in successive episodes of convergence since the Late Cretaceous. Seismicity and crustal deformation are concentrated along corridors located far (> 200 to ~ 800 km) from the convergent plate margin. Proposed geodynamic models require information on crust and mantle structure and strain history, which are poorly constrained. We calculate receiver functions using 66 broadband seismic stations within and around the NCC and process them to estimate Moho depth and P-to-S velocity ratio (Vp/Vs) of the Cordilleran crust. We also perform a harmonic decomposition to determine the anisotropy of the subsurface layers. From these results, we construct simple seismic velocity models at selected stations and <b>simulate</b> <b>receiver</b> function data to constrain crust and uppermost mantle structure and anisotropy. Our results indicate a relatively flat and sharp Moho at 32 ± 2 km depth and crustal Vp/Vs of 1. 75 ± 0. 05. Seismic anisotropy is pervasive in the upper crust and within a thin (~ 10 – 15 km thick) sub-Moho layer. The modeled plunging slow axis of hexagonal symmetry of the upper crustal anisotropic layer may reflect the presence of fractures or mica-rich mylonites. The subhorizontal fast axis of hexagonal anisotropy within the sub-Moho layer is generally consistent with the SE-NW orientation of large-scale tectonic structures.

Airgun-survey and passive seismic/microseismic). The common seismic equipment is configured in receiver lines with cables trenched or covered on the sea-bottom. The equipment typically comprises up to 4000 receivers depending on the aerial extent of the reservoir. Multicomponent receiver technology like Ocean Bottom Cable (OBC), borehole tools or Ocean Bottom Nodes (OBN) provides information on both pressure and particle velocity recorded with three component accelerometers or geophones and an omnidirectional hydrophone at the seafloor level, allowing complementary PP and PS imaging.

A difficulty in quickly settling or rejecting insurance claims to the policy of the operator of the EGS is the lack of ground truth on the observed shaking at sites of reported damage.
