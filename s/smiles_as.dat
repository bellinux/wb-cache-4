In the parking lot, Pam admits to Jim that it was she who wrote the graffiti. She begins to ask Jim a question, but stops when she notices the camera. A Chili's employee then talks to the camera and says that Pam apparently was sneaking drinks off of others' tables, which is against the restaurant's rules.

500|$|For Advent Children, Nomura {{agreed to}} direct the project largely because of his {{attachment}} {{to the character of}} Cloud. Although Nomura stated that Cloud was a more positive character in Final Fantasy VII than in Advent Children, he did not believe that such an [...] "'upbeat' image of him is what stuck {{in the minds of the}} fans", and the script was written to explain why Cloud returned to a state of mind [...] "consistent with the fans' view of him." [...] Nomura describes Cloud's life as peaceful but, hurt by the losses he experienced during the original game, one which he grew scared of losing. Blaming himself for things outside of his control, Cloud, Nomura elaborated, needed to overcome himself. In contrast to other heroes, who, in Nomura's view, typically possess character defects amounting only to quirks, Nomura believed Cloud's weakness to be humanizing. Nojima viewed the theme of the story as one of forgiveness, which he believed required hardship. Cloud, by taking up his sword and fighting, struggles to achieve it. Nojima sought to establish Cloud's withdrawn personality by depicting him with a cell phone, but never answering any calls. He originally intended for Aerith's name to be the last of those displayed while the backlog of ignored messages appears as Cloud's cell phone sinks into the water, but Nojima altered the scene because it [...] "sounded too creepy". The wolf which Cloud imagines [...] "represents the deepest part of Cloud's psyche" [...] and [...] "appears in response to some burden that Cloud is carrying deep in his heart", vanishing at the film's end. Nomura cites one of the film's final scenes, in which Cloud <b>smiles,</b> <b>as</b> his favorite, highlighting the lack of dialogue and Cloud's embarrassment. The scene influenced composer Nobuo Uematsu's score, who grew excited after coming across it in his review of the script, commenting on the difficulty players who had finished Final Fantasy VII would have had imagining Cloud's smile.|$|E
2500|$|Mercedes {{enters the}} {{labyrinth}} and comforts the dying girl. Drops of Ofelia's blood fall {{down the center}} of the spiral stone staircase onto an altar. Ofelia then appears in a golden throne room. The king of the underworld says that she passed the final test, which was to choose to spill her own blood rather than that of her baby half-brother. The faun praises Ofelia for her choice, and addresses her as [...] "Her Majesty". The queen of the underworld, her mother, invites Ofelia/Moanna to sit next to her father, and rule at his side. In the stone labyrinth, Ofelia <b>smiles</b> <b>as</b> she dies.|$|E
2500|$|Barry Newman {{offered his}} {{interpretation}} of the film's ending in an interview printed in the March 1986 issue of Musclecar Review, [...] "Kowalski <b>smiles</b> <b>as</b> he rushes to his death {{at the end of}} Vanishing Point because he believes he will make it through the roadblock." [...] The August 2006 issue of Motor Trend magazine has a sidebar with Newman, in which he explains that Kowalski sees the light glinting from between the two bulldozers. [...] "To Kowalski, it was still a hole to escape through. It symbolized that no matter how far they push or chase you, no one can truly take away your freedom and there is always an escape." [...] Newman also thought that the entire film was an essay on existentialism. Kowalski drives to drive, with no real purpose for doing what he's doing. He decides to give his life its definition and meaning, with complete freedom over his actions.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1783, young Napoleon Buonaparte (Vladimir Roudenko) is {{enrolled}} at Brienne College, a military school for sons of nobility, run by the religious Minim Fathers in Brienne-le-Château, France. The boys at the school are holding a snowball fight organized as a battlefield. Two bullies—Philippeaux (Petit Vidal) and Peccaduc (Roblin)—schoolyard antagonists of Napoleon, are leading the larger side, outnumbering the side that Napoleon fights for. These two sneak up on Napoleon with snowballs enclosing stones. A hardened snowball draws blood on Napoleon's face. Napoleon is warned of another rock-snowball by a shout from Tristan Fleuri (Nicolas Koline), the school's [...] and a friend to Napoleon. Napoleon recovers himself and dashes alone to the enemy snowbank to engage the two bullies in close combat. The Minim Fathers, watching the snowball fight from windows and doorways, applaud the action. Napoleon returns to his troops and encourages them to attack ferociously. He watches keenly and calmly as this attack progresses, assessing {{the balance of the}} struggle and giving appropriate orders. He <b>smiles</b> <b>as</b> his troops turn the tide of battle. Carrying his side's flag, he leads his forces in a final charge and raises the flag at the enemy stronghold.|$|E
