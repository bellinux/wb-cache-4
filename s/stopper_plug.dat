30|$|The batch fermentations were {{performed}} {{in either a}} 1.4 -L fermenter with a 1000  mL working volume (Infors AG, Switzerland) or in 250 -mL shake flasks with a 50 -mL working volume. The different media described above were used as needed. The fermentations {{were performed}} at 30  °C and 200  rpm agitation rate, with other parameters of either 0.04  vvm ventilation (the oxygen-limited condition) (Zhang et al. 2010), pH 5.5 in the fermenters, or an initial pH of 6 in the shake flasks with a rubber <b>stopper</b> <b>plug</b> in a syringe needle (the oxygen-limited condition) (Walfridsson et al. 1996). Overnight cultures of a single colony were transferred to 100  mL YPD 20 in 250 -mL shake flasks at an initial OD 600 of 0.2 and incubated at 30  °C for another 12  h for inoculations (Li et al. 2015). The data from the independent triplicate cultivations were compared using Student’s t-test whenever indicated. A P <  0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|E
40|$|The LANSCE {{accelerator}} {{relies on}} a Radiation Security System to provide personnel protection from prompt beam-induced radiation. System faults inhibit beam generation in ion sources until areas are made safe by the automatic insertion of beam <b>plugs</b> (<b>stoppers)</b> for the affected area. Should system failures occur, final protection is provided by reliably-engineered, redundant fusible beam plugs which can intercept the beam at the accelerator injection energy of 750 keV. These plugs auto-insert on faults of the Radiation Security System, and remain in until the fault clears. They are normally protected by systems designed to shut off or intercept the full-power beam. In the event of failure of these systems, the beam incident on the stainless- steel surface of the plug will cause, the layer of steel to vaporize and open the beam-line to an atmospheric air passage that results in {{a portion of the}} accelerator losing vacuum. The low energy beam cannot propagate through air, thus ensuring personnel safety...|$|R
30|$|Following the 28 -day incubation, each wood meal {{culture was}} {{supplemented}} {{by the addition}} of 10  mL of basal liquid medium without saccharides (10  g L− 1 yeast extract, 10  g L− 1 KH 2 SO 4, 2  g L− 1 (NH 4) 2 SO 4, and 0.5  g L− 1 MgSO 4 - 7 H 2 O, pH 4.5) and then homogenized using a Polytron PT 1200 E. The cultures were further incubated with shaking (150  rpm) at 30  °C for 3, 6, 9, and 12  days in semi-aerobic conditions (obtained by sealing each culture flask with a silicon <b>plug</b> <b>stopper).</b> After fermentation, the wood meal cultures were centrifuged (10, 000 ×g, 5  min). Ethanol levels in the resulting supernatants were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Shodex SH 1821 column (8.0  mm ×  300  mm, Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan) at 75  °C with 0.5  mM H 2 SO 4 as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6  mL min− 1. Detection was performed using an online Refractive Index Detector.|$|R
40|$|Early in {{the course}} of our studies on {{pigmentation}} in Serratia marcescens it was noted that, when a broth culture of the Amer-ican Type Culture Collection strain # 274 was streaked on a suitable medium, some of the resulting colonies were pink or white rather than dark red. The proportion of these atypical variant colonies appeared to increase for several weeks as the cultures aged, and then decreased to low values. The experi-ments which will be reported in this paper were set up to observe in a quantitative manner the distribution of color types in ageing broth cultures in order to find out whether reproducible changes in the populations did occur and, if so, whether they could be correlated with other events {{in the history of the}} cultures. The stability of the different color types, as revealed by plating techniques, has been discussed in a previous paper (1940 a). Colonies of four distinct colors were repeatedly observed and it was believed that each arose from a different type of cell. As a matter of convenience the cell types were designated as dark red, bright pink, pale pink or white according to the colors of the colonies to which they gave rise, although it was realized that no observations had been made on the colors of single cells. EXPERIMENT I In the first experiment the plating method was used to follow the total populations and the relative numbers of cells of each color type in ageing broth cultures which had been inoculated with cells from a typical dark red colony. Six Kolle flasks of 250 ml. capacity were made up with 100 ml. of a synthetic broth which contained per liter of distilled water: ammonium citrate 5. 0 grams, glycerol 10. 0 grams, K 2 HPO 4. 3 H 20 10. 0 grams, MgSO 4 0. 5 gram, NaCl 0. 5 gram, ferric anumonium citrate 0. 05 gram. Before autoclaving, the flasks were <b>stoppered</b> with cotton <b>plugs</b> through which short lengths of 1 cm. glass tubing had been in-serted. When the flasks were inoculated or samples were remove...|$|R
