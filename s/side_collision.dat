5000|$|... ==Terminology== Traffic {{collisions}} can {{be classified}} by general type. Types of collision include head-on, road departure, rear-end, <b>side</b> <b>collisions,</b> and rollovers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Side</b> <b>collisions</b> are vehicle crashes {{where the}} side {{of one or more}} {{vehicles}} is impacted. These crashes often occur at intersections, in parking lots, and when two vehicles pass on a multi-lane roadway.|$|R
50|$|This type of chassis is {{also often}} found on some sports cars. It {{does not provide}} {{protection}} against <b>side</b> <b>collisions,</b> and thus has to be combined with a body that would compensate for this shortcoming.|$|R

50|$|A head-on {{collision}} is a traffic collision where the front ends of two vehicles such as cars, trains, ships or planes hit {{each other in}} opposite directions, {{as opposed to a}} <b>side</b> <b>collision</b> or rear-end collision.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 Crown added a front-side millimeter-wave radar {{to detect}} {{potential}} <b>side</b> <b>collisions</b> primarily at intersections or when another vehicle crosses the center line.

40|$|<b>Side</b> impacts <b>collisions</b> pose a {{great risk}} to {{children}} in crashes but information about the injury mechanisms is limited. The heights and weights of children vary widely and as a result, the injury patterns may vary across the pediatric age range. This study involves a case series of children in <b>side</b> impact <b>collisions</b> who were identified through Partners for Child Passenger Safety, a large child-focused crash surveillance system.

50|$|Loco ACDs brake {{to reduce}} the train speed to 15 km/h if on approach. They receive {{messages}} from each other ACDs on adjacent tracks. If inbound ACDs of other trains read 'train parted', the trains decelerate until they have stopped to prevent dangerous <b>side</b> <b>collisions</b> that can occur when adjacent tracks have been damaged.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{implementation of}} front airbags {{did little to}} protect against <b>side</b> <b>collisions,</b> which can be more dangerous than frontal collisions because the protective crumple zone {{in front of the}} passenger compartment is completely bypassed. Side airbags and protective airbag curtains are increasingly being required in modern vehicles to protect against this very common category of collisions.|$|R
40|$|During 1976 {{and part}} of 1977 the Dutch {{institute}} for road safety research SWOV carried out the field work for an accident study involving passenger cars. The purpose of this crash injury investigation was to evaluate the influence of relevant crash safety factors (like safety belts and head restraints) {{on the outcome of}} car accidents. Total sample size was 8173 cases. For the purpose of a meeting of an EEC working group on lateral collisions relevant material was made available, which is presented here. The 25 % side damage (2044 cases) consists of left side and right <b>side</b> <b>collisions.</b> Left <b>side</b> lateral <b>collisions</b> amount to 13. 9 % of all cases, and right <b>side</b> lateral <b>collisions</b> amount to 11. 1 %, which is consistent with results of previous studies (in other countries as well as the Netherlands) and seems to be related to right hand traffic regulations...|$|R

5000|$|A series {{production}} vehicle was unveiled on September 29, 2015. It has a panoramic windshield. According to Tesla founder Elon Musk, it is the safest SUV in terms of frontal and side impact crash, being {{more than twice as}} safe as the next closest SUV in rollover tests as well. The Model X includes Tesla Autopilot with standard radar-based AEB and ultrasonic-based <b>side</b> <b>collision</b> avoidance system to steer occupants away from a <b>side</b> <b>collision.</b> Tesla used a Flat Earth wide band radar system that can see through metal to keep falcon wing doors from hitting nearby objects when opening or closing. Musk claims the car features the first true HEPA filter in a car, with medical grade cabin air cleanliness comparable to that of a hospital operating room. When the car operates at maximum capability (enabled with a [...] "Bioweapon Defense Mode" [...] button), Tesla claims that no viruses, bacteria or spores can be detected in the cabin.|$|E
50|$|On November 30, 2016, Rodriguez officially {{signed a}} two-year, $11.5 million {{contract}} with the Atlanta Braves. On January 28, 2017, Rodriguez was injured when his SUV was struck in a <b>side</b> <b>collision</b> by a stolen police cruiser. The rotator cuff on his non-throwing arm required surgery, which was performed on February 14. His wife was hospitalized in fair condition, {{and two of his}} children in serious but stable condition.|$|E
50|$|World first Front-side Pre-crash Safety System: on this {{generation}} Crown Majesta, Toyota further advanced the Pre-Collision System (PCS), adding a front-side millimeter-wave radar to detect potential <b>side</b> <b>collisions</b> primarily at intersections or when another vehicle crosses the center line (Intersection assistant). The latest version tilts {{the rear seat}} upward, placing the passenger in a more ideal crash position if it detects a front or rear impact.|$|R
50|$|Side-impact airbags {{can protect}} vehicle {{occupants}} during <b>side</b> <b>collisions,</b> but {{they face the}} same limitations as other airbags. Additionally, side impact wrecks {{are more likely to}} involve multiple individual collisions or sudden speed changes before motion ceases. Since the airbag can only provide protection during the first collision, it may leave occupants unprotected during subsequent collisions in the crash. However, the first collision in a crash typically has the most severe forces, so an effective airbag provides maximum benefit during the most severe portion of a crash.|$|R
40|$|Reducing the {{severity}} of <b>side</b> impact <b>collisions</b> has been an emerging area of research {{during the past decade}} by a variety of organizations and research communities. The motor vehicle manufacturing and regulatory communities in both the United States, Europe and many other countries have developed dynamic side impact test and evaluation criteria to reduce {{the severity}} of vehicle-to-vehicle <b>side</b> impact <b>collisions.</b> Similarly, the international research community has developed test procedures for performing impacts into poles, one of the most severe types of <b>side</b> impact <b>collisions.</b> This paper presents preliminary side impact test and evaluation procedures for roadside safety hardware like guardrails, guardrail terminals, luminaire supports, utility poles and signs. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to summarize recommendations for performing roadside hardware side impact crash tests, describe the results of several side impact roadside hardware crash tests, compare the proposed test and evaluation procedures to other major side impact test and evaluation procedures, and discuss areas requiring further research...|$|R
5000|$|Two-piece {{engine and}} cab. Perhaps the most {{noticeable}} design {{element of the}} Sir Vival is the two-part segmented chassis. The engine and front wheels sit in a separate section {{which in turn is}} connected to the passenger cab by an articulated joint. The rationale was that in a front or <b>side</b> <b>collision</b> the sections would articulate around the vertical axis and absorb the critical shock of the collision.|$|E
50|$|The Mobilio Spike {{incorporates}} Honda's G-CON (G-force Control) technology, for enhanced crash safety. The {{vehicle body}} {{is designed to}} offer protection to occupants in a 55 km/h full-frontal collision, a 64 km/h front offset collision, 55 km/h <b>side</b> <b>collision,</b> and a 50 km/h rear collision.Honda has implemented its own vehicle-to-vehicle collision testing program: 50% frontal offset collision with a 2-ton class vehicle while both vehicles traveling at 50 km/h, to help improve safety in real-world collisions.|$|E
50|$|At certain junctions, {{especially}} where if the signal protecting the junction was passed at danger a <b>side</b> <b>collision</b> {{is likely to}} result, then flank protection may be used. Derailers and/or facing points beyond the signal protecting the junction will be set in such a position to allow a safe overlap if the signal was passed without authority. This effectively removes {{the chance of a}} side-impact collision as the train would be diverted in a parallel path to the approaching train.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the pattern of}} facial fractures in automotive collisions using the National Automotive Sampling System – Crashworthiness Data System. The database was examined for trends within collision and occupant descriptors among occupants sustaining facial fractures. Drivers and right front passengers were included {{in an analysis of}} frontal <b>collisions.</b> <b>Side</b> impacts were assessed separately by identifying occupants exposed to near and far <b>side</b> <b>collisions.</b> The distribution of facial bone fractures and injury sources were demonstrated for each impact configuration. Risk ratios were used to demonstrate the effects of restraint use and airbag deployment. Seatbelts were found {{to reduce the risk of}} sustaining a facial fracture by 74 % in frontal impacts. Facial fractures are associated with severe impacts with a risk of 5 % at a Delta-V of 40 km/h and 65 km/h for unbelted and belted occupants respectively...|$|R

40|$|A turbo {{roundabout}} is a {{new type}} of canalized multilane intersection in which the physical separation between lanes helps to prevent <b>side</b> <b>collisions</b> when crossing the roundabout. This paper presents an estimation of capacity, delays and level of service of basic turbo roundabouts in undersaturation conditions, considering both vehicle flow and pedestrian traffic. The traffic performance model was developed by evaluating the capacity for each entry lane. Owing to the geometric features of the intersection, the total entry capacity is obtained by considering different values of the pedestrian impedance factor and degree of saturation at both the right-turn and left-turn lanes...|$|R
