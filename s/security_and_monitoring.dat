Periodic evaluation of the food <b>security</b> <b>and</b> nutrition <b>monitoring</b> systems for their intended objectives is essential for reorienting them towards the constantly changing information needs and for redesigning the food and nutrition intervention programs. This paper develops a framework for evaluating food <b>security</b> <b>and</b> nutrition <b>monitoring</b> systems. Using this framework and Uganda {{as a case study}} country, it attempts to evaluate the National Early Warning System (NEWS) and the Famine Early Warning System (FEWS) in order to gain useful lessons for other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. It is argued that unless the existing food security monitoring systems are constantly evaluated for their performance and impact and modified to meet the changing information needs of policymakers, they may become irrelevant for food security decisionmaking.

40|$|Identifying {{cost and}} time-efficient {{approaches}} to food <b>security</b> <b>and</b> nutrition <b>monitoring</b> programs {{is fundamental to}} increasing the utility <b>and</b> sustainability. Food <b>security</b> <b>and</b> nutrition <b>monitoring</b> systems should be periodically evaluated {{to ensure that their}} objectives are met, and re-oriented towards the changing information needs for food policy interventions. In meeting these challenges, the role of continued evaluation of food security monitoring systems- for their impact on food security decision-making- cannot be overemphasized. The linkage between the information generated by these systems, planning and policy processes to improve food security remains weak in several sub-Saharan African countries. This paper aims at developing a framework for evaluating food <b>security</b> <b>and</b> nutrition <b>monitoring</b> systems. Among the criteria used for evaluation are the capacity for data processing, analysis and, reporting, timely generation of information, commitment of decision makers and cost-effectiveness.

50|$|The limes in Britain (Limes Britannicus) {{is on the}} {{territory}} of the present-day United Kingdom in England, Scotland and Wales. Initially, the Gask Ridge and the Stanegate, with their chains of Roman camps and watchtowers, marked the northern boundary of Britannia from the 1st to the 2nd century. Later the isthmuses in the north between the Firth of Forth and Firth of Clyde were guarded by the defences of the Antonine Wall and the line between the mouth of the Tyne and Solway Firth by Hadrian's Wall. The perimeter defence of Hadrian's Wall was achieved through the construction of camps (castella) on the lowlands, which were built along the most important roads in the north. <b>Security</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> on the coasts in the west and southeast was achieved by camps and by chains of watchtowers or signal towers both along the coastline and along main roads in the interior.|$|E
