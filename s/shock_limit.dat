Therefore, datasheets of 118 accelerometers from 27 manufacturers of eight countries have been analyzed. Focus of the analysis were the parameters overload <b>shock</b> <b>limit,</b> measurement range, frequency response, resonance frequency, volume, weight, power consumption and operating temperature of both uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers. Accelerometers with overload shock limits in the range of 50 g to 200 x 103 g and within a measurement range of 2 g to 110 x 103 g have been analyzed. The unit g stands for the gravity acceleration defined as 9. 81 meters per square second. A strict overload <b>shock</b> <b>limit</b> of 10 x 103 g for accelerometers with proof mass and a measurement range of less than 2 x 103 g was found. Also, that the performance of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers differs. Especially uniaxial piezoelectric accelerometers show a better performance with regard to overload shock, measurement range, resonance frequency, frequency response and operating temperature in contrast to triaxial ones. Piezoelectric accelerometers show the highest overload shock limits, measurement range and operating temperature, capacitive accelerometers the lowest power consumption and volume, piezoresistive accelerometers the widest frequency response...|$|E

A parametric survey of numerical solutions of the RH relations is presented, {{making it possible to}} infer by interpolation from graphical displays the solutions to a variety of shocks.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} properties of hydrodynamic shocks with finite Mach numbers. The linear analysis supplements previous analyses which took the strong <b>shock</b> <b>limit.</b> We derive the linearised equations {{for a general}} specific heat ratio as well as temperature and density power-law cooling functions, corresponding {{to a range of}} conditions relevant to interstellar atomic and molecular cooling processes. Boundary conditions corresponding to a return to the upstream temperature ($R$ = 1) and to a cold wall ($R$ = 0) are investigated. We find that for Mach number $M > 5 $, the strong shock overstability limits are not significantly modified. For $M < 3 $, however, shocks are considerably more stable for most cases. In general, as the shock weakens, the critical values of the temperature power-law index (below which shocks are overstable) are reduced for the overtones more than for the fundamental, which signifies a change in basic behaviour. In the $R$ = 0 scenario, however, we find that the overstability regime and growth rate of the fundamental mode are increased when cooling is under local thermodynamic equilibrium. We provide a possible explanation for the results in terms of a stabilising influence provided downstream but a destabilising effect associated with the shock front. We conclude that the regime of overstability for interstellar atomic shocks is well represented by the strong <b>shock</b> <b>limit</b> unless the upstream gas is hot. Although molecular shocks can be overstable to overtones, the magnetic field provides a significant stabilising influence...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study is}} made of an unsteady three dimensional motion of a shock wave of arbitrary strength propagating through an ideal gas. The dynamical coupling between the shock front and the rearward flow is investigated by considering an infinite system of transport equations for the variation of jumps in pressure and its space derivatives across the shock. This infinite system is then truncated to get a closed system of coupled differential equations, which efficiently describes the shock motion. Disturbances propagating on the shock and the onset of shock-shocks are briefly discussed. In the limit of vanishing shock strength, the first order truncation approximation leads to an exact description of acceleration waves. Asymptotic decay laws for the weak shocks and rearward precursor disturbances are exactly recovered. In the strong <b>shock</b> <b>limit,</b> the first order approximation leads to a propagation law for imploding shocks, which is {{in agreement with the}} Guderley's exact similarity solution.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the evolutionary behavior of shock waves of arbitrary strength propagating through a relaxing gas in a duct with spatially varying cross section. An infinite system of transport equations, governing {{the strength of}} a shock wave and the induced discontinuities behind it, are derived in order to study the kinematics of the shock front. The infinite system of transport equations, when subjected to a truncation approximation, provides an efficient system of only finite number of ordinary differential equations describing the shock propagation problem. The analysis, which accounts for the dynamical coupling between the shock fronts and the flow behind them, describes correctly the nonlinear steepening effects of the flow behind the shocks. Effects of relaxation on the evolutionary behavior of shocks are discussed. The first-order truncation approximation accurately describes the decay behavior of weak shocks; the usual decay laws for weak shocks in a nonrelaxing gas are exactly recovered. The results concerning shocks of arbitrary strength are compared with the characteristic rule. In the limit of vanishing shock strength, the transport equation for the first-order induced discontinuity leads to an exact description of an acceleration wave. In the strong <b>shock</b> <b>limit,</b> the second-order truncation criterion leads to a propagation law for imploding shocks which is in agreement (within 5 % error) with the Guderley's exact similarity solution...|$|E

For this study pristine and accelerated aged RDX-based polymer bonded explosives (PBX) have been subjected to laboratory and insensitive munition (IM) related tests such as cook-off and fragment impact tests. The study showed that ageing has an effect on the PBX {{in the way that the}} PBX becomes more stiff, has less elasticity and shows first indications of damage. These features have been revealed by means of gas-dilatometry and friability test series. Both methods are good candidates in the methodology for the surveillance of energetic materials (EM) for IM in the future. The aged PBX investigated in the Dutch program, showed a minor increase in sensitivity in the slow cook-off and fragment impact test which is fully in agreement with the results of the friability test. In the impact test, the reaction below the <b>shock</b> <b>limit</b> of aged material was more violent than the reaction of the pristine material. However, in order to draw conclusions on this phenomenon also the results of the experimental work of the other nations in this cooperation should be analysed. Due to an unexpected detonation in one of the test series, it was shown that several other aspects have a major influence on the sensitivity of the EM. Purity of the components in the EM (including that of the crystals), polymer-crystal bonding, production process, crystal defects and the properties of the pre-polymer all might have an effect on the sensitivity of the EM and the consequences of these effects will most likely be enhanced with ageing.

40|$|Abstract. We present hydrodynamical {{calculations}} of radiative shocks with low Mach numbers {{and find that}} the well-known global overstability can occur if the temperature exponent (α) of the cooling is sufficiently negative. We find that the stability of radiative shocks increases with decreasing Mach number, {{with the result that}} M = 2 shocks require α < ∼ − 1. 2 in order to be overstable. Such values occur within a limited temperature range of many cooling curves. We observe that Mach numbers of order 100 are needed before the strong <b>shock</b> <b>limit</b> of αcr ≈ 0. 4 is reached, and we discover that the frequency of oscillation of the fundamental mode also has a strong Mach number dependence. We find that feedback between the cooling region and the cold dense layer (CDL) further downstream is a function of Mach number, with stronger feedback and oscillation of the boundary between the CDL and the cooling region occuring at lower Mach numbers. This feedback can be quantified in terms of the reflection coefficient of sound waves, and in those cases where the cooling layer completely disappears {{at the end of each}} oscillation cycle, the initial velocity of the waves driven into the upstream pre-shock flow and into the downstream CDL, and the velocity of the the boundary between the CDL and the cooling layer, can be understood in terms of the solution to the Riemann problem. An interesting finding is that the stability properties of low Mach number shocks can be dramatically altered if the shocked gas is able to cool to temperatures less than the pre-shock value (i. e. when χ < 1, where χ is the ratio of the temperature of the cold dense layer to the pre-shock temperature). In such circumstances, low Mach number shocks have values of αcr which are comparable to values obtained for higher Mach number shocks when χ = 1. For instance, αcr = − 0. 1 whe...|$|E
40|$|Supernovae (SNe) are {{energetic}} explosions {{that signal}} {{the end of}} a star's life. These events and the supernova remnants (SNRs) they leave behind {{play a central role in}} stellar feedback by adding energy and momentum and metals to the interstellar medium (ISM). Emission associated with these feedback processes, especially atomic and molecular line emission as well as thermal and nonthermal continuum emission is known to be enhanced in regions of high density, such as dense circumstellar matter (CSM) around SNe and molecular clouds (MCs). In this thesis, I begin with a brief overview of the physics of SN shocks in Chapter 1, focusing on a foundation for studying pan-chromatic signatures of interactions between SNe and dense environments. In Chapter 2, I examine an unusual SN with signatures of CSM interaction in the form of narrow lines of hydrogen (Type IIn) and thermal continuum emission. This SN appears to belong to a class of Type Ia SNe that shares spectroscopic features with Type IIn SNe. I discuss the difficulties of decomposing spectra in a regime where interaction occurs between SN ejecta and CSM, potentially confusing the underlying SN type. This is followed by a discussion of rebrightening that occurred at late-time in 1 ̆d 435 and 1 ̆d 449 band photometry of this SN, possibly associated with clumpy or dense CSM at large distances from the progenitor. In Chapter 3, I examine synchrotron emission from Cassiopeia A, observed in the 1 ̆d 43 eₛ band over multiple epochs. The synchrotron emission is generally diffuse over the remnant, but there is one location in the southwest portion of the remnant where it appears to be enhanced and entrained as knots of emission in the SNR ejecta. I evaluate whether the 1 ̆d 43 eₛ band knots are dominated by synchrotron emission by comparing them to other infrared and radio imaging that is known to be dominated by synchrotron emission. Concluding that they are likely synchrotron-emitting knots, I measure the magnetic field strength and electron density required for their evolution over the 10 yr baseline they were observed and find 1 ̆d 435 ≈ 1. 3 - 5. 8 mG and 1 ̆d 45 bₑ≈ 1, 000 - 15, 000 cm⁻³. The magnetic field strengths appear enhanced beyond values required by the adiabatic strong <b>shock</b> <b>limit,</b> arguing in favor of other forms of magnetic field amplification in the shock. In Chapter 4, I again discuss Cassiopeia A and interaction between the remnant and nearby MCs as seen at mid-infrared and millimeter wavelengths. I report detection of a SNR-MC interaction and analyze its signatures in broadened molecular lines. I extend this analysis in Chapter 5 to a large survey for SNR-MC interactions in the ¹²CO 1 ̆d 43 d= 2 - 1 line. Although broadened ¹²CO 1 ̆d 43 d= 2 - 1 line emission should be detectable toward virtually all SNR-MC interactions, I find relatively few examples; therefore, the number of interactions is low. This result favors mechanisms other than supernova feedback as the basic trigger for star formation. In addition, I find no significant association between TeV gamma-ray sources and MC interactions, contrary to predictions that SNR-MC interfaces are the primary venues for cosmic ray acceleration. I end this dissertation in Chapter 6 with a brief summary of my results and two extensions of this work: examining the late-time radio light curves of CSM-interacting SNe for signatures of radio synchrotron emission and dense or clumpy CSM at large distances from the progenitor and re-observing SNR-MC interactions in ¹²CO 1 ̆d 43 d= 3 - 2 in order to verify the presence of shock-heated molecular gas and perform a census on the densities and temperatures of post-shock molecular gas...|$|E
