Under the same assumptions, we also prove {{the existence of a}} definable, proper elementary extension of the <b>standard</b> <b>superstructure</b> over the reals.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{forces have}} been often {{neglected}} in ship design. At present, windage evaluation, aerodynamic load assessment, and accurate air flow simulation become {{to be considered in}} the design procedures of ships and small craft. They are related to main engines and DPS horsepower assessment as well as to superstructure design. This paper, based on experimental results obtained in the Wind Tunnel of Politecnico di Milano and in the Towing Tank of University of Naples focuses on two issues related to aerodynamic resistance component: the first is the relative weight of the aerodynamic component on the total resistance of a scale model of planing craft in the model-ship correlation procedure; the second is related to the improvement of the procedures widely used for planing craft resistance evaluation including effects of aerodynamic forces on vessel trim and resistance. The obtained results can be considered a reference for air and wind resistance evaluation of high speed motor yachts with <b>standard</b> <b>superstructure</b> profile...|$|E

But it {{gave you}} {{tremendous}} capability - you just opened {{the top of}} the ship ... and dropped everything in and closed it up and off you went."

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a function}} integrated track system {{that focuses on}} the reduction of acoustic emissions from railway lines. It is shown that the combination of an embedded rail system (ERS), a sound absorbing track surface, and an integrated mini sound barrier has significant acoustic advantages compared to a <b>standard</b> ballast <b>superstructure.</b> The acoustic advantages of an embedded rail system are particularly pronounced in the case of railway bridges. Finally, it is shown that an ERS with track integrated vibration sensors may be used as an early warning system and for monitoring the structural health of the railway infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{submitted}} {{contribution is}} {{to demonstrate that the}} financial and legal aspects created the basis of economic development of the regions from the early beginnings of human society. Social relations constituting the subject-matter of the financial law had been developing, changing, and had become established before the financial law itself has been constituted. These relations seem to have been present {{from the very beginning of}} the existence of the human society. Regulatory acts associated with regulation of these relationships embodied solidarity and methodological specificities. The specificity of the subject-matter of regulation, solidarity and methodological specificities of the financial and legal <b>standards</b> sufficiently define <b>superstructure</b> with a natural law character. The superstructure is based on constitutional system of national states and now, after the EU integration has been completed, on the EU law.

30|$|The paper {{introduces}} some {{findings about}} a sensitivity analysis conducted on every geometrical and mechanical parameters which characterize {{the use of}} a railway superstructure at the high velocity. This analysis was carried out by implementing a forecast model that is derived from the simplified Gazetas and Dobry one. This model turns out to be particularly appropriate in the explication of problems connected to high velocity, since it evaluates both inertial and viscous effects activated by the moving load speed. The model implementation requires the transfer function determination that represents the action occurred by the bed surfaces on the railway and it therefore contains information concerning the geometrical and the mechanical characteristics of the embankment, of the ballast and of the sub-ballast. The transfer function H has been evaluated with the finite elements method and particularly, by resorting the ANSYS® code with a harmonic structural analysis in the frequencies field. The authors, from the critic examination of the system’s dynamics response in its entirety, glean a series of observations both of a general and a specific character, finally attaining a propose of a design modification of the <b>standard</b> railway <b>superstructure</b> at the high velocity of train operation adopted today especially in Italy.|$|R
