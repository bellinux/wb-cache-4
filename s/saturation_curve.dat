To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen.

40|$|Capillary pressure-water {{saturation}} {{relations are}} required to explore the CO 2 /brine flows in deep saline aquifers including storage capacity, relative permeability of CO 2 /brine, and change to stiffness and volume. The study on capillary pressure-water <b>saturation</b> <b>curves</b> has been conducted through experimentation and theoretical models. The results show that as the pressure increases up to 12 [*]MPa, (1) capillary pressure-water <b>saturation</b> <b>curves</b> shift to lower values at given water saturation, (2) after the drainage process, residual water saturation decreases, and (3) after the imbibition process, capillary CO 2 trapping increases. Capillary pressure-water <b>saturation</b> <b>curves</b> above 12 [*]MPa appear to be similar because of relatively constant contact angle and interfacial tension. Also, as brine salinity increases from 1 [*]M to 3 [*]M NaCl, (1) capillary pressure-water <b>saturation</b> <b>curves</b> shift to lower capillary pressure, (2) residual water saturation decreases, and (3) capillary CO 2 trapping increases. The results show that pressure and brine salinity have an influence on the capillary pressure-water <b>saturation</b> <b>curves.</b> Also, the scaled capillary CO 2 entry pressure considering contact angle and interfacial tension is inconsistent with atmospheric conditions {{due to the lack}} of wettability information. Better exploration of wettability alteration is required to predict capillary pressure-water <b>saturation</b> <b>curves</b> at various conditions that are relevant to geological CO 2 sequestration...|$|R

Naturally dimeric bovine seminal RNase, which {{has been found to}} give nonhyperbolic <b>saturation</b> <b>curves,</b> loses this property upon monomerization. It is proposed that when RNase monomers are arranged in a quaternary structure, they assume a conformation which enables them to be modulated in their catalytic activities.

40|$|Bovine seminal {{ribonuclease}} is a dimeric enzyme with interchain disulfides {{linking the}} 2 subunits. It can be isolated from bull seminal plasma or from bull seminal vesicles, the organ {{where it is}} produced. The primary structure of the subunit chain is strictly homologous to that of pancreatic RNase A from the same species. Especially interesting is the observation that the amino acid residues which were found {{to interact with the}} substrate at the active site of RNase A are all conserved at identical sequence positions in BS-RNase. Hence, {{it is not surprising that}} BS-RNase has the same 2 -step mode of action (transphosphorolysis followed by hydrolysis of the cyclic phosphate) and the same bond specificity as RNase A. Investigating both the reaction steps catalysed by BS-RNase with appropriate model substrates, we found that the enzyme displays non-hyperbolic <b>saturation</b> <b>curves,</b> but only for the substrate of the second, rate-limiting step of reaction. This phenomenon appeared overlooked in for the limited range of substrate concentrations used.

At subsaturating concentrations of fructose- 6 -phosphate, 1, 5 anhydroglucitol- 6 -phosphate had a stimulatory effect on enzyme activity, suggesting multiple and interacting fructose- 6 -phosphate sites on sucrose-phosphate synthase. The concentrations required for 50 % of maximal activity were 3. 0 millimolar and 1. 3 millimolar, respectively, for fructose- 6 -phosphate and UDPglucose. The enzyme was not stimulated by divalent cations. Inorganic phosphate {{proved to be}} a potent inhibitor, particularly at low concentrations of substrate. Phosphate inhibition was competitive with UDPglucose, and its Ki was determined to be 1. 75 millimolar. Sucrose phosphate, the product of the reaction, was also shown to be a competitive inhibitor towards UDPglucose concentration and had Ki of 0. 4 millimolar. The kinetic results suggest that spinach leaf sucrose-phospahte synthase is a regulatory enzyme and that its activity is modulated by the concentrations of phosphate, fructose- 6 -phosphate, and UDPglucose occurring in the cytoplasm of the leaf cell...|$|R
40|$|Granitoids of the Cape Granite Suite can be {{classified}} as S-, I- and A-types according to their P 2 O 5 contents. The S-type granitoids dominate in the western Tygerberg terrane, the I-type granitoids in the central Swartland {{as well as the}} eastern Boland terranes and the A-types are intrusive in both the Swartland and Tygerberg terranes. The subdivision of the three major groups into six granitic associations, namely two Stype (Sa and Sb), two I-type (Ia and Ib) and two A-type associations (Aa and Ab) was performed by a combination of mineralogical and petrochemical parameters utilizing P 2 O 5, Th, Nb, Zr, Na 2 O, K 2 O and the rare earth elements. The S-type granitoids are enriched in P 2 O 5 above values for theoretical apatite <b>saturation</b> <b>curves.</b> A distinction is made between the Sa 1 association with P enrichment regardless of the degree of differentiation and the Sa 2 association with considerable enrichment during advanced stages of differentiation. Granitoids of the Ia association follow high temperature apatite <b>saturation</b> <b>curves.</b> Fractionated Ib association granitoids adhere to these curves up to advanced stages of differentiation, where P 2 O 5 is slightly enriched. A-type granitoids of both associations are depleted in P 2 O 5. The mineralization potential of granitoids of the Suite is specific [WMo(Cu) or WSn(Au, As) or MoCu(Au, As) ] and related to granitoid association as well as geochemical parameters in each association. High P 2 O 5 granitoids (S-types) have the potential for WSn(Au, As) mineralization when late differentiates (Sa 2 association) are particularly enriched in P 2 O 5 following a trend perpendicular to theoretical apatite <b>saturation</b> <b>curves.</b> Intermediate P 2 O 5 granitoids (1 -types) are potentially mineralized [WMo(Cu) ] when they follow high temperature apatite <b>saturation</b> <b>curves</b> and have high Ca/P values, as well as a wide range in Ca/P ratios. A-type granitoids with MoCu(Au) mineralization are low in P 2 O 5 and high in Nb, Th, Zr and CO 2. Barren A-type granitoids are low in P 2 O 5 and CO 2 and high in Y and Th. High P 2 O 5 peraluminous Stype granitoids are late orogenic to post-orogenic. The intermediate P 2 O 5 metaluminous I-type granites are anorogenic and intruded during a long time span (560 - 517 Ma) in a marginal position with respect to a Proterozoic subduction zone. P 2 O 5 depleted granitoids of the Aa and Ab associations have the typical characteristics of anorogenic alkali granites. © 1995. Articl...|$|R
