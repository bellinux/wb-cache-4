5|$|In 2010, the New Meadowlands <b>Stadium</b> opened, {{replacing}} Giants <b>Stadium.</b> The new <b>stadium</b> is a 50/50 {{partnership between}} the Giants and Jets, and while the <b>stadium</b> {{is owned by the}} New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority on paper, the two teams jointly built the <b>stadium</b> using private funds, and administer it jointly through New Meadowlands <b>Stadium</b> Corporation. The Giants had previously planned a $300-million renovation to the Meadowlands, before deciding in favor of the new <b>stadium</b> which was originally estimated to cost approximately $600 million, before rising to an estimated cost of $1.2 billion. One advantage gained by owning the <b>stadium</b> is that the teams saved considerable money in tax payments, leasing the land from the state at a cost of $6.3 million per year. The state paid for all utilities, including the $30 million needed to install them. Both teams received $150 million loans from the NFL to pay for construction of the <b>stadium.</b> Representatives from the league's teams voted 30–2 in favor of the loan.|$|E
