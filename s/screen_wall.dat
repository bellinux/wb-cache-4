Between 1989 and 1999, the Lawn was re-roofed and {{separated}} from the concourse by a glass <b>screen</b> <b>wall.</b> It is surrounded by shops and cafes on several levels.|$|E
5|$|Charles II criticised Bruce's initial {{plans for}} the {{internal}} layout, and an improved scheme was eventually approved. Construction began in July 1671, and by 1674 {{much of the work}} was complete. Bruce built a second gothic tower to mirror the existing one built by James V between 1528 and 1532, and created the courtyard block in a restrained classical style. A second phase of work started in 1676, when the Duke of Lauderdale ordered Bruce to demolish and rebuild the main west façade, resulting by 1679 in the <b>screen</b> <b>wall,</b> topped by a carved imperial crown, which forms the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|It is {{constructed}} primarily {{of steel and}} glass. The main building {{is based on the}} diagonal truss. Originally, the museum was planned parallel to the river, but was quickly changed so it would lie perpendicular to the river, for the purpose of providing a better view to visitors. The western façade of the museum is a <b>screen</b> <b>wall</b> composed of laminated glass tiles, providing a sunscreen for the building. The underside {{is constructed}} of aluminum. Some critics dislike the bridge design, saying it looks too much like a trailer on stilts.|$|E

On November 22, 2011, {{a crew member}} died in an accident at a New Orleans warehouse that was serving as a soundstage for the production. The incident happened while crew members were changing out a set. The battle on the Himalayas was shot in a New Orleans warehouse previously used to build NASA rockets, that had been fitted with a green <b>screen</b> <b>wall</b> at a very steep angle {{with a lot of}} rigging above to swing the stunt people through.|$|E

25|$|The muazzin's towers {{are located}} in two small minarets (10.5 in diameter). These minarets are located {{at the top of}} an 11.5 feet thick <b>screen</b> <b>wall.</b> The minarets are now ruined, but their {{remnants}} show that they were sloping hollow towers with 24 alternately angular and circular flutes, just like the ones in the Qutb Minar of Delhi.|$|E
2500|$|The bathhouse {{actually}} {{consists of}} four individual structures making up each face of the building, linked by common outer <b>screen</b> <b>walls,</b> with a central courtyard in between. The <b>screen</b> <b>walls</b> are brick and rise [...] high. The buildings share a common outer facade in terms of materials, consisting of brick laid in american bond, cast stone, and concrete. After the 1937 renovations, the entire structure was painted in light gray.|$|R

25|$|A brief {{instance}} {{after the}} foundation of Zubarah, two <b>screening</b> <b>walls</b> were constructed from the outer town wall toward Qal'at Murair. These two walls, oriented east-west, include round towers placed at regular intervals, which strengthened their defensive capabilities. The <b>screening</b> <b>walls</b> likely served to secure the transportation {{of water from the}} wells inside Qal'at Murair to Zubarah. In the harsh, hot summers of the Persian Gulf, water was a most valuable and beneficial commodity. The walls also channeled general traffic to and fro the town over open salt flats.|$|R
25|$|Iltutmish, the {{successor}} of Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak, subsequently beautified the mosque in 1213 CE, with a <b>screen</b> <b>wall</b> pierced by corbelled engrailed arches — a first in India. An inscription {{on the central}} arch of the screen {{as well as two}} inscriptions of the northern minaret contain his name. The second arch from the south names one Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Arid as the construction supervisor.|$|E
25|$|The {{cemetery}} contains over 300 British Commonwealth war graves, {{cared for}} by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), 286 from the First World War (more than half of these in a war graves plot where a <b>Screen</b> <b>Wall</b> memorial lists names of those buried in it) and 46 from the Second, beside graves of 8 Belgian servicemen (one unidentified). It also has a war memorial which includes a statue designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield.|$|E
25|$|The {{second floor}} is {{accessed}} by a stairway {{on the north}} side, and includes a small hallway opening to a guest bedroom with sink, a bathroom, and the family bedroom space. The latter is a singular suite which could be divided by a built-in folding <b>screen</b> <b>wall,</b> separating it into children’s and master bedrooms. The maid’s room is accessed off the stair landing, which is surrounded by wraparound wall of art glass windows.|$|E

25|$|Torquay {{has about}} 60 churches {{from a wide}} variety of Christian denominations. The largest congregations are those of St Matthias (Anglican) and Upton Vale Baptist church. Central Church (United Reformed Church) has a notable pierced <b>screen</b> <b>wall</b> facade. St Matthias's Church, Wellswood, was built as a chapel-of-ease to St Mark's, Torwood, in the 1850s and became a parish church in 1880. In the 1970s the churches of St Mark and Holy Trinity were closed and in 1979 the vicar of St Matthias's became rector of the parish of St Matthias, St Mark and Holy Trinity.|$|E
25|$|The house gate (lawang) – the {{entrance}} to a compound – is ideally placed at the most inauspicious side of the compound, usually in the west wall towards the south end (kauh-kelod). It is identified with the anus. Sometimes this entrance is flanked with gate shrines (apit lawang). A small <b>screen</b> <b>wall</b> (aling-aling) is built directly behind the opening, screening off the interior and preventing evil spirits to enter the house compound. These house gates can be constructed with a simple alang-alang grass thatch or heavily ornate, the degree of elaboration reflects the economic status of the owner of the house.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{building was}} partially destroyed and {{converted into a}} mosque by Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak of Delhi in the late 12th century. According to a local legend, after defeating Vigraharaja's nephew Prithviraja III in the Second Battle of Tarain, Muhammad Ghori passed through Ajmer. There, he saw the magnificent temples, and ordered his slave general Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak to destroy them, and construct a mosque — all within 60 hours (that is, two-and-a-half-days). The artisans could not build a complete mosque in 60 hours time, but constructed a brick <b>screen</b> <b>wall</b> where Ghori could offer prayers. By {{the end of the}} century, a complete mosque was built.|$|E
2500|$|The {{memorial}} {{forms the}} entrance {{to one of the}} CWGC sections of Dunkirk Town Cemetery in Dunkirk, France. Either side of the entrance gates are the inscription panels in English and French, surmounted by stone urns. There are 4,505 names listed on the memorial, which takes the form of free-standing Portland stone <b>screen</b> <b>walls</b> in two rows either side of an avenue leading to a shrine which includes a glass pane (...) engraved with scenes from the evacuation. Further <b>screen</b> <b>walls</b> are attached to the shrine, at the centre of which is a circular wooden seating area integrated with the cabinet containing the CWGC cemetery and memorial register.|$|R

50|$|The {{cemetery}} contains 459 Commonwealth service {{war graves}} from World War I, over 200 of whom form three denominational war graves plots marked by <b>Screen</b> <b>Walls</b> bearing {{names of those}} buried within the plots {{and elsewhere in the}} cemetery whose graves could not be marked by headstones.|$|R
25|$|The Warrant Design showed {{external}} buttresses on {{the ground}} floor level.These were not a classical feature and were one of the first elements Wren changed. Instead he made the walls of the cathedral particularly thick to avoid the need for external buttresses altogether. The clerestorey and vault are reinforced with flying buttresses, which were added at a relatively late stage in the design to give extra strength. These are concealed behind the <b>screen</b> <b>wall</b> of the upper storey which was added to keep the building's classical style intact, to add sufficient visual mass to balance the appearance of the dome and which, by its weight, counters the thrust of the buttresses on the lower walls.|$|E
25|$|The cemetery's 'Cross of Sacrifice' {{serves as}} a landmark, but though rising on a ragstone {{platform}} of contrasting Portland stone, it cannot be viewed on the approach from Church Street since the cemetery company chose to infill Dr Watts' axial walk {{at the time the}} war memorial was erected, so they designed the platform <b>screen</b> <b>wall</b> to prevent the cross from being seen from the south. The trust hopes to change this if a redesign can be agreed, so as to display the cross to be seen from more directions and as a vantage point and focal point overlooking both directions of the original axis from the chapel spire and its ogee arch along Dr Watts' Walk, and on to Abney House gate; the axis that commemorates the life of the Rev. Dr Isaac Watts. Slightly off this exact axial alignment, is the small Blitz memorial that records civilian deaths, closer to the south entrance (picture right).|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war years {{there was little}} money available for other than essential repairs. The 1950s and early 1960s saw {{little in the way}} of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. This involved flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006). Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600–1800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. To adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned <b>screen</b> <b>wall</b> designed by Aston Webb that forms the façade.|$|E
50|$|Greenwich Cemetery {{contains}} 558 World War I burials. Over {{half are}} {{scattered throughout the}} cemetery, but 263 form a large war graves plot known as 'Heroes' Corner', where two curved <b>screen</b> <b>walls</b> bear the names of casualties buried both in the plot and in unmarked graves in the cemetery.|$|R
50|$|The {{burial ground}} was altered {{following}} {{the construction of}} Waterloo Place in 1819, which divided the graveyard into two sections. Along with Edinburgh's other historic graveyards, Old Calton is managed by City of Edinburgh Council. The burial ground, including <b>screen</b> <b>walls,</b> and its monuments are protected as a category A listed building.|$|R
50|$|In August 2016 {{the station}} {{buildings}} of 1867 {{were added to}} the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building.

500|$|Built from Portland stone, the {{memorial}} is sited against the ramparts {{of the city}} walls. It consists of a single, [...] obelisk rising from a three-tiered pedestal set into the rear portion of a three-sided <b>screen</b> <b>wall.</b> The wall creates a recess, sheltering a Stone of Remembrance. The two flanking sides terminate with urn-shaped finials; the ends of each wall are decorated with a laurel wreath in relief carving; {{the inside of the}} walls is further decorated with laurel swags below the urns. The rear wall bears further relief swags to either side of the obelisk; the North Eastern Railway Company's coat of arms is engraved on the pedestal of the obelisk, just above the level of the <b>screen</b> <b>wall,</b> which is surrounded by another laurel wreath. The obelisk rises above the <b>screen</b> <b>wall</b> to a total height of [...] The Stone of Remembrance is a monolith in the shape of an altar, [...] long and curved so slightly as to barely be visible to the naked eye; it is deliberately devoid of any decoration besides the inscription [...] "THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE".|$|E
500|$|The {{memorial}} is of Portland stone construction. It {{consists of}} a low <b>screen</b> <b>wall</b> on top {{of which is a}} tomb chest (cenotaph) topped with a carved wreath, the last of eight cenotaphs by Lutyens to be built in England—the first being Southampton's and the most famous being that on Whitehall in London. The city's coat of arms is carved and painted into the tomb, supported by two relief figures of angels. The memorial is flanked by pedestals, which are topped with bronze flambeaux (flaming torches) gilded with gold leaf. Protruding from the <b>screen</b> <b>wall,</b> beneath the coat of arms, is a Stone of Remembrance, the only one he designed to be integrated into a larger structure. Built into the structure were two metal caskets, one of which contained a list of Norwich's dead from the war and the contents of the second is unknown; the council decided {{that it would have been}} inappropriate to open it during restoration work. The memorial is designed so that gas can be burnt inside it, with the smoke and flames emitted through the flambaeux at either end. Lutyens proposed similar designs for several memorials, including the Cenotaph on Whitehall, but Norwich was the only place where the proposal was accepted and is thus the only one of his memorials capable of emitting a flame. The inscriptions read [...] (above the stone) and [...] (on the stone itself). A further inscription in smaller font on the base of the stone reads [...] This was added at a later date, along with the dates of the two world wars which are inscribed on the <b>screen</b> <b>wall,</b> either side of the stone.|$|E
500|$|The {{hall was}} reconstructed and reduced in size in 1928. [...] The work {{included}} demolition {{of much of}} the west wing, building a <b>screen</b> <b>wall</b> to fill the gap, and removing parts of the south wing. [...] During the 19th and early 20thcenturies the gardens, parkland and woodland became overgrown, and the condition of some of the buildings in them deteriorated. [...] From the middle of the 20thcentury, work has been undertaken to restore some of the parkland and its buildings, and to create new formal gardens near the hall.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{surviving}} buildings date from the 17th century, and include a five-story pagoda and an orchard of late blooming dwarf cherry trees called the Omuro cherry trees that would grow to around 2-3 meters in height. The temple itself features some beautifully painted <b>screen</b> <b>walls,</b> and a beautiful walled garden.|$|R
50|$|To the north, Adam {{designed}} a long low stable range connected {{at either end}} to the main building by <b>screen</b> <b>walls</b> with gateways, creating a forecourt. The outbuildings were constructed in a simpler style intended by Adam, possible {{after his death in}} 1792, with several small lodges arranged symmetrically around the court.|$|R
25|$|Covering {{an area of}} circa 400 {{hectares}} (60 hectares {{inside the}} outer town wall), Zubarah is Qatar’s most substantial archaeological site.
