40|$|In the {{two years}} since the last {{workshop}} report, the environment surrounding the prediction of skin sensitisation hazards has experienced major change. Validated non-animal tests are now OECD Test Guidelines. Accordingly, the recent cross <b>sector</b> <b>workshop</b> focused on how to use in vitro data for regulatory decision-making. After a review of general approaches and six case studies, there was broad consensus that a simple, transparent stepwise process involving non-animal methods was an opportunity waiting to be seized. There was also strong feeling the approach should not be so rigidly defined that assay variations/additional tests are locked out. Neither should it preclude more complex integrated approaches being used for other purposes, e. g. potency estimation. All agreed the ultimate goal is a high level of protection of human health. Thus, experience in the population will be the final arbiter of whether toxicological predictions are fit for purpose. Central to this is the reflection that none of the existing animal assays is perfect; the non-animal methods should not be expected to be so either, but by integrated use of methods and all other relevant information, including clinical feedback, we have the opportunity to continue to improve toxicology whilst avoiding animal use.

40|$|Report of a EPAA/CEFIC LRI cross <b>sector</b> <b>workshop,</b> 4 th February 2013 In a {{previous}} EPAA-Cefic LRI workshop in 2011, issues surrounding {{the use and}} interpretation of results from the local lymph node assay were addressed. At the beginning of 2013 a second joint workshop focused greater attention on the opportunities {{to make use of}} non-animal test data, not least since a number of in vitro assays have progressed to an advanced position in terms of their formal validation. It is already recognised that information produced from non-animal assays can be used in regulatory decision-making, notably in terms of classifying a substance as a skin sensitiser. The evolution into a full replacement for hazard identification, where the decision is not to classify, requires the generation of confidence in the in vitro alternative, e. g. via formal validation, the existence of peer reviewed publications and the knowledge that the assay(s) are founded on key elements of the Adverse Outcome Pathway for skin sensitisation. It is foreseen that the validated in vitro assays and relevant QSAR models can be organised into formal testing strategies to be applied for regulatory purposes by the industry. To facilitate progress, the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to animal testing (EPAA) provided the platform for cross-industry and regulatory dialogue, enabling an essential and open debate on the acceptability of an in vitro based integrated strategy. Based on these considerations, a follow up activity was agreed upon to explore an example of an Integrated Testing Strategy for skin sensitisation hazard identification purposes in the context of REACH submissionsJRC.

Specifically, many research questions were addressed to target the main purpose of the study: To what extent the practical components of curriculum are applied in and outside TVET institutions? To what extent the in-service training’s programs meet the professional development of teachers and trainers? Is the private sector contributes to the training programs? Which approaches could be implemented to improve the teacher training? To what extent the integration of ICTs in learning and teaching process improves competence of TVET teachers? Is there re-training program for old teachers? Is there need to train teacher in private <b>sector</b> <b>workshop?</b> Moreover: the following concepts are relevant to raising the capacity building of teachers are studied: teacher professional development, capacity building, integration of suitable level of information and communication technology (ICT) to teacher education and the connectivity of training process to world of work. In order to collect convenient information, the study used the questionnaire and interview as instruments to achieve the objectives of the research. The main population of the study is teachers, trainers, administrators and employers. With respect to data analysis, the study used the SPSS program and the Chi-square to test some hypotheses. The results of the study showed that essential innovations and reforms on the initial and in-service training programs should be done especially, respect to practical components of the initial and in-service training to reach the professional development for teachers. Since most of interviewees confirmed old curricula of the initial education of teacher and there was no retraining program for the teacher on the job: the linkage of the training to world of work is needed to keep the teacher up-to date. Integration of ICT into learning/teaching process is very important factor because it’s one of the modernization requirements; hence if we do not do this now it should be urgent necessity at the near future. Major result of the study the proposed training approach for TVET teachers in Sudan, whereas implementation of this approach depends on three levels: macro- level the political commitment by undertaking clear national policy and conceptual framework for technical and vocational education and improving the image of teachers, their work conditions and media involvement. Meso-level:(public and private sector) : since a moral contribution towards training of TVET teachers should be realized, by providing real opportunity to make a success to this new training approach by means of offering technical support, technical consultation, advanced knowledge, specialized seminars and contributing of all training policies especially the financial cost. Micro-level (TVET institutions) : there is vital role of administrators to play to attract best candidates not only students of low grades to TVET domain. For example, integrate simple level technology into curricula. Improve initial and in-service training programs based on training needs assessment.

The transformation of Indonesia's central government budgetary system [...] 4. Paper 3. The implementation of performance-based budgeting within Indonesian local government [...] 5. Conclusion. Performance-Based Budgeting (PBB) has been, and continues to be, implemented within developed and developing countries {{as part of a}} wider public sector reform process. The purpose is to embed accurate performance measurement within public sector organisations (see Franklin, 2006, Aristovnik and Seljak, 2009, Schick, 2007) and provide a more efficient and effective approach to resource allocation (Shah and Shen, 2007). PBB adoption and implementation has not been without criticism and there is ongoing debate as to the real use and effectiveness of PBB. The historical context within which PBB developed, and the justification for why countries decide to implement PBB, {{has been the subject of}} scant research, which has led to a lack of understanding as to its purpose and effects. This thesis undertook an historical examination of PBB as part of fiscal reform within the public sector. It specifically used a case study regarding the adoption and implementation of PBB within the Indonesian government as its central field of analysis. The study used qualitative research methodology, beginning with a historical review of the evolution of PBB as the new public budgeting system, using the Lüder FMR model (2002) as a {{conceptual framework}}. It then utilized new institutional sociology (NIS) theory as a theoretical framework to examine the extent to which isomorphism was evident during PBB implementation within the Indonesian central government. Finally, the Lüder FMR model (2013) was employed as a conceptual framework to investigate the motives that underpinned the development of PBB within Indonesian local government, and the factors influencing its implementation. This study offers three conclusions about the historical context of PBB evolution and the decision by countries to adopt. First, PBB was initially implemented in the United States in 1949 and expanded to developing countries through United States (US) and United Nations (UN) funded projects. Using the Lüder FMR model (2002), this study finds that the primary motive underpinning PBB implementation in the US was public sector demand for more informative and measured budgets. Similar motives were also found in the UK, Australia and Denmark. That the implementation of PBB within the US and UK budgeting systems were largely seen as positive, was the primary stimulus for PBB implementation across the globe. Furthermore, this study found the outcome of budgetary reform varied between countries, from that of a single format that involved traditional budgeting methods, to ‘old PBB’, to a dynamic approach involving multiple stages that culminated in PBB modification. Second, the change to the budgetary system was a consequence of the Indonesian central government‘s institutional environment. Two phases of PBB implementation occurred within the Indonesian central government. In the initial period (1990 s), most of the impetus for change originated from Indonesian technocrats (internal governmental officers and academics) who proposed PBB after their participation in an international public <b>sector</b> <b>workshop.</b> During the second period (2003), pressure to implement PBB emanated from the IMF and the World Bank, and the Indonesian central government responded to moderate coercive pressure with an avoidance strategy. This avoidance response, coupled with the occurrence of weak mimetic and strong normative pressure (from Indonesian technocrats) in the institutionalisation of PBB, is evident through the modified form of PBB implemented across the Indonesian central government. This avoidance strategy appears to be the result of the Indonesian government seeking legitimacy from the international community rather than the rational motive of gaining efficiency. Third, the primary motivation for PBB implementation within Indonesian local government was the demand to modernise its financial and reporting system, with support from Indonesian technocrats (government officers and scholars) and foreign donor projects. The harmonisation of planning, budgeting and accounting helped to embed reform. Furthermore, the study found that the Lüder FMR model (2013) is a useful framework to identify the key factors (such as stimuli, reform driver and promoters, and structural features) behind the implementation of PBB within Indonesian local government. However, the weak performance identified after PBB implementation indicated that budgeting reform was at least partly cosmetic. In practical terms, the Indonesian experience of PBB implementation has lessons for other developing countries who are adopting or intend to adopt and implement PBB.

40|$|The {{significant}} uncertainties {{associated with}} the (eco) toxicological risks of engineered nanomaterials pose challenges {{to the development of}} nanoenabled products toward greatest possible societal benefit. This paper argues for the use of risk governance approaches to manage nanotechnology risks and sustainability, and considers the links between these concepts. Further, seven risk assessment and management criteria relevant to risk governance are defined: (a) life cycle thinking, (b) triple bottom line, (c) inclusion of stakeholders, (d) risk management, (e) benefit– risk assessment, (f) consideration of uncertainty, and (g) adaptive response. These criteria are used to compare five well-developed nanotechnology frameworks: International Risk Governance Council framework, Comprehensive Environmental Assessment, Streaming Life Cycle Risk Assessment, Certifiable Nanospecific Risk Management and Monitoring System and LICARA NanoSCAN. A Sustainable Nanotechnology Decision Support System (SUNDS) is proposed to better address current nanotechnology risk assessment and management needs, and makes.

Think Tanks in both countries, bringing together a wide range of persons involved in agricultural R&D and in AIDS control and public health, drew on these papers to identify the critical gaps in knowledge and the priorities for action research to address them. Stakeholders then met and refined these priorities and recommended the establishment of national networks that would support a broad-based initiative in each country.
