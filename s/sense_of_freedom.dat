The discussion covers the subjects of Tattvas, the nature and relationship between the individual soul (Self, Atman) and the Ultimate Reality (Brahman), the seven stages of learning, the characteristics of Jivanmukti (inner <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> while living), and the four types of Jivanmuktas (liberated persons).

5|$|Ragusa Ibla, {{the lower}} city, boasts an {{impressive}} array of Baroque architecture, which includes the Church of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi, designed in 1738 (Illustration 12). In the design of this church Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site. The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps, a Baroque feature, especially exploited in Sicily due to the island's topography. The tower seems to explode from the façade, accentuated by the columns and pilasters canted against the curved walls. Above the doorways and window apertures, pediments scroll and curve with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> and movement which would have been unthinkable to those earlier architects inspired by Bernini and Borromini. The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering {{partners}} {{of a small}} law firm in the South Side of Chicago; in fact, {{for much of the}} time they are just a pair of ambulance chasers. Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish and unethical behavior of Wally, his junior partner. Their bickering is often mediated by Rochelle, the highly competent African American secretary, who had learned a lot of law in her eight years in the office. Meanwhile, David Zinc, a graduate of the Harvard Law School, is completely fed up with the grinding and dehumanizing – though well-paid – life of an associate in the law firm of Rogan Rothberg, where in five years of work he had never seen the inside of a courtroom, in fact, David's expertise was in long-term bonds a job he hated. David suddenly breaks away, goes on a drinking binge and by chance finds himself at the Finley & Figg office. Feeling an elevating <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> and vowing never to go back, Zinc willingly relegates himself to working for the two disreputable street lawyers and ambulance chasers.|$|E

5|$|Some argue on {{religious}} or philosophical {{grounds that it}} is blameworthy to act against conscience, even if the judgement of conscience {{is likely to be}} erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms). Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole. Langston argues that philosophers of virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected conscience for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> of will to use such powers arbitrarily, or with violence, this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the causal factors influencing students adversity between twelfth grade and third-year vocational students in Sisaket province, Thailand. Six hundred and seventy two of twelfth grade and 376 third-year vocational students were selected by multi-stage random sampling techniques. Approach: The instruments used for collecting data were: A scale on self-esteem, a scale on dominance, a scale on self-confidence, a scale on <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>freedom,</b> a scale on achievement motivation, a scale on ambition, a scale on enthusiasm, a scale on responsibility, a scale on future orientation, and an adversity quotient scale. The data were analyzed by validity test of the causal relationship model. Results: The results of the study were as follows: (1) variables influencing the adversity quotient of 12 th grade and third-year vocational students were dominance, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>freedom,</b> self-esteem, enthusiasm, self-confidence, ambition and achievement motivation. (2) Variables are directly influencing the adversity quotient of twelfth grade students was self-confidence while the variables both directly and indirectly influencing the adversity quotient of students were dominance, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>freedom,</b> self-esteem, and enthusiasm. (3) Variable are directly influencing adversity quotient of third-year vocational students was achievement motivation, the variables are indirectly influencing the adversity quotient of these students was dominance while the variables both directly and indirectly influencing the adversity quotient of these students were <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>freedom,</b> self-esteem, enthusiasm, self-confidence, and ambition. Conclusion: In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} could be used as beneficial information for parents, teachers and those involved in education for developing students to have adversity quotient as well as to be used as guidelines for providing education in the future...|$|R

25|$|The {{possible}} {{impression that}} solo divers are unsociable is often wrong. Most solo divers are normally gregarious {{and want to}} share their enjoyment of diving with others – {{they just want to}} do it when they get to the surface. The solitude they want to enjoy is during the dive. These solo divers take pleasure in this solitude and in the feeling of self-sufficiency for this style of diving, that one is not dependent on others, but is relying solely on one's own skills and capabilities. Finally, there is the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom,</b> of not being impeded by the need to look after anyone but oneself and therefore being able to achieve one's own goal in the dive without compromising.|$|E

25|$|Sackville-West was {{a writer}} and author of novels. The Edwardians (1930) and All Passion Spent (1931) are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long {{suppressed}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> and whimsy {{after a lifetime of}} convention. This novel was dramatised by the BBC in 1986 starring Dame Wendy Hiller. All Passion Spent appears to reflect Woolf's influence, as Lady Slane, who has only existed while married to her late husband, a former prime minister, finally begins to live after his death, and becomes friends with the servants on her estate, discovering that the lives of people she had ignored until then are also interesting. At the end of the novel, Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage to pursue her career as a musician. Sackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break {{for a variety of reasons}} as she needed money to pay for the Sissinghurst Castle which had just been purchased; Nicolson having left the Foreign Office no longer had a diplomat's salary to draw upon; she had to pay tuition for her two sons to attend Eton, one of the most expensive public schools in England; and it because she felt she had become a better writer thanks to the mentorship of Woolf who had taught her how to write better.|$|E
500|$|In Raz's view, one of {{the virtues}} {{of the rule of law}} is the {{restraint}} it imposes on authorities. It aims to exclude arbitrary power as it is said that most of the exercises of arbitrary power violate the rule of law. Arbitrary power is excluded when courts hold themselves accountable only to the law and observe [...] "fairly strict procedures". Another virtue is the protection it accords to individual freedom, namely, [...] "the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> in which it is identified with an effective ability to choose between as many options as possible". Most importantly, to adhere to the rule of law is to respect human dignity by [...] "treating humans as persons capable of planning and plotting their future".|$|E

GameDaily listed {{the game as}} one of the [...] "Most Influential Video Games" [...] and stated it [...] "defined the 3-D platform experience, influencing numerous designers to create their own, original offerings". GamesTM noted many game companies, including Nintendo, have tried to develop a platform game to match up to Super Mario 64. Nintendo's first party developer, Rare, reflected in 2013 that during the development of 2001's Conker's Bad Fur Day, they had originally drawn inspiration from their deep analysis of the gameplay and camera mechanics of Super Mario 64: [...] "We were just copying Mario, weren't we? Which, to this day, is still the best 3D camera." [...] Super Mario 64 is notable for its <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> and non-linearity. A central hub, where controls can be learned before entering levels themselves, has been used in many 3D platformers since. In addition, the game's mission-based level design is an inspiration for other game designers. Martin Hollis, who produced and directed GoldenEye 007, says [...] "the idea for the huge variety of missions within a level came from Super Mario 64". In 2012, Dan Houser, a prominent figure {{in the development of the}} Grand Theft Auto series, stated, [...] "Anyone who makes 3D games who says they've not borrowed something from Mario or Zelda [...] is lying." [...] Tetsuya Nomura, a leading designer at Square Enix, stated in 2016 that Super Mario 64 was the impetus for the creation of the Kingdom Hearts series.|$|E

It also praised the Wii version for its story and Force powers, but criticized the game's lightsaber controls and linear gameplay. GameSpot noticed visual glitches and problematic audio compression that detracted from the Wii version's [...] "mature and exciting" [...] story, adding that the reduced number of Force-manipulable objects helps mitigate the targeting problems experienced on other platforms. Referring to the Wii remote and nunchuck controls, GameSpot also speculated that The Force Unleashed is [...] "possibly the most waggle-heavy" [...] Wii game. Zero Punctuation criticized the Wii version's graphics and compared lightsaber combat to [...] "trying to follow an aerobics routine with both your arms tied to different windmills". The ability to upgrade Starkiller's abilities in the PS2 version, according to IGN, is not as [...] "robust" [...] as it should be, and the game's targeting system is sometimes frustrating. IGN said the PS2's real-time cutscene rendering made Starkiller seem emotionless, and that pre-rendered cutscenes would have been better. GameSpot found the DS version's plot interesting but the storytelling itself [...] "lackluster". While the DS version is easy, with Starkiller killing enemies [...] "like a hot knife through butter", GameSpot said the player's sense of power is not matched by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom.</b> GameSpot called the PSP version's camera [...] "unwieldy", but added that smaller and less cluttered environments make the targeting system less frustrating than on other platforms.

The song {{has been}} described {{as an example of the}} use of purely musical techniques to convey subversive messages. The piece has no lyrics, but drew on a number of aspects of black South African culture, including church music, jazz, marabi, and blues, to create a piece that conveyed a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> and cultural identity. It includes a saxophone solo by Coetzee, whose role in the song earned him his nickname [...] "Manenberg". During the recording, the piano played by Ibrahim had thumbtacks attached to the hammers; the instrument thus had a [...] "metallic timbre" [...] that was generally associated with marabi music. Jazz pianist Moses Molelekwa would later state that [...] "Mannenberg" [...] was [...] "a dance song, a party song [...] most of the jazz that was coming out at that period." [...] Commentator John Edwin Mason would write that [...] "It had an irresistible hook—its beautiful melody. It was driven by an infectious, danceable beat." [...] The popularity of the piece was also attributed to the fact that it contained elements of many musical styles, thus sounding familiar to a large number of listeners: the groove of the piece incorporated elements of marabi, the beat was similar to that of ticky-draai, and the saxophone melody drew from langarm, while all of it was based on a [...] "underlying aesthetic" [...] of jazz. The piece also had similarities to [...] "Jackpot", a 1960 mbaqanga tune by Zacks Nkosi, who believed that [...] "Mannenberg" [...] was a rip-off of his piece. The various African genres that were incorporated into the song came from the Coloured and the black communities of the country. Ibrahim stated that to the musicians the piece was an [...] "affirmation... that our inherent culture is valid." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1976 the {{government}} of South Africa decided to implement the use of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in all schools instead of English. In response, high school students {{began a series of}} protests that {{came to be known as}} the Soweto Uprising. 15,000–20,000 students took part; the police, caught unprepared, opened fire on the protesting children. 700 people were estimated to have been killed, and over a thousand injured. The killings sparked off several months of rioting in the Soweto townships, and the protests became an important moment for the anti-Apartheid movement. Hugh Masekela wrote Soweto Blues in response to the massacre, and the song was performed by Miriam Makeba, becoming a standard part of Makeba's live performances for many years. [...] "Soweto Blues" [...] was one of many melancholic songs composed by Masekela during this period that expressed his support of the anti-apartheid struggle, along with [...] "Been Gone Far Too Long," [...] "Mama," [...] and [...] "The Coal Train." [...] Songs written after the Soweto uprising were generally political in nature, but used hidden meaning to avoid suppression, especially as the movement against apartheid gained momentum. A song by the band Juluka used a metaphor of fighting bulls to suggest the fall of apartheid. Many songs of this period became so widely known that their lyrics were frequently altered and adapted depending on the circumstances, making their authorship collective. Pianist Abdullah Ibrahim used purely musical techniques to convey subversive messages, by incorporating melodies from freedom songs into his improvisations. Ibrahim also composed [...] "Mannenberg", described as the [...] "most powerful anthem of the struggle in the 1980s", which had no lyrics but drew on a number of aspects of black South African culture, including church music, jazz, marabi, and blues, to create a piece that conveyed a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> and cultural identity.|$|E
