5|$|At <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, {{the upper and}} lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
5|$|If Mac Scelling {{was indeed}} {{a member of the}} Meic Somairlethe {{descendants}} of Somairlethis relationship may cast light upon Somairle's struggles in the Isles. For instance, Mac Scelling's cooperation with Muirchertach could be evidence that Guðrøðr faced united opposition from Somairle and Muirchertach. In fact, there is evidence indicating that Guðrøðr and Muirchertach were indeed at odds at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1150s or 1160s, as the former appears to have briefly gained the kingship of Dublin at the expense of Muirchertach's authority as overlord.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus's shape to determine if it is differentiated. Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to determine that its shape, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recent past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that {{the density of the}} core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E

5|$|Ryholt dates Sheshi's reign to the mid 18th century BC. His main {{argument}} {{is the presence}} of seals of Sheshi and of two kings of the mid 13th Dynasty Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw and Djedkheperew in the Egyptian fort of Uronarti in Nubia. The fort of Uronarti was abandoned at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th Dynasty, an event which Ryholt dates to the reign of Djedkheperew given the lack of seals attributable to subsequent kings. Ryholt thus proposes that Sheshi reigned from c. 1745 BC until 1705 BC and was a contemporary of Khabaw and Djedkheperew.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach {{clashed with}} rural landowners again in 2009 when his {{government}} introduced the Land Assembly Project Area Act, {{designed to make}} it easier for the government to acquire large blocks of land for public purposes such as ring roads or reservoirs. The Act allowed the government to identify land that it may be interested in expropriating at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future and to indefinitely prohibit any development on that land that could conflict with the government's purposes. Despite vigorous opposition from landowners and the opposition parties, the bill passed the legislature in late April.|$|E
5|$|The bus tunnel was {{originally}} intended to be converted for use by light rail trains at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. Metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988, appropriating half of the $5 million used to install them during construction, the remainder coming from federal sources. To save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the rail's electrical insulation, {{a move that would}} later make them unusable for rail service.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} NY370 west of Victory was realigned {{in the late}} 1950s to follow its modern {{alignment}} to a new terminus at US104 (Ridge Road) southwest of Red Creek. After US104 (now NY104) was rerouted to follow a new super two highway through the Red Creek area in the early 1970s, the portion of Ridge Road between the super two east of Wolcott and NY370 southwest of Red Creek became a westward extension of NY370. The route was altered slightly at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s or early 1980s to follow Ridge Road northeast to NY104 instead.|$|E
5|$|Vedar use the Sri Lankan Tamil dialect {{peculiar}} to the region, known as Batticaloa Tamil dialect, in their {{day to day}} conversations. Vedar children also study in that language in schools. During Sadangu ceremonies, those who are possessed by spirits speak in a mixed language that they call Vedar Sinkalam(Vedar Sinhala") or Vedar Bhasai which is the Vedda language of the interior Vedas. This Vedar Sinkalam is mixed with many Tamil words, as people no longer know the language. There is evidence at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past that the people were bilingual in Vedda language and Tamil, but {{that is no longer}} the case.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E

Numerical calculations of turbulent boundary layer over this urban area were carried out using the three-dimensional simulation method.
