40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{production}} and transfer methods of digital images have evolved rapidly and the digital image material in various organizations is growing fast. New information retrieval (IR) solutions {{are needed to}} provide access to images. The requirements of the data type, user needs and work tasks and processes need to be studied. Much research focuses on the development of image indexing methods and algorithms. However, the research on user needs seems to come behind the rapid technical development. For images, considerably few user studies exist, on which to found the system design. This work presents a field study on the needs and searching behaviour of journalists and indexing performed by archivists in a digital newspaper photograph archive. Observations and interviews were used to collect data on journalists' illustration tasks, photograph needs and selection criteria applied and on indexing practiced by the archivists including photograph attributes indexed and the <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> <b>indexing.</b> In addition, a sample of requests given to archivists and a sample of photograph captions produced in photograph production process were collected and analysed. The results obtained on user needs were contrasted with observed indexing practices and problem areas in the end-user access to photographs were identified. The analysis revealed that the users coped reasonably well when searching photographs of named persons or current news events, which needs were also prevailing in the data. Photographs of object types, named places or themes were also needed but considered difficult to find. Browsing was the key searching strategy applied by the users. The access problems faced by the users are discussed and potential solutions by developing the indexing and the user interface are proposed. Asiasanat:image retrieval, user need...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The exhaustivity of {{document}} {{descriptions and}} the <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> <b>index</b> terms are usually regarded as independent. It {{is suggested that}} specificity should be interpreted statistically, {{as a function of}} term use rather than of term meaning. The effects on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing, in particular, that frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure. Exhaustivity and specificity We are familiar with the notions of exhaustivity and specificity: exhaustivity is a property <b>of</b> <b>index</b> descriptions, and <b>specificity</b> one <b>of</b> <b>index</b> terms. They are most clearly illustrated by a simple keyword or descriptor system. In this case the exhaustivity of a document description is the coverage of its various topics given by the terms assigned to it; and the <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> an individual term is the level of detail at which a given concept is represented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to draw a}} quick sketch {{of some of the}} research that relates to the state of social tagging research today.

The goal <b>of</b> <b>indexing</b> consistency is discussed and examined with respect to the <b>specificities</b> <b>of</b> differing <b>indexing</b> systems. The relation <b>of</b> <b>indexing</b> consistency with 'language-in-use' is discussed. We then proceed {{to take a look at}} a few examples of much older systems that relate closely with the lessons now being learned in social tagging today, in order to situate the present activity in its historical context â and examine a few approaches used for text-based search-and-retrieval and their relevance to tag corpora.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> 12 tumor markers related to colon carcinoma and identify the most sensitive index. Logistic regression and Bhattacharyya distance were used {{to evaluate the}} index. Then, different index combinations were used to establish a support vector machine (SVM) diagnosis model of malignant colon carcinoma. The accuracy of the model was checked. High accuracy was assumed to indicate the high <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>index.</b> Through Logistic regression, three indexes, CEA, HSP 60 and CA 199, were screened out. Using Bhattacharyya distance, four indexes with the largest Bhattacharyya distance were screened out, including CEA, NSE, AFP, and CA 724. The <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> the combination of the above six indexes was higher than that of other combinations, so did the accuracy of the established SVM identification model. Using Logistic regression and Bhattacharyya distance for detection and establishing an SVM model based on different serum marker combinations can increase diagnostic accuracy, providing a theoretical basis for application of mathematical models in cancer diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Protein-energy {{malnutrition}} {{is thought}} to be widespread in hospitalized patients. However, the <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> <b>indexes</b> used to assess malnutrition is uncertain. We therefore assessed the rate of false-positive diagnoses of malnutrition when biochemical-anthropometric indexes were applied to healthy subjects. Nutritional status was assessed in 175 healthy blood donors (aged 44. 2 +/- 13. 4 y) and in 34 highly fit elderly volunteers (aged 74. 7 +/- 3. 6 y) participating in the Nijmegen Four Days Walking March. We investigated both the Nutritional Risk Index [(1. 489 x albumin) + (41. 7 x present/usual weight) ] and the Maastricht Index [20. 68 -(0. 24 x albumin, g/L) -(19. 21 x serum transthyretin, g/L) -(1. 86 x lymphocytes, 10 (6) /L) -(0. 04 x ideal weight) ]. We found previously that 52 - 64 % of nonsurgical hospitalized patients were malnourished according to these indexes. In the present study, 1. 9 % of the 209 volunteers had apparent malnutrition according to the Nutritional Risk Index and 3. 8 % according to the Maastricht <b>Index.</b> The prevalence <b>of</b> apparent malnutrition in the elderly volunteers was 5. 9 % and 20. 6 %, respectively. The rate of false-positive diagnoses was acceptably low in those aged < 70 y with both the Nutritional Risk Index and the Maastricht Index; therefore, the use <b>of</b> these <b>indexes</b> will not cause a clinically significant increase in the prevalence of malnutrition because patients who are not malnourished are included.

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} patient {{orthodontic treatment}} need, appropriate self-perceived indices are required. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> esthetic component (AC) <b>of</b> the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> orthodontic treatment need (IOTN), oral esthetic subjective index scale (OASIS), and visual analog scale (VAS) through dental health component (DHC) IOTN as a normative index to determine the more appropriate self-perceived index among young adults. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a sample of 993 was randomly selected from freshman students of Isfahan University. Those with a history of orthodontic treatment or current treatment were excluded. DHC was evaluated by two inter- and intra-calibrated examiners. Data for AC, OASIS, and VAS were collected through a questionnaire completed by students. Descriptive statistics, Mann–Whitney U-test, and Spearman correlation test, were used for data analyses. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values <b>of</b> self-perceived <b>indices</b> were calculated through DHC. Results: Sensitivity of AC, OASIS, and VAS for evaluating definite orthodontic treatment need was calculated at 15. 4 %, 22. 3 %, and 44. 6 %, respectively. <b>Specificity</b> <b>of</b> these <b>indices</b> for evaluating definite orthodontic treatment need was calculated at 92. 7 %, 90. 5 %, and 76. 2 % percent, respectively. All self-perceived indices had a significant correlation with together and with DHC (P < 0. 01). Among demographic factors, there was weak but significant correlation only between mother's educational level and VAS (P < 0. 01). Conclusion: Due to the sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> the three self-perceived indices, these indices are not recommended for population screening and should be used as adjuncts to a normative index for decision-making in orthodontic treatment planning...|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} {{paradigm for}} evaluating test performance compares the results <b>of</b> an <b>index</b> test with a reference test. When the reference test does not mirror the “truth ” adequately well (e. g. is an “imperfect ” reference standard), the typical (“naïve”) estimates <b>of</b> sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> are biased. One {{has at least}} four options when performing a systematic review of test performance when the reference standard is “imper-fect”: (a) to forgo the classical paradigm and assess the index test’s ability to predict patient relevant outcomes instead of test accuracy (i. e., treat the index test as a predictive instrument); (b) to assess whether {{the results of the}} two tests (index and reference) agree or disagree (i. e., treat them as two alternative measure-ment methods); (c) to calculate “naïve ” estimates <b>of</b> the <b>index</b> test’s sensitivity and specificity from each study included in the review and discuss in which direction they are biased; (d) mathematically adjust the “naïve” estimates <b>of</b> sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>index</b> test to account for the imperfect reference standard.

Methods: Computed tomography head scans {{were obtained from}} 60 patients diagnosed with ISS and 41 age-matched control patients. Volumetric reformations of the skull and overlying skin were used to trace two-dimensional planes {{defined in terms of}} skull-base plane and internal or surface landmarks.

40|$|AIMS: To compare a {{histological}} hepatic iron index with a biochemical hepatic iron index, {{derived from}} {{atomic absorption spectroscopy}} measurements of hepatic iron content, for the diagnosis of genetic haemochromatosis (GH). METHODS: Histological sections of liver biopsy specimens from 70 subjects, who had previously had their biochemical hepatic iron index measured, were examined. The iron stores were scored to derive a histological hepatic iron index and were also graded from 0 to 4 by a standard grading system. The case history of each patient was then reviewed to establish a definitive clinical diagnosis and patients were classified as GH, non-GH or indeterminate. RESULTS: There were 26 cases of GH, 40 cases of non-GH and four indeterminate cases in whom a definite clinical diagnosis was not established. Using a biochemical hepatic iron index cut off level of 2. 0, two cases were misclassified, with one case of GH having a biochemical hepatic iron <b>index</b> <b>of</b> 1. 8 and one non-GH case having a biochemical hepatic iron <b>index</b> <b>of</b> 3. 1. This {{could not have been}} improved by altering the cut off level. Using the recommended cut off level of 0. 15, the histological hepatic iron index was raised in all cases of GH, but was also increased in 11 of the 40 non-GH patients. The <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> this histological <b>index</b> can be improved by increasing the cut off level to 0. 30. A histological iron grade of > or = 3 is more specific than the histological index but has a lower sensitivity, which particularly affects the diagnosis of younger patients with GH. CONCLUSIONS: The biochemical hepatic iron index is a reliable method for establishing a diagnosis of homozygous GH. In contrast, the histological hepatic iron index as originally described is non-specific and does not reliably distinguish patients with GH from others with a raised hepatic iron index due to other causes. The <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> this <b>index</b> can be improved by increasing the cut off level used, but the discrimination provided by the histological index is still inferior to that provided by the biochemical hepatic iron index...|$|R
40|$|The toe-brachial index (TBI) {{is used as}} {{an adjunct}} to the ankle-brachial index (ABI) for {{non-invasive}} lower limb vascular screening. With increasing evidence suggesting limitations of the ABI for diagnosis of vascular complications, particularly in specific populations including diabetes cohorts, the TBI is being used more widely. The aim of this review was to determine the sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> the TBI for detecting peripheral artery disease (PAD) in populations at risk of this disease. A database search was conducted to identify current work relating to the sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> toe-brachial <b>indices</b> up to July 2015. Only studies using valid diagnostic imaging as a reference standard were included. The QUADAS- 2 tool was used to critically appraise included articles. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Sensitivity of the TBI for PAD was reported in all seven studies and ranged from 45 % to 100 %; specificity was reported by five studies only and ranged from 16 % to 100 %. In conclusion, this review suggests that the TBI has variable diagnostic accuracy for the presence of PAD in specific populations at risk of developing the disease. There was a notable lack of large-scale diagnostic accuracy studies determining the diagnostic accuracy of the TBI in detecting PAD in different at-risk cohorts. However, standardised normal values need to be established for the TBI to conclusively determine the diagnostic accuracy of this test...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{reference}} standards (CRSs) {{have been}} advocated in diagnostic accuracy {{studies in the}} absence of a perfect reference standard. The rationale is that combining results of multiple imperfect tests leads to a more accurate reference than any one test in isolation. Focusing on a CRS that classifies subjects as disease positive if at least one component test is positive, we derive algebraic expressions for sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> this CRS, sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> a new (<b>index)</b> test compared with this CRS, as well as the CRS-based prevalence. We use as a motivating example the problem of evaluating a new test for Chlamydia trachomatis, an asymptomatic disease for which no gold-standard test exists. As the number of component tests increases, sensitivity of this CRS increases at the expense specificity, unless all tests have perfect specificity. Therefore, such a CRS can lead to significantly biased accuracy estimates <b>of</b> the <b>index</b> test. The bias depends on disease prevalence and accuracy of the CRS. Further, conditional dependence between the CRS and index test can lead to over-estimation <b>of</b> <b>index</b> test accuracy estimates. This commonly-used CRS combines results from multiple imperfect tests in a way that ignores information and therefore is not guaranteed to improve over a single imperfect reference unless each component test has perfect specificity, and the CRS is conditionally independent <b>of</b> the <b>index</b> test. When these conditions are not met, as in the case of C. trachomatis testing, more realistic statistical models should be researched instead of relying on such CRSs.

40|$|Most {{present day}} {{information}} retrieval systems use {{the presence or}} absence of certain words to decide which documents are appropriate for a user's query. This approach has had certain successes, but it fails to capture relationships between concepts represented by the words, and hence reduces the potential <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> both <b>indexing</b> and searching <b>of</b> documents. A richer representation of the semantics of documents and queries, and methods for reasoning about these representations, have been provided by artificial intelligence.

FS cells, which are {{the primary source of}} synaptic inhibition, are critical for temporally organizing brain activity, regulating brain maturation, and modulating critical developmental periods in multiple cortical systems. Reduced expression of parvalbumin, a marker of mature FS cells, has been reported in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and in mouse models of schizophrenia and autism. Although these results suggest that FS cells may be immature in neuropsychiatric disease, this possibility had not previously been formally assessed. Methods: This study used time-course global expression data from developing FS cells to create a maturation index that tracked with the developmental age of purified cortical FS cells.

The threshold of significant ischemia was set above 10 % reversibility hypoperfusion area from entire surface of left ventricle using semi-quantitative SPECT image analysis (QGS). Diagnostic performance of computerized variables was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

The aim of this study was the diagnostics reliability assessment <b>of</b> ECG –LVH <b>indexes</b> that were met in the group of patients with arterial hypertension over 60 years of age in relation to echocardiography. Material and methods. Two groups of hypertensive subjects: aged above 60 years old (n = 22) and under 60 years old (n = 19) underwent a 12 -lead ECG examination and conventional echocardiography. Results. The number of patients, who met at least one electrocardiographic LVH criterion, was similar in both groups (36. 4 % of patients above 60 % vs. 36. 8 % in patients under 60), although the frequency of LVH echocardiographic criteria was higher in group of patients above 60 (72 % vs. 31. 2 %). In the group of patients above 60, the sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> ECG <b>indexes</b> amounted to 31. 3 % and 50 %.

A selection of the most sensitive ECG criteria to evaluate left ventricular hypertrophy might improve {{the sensitivity of the}} method and thus recognize a sufficient proportion of the hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, confirmed by echocardiography. Patients and methods. We included 62 consecutive patients (31 male and 31 female) with essential arterial hypertension, treated in a single general practice. We made anamnesis, a complete clinical examination with eye fundi examination, usual laboratory examinations, 12 -lead ECG and echocardiography. We applied the ECG criteria to evaluate left ventricular hypertrophy (Sokolow-Lyon index > 38  mm, Cornell product > 2440 mm*ms) and echocardiographic criteria (left ventricular mass for men at least 125 g/m 2 and for women at least 110 g/m 2). Results. We found left ventricular hypertrophy in 13 (21. 0 %) patients by using the combination of both ECG criteria and in 39 (62. 9 %) by echocardiography. The sensitivity of the combined ECG criteria was 25. 6 %, the sensitivity <b>of</b> SokolowLyon <b>index</b> was 12. 8 % and the sensitivity of Cornell product was 17. 9 %. The <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> Sokolow-Lyon <b>index</b> was 83 %, Cornell product had 78 % specificity and the combination of both criteria had <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> 100 %. The left ventricular hypertrophy confirmed by echocardiography was more prevalent in female patients (p = 0. 035) and it showed statistically significant correlation with higher values <b>of</b> Sokolow-Lyon <b>index</b> and Cornell product (p < 0. 0005). Conclusions. The combination <b>of</b> Sokolow-Lyon <b>index</b> and Cornell product yields higher sensitivity than each of them alone and enables us to recognize a higher percentage of hypertensive patients with actual left ventricular hypertrophy. Values of applied ECG criteria which are closer to the limit values signify a higher possibility for the left ventricular hypertrophy. </p...|$|R

40|$|The audiological {{approach}} to the early diagnosis of cerebellopontine angle tumours (APC) is based mainly on ABR. In present work, wave V latency has been studied in two groups of patients: 308 cochlear cases and 74 retrocochlear cases (APC surgically confirmed tumours), {{in order to increase}} the sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> the diagnostic <b>indexes</b> I-V, IT 5 and Delta V. Wave V latencies have been evaluated in relation to hearing loss at 2 - 4 kHz and audiometric profile. Both these factors show a highly significant positive correlation with the latency, which consequently increases proportionally to hearing loss and high-frequency audiometric loss. A multiple regression analysis was therefore used to analyse the effects from the two variables, and a correction factor was calculated to compensate the latency values for hearing loss and threshold configuration. The effects of such a correction on the clinical results consist mainly of a reduction in the rate of cochlear false-negative results, which corresponds to improving the ABR specificity...|$|R
40|$|Objective: to {{investigate}} the levels of cytokines in patients with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) and to determine their correlation with SLE activity and organ damage, {{as well as their}} changes during rituximab (RTM) therapy. Subjects and methods. The trial enrolled 26 patients (5 men and 21 women) with a median (Me) age of 27 [range 23 - 40] years and a SLE duration of 9 to 300 months (Me 72 [range 36 - 108] months and 30 healthy donors marched with the examinees for gender and age. Disease activity was assessed using the SLEDAI- 2 K index. The serum levels of 27  cytokines were measured utilizing X-MAP technologies on a BioPlex 200 device (Bio-Rad, USA). The patients were divided into 2 groups of 13 persons in each: lupus nephritis (LN) and no renal injury. All the patients included in the trial received RTM therapy. Results. A statistically significant elevation in the concentrations of interleukin 13 (IL- 13) and G-CSF was found in the patients with SLE versus the healthy control group (p = 0. 03 and p = 0. 03, respectively). The LN group displayed a statistically significant increase in the concentrations of IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 7, IL- 13, and G-CSF as compared with the non-LN group (р = 0. 039, р = 0. 03, р = 0. 037, р = 0. 03, and р = 0. 028, respectively). ROC analysis established the sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> all <b>indices</b> in the LN group. The area under the ROC curve was equal for all indicators.  The highest <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> IL- 13 (85 %) was observed in the LN group. These cytokines other than that of IL 13 (62 %)  showed the same sensitivity (70 %). Conclusion. The patients with LN had statistically significantly elevated concentrations of IL 4, IL 6, IL 7, IL 13, and G-CSF. The findings suggest that these cytokines are associated with VN. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Acute gangrenous {{appendicitis}} (AGA) is {{a common}} medical condition; however, the grade of appendicitis usually cannot be established preoperatively. We have attempted to identify some indicators, such as the mean platelet volume (MPV) and the platelet distribution width (PDW), to diagnose AGA. Aims. To evaluate {{whether or not the}} MPV and PDW are suitable markers to diagnose AGA. Methods. A retrospective study of 160 patients with AGA and 160 healthy patients was undertaken. Disease diagnosis was confirmed based on the pathologic examination of surgical specimens. Patient white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil ratio (NR), platelet (PLT) count, MPV, PDW, and hematocrit (HCT) were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> these <b>indices</b> in AGA. Results. There {{were no significant differences between}} the AGA and control groups in age and gender. Compared to the control group, the WBC count, NR, and PDW were significantly higher (P< 0. 001, resp.) and the MPV and HCT were significantly lower (P< 0. 001, resp.) in the AGA group. The diagnostic <b>specificities</b> <b>of</b> the WBC count, NR, PLT count, MPV, PDW, and HCT were 86. 3 %, 92. 5 %, 58. 1 %, 81. 7 %, 83. 9 %, and 66. 3 %, respectively. Therefore, the NR had the highest diagnostic specificity for the diagnosis of AGA. Conclusions. This is the first study to assess the MPV and PDW in patients with AGA. Our present study showed that the MPV is reduced and the PDW is increased in patients with AGA; the sensitivity of PDW was superior to the MPV. A decreased MPV value and an increased PDW could serve as two markers to diagnose AGA. The NR had the highest specificity for the diagnosis of AGA...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of the first {{clinical}} realization of a novel software technology 1, HistoScanning TM, aimed at enhancing ultrasound image-based detection of cancerous processes in solid organs. The core of HistoScanning technology consists in mathematical algorithms that are able to distinguish between the numerical patterns of backscattered ultrasounds from malignant and non-malignant tissues. In the following improved characterization capabilities of pelvic masses by performing TVS in conjunction with HistoScanning analysis is described. The described implementation is aimed mainly at characterization of Ovarian Cancer; Ovarian HistoScanning (“OVHS”) was designed with putting the emphasis on the sensitivity, i. e. on not missing any cancer. Application of OVHS onto TVS 8 bit grey level 114 data files resulted in correct identification of all cancers (29) and of 31 out of 58 normal or with benign neoplasm at histology masses yielding an estimated sensitivity of 100 % and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> 68 %. <b>Index</b> terms- Ovarian cancer, ultrasound, early detection, mathematical algorithm. 1 US patent No. 6, 785, 570 2 I...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether a change in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value could predict early response to CT-guided Oxygen-Ozone (O 2 -O 3) injection therapy in patients with unilateral mono-radiculopathy due to lumbar disc herniation. Materials and Methods: A total of 52 patients with unilateral mono-radiculopathy received a single intradiscal (3 mL) and periganglionic (5 mL) injection of an O 2 -O 3 mixture. An ADC <b>index</b> <b>of</b> the involved side to the intact side was calculated using the following formula: pre-treatment ADC index = ([ADC involved side- ADC intact side] / ADC intact side) x 100. We analyzed {{the relationship between the}} pre-treatment Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the ADC index. In addition, the correlation between ODI recovery ratio and ADC index was investigated. The sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> the ADC <b>index</b> for predicting response in O 2 -O 3 therapy was determined. Results: Oswestry Disability Index and the ADC index was not significantly correlated (r =- 0. 125, p = 0. 093). The ADC index and ODI recovery ratio was significantly correlated (r = 0. 819, p < 0. 001). When using 7. 10 as the cut-off value, the ADC index obtained a sensitivity of 86. 3 % and a <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> 82. 9 % for predicting successful response to therapy around the first month of follow-up. Conclusion: This preliminary study demonstrates that the patients with decreased ADC index tend to show poor improvement of clinical symptoms.

40|$|PurposeHeart rate {{adjustment}} of exercise-induced ST-segment depression (ST/HR index and ST/HR hysteresis) {{has been suggested}} as an accurate predictor {{of the presence of}} a coronary artery disease. Its powerful predictive value for proven coronary artery stenosis is now accepted. The objective of our study was to investigate the sentitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> computerized ST/HR <b>index</b> and ST/HR hysteresis to detect significant ischemia. MethodsWe used a cross-sectional analysis of exercise test and myocardial perfusion stress-rest SPECT data. The study population comprised 710 consecutive patients referred for myocardial perfusion imaging. The threshold of significant ischemia was set above 10 % reversibility hypoperfusion area from entire surface of left ventricle using gated-SPECT image analysis (QGS). Diagnostic performance <b>of</b> ST/HR <b>index</b> and ST/HR hysteresis was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. ResultsCrude ST/HR hysteresis showed at the same 70 % <b>specificity,</b> a sensitivities <b>of</b> 56 % and 57 %, respectively. Diagnostic performance of ST/HR hysteresis seems slightly better than ST/HR index (AUC=. 668 vs. 654) with the following cut points. 038 mV and 1. 625 μV/bpm. Adjusting these variables to body mass index does not improve the diagnostic performance. Combining an independant clinical judgement in the model yields a moderate increase of the diagnostic accuracy the prediction only for ST/HR index as suggested by the AUC (. 688). ConclusionsST/HR index and ST/HR hysteresis have a good capability to detect a significant myocardial ischemia evaluated by SPECT, which has therapeutic implications...|$|R
40|$|It was {{performed}} electroneurographic (ENG) studies with surface electrodes and ex-amined nervus medianus (NM) in patients (females), average age of, years (X±SD=,±), with clinical diagnosis of {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} (CTS) {{and at least one}} border or discrete abnormal value of conventional electrophysiological tests. It was also examined healthy individuals (females) as control group, average age of, years (X±SD=,±,). The sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> sensory-motor <b>index</b> (SMI), terminal latency index (TLI) and residual latency (RL) were calculated and compared. SMI is deter-minate by using following formula: distal distance (DD) (in cm) /distal motor latency (DML) (in ms) + sensory conduction velocity (SCV) (in m/s) /motor conduction velocity (MCV) (in m/s) of NM. SCV of NM was measured by antidromic technique in segment wrist-index finger and MCV of NM in forearm segment above wrist. SMI mean value of control group was, (X±SD=,±,) with lower limit of normal value, and in patients with CTS, (X±SD=, ±,). The sensitivity of SMI in patients with CTS was,. SMI is use-ful parameter in electroneurographical diagnosis of CTS and it’s determination is easy and fast and specially important in cases with border or discrete abnormal values of other NM electrophysiological parameters, when SMI values can indicate incipient phase of CTS evolution. In rare cases (about) of CTS with selective NM motor axons affection, SMI may have normal value (false negative result), but DML is always prolonged in this cases. SMI is not dependent on age and DD values in patients with CTS and control subjects. KEY WORDS: sensory-motor index, carpal tunnel syndrom...|$|R
40|$|Research {{into the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of clinical tests is often hampered by single or double partial verification mechanisms, that is, not all patients have their disease status verified by a reference test, neither do all patients receive all tests under evaluation (index tests). We show methods that reduce verification bias introduced when omitting data from partially tested patients. Adjustment techniques are well established {{when there are}} no missing index tests and when the reference test is missing at random. However, in practice, index tests tend to be omitted, and the choice of applying a reference test may depend on unobserved variables related to disease status, that is, verification may be missing not at random (MNAR). We study double partial verification in a clinical example from reproductive medicine in which we analyse the diagnostic values of the chlamydia antibody test and the hysterosalpingography in relation to a diagnostic laparoscopy. First, we plot all possible combinations <b>of</b> sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> both <b>index</b> tests in two test ignorance regions. Then, we construct models in which we impose different assumptions for the verification process. We allow for missing index tests, study the influence of patient characteristics and study the accuracy estimates if an MNAR mechanism would operate. It is shown that data on tests used in the diagnostic process of the same population are preferably studied jointly and that the influence of an MNAR verification process was limited in a clinical study where {{more than half of the}} patients did not have the reference test.

40|$|Study objective: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{observational study}} was to evaluate the utility of derived dead space indexes to predict survival in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS. Study population: Thirty-six patients with ALI (Murray score, > or = 1; Pao(2) /fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio(2) ] ratio, < 300) in critical care departments at two separate hospitals entered the study. MEASUREMENTS: At ICU admission, 24 h, and 48 h, we measured the following: simplified acute physiologic score II; Pao(2) /Fio(2) ratio; respiratory system compliance; and capnographic indexes (Bohr dead space) and physiologic dead space (Enghoff dead space [Vdphys/Vt]), expired normalized CO(2) slope, carbon dioxide output, and the alveolar ejection volume (Vae) /tidal volume fraction (Vt) ratio. RESULTS: The best predictor was the Vae/Vt ratio at ICU admission (Vae/Vt-adm) and after 48 h (Vae/Vt- 48 h) [p = 0. 013], with a sensitivity of 82 % and a <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> 64 %. The difference between Vae/Vt- 48 h and Vae/Vt-adm show a sensitivity of 73 % and a <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> 93 % with a likelihood ratio (LR) of 10. 2 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0. 83. The interaction between the Pao(2) /Fio(2) ratio and Vae/Vt-adm predict survival (p = 0. 003) with an area under the ROC curve of 0. 84, an LR of 2. 3, a sensitivity of 100 %, and a <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> 57 %. The Vdphys/Vt after 48 h predicted survival (p = 0. 02) with an area under the ROC curve of 0. 75, an LR of 8. 8, a sensitivity of 63 %, and a <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> 93 %. <b>Indexes</b> recorded 24 h after ICU admission were not useful in explaining outcome.
