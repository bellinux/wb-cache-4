5|$|According to film {{historian}} Laurent Bouzereau, Jabba the Hutt's {{death in}} Return of the Jedi was suggested by script writer Lawrence Kasdan.

5|$|The {{animals that}} eat the figs {{disperse}} the seeds, which then germinate and grow on other plants (epiphytes) or on rocks (lithophytes). As the new plants develop, they send roots {{to the forest}} floor. Figs growing on other plants grow larger and larger until they <b>strangle</b> their hosts. Ficus obliqua is long-lived, and trees are thought to live in excess of 500 years.|$|E
50|$|It is a hemi{{epiphyte}}, that is, {{it grows}} as an epiphyte on rocks or other {{trees at the}} start of its life and resembles a <b>strangling</b> fig (Ficus). Just as a <b>strangling</b> fig it overgrows and <b>strangles</b> its host tree with its many aerial roots.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Strangling</b> {{does not}} have to be fatal; limited or {{interrupted}} <b>strangling</b> is practised in erotic asphyxia, in the choking game, and is an important technique in many combat sports and self-defence systems. <b>Strangling</b> can be divided into three general types according to the mechanism used: ...|$|R
500|$|<b>Strangles</b> was a {{green tree python}} that Bart owned {{during the}} episode [...] "Stop or My Dog Will Shoot", during which time Santa's Little Helper was a police dog.

5|$|William Marwood, the 19th century hangman, {{carried out}} his first {{execution}} at Lincoln. He used the long drop, designed {{to break the}} victim's neck rather than to <b>strangle</b> him, to execute Fred Horry in 1872. Until 1868, prisoners were publicly hanged on the mural tower at the north-east corner of the curtain wall, overlooking the upper town.|$|E
5|$|Walmsley's crew each {{received}} a Distinguished Flying Cross for extraordinary heroism. Walmsley however, {{was awarded the}} Medal of Honor posthumously on 12 June 1954. The medal was presented to his widow at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C.. Four weeks after the mission, the arclights and Operation <b>Strangle</b> were abandoned, as leaders felt the risks and casualties of the operation outweighed the benefits.|$|E
5|$|An embargo is not {{the same}} as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an embargo. In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials. Food has the real power. After food was introduced the blockade began to <b>strangle</b> Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} {{the presence of the}} Streptococcus equi causes <b>Strangles</b> in horses. Inspection carried out by isolation and identification of bacteria from 20 samples nasal swabs of suspected horse disease <b>Strangles.</b> Isolation and identification of activities performed by the method of bacterial culture, Gram stain, catalase test, and with sugar test.

40|$|<b>Strangles</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} infectious diseases that affect the respiratory system of the horse. The disease is characterized by fever, nasal discharges and enlargement of the associated lymph nodes. Strptococcus equi the causative agent of <b>strangles,</b> is a Gram positive bacteria. The goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of <b>strangles</b> among horses residing on horse farms in main regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. To achieve this goal, field visits were made to horse farms in Al-Ahsa, Dammam, Jubail, Riyadh, Jeddah and Tayf. A total of 75 farms that contain 926 horses were visited. Farm owners and managers were questioned regarding the presence of signs similar to <b>strangles.</b> In the meantime, horses were clinically evaluated. This survey indicated no horses were <b>strangles</b> confirmed. Finally, 35 horses admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at King Faisal University were examined. These horses were admitted for signs of respiratory disorders. Physical and endoscopic examination as well as bacterial culture indicated they were <b>strangles</b> free. <b>Strangles</b> seems not to be a threat to horses in Saudi Arabia...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} {{variants of}} <b>strangles,</b> called Euro-American or hybrid <b>strangles,</b> and it promotes a new numerical pricing technique. We highlight {{and compare the}} properties of European, American, and hybrid <b>strangles</b> with pricing and hedging in mind. The new quadrature approach we propose can account for systems of coupled integral equations that locate the early exercise boundaries of finite-lived contracts. We show that this method is efficient, accurate, and fast for pricing all types of early exercisable <b>strangles.</b> Other advantages of this technique are that it avoids the non-monotonic gradient problem faced by others and it allows users to control for errors. We then investigate the hedging of all <b>strangles,</b> we derive analytical expressions for some Greek parameters, and we stress how these parameters can differ (or not) from each other...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Strangles</b> (equine distemper) is a {{contagious}} {{upper respiratory}} tract infection of horses and other equines caused by a gram-positive bacterium, Streptococcus equi. [...] As a result the lymph nodes swell, compressing the pharynx, larynx and trachea and can cause airway obstruction leading to death, hence the name <b>Strangles.</b> <b>Strangles</b> is enzootic in domesticated horses worldwide. The contagious nature of the infection has at times led to limitations on sporting events.|$|R
