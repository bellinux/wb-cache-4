5000|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, Wolves of the Rail was subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards.

5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the <b>Scene</b> <b>of</b> sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to {{the context in which the}} mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole <b>Scene</b> <b>of</b> sacrifice attests to the sophistication of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E
5|$|Although the Sejm was {{supposed}} to meet every 2 years, only four sessions were called by the Tsar as it became the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> increased clashes between liberal deputies and conservative government officials.
