However, {{it is a new}} policing with varying degrees of success (Policing Communities: Understanding Crime and Solving Problems, Roxbury Publishing, 2000, page 1). This success has led to the problem-oriented approach being popular among police administrators and high-ranking city officials. Other factors affecting this preference is that public favor translates into job security for administrators and elected officials and that it gives the opportunity to collect substantial sums of money through federal grants. In 1995, a federal grant of $327 million from the U.S. Department of Justice was divided up among police departments implementing POP programs in the state of Arizona. The availability of federal grant money creates a real incentive for police agencies to use POP. Federal agencies and national policing groups, the creation of national awards for effective problem-oriented policing programs and implementation throughout the world. The U.S federal agency, the office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) adopted key strategy, and funding for POP (www.popcenter.org)..|$|E

The JAMA criticism pointed to large wasting of research money on testing scientifically implausible treatments, citing [...] "NCCAM officials spending $374,000 to find that inhaling lemon and lavender scents does not promote wound healing; $750,000 to find that prayer does not cure AIDS or hasten recovery from breast-reconstruction surgery; $390,000 to find that ancient Indian remedies do not control type 2 diabetes; $700,000 to find that magnets do not treat arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or migraine headaches; and $406,000 to find that coffee enemas do not cure pancreatic cancer." [...] It was pointed out that negative results from testing were generally ignored by the public, that people continue to [...] "believe {{what they want to}} believe, arguing that it does not matter what the data show: They know what works for them". Continued increasing use of CAM products was also blamed on the lack of FDA ability to regulate alternative products, where negative studies do not result in FDA warnings or FDA-mandated changes on labeling, whereby few consumers are aware that many claims of many supplements were found not to be supported.|$|E

5000|$|Sexualization (or sexualisation) {{is to make}} {{something}} sexual in character or quality, or {{to become aware of}} sexuality, especially in relation to men and women. Sexualization is linked to sexual objectification. According to the American Psychological Association, sexualization occurs when [...] "individuals are regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical characteristics and sexiness." [...] "In <b>study</b> <b>after</b> <b>study,</b> findings have indicated that women more often than men are portrayed in a sexual manner (e.g., dressed in revealing clothing, with bodily postures or facial expressions that imply sexual readiness) and are objectified (e.g., used as a decorative object, or as body parts rather than a whole person). In addition, a narrow (and unrealistic) standard of physical beauty is heavily emphasized. These are the models of femininity presented for young girls to study and emulate." [...] Women who embrace their sexual desires are considered to be sexy and attractive to men who want nothing more than to have a woman as a sex toy. In the eyes of men, women that practice this behavior serve the pure purpose of providing satisfaction and showcasing their human nature. According to the Media Education Foundation, the sexualization of girls in media, and the ways women are portrayed in the dominant culture, is detrimental to the development of young girls as they are developing their identities and understanding themselves as sexual beings.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{researchers}} {{were concerned about}} contamination from the first reports of XMRV-disease associations, and these concerns spread as <b>study</b> <b>after</b> <b>study</b> failed to replicate WPI's results. In December, 2010, four independent articles {{published in the journal}} Retrovirology presented evidence that reported XMRV detection could be explained by contamination of laboratory reagents, tissue samples and blood. Samples that were positive for XMRV were also positive for mouse DNA contaminants. Furthermore, the striking identity of XMRV genomic sequences and their similarity to xenotropic MLVs in several human cell lines suggested that XMRV is not a transmissible human pathogen. The British Medical Journal responded with an article entitled, [...] "Chronic fatigue syndrome is not caused by XMRV virus, study shows". A fifth study supporting the contamination hypothesis was published in February, 2011, just ahead of the 18th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). At CROI, WPI representatives were absent, and a large amount of negative data was presented. Two groups showed evidence that XMRV is a recombinant of two mouse retroviruses, which infected a prostate cancer cell line during passage through nude mice. Virologist John Coffin, who had previously expressed optimism about the initial WPI data, declared, [...] "It's all contamination." [...] Robert Silverman, who was a co-author of the original XMRV-CFS article but is no longer collaborating with Mikovits, told the Chicago Tribune that he was [...] "concerned about lab contamination, despite our best efforts to avoid it".|$|E
