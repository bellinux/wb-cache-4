5|$|Buildings swayed {{with the}} tremor in Mexico City, {{prompting}} evacuations and causing panic among many. Following the quake, police patrolled city <b>streets</b> <b>for</b> safety reasons and damage assessments {{were carried out}} across the affected region. There were no casualties, though two local police stations suffered slight damage. A number of light aftershocks succeeded the main event, of which the strongest measured a magnitude of 4.1(ML).|$|E
5|$|Ice's pet wallaroo, Bucky, and pet goat, Pancho, {{escaped from}} his Port St. Lucie, Florida home in November 2004.

He paid a $220 fine for expired pet tags and an undisclosed fine for the escape of the animals.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Perón's death, the {{government}} suspended all official activities {{for two days}} and ordered all flags flown at half-staff for ten days. It soon became apparent, however, that these measures fell short of reflecting popular grief.

5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of {{transportation}} for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw development of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794, and renamed <b>streets</b> <b>for</b> birds and mammals that had honored British royalty. This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles. The construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th century.|$|E

Similar protests in China were frequently suppressed—sometimes forcefully—with official media sometimes blaming labor unrest on criminal instigation. Bo's government instead held a televised roundtable dialogues with the protesters and citizens, and agreed to allow {{the formation of a}} trade union. His handling of the situation earned him praise as a comparatively restrained and progressive leader.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, Leicester's march up {{the league}} system hit a breakthrough. Their 2–1 win over Sheffield Wednesday, {{combined}} with losses by Queens Park Rangers and Derby County, allowed Leicester City to clinch a promotion to the Premier League after a ten-year absence. Later that month, a win at Bolton saw Leicester become the {{champions of the}} 2013–14 Championship, the seventh time they had been champions of England's second tier. On 5 May 2014, 35,000 fans in Leicester lined the <b>streets</b> <b>for</b> a parade in celebration of the team's success.|$|E
5000|$|... 86th Street was {{an express}} {{station on the}} {{demolished}} IRT Second Avenue Line. It had two levels.

5|$|Norris had {{similarly}} scouted {{settings for}} his novel and chose the upstairs {{of a building}} {{on the corner of}} Polk and California street as McTeague's dentist office, as well as many of the saloons and lunch counters in the area. Stroheim discovered that many of the locations that Norris had described, such as Polk Street, had been destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but he was able to find suitable period locations on Hayes and Laguna <b>streets.</b> <b>For</b> authenticity, Stroheim had no sets built in San Francisco and only redecorated existing locations, such as saloons, butcher shops, and wooden shacks, thus saving on construction costs.|$|E
5|$|The European immigrant-owned bookstores {{fueled the}} demand for detective fiction, {{historical}} reading, and periodicals from Germany and England. Steimatzky, which opened its first bookstore on Jaffa Road in the Triangle in 1925, identified the growing taste for imported newspapers and magazines and bought the franchises for many of them. The European immigrants also created a market for cold cuts and cheeses, with three competing delicatessens on King George and Ben Yehuda <b>Streets.</b> <b>For</b> many years, the Triangle was also {{the only place where}} Jerusalem residents could purchase clothing, shoes, furniture, and household goods.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of schools and religious, {{cultural}} and sporting facilities including sailing and wind surfing and golf. One popular ancient local tradition involves the Hobby Horse, or Obby Oss, which takes to the <b>streets</b> <b>for</b> four days {{on the eve of the}} first of May each year, with accompanying musicians and rival horses. The town is the starting point of the South West Coast Path National Trail, the nation's longest long-distance countryside walking trail. The Minehead Railway was opened in 1874 and closed in 1971 but has since been reopened as the West Somerset Railway.|$|E
5000|$|... 42nd Street {{station was}} built on August 26, 1878, by the New York Elevated Railway Company, and was the {{penultimate}} station on the Third Avenue El until it was expanded to 67th Street almost a month later. West of this station, the original line became the Grand Central Shuttle, serving Grand Central Depot until 1899, when it was replaced by Grand Central Station, which was itself replaced by Grand Central Terminal in 1913. From that point on, the next stop to the north was 47th <b>Street</b> <b>for</b> local trains and 106th <b>Street</b> <b>for</b> express trains.

5|$|Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island {{and acts}} as the {{demarcation}} line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, {{at a rate of}} 100 per block on most streets. South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd <b>Streets,</b> <b>for</b> example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. The rule of thumb is that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.|$|E
5|$|In May 1909, the Woman’s Club {{purchased}} {{an option}} to buy the property on {{the southwest corner of}} Winter and State <b>streets</b> <b>for</b> $5500, which was located across State from Willson Park (a city park at that time). This group then raised the funds to purchase the land for $12,000, and Salem applied for a grant from the Carnegie foundation. The city was allotted $14,000 by the foundation to build a library, but the Women’s Club which owned the existing library and land had not been involved in the process. The organization was able to get the money rescinded, and in November 1910, worked with the city to increase their maintenance fund for the library. Carnegie then raised the grant to $27,500 at the lobbying of Lulu Bush (daughter-in-law to Asahel Bush) and the Woman’s Club deeded the lot and the other library assets to the city of Salem.|$|E
5|$|On the mainland, SR 160 {{once again}} runs atop the east levee, now 1–2 miles (1.5–3km) west of Interstate 5. The final {{bridge over the}} river is the Freeport Bridge, which carries County Route E9 to the west levee, where it turns south to return to SR 160 at {{the west end of}} the Paintersville Bridge. About a mile (1.5km) beyond the Freeport Bridge, SR 160 leaves the levee, enters the city of Sacramento (where state {{maintenance}} and control ends), passes under I-5, and farms give way to suburbs. Here the former SR 160 is known as Freeport Boulevard, a major surface road that passes the Sacramento Executive Airport and Sacramento City College. Freeport Boulevard turns to the northwest at about 4th Avenue. It was formerly a one-way pair with 21st Street with Freeport heading one-way southbound and 21st heading one-way northbound. The city converted these streets back to two-way <b>streets</b> <b>for</b> traffic calming purposes in 2008. After a short jog west on Broadway, former SR 160 turns north on the one-way pair of 15th (southbound) and 16th (northbound) Streets, almost immediately crossing Business 80 and entering downtown Sacramento.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{wanted to}} {{recreate}} the Kennedy assassination in Dealey Plaza. His producers had to pay the Dallas City Council {{a substantial amount of}} money to hire police to reroute traffic and close <b>streets</b> <b>for</b> three weeks. He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35mm and five 16mm) and 14 film stocks. Getting permission to shoot in the Texas School Book Depository was more difficult. They had to pay $50,000 to put someone in the window from which Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy. They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor and Stone. Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.|$|E
