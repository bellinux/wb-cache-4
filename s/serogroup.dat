5|$|A common {{subdivision}} system of E. coli, but {{not based on}} evolutionary relatedness, is by serotype, {{which is based on}} major surface antigens (O antigen: part of lipopolysaccharide layer; H: flagellin; K antigen: capsule), e.g. O157:H7). It is, however, common to cite only the <b>serogroup,</b> i.e. the O-antigen. At present, about 190 serogroups are known. The common laboratory strain has a mutation that prevents the formation of an O-antigen and is thus not typeable.|$|E
25|$|Stool and swab samples {{collected}} in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is V. cholerae O1. If V. cholerae <b>serogroup</b> O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for V. cholerae O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, {{it is necessary to}} send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.|$|E
25|$|In the end, a workshop, {{based on}} {{sequence}}, decides which new allele goes into which <b>serogroup</b> either by sequence or by reactivity. Once the sequence is verified, it is assigned a number. For example, a new allele of B44 {{may get a}} serotype (i.e. B44) and allele ID i.e. B*44:65, {{as it is the}} 65th B44 allele discovered. Marsh et al. (2005) can be considered a code book for HLA serotypes and genotypes, and a new book biannually with monthly updates in Tissue Antigens.|$|E

50|$|Two <b>serogroups</b> of V. cholerae, O1 and O139, cause {{outbreaks}} of cholera. O1 causes {{the majority of}} outbreaks, while O139 - first identified in Bangladesh in 1992 - is confined to Southeast Asia. Many other <b>serogroups</b> of V. cholerae, {{with or without the}} cholera toxin gene (including the nontoxigenic strains of the O1 and O139 <b>serogroups),</b> can cause a cholera-like illness. Only toxigenic strains of <b>serogroups</b> O1 and O139 have caused widespread epidemics.|$|R
40|$|Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is {{a common}} {{etiological}} agent of neonatal, pre and post weaning diarrhoea in piglets.

25|$|The genome {{of strain}} MC58 (<b>serogroup</b> B) has 2,272,351-base pairs. When sequenced in 2000, {{it was found}} to contain 2158 open reading frames (ORFs). Of these, a {{biological}} function was predicted for 1158 (53.7%). There were three major islands of horizontal DNA transfer found. Two encode proteins involved in pathogenicity. The third island only codes for hypothetical proteins. They also found more genes that undergo phase variation than any pathogen then known. Phase variation is a mechanism that helps the pathogen to evade the immune system of the host.|$|E
25|$|Another way for {{bacteria}} {{to defend against}} phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication. The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae <b>serogroup</b> O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.|$|E
25|$|January 1991 – September 1994: Outbreak in South America, {{apparently}} initiated when a Chinese ship discharged ballast water. Beginning in Peru, {{there were}} 1.04million identified cases and almost 10,000 deaths. The causative agent was an O1, El Tor strain, with small differences from the seventh pandemic strain. In 1992 a new strain appeared in Asia, a non-O1, nonagglutinable vibrio (NAG), which was named O139 Bengal. It was first identified in Tamil Nadu, India {{and for a}} while displaced El Tor in southern Asia. It decreased in prevalence from 1995 to around 10% of all cases. It is considered to be an intermediate between El Tor and the classic strain, and occurs in a new <b>serogroup.</b> Scientists warn of evidence of wide-spectrum resistance by cholera bacteria to drugs such as trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and streptomycin.|$|E

40|$|Neisseria meningitidis is {{a leading}} {{pathogen}} of epidemic bacterial meningitis and fulminant sepsis worldwide. Twelve different N. meningitidis <b>serogroups</b> have been identified to date based on antigenic differences in the capsular polysaccharide. However, more than 90 % of human cases of N. meningitidis meningitis {{are the result of}} infection with just five <b>serogroups,</b> A, B, C, W 135, and Y. Efficient methods of detection and genogrouping of N. meningitidis isolates are needed, therefore, in order to monitor prevalent <b>serogroups</b> as a means of disease control and prevention. The capsular gene complex regions have been sequenced from only seven out of the 12 <b>serogroups.</b> In this study, the capsular gene complexes of the remaining five <b>serogroups</b> were sequenced and analyzed. Primers were designed that were specific for N. meningitidis species and for the 12 individual <b>serogroups,</b> and a multiplex PCR assay using these specific primers was developed for N. meningitidis detection and genogrouping. The assay was tested using 15 reference strains covering all 12 <b>serogroups,</b> 143 clinical isolates, and 21 strains from closely related species or from species that cause meningitis. The assay could detect N. meningitidis <b>serogroups</b> and was shown to be specific, with a detection sensitivity of 1 ng of genomic DNA (equivalent to ∼ 4 × 105 genomes) or 3 × 105 CFU/ml in noncultured mock cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens.
