5000|$|Selectors {{directed}} a pulse {{from a common}} entry to either of two outputs, depending on whether a relay magnet was energized. Many types of selectors were employed that differed in how the [...] "pickup" [...] relay was energized. In the simplest case, immediate (I) entries, the magnet was energized when a pulse was received and held {{for the remainder of}} the cycle. More complex selectors, called pilot selectors, had a D entry hub that caused the <b>selector</b> <b>magnet</b> to pick up on the next machine cycle, and X entry hub that also delayed but was only triggered by an 11 or 12 pulse. The one-cycle delay was needed because in most cases, by the time a pulse was detected it was too late to reliably take action in that cycle. Co-selectors had only an immediate input, but five sets of contacts and were typically triggered by a pilot selector's coupling exit, hence the names.|$|E
50|$|The {{atomic beam}} {{standard}} {{is a direct}} extension of the Stern-Gerlach atomic splitting experiment. The atoms of choice are heated in an oven to create gas, which is collimated into a beam. This beam, consisting of a mixture of atoms in two states, passes through a state-selector magnet A, where atoms of the wrong state are separated out from the beam. The remaining beam is exposed to an RF field {{at or near the}} transition frequency. The beam then passes through a space containing a static homogeneous magnetic field before it is again exposed to the RF field. The RF field and the C-field coil will flip the state of the atoms, with a probability depending on how close the microwave frequency is to the atomic transition frequency. After the second RF field exposure the atomic beam passes through a second state <b>selector</b> <b>magnet</b> B, where the atoms that did not change state (are still in the state selected by magnet A) are discarded. This way, the number of atoms which survive magnet B is related to the microwaves' ability to match the atomic transition frequency. After the second state selector, a mass-spectrometer using an ionizer detects the rate of atoms being received.|$|E
