5|$|In mathematics, {{a finite}} {{subdivision}} rule is a recursive way of dividing a polygon or other two-dimensional shape into smaller and <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces.</b> Subdivision rules {{in a sense}} are generalizations of fractals. Instead of repeating exactly the same design over and over, they have slight variations in each stage, allowing a richer structure while maintaining the elegant style of fractals. Subdivision rules {{have been used in}} architecture, biology, and computer science, {{as well as in the}} study of hyperbolic manifolds. Substitution tilings are a well-studied type of subdivision rule.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones breed by {{liberating}} {{sperm and}} eggs through the mouth into the sea. The resulting fertilized eggs develop into planula larvae which, after being planktonic for a while, {{settle on the}} seabed and develop directly into juvenile polyps. Sea anemones also breed asexually, by breaking in half or into <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces</b> which regenerate into polyps. Sea anemones are sometimes kept in reef aquariums; the global trade in marine ornamentals for this purpose is expanding and threatens sea anemone populations in some localities, as the trade depends on collection from the wild.|$|E
30|$|The {{challenge}} is to model an infinite <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of telegraph wire as an electric circuit since it has a load and a source as indicated by Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws. The characteristics of a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of telegraph wire and that of a long transmission line are the same, thus it is sufficient to model an infinite <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of telegraph wire to represent a transmission line over distance.|$|R

50|$|A {{theoretical}} model considered by Planck {{consists of a}} cavity with perfectly reflecting walls, initially with no material contents, into which is then put a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of carbon. Without the <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of carbon, {{there is no way}} for non-equilibrium radiation initially in the cavity to drift towards thermodynamic equilibrium. When the <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of carbon is put in, it transduces amongst radiation frequencies so that the cavity radiation comes to thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|R
5|$|The high {{population}} of the asteroid belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces</b> (leading {{to the formation of}} a new asteroid family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.|$|E
5|$|The {{reconstruction}} of Castell Coch was delayed until 1875, {{because of the}} demands of work at Cardiff Castle and an unfounded concern by the Marquess's trustees that he was facing bankruptcy. On commencement, the Kitchen Tower, Hall Block and shell wall were rebuilt first, followed by the Well Tower and the Gatehouse, and the Keep Tower last. Burges's drawings for the proposed rebuilding survive at the Bute seat of Mount Stuart. The drawings were supplemented by {{a large number of}} wooden and plaster models, from <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces</b> to full-size models of furniture.|$|E
5|$|When being cooked, {{fried chicken}} is often divided into <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces.</b> The chicken is then {{generally}} {{covered in a}} batter, often consisting of ingredients such as eggs or milk, and a thickener such as flour. This is {{used to create a}} crust on the exterior of the meat. In addition, seasoning is often added at this stage. Once the chicken is ready to be cooked, it is placed in a deep fryer, frying pan or pressure cooker (depending on the method used) and fried in lard or a type of oil.|$|E

40|$|Very less {{work has}} been done on laser welding of polymer materials. This project related to the {{optimization}} of process parameters in laser welding operations. Larger pieces of Polycarbonates were cut into <b>small</b> <b>pieces.</b> The dimension of <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> is 80 mm × 50 mm × 2 mm were cut from larger pieces. Good surface finish required for laser welding. So the <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> must not have a gap when it is placed nearly between one another. The <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> were machined by bend saw machine. Very less burr can also affect the welding output. The <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> were welded on the welding table. Experimental design using the Taguchi method. Based on the Taguchi method, the number of experiments can be reduced from the total actual experiment. For the analysis, tensile test and microstructural tests were performed on each specimen. This analysis is also based on the Taguchi method calculation. Finally, the optimum parameters for the tensile test and bubble size have been predicted...|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{artillery}} guns were deployed, including heavier weapons, such as cannons, culverins and demi-cannons, and <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces</b> such as sakers, minions and falcons. Some older guns, for example slings and bases, were also deployed, but were less effective than newer weapons {{such as the}} culverin. With sites equipped with several tiers of weapons, the heaviest guns would typically be placed higher up in the fortification, with the smaller weapons closer to the ground. It is uncertain how far the guns of the period would have reached; analysis {{carried out in the}} 16th and 17th century on the ranges of artillery suggested that the largest weapons, such as a culverin, could hit a target up to between 1,600 and 2,743 metres (5,200ft and 8,999ft) away.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is {{an important}} innate defence against viruses. Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces.</b> A biochemical pathway – the RISC complex, is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA. Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defence mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside {{the core of the}} virion.|$|E
5|$|Weight {{loss and}} eating {{difficulties}} due to dysphagia and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly {{important as the}} disease advances. Thickening agents {{can be added to}} liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces</b> of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is available. This is a feeding tube, permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, which reduces the risk of aspirating food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by speech-language pathologists with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the name remains uncertain, but one {{suggestion}} {{is that it may}} derive from the word platt, meaning a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of ground, with miles being a corruption of mills. Hence Miles Platting may mean [...] "mills on a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of ground".|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} and {{moderate}} stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase patient safety and reduce caretaker burden. Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety locks, the labelling of household items to cue {{the person with the}} disease or the use of modified daily life objects. If eating becomes problematic, food will need to be prepared in <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces</b> or even pureed. When swallowing difficulties arise, the use of feeding tubes may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the caregivers and family members. The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregivers.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces</b> for easier consumption.|$|E

However, because food cooks faster when it is in <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces,</b> food placed inside a solar cooker is usually cut into <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces</b> than it might otherwise be. For example, potatoes are usually cut into bite-sized pieces rather than roasted whole. For very simple cooking, such as melting butter or cheese, a lid may not be needed and the food may be placed on an uncovered tray or in a bowl. If several foods are to be cooked separately, then they are placed in different containers.|$|E
