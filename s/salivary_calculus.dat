40|$|<b>Salivary</b> gland <b>calculus</b> (Sialolith) is {{the most}} common disease of the salivary glands.

30|$|The {{definitive}} {{cause of}} sialolithiasis is unknown, however, several theories have been proposed. Symptomatic salivary calculi only cause problems {{when there is}} an obstruction of the ductal system [1]. Contributing factors include saliva stagnation, sialadenitis, and ductal inflammation or injury. <b>Salivary</b> <b>calculus</b> composition is mainly calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate, often combined with small proportions of magnesium, zinc, ammonium salts, and organic materials or debris [2].|$|E

40|$|Sialolithiasis, or <b>salivary</b> <b>calculus,</b> is {{a disease}} of the salivary glands, {{characterized}} by the formation of mineralized structures within the excretory salivary ducts or the glandular parenchyma. Approximately 80 % occur in the submandibular gland, followed by the parotid and sublingual glands. Although rare, sialolithiasis can also occur in the minor salivary glands. Although the oral cavity and upper lip {{are the most common}} sites, they can develop in any region of the oral cavity that contains minor salivary glands. Treatment is based on surgical excision of the lesion, with a favorable prognosis. This study presents three cases of sialolithiasis of minor salivary glands of the upper and lower lip, addresses their clinical characteristics and correlation with microscopic findings, diagnosis and treatment plans. Etiology and factors that should be considered during diagnosis, appropriate treatment and improved prognosis are discussed in this study...|$|E
40|$|Although oral {{piercing}} {{has been an}} uncommon practice in the Western world, the insertion of metal objects into intra-oral and peri-oral pierced sites is growing in popularity. Tongue piercing is one such practice whereby a metal barbell is inserted into the tongue after piercing with a 14 - 16 gauge needle. Pain, swelling and infection are the most serious consequences associated with this procedure. Other adverse outcomes include mucosal or gingival trauma, chipped or fractured teeth, increased <b>salivary</b> flow, <b>calculus</b> build-up, and interference with speech, mastication and swallowing. This article presents a case report on tongue piercing and highlights the procedure involved. Special attention is given to complications and dental implications associated with such an unusual practice...|$|R
50|$|The {{processes}} of calculus formation from dental plaque {{are not well}} understood. Supragingival calculus formation is most abundant on the buccal (cheek) surfaces of the maxillary (upper jaw) molars and on the lingual (tongue) surfaces of the mandibular (lower jaw) incisors. These areas experience high salivary flow because of their proximity to the parotid and sublingual <b>salivary</b> glands. Subgingival <b>calculus</b> forms below the gumline and is typically darkened in color {{by the presence of}} black-pigmented bacteria, whose cells are coated in a layer of iron obtained from heme during gingival bleeding. Dental calculus typically forms in incremental layers that are easily visible using both electron microscopy and light microscopy. These layers form during periodic calcification events of the dental plaque, but the timing and triggers of these events are poorly understood. The formation of calculus varies widely among individuals and at different locations within the mouth. Many variables have been identified that influence the formation of dental calculus, including age, gender, ethnic background, diet, location in the oral cavity, oral hygiene, bacterial plaque composition, host genetics, access to professional dental care, physical disabilities, systemic diseases, tobacco use, and drugs and medications.|$|R
40|$|Dental {{calculus}} {{is composed}} of inorganic components and organic matrix. Brushite, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, octacalcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite, and whitlockite form the mineral part of dental <b>calculus.</b> <b>Salivary</b> proteins selectively adsorb on the tooth surface to form an acquired pellicle. It {{is followed by the}} adherence of various oral micro-organisms. Fimbriae, flagella, and some other surface proteins are essential for microbial adherence. Microbial co-aggregation and co-adhesion enable some micro-organisms, which are incapable of adhering, to adhere to the pellicle-coated tooth surface. Once organisms attach to the tooth surface, new genes could be expressed so that mature dental plaque can form and biofilm bacteria assume increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. Supersaturation of saliva and plaque fluid with respect to calcium phosphates is the driving force for plaque mineralization. Both salivary flow rate and plaque pH appear to influence the saturation degree of calcium phosphates. Acidic phospholipids and specific proteolipids present in cell membranes {{play a key role in}} microbial mineralization. The roles of crystal growth inhibitors, promoters, and organic acids in calculus formation are discussed. Application of biofilm culture systems in plaque mineralization is concisely reviewed. Anti-calculus agents used - centering on triclosan plus polyvinyl methyl ether/maleic acid copolymer, pyrophosphate plus polyvinyl methyl ether/maleic acid copolymer, and zinc ion - in commercial dentifrices are also discussed in this paper. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hyposalivation is based predominantly on the clinical signs and symptoms. There is little correlation between symptoms and objective tests of salivary flow, such as sialometry. This test {{is simple and}} noninvasive, and involves measurement of all the saliva a patient can produce during a certain time, achieved by dribbling into a container. Sialometery can yield measures of stimulated salivary flow or unstimulated salivary flow. Stimulated salivary flow rate is calculated using a stimulant such as 10% citric acid dropped onto the tongue, and collection of all the saliva that flows {{from one of the}} parotid papillae over five or ten minutes. Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate more closely correlates with symptoms of xerostomia than stimulated salivary flow rate. Sialography involves introduction of radio-opaque dye such as iodine into the duct of a salivary gland. It may show blockage of a duct due to a <b>calculus.</b> <b>Salivary</b> scintiscanning using technetium is rarely used. Other medical imaging that may be involved in the investigation include chest x-ray (to exclude sarcoidosis), ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (to exclude Sjögren's syndrome or neoplasia). A minor salivary gland biopsy, usually taken from the lip, may be carried out if there is a suspicion of organic disease of the salivary glands. Blood tests and urinalysis may be involved to exclude a number of possible causes. To investigate xerophthalmia, the Schirmer test of lacrimal flow may be indicated. Slit-lamp examination may also be carried out.|$|R
