5|$|There {{are also}} many {{cases where the}} remains of the fetus are found {{separate}} from the body of the mother, but expulsion was not through the birth canal, and separation of the two bodies may have been influenced by external environmental factors. The process of separation is <b>so</b> <b>unusual</b> that a specific term for the phenomenon may not have been proposed to the scientific community. These cases may have comparable results, but they are not cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|Copeland was {{appointed}} a soloist at ABT in August 2007, {{one of the}} youngest ABT dancers promoted to soloist. Although, she was described by early accounts as the first African American woman promoted to soloist for ABT, Anne Benna Sims and Nora Kimball were soloists with ABT in the 1980s. Male soloist Keith Lee also preceded her. As of 2008, Copeland was the only African-American woman in the dance company during her entire ABT career. The only male African American in the company during her career, Danny Tidwell, left in 2005. In an international ballet community with a lack of diversity, she was <b>so</b> <b>unusual</b> as an African American ballerina, that she endured cultural isolation. She has been described in the press as the Jackie Robinson of classical ballet.|$|E
5|$|The mane of {{the adult}} male lion, unique among cats, {{is one of the}} most {{distinctive}} characteristics of the species. Although having a ruff is not <b>so</b> <b>unusual</b> for a lioness, in rare cases, a female lion can have a mane. The presence, absence, colour, and size of the mane is associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate, and testosterone production; the rule of thumb is the darker and fuller the mane, the healthier the lion. Sexual selection of mates by lionesses favours males with the densest, darkest mane. Research in Tanzania also suggests mane length signals fighting success in male–male relationships. Darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year.|$|E

5|$|Dean and Knapp {{record that}} in early 1707 Keiser {{surrendered}} the lease of the Gänsemarkt to Johann Heinrich Sauerbrey, who thus became {{responsible for the}} staging of the double opera. It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts {{is that the two}} parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as they are the first works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original run, or of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, fresh from the opening of Rodrigo in Florence, to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner, although Anthony Hicks in his Grove Handel biography, says that <b>so</b> <b>unusual</b> a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence.|$|E
5|$|The first small bones {{belonging}} to Balaur bondoc consisted of six {{elements of the}} front limbs. Named specimens FGGUB R. 1580–1585, these were discovered in 1997 in Romania by Dan Grigorescu, but the morphology of the arm was <b>so</b> <b>unusual</b> that scientists could not correctly combine them, mistaking them for the remains of an oviraptorosaur. The first partial skeleton was discovered in September 2009 in Romania, approximately 2.5 kilometers north of Sebeș, along the Sebeș river in the Sebeș Formation dating from the early Maastrichtian, and was given the preliminary field number SbG/A-Sk1. Later it received the holotype inventory number EME VP.313. The discovery {{was made by the}} geologist and paleontologist Mátyás Vremir of the Transylvanian Museum Society of Cluj Napoca who sent them for analysis to Zoltán Csiki of the University of Bucharest. The findings were described on August 31, 2010, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The 1997 specimens indicate an individual about 45% longer than the holotype; they were also found in a younger stratum.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea of a}} land {{grant to}} an entire class of people was not <b>so</b> <b>unusual</b> in the 1700s and 1800s as it seems today. For example, Thomas Jefferson {{proposed}} a grant of 50 acres to any free man who didn't already have at least 50 acres in his draft of a revolutionary constitution for Virginia in 1776. More proximately, various Homestead Acts were passed 1862–1916, granting 160–640 acres (a quarter section to a full section), depending on the act, and earlier homesteading occurred under statutues such as the Preemption Act of 1841. Freedmen were not generally eligible for homesteading, {{because they were not}} citizens, which changed with the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, when they were granted citizenship.|$|E

500|$|... "All Through the Night" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{originally}} recorded in 1983 by American singer-songwriter Jules Shear, though it {{is best known for}} the hit single version recorded by Cyndi Lauper later that same year. [...] It is included on Lauper's debut album She's <b>So</b> <b>Unusual.</b> Shear wrote [...] "All Through The Night" [...] as a mid-tempo folk-rock song for his 1983 album Watch Dog. After the Cars recorded their own version, which they did not use on any of their albums, Lauper decided to cover it. Although she initially intended to do a straight cover of Shear's version, she turned it into a pop ballad instead.|$|E

The theme, inspired by Irving Berlin's 1929 song [...] "Alexander's Ragtime Band", was composed within 20 minutes.

500|$|This huge {{death toll}} {{was caused by}} an {{extremely}} high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms, suspected {{to be caused by}} cytokine storms. Symptoms in 1918 were <b>so</b> <b>unusual</b> that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue, cholera, or typhoid. One observer wrote, [...] "One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred". The majority of deaths were from bacterial pneumonia, a common secondary infection associated with influenza, but the virus also killed people directly, by causing massive hemorrhages and edema in the lung.|$|E

500|$|Rangel {{is known}} as an energetic, genial, and sociable politician, one {{who is able to}} gain {{friendship}} and influence by means of charm, humor, and candor. [...] He is called [...] "Charlie" [...] by everyone in Congress, from the highest-ranking members to the custodial employees. [...] Of his political skills, 1980s Ways and Means chair Dan Rostenkowski said, [...] "Charlie has the gifted knack of getting you to change your position, and you actually enjoy doing it. Compromising isn't <b>so</b> <b>unusual</b> in Congress. Enjoying it is." [...] The New York congressman's ability to use humor to catch others off guard before making a political point has been called [...] "Rangeling" [...] by lobbyists and others on Capitol Hill. [...] Many of his closest friends and allies in Congress have not been other African Americans, but white representatives from working class or rural districts; O'Neill aide Chris Matthews said these members were [...] "tied emotionally and culturally to the people they represent." ...|$|E
500|$|The Jonas Brothers are parodied in [...] "The Ring" [...] {{and play}} a {{prominent}} role in the episode's plot. In a television column written before [...] "The Ring" [...] was broadcast, Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post suggested Parker and Stone were using the Jonas Brothers in the thirteenth season debut as a means of improving the show's ratings; Comedy Central executives insisted Jonas Brothers fans do not fit into South Parks demographic of males between the ages 18 and 49. The scenes with the Jonas Brothers using hoses to shoot foam into the faces of their female fans were inspired by actual scenes in Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience. Matt Stone said some viewers found it <b>so</b> <b>unusual</b> they believed the writers made it up themselves. [...] The Walt Disney Company, the Disney Channel and the Mickey Mouse cartoon character are also prominently featured, and spoofed, in the episode; even when Mickey Mouse says callous things or physically assaults people, he follows up most sentences with the character's trademark high-pitched [...] "Ha-ha!"

500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, in {{collaboration}} with Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first recorded by American pop singer Katy Perry, for her second album One of the Boys (2008), though it was never included for the album and was passed on to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals. Like most songs on Breakout, Cyrus wrote [...] "7 Things" [...] while traveling on the Best of Both Worlds Tour, reflecting on her numerous emotions about an ex-boyfriend. She claimed her {{use of the word}} [...] "hate" [...] demonstrated how furious she was, at the time. Originally, [...] "7 Things" [...] was more [...] "soft and nice" [...] but Cyrus says she [...] "went nuts" [...] during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound. She decided to record a cover version of Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] from the album She's <b>So</b> <b>Unusual</b> (1983), after speaking with Lauper at the 50th Grammy Awards. The two singers were conversing about music, when Lauper stated, [...] "Well, don't be scared of anything. People waste their lives being scared. Lasso the moon. But don't do it because someone tells you it's the right idea." [...] Cyrus believed Lauper's saying encompassed the direction she wanted to take Breakout, ergo she covered [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun". However, she desired for the cover to be completely different from other covers of [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] she heard. She described the process as [...] "almost [...] to relearn the song." [...] About the finished product, Cyrus said, [...] "When you listen to the song, it's, like, you're not even sure what it is. It's something completely new." [...] "Full Circle" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Scott Cutler, and Anne Preven about Cyrus' relationship with Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers. [...] "It's about two people. They're always gonna come back together no matter what anyone says, the bad people that try to keep you apart", Cyrus said of the song's concept.|$|E
