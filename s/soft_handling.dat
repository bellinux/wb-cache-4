40|$|This thesis {{concerned}} {{the development of}} hydrophilic polysiloxan based softeners with strong adhesive properties. Functionalized polysiloxanes were designed and examined concerning their structure-response relationship on cotton and polyester fabrics. To ensure strong adhesive properties of the polysiloxanes two different binding concepts were investigated: first with covalent bonds and second with multiple hydrogen bonds. For the covalent binding concept in a first step comb-shaped PDMS-PEG were synthesized via hydrosilylation with poly(methyl hydrogen-stat-dimethyl siloxane) and poly(ethylene glycol) -monoallyl ether. Afterwards the hydroxy terminated PDMS-PEGs were functionalized with isocyanatopropyl triethoxysilane as binding moiety. Good adhesive properties were obtained with the customized polysiloxanes on cotton fabrics. Especially polysiloxanes with a high density of binding groups (PDMS-PEG 87 / 12 - 17 und 23 / 4 - 17) showed improved adhesive bond strength with triethoxysilane. The polysiloxane layer on the fabric was between 4 - 9 nm and increased with rising hydrophobicity of the polysiloxanes. Based on high polymer chain flexibility and only minor intermolecular interactions the polysiloxanes improved the <b>soft</b> <b>handle</b> of cotton fabric. The PDMS-PEGs with big polymer chain loops (100 / 4 - 7, 100 / 4. - 17, 91 / 8 - 7, 91 /- 8 - 17 und 87 / 12 - 7) enhanced the <b>soft</b> <b>handle</b> significantly compared to the raw fabric. In particular the deformability of the fabrics, determined by the inner softness of a yarn, {{was influenced by the}} polysiloxanes. The hydrophilic properties of treated fabrics were measured by absorbance and rising properties of water. With higher HLB value of the polysiloxanes the hydrophilic properties of the treated fabrics increased. After the application of the polysiloxanes with a portion up to 60 vol% PDMS (23 / 4 - 7, 23 / 4 - 17, 30 / 9 - 10 und 87 / 12 - 17) the hydrophilic properties of cotton fabric was not diminished. Systematically varying polysiloxane properties such as the molecular weight, the density and length of hydrophilic sidechains yielded in PDMS-PEG 87 / 12 - 17, a polysiloxane featuring good <b>soft</b> <b>handle</b> together with adequate hydrophilic properties. The second binding concept, adhesion by hydrogen bonds, stands out due to their broad field of binding applications on various surfaces. Two different comb shaped polysiloxanes were prepared either with the coupler phenylchloroformiate or epoxy as terminal groups. Subsequently, the end groups of these starting compounds were functionalized with 2 -(1 -aminoethyl) imidazolidinone, the final binding group. The epoxide based synthesis proofed to be faster and more efficient. The functional polysiloxane formed a stable layer of about 5 nm on polyester fabric. In particular the polysiloxane 87 / 12 with a high density of binding groups was evenly applied to polyester fabric with an excellent permanence. The adhesive properties of PDMS-PEG 91 / 8 - 6 - 4 were improved with imidazolidinone functionalization compared to the previously hydroxyl functionalized polysiloxanes. Via the epoxide strategy prepared polysiloxanes showed with and without imidazolidinone comparably adhesive properties. Maybe the interactions between epoxides and fabric were sufficient for permanent adherence. The <b>soft</b> <b>handle</b> of polyester fabrics was significantly improved by applying imidazolidinone functionalized polysiloxanes such as polysiloxane 100 / 4, 91 / 8, 87 / 12 and 23 / 4. As observed for cotton the fabrics were easier to deform in accordance with <b>softer</b> <b>handle.</b> The application of imidazolidinone functionalized polysiloxanes did not lead to higher hydrophobicity of polyester fabrics. A high density of imidazolidinone (D:Dx < 4 : 1) rather enhanced the hydrophilicity. More than 40 vol% PEG (30 / 9 - 10 and 78 / 6 / 4) improved the hydrophilicity even further. Concluding the hydrogen bond based concept, the imidazolidinon functionalized polysiloxane 87 / 12 stood out by an even application and good durability on polyester fabric. The results of hydrophilicity and <b>soft</b> <b>handle</b> were comparably well for imidazolidinon functionalized polysiloxanes prepared via the epoxide route. To further increase the hydrophilicity a combination of PEG- and epoxy functional side chains is imaginable, where the epoxy functional chains are modified with the binding group. First experiments with such a polysiloxane 78 / 6 / 4 showed very good hydrophilic properties on polyester fabrics...|$|R

40|$|A {{low torque}} {{spinning}} method has been recently developed by integrating the ring spinning process with false twisting techniques. As {{a result of}} false twist and true twist, a novel single yarn of low torque and <b>soft</b> <b>handle</b> is generated. Based on the similar spinning principle, this paper proposed a 2 -step spinning method, which is composed of twisting-anduntwisting operation and {{can be considered as}} a variant of the low torque spinning method. The proposed spinning method separates the false twisting process into twisting and untwisting processes which are combined in one step in the low torque spinning method. In this paper, physical properties of yarns produced by the proposed spinning method were evaluated and compared with the conventional yarns. Influences of various spinning parameters on the properties of 2 -step yarns were also examined. Furthermore, a systematic study of the physical properties of the 2 -step yarns and resultant fabrics with respect to the conventional and low torque ones was carried out. The experimental results showed that the 2 -step yarns exhibit slightly higher tenacity, lower wet snarl and much less hairiness than the conventional yarns, which, however, are inferior to the low torque yarns, particularly the evenness. The fabrics made by the 2 -step yarns show the <b>softest</b> <b>handle</b> feeling, best airpermeability and moderate spirality angle with acceptable pilling resistance.

Our previous {{studies showed that}} this technology can be applied for producing coarse modified yarns (7 - 32 Ne) with improved yarn and fabric performance. The present paper extends the work for the production and optimization of modified yarns at a fine yarn count (80 Ne). Compared with the conventional ring spinning system, the modified system presents a different and complicated spinning condition in terms of yarn tension and twist distributions, {{as well as the}} interaction between the false twisting device and conventional ring frame.

40|$|Yarn {{structure}} {{plays an}} important role in determining the properties of spun yarns. Recently, a modified spinning technique has been developed for producing a low torque and <b>soft</b> <b>handle</b> singles yarn by modifying the fiber arrangement in a yarn. Comparative studies revealed that the finer modified yarns possess significantly higher strength and lower hairiness over the conventional yarns of the same twist level, implying a different structure of finer modified yarn. Thus this paper aims to quantitatively study the structures of the finer conventional and modified cotton yarn (80 Ne) produced at the same twist level. Various measuring techniques, namely the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), cross section technique and tracer fiber technique, are adopted to analyze their structural characteristics, including fiber configuration, fiber spatial orientation angle, fiber packing density, yarn surface appearance, and fiber migration behavior. Results showed that finer modified yarns exhibit a smoother surface and much more compact structure with less hairiness. The fibers in the finer modified yarn have a complicated fiber path with relatively lower fiber radial position, larger migration frequency and magnitudes. In addition, it was noted that 73 % of fibers in the finer conventional yarn follow concentric conical helix, which is contrary to those in the coarser conventional yarn. The analyses conducted in this paper provide deep insights into the mechanism of modified spinning technique and evidential explanations on the difference of properties between the finer conventional and modified yarns.
