5000|$|The {{two bodies}} that Henley had insisted were still buried {{on the beach}} may have been those of Mark Scott and Joseph Lyles. In light of {{developments}} relating to the identifications of victims, the body of Scott still lies undiscovered at High Island, while Lyles' remains were only found by chance in 1983. Had the search for bodies continued, both victims would have likely been discovered. Following Hurricane Ike in 2008, the area of High Island Beach where Corll {{is known to have}} buried his victims remains submerged, leaving a strong possibility that Scott's body will never be found. [...] "How that man was able to go out to that storage <b>shed,</b> <b>time</b> after time, and bury one more dead boy is something I'll never understand. You get close to evil like that, no matter how long ago it was, and it never leaves you." [...] Detective David Mullican, recollecting the Houston Mass Murders, April 2011. Former workers at the Corll Candy Company recalled Corll doing a lot of digging in the years leading up to 1968, when his mother's third marriage was deteriorating and the firm was failing. Corll stated he was burying spoiled candy to avoid contamination by insects. He subsequently cemented over the floor. He was also observed digging in waste ground that was later converted into a car park. Former Corll Candy Company employees also recalled that Corll had rolls of clear plastic of precisely the same type used to bury his victims. Moreover, co-workers at HL&P would also state that, from the earliest days of his employment, Corll had repeatedly retained coils of used nylon cord which would otherwise have been discarded. This brand of cord was the same type used to strangle and bind the bodies of many of his victims. The suspicion is that Corll may have begun killing much earlier than 1970, and may also have been abusing youths prior to this date.|$|E

40|$|Questions: Under what climatic {{conditions}} is long leaf longevity, or evergreen-ness, favoured? Under what physiological conditions of leaves is long leaf longevity, or evergreen-ness, favoured? Why is evergreen-ness favoured in both tropical and frigid regions? What {{is the difference}} in biological meaning of evergreen-ness between tropical and frigid regions? Mathematical method: Optimization with two variables, expansion and <b>shedding</b> <b>times</b> of leaves. The objective function for optimality {{is the amount of}} assimilating product per unit time of an individual leaf. We obtained the optimal expansion and <b>shedding</b> <b>times</b> of leaves by numerical calculation. Key assumptions: (1) Air temperature varies seasonally with average temperature and the amplitude (climatic condition). (2) The key parameters of a leaf are construction cost, photosynthetic rate, and ageing rate (physiological condition). (3) A leaf adopts the optimal strategies of expansion and <b>shedding</b> <b>times</b> both under various {{climatic conditions}} and physiological conditions. Predictions: (1) There are two climatic conditions in which evergreen-ness is optimal. The first is where average temperature is over 30 °C and the amplitude is very small, as in the tropics. The other is in cold regions, such as a frigid area. (2) Low maximum photosynthetic rate and high construction cost are likely to select for evergreen leaves...|$|R

40|$|The natural {{reservoir}} of influenza A virus is waterfowl, particularly dabbling ducks (genus Anas). Although {{it has long}} been assumed that waterfowl are asymptomatic carriers of the virus, a recent study found that low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) infection in Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) negatively affected stopover time, body mass and feeding behaviour. In the present study, we investigated whether LPAI infection incurred ecological or physiological costs to migratory mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in terms of body mass loss and staging time, and whether such costs could influence the likelihood for long-distance dispersal of the avian influenza virus by individual ducks. During the autumn migrations of 2002 - 2007, we collected faecal samples (n = 10 918) and biometric data from mallards captured and banded at Ottenby, a major staging site in a flyway connecting breeding and wintering areas of European waterfowl. Body mass was significantly lower in infected ducks than in uninfected ducks (mean difference almost 20 g over all groups), and the amount of virus shed by infected juveniles was negatively correlated with body mass. There was no general effect of infection on staging time, except for juveniles in September, in which birds that shed fewer viruses stayed shorter than birds that shed more viruses. LPAI infection did not affect speed or distance of subsequent migration. The data from recaptured individuals showed that the maximum duration of infection was on average 8. 3 days (s. e. 0. 5), with a mean minimum duration of virus shedding of only 3. 1 days (s. e. 0. 1). <b>Shedding</b> <b>time</b> decreased during the season, suggesting that mallards acquire transient immunity for LPAI infection. In conclusion, deteriorated body mass following infection was detected, but {{it remains to be seen}} whether this has more long-term fitness effects. The short virus <b>shedding</b> <b>time</b> suggests that individual mallards are less likely to spread the virus at continental or intercontinental scales...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Energy is {{the basic}} {{necessity}} for the economic development of a country. Many functions necessary to present-day living grind to halt when the supply of energy stops. It is practically impossible to estimate the actual magnitude of the role that energy has played in building up present-day civilization. In this modern world, the dependence on electricity is {{so much that it}} has become a PART & PARCEL of our life. So we need to save more & more electrical power. Hence, the load shedding control system, which was earlier done manually, now-a-days, is controlled by a computer based system, developed to some more extent to direct the society to a more convenient life. This paper focuses on developing a computerized procedure for controlling the load-shedding system where manual work will be minimized by selecting the feeder, substation and duration of <b>shedding</b> <b>time</b> by the user. Simulation results’, using the above proposed model, verifies the suitability of choosing such an automated load shedding system...|$|R

Inspired by the millimetric bumps of the Namib Desert beetle, here we report the identified role of radius of curvature and width of bumps with homogeneous surface wettability in growth rate, coalescence and transport of water droplets. Further rational design of asymmetric convex topography and synergetic combination with slippery coating simultaneously enable self-transport, leading to unseen five-fold higher growth rate and an order of magnitude faster <b>shedding</b> <b>time</b> of droplets compared to superhydrophobic surfaces.

40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study of the infection dynamics of Salmonella enterica was carried out with three Danish farrow-to-finish swine herds. To account for variations in Salmonella <b>shedding</b> over <b>time,</b> litters from each herd {{were divided into two}} cohorts. Each cohort consisted of 30 pigs, for a total of 180 pigs. Pigs were individually monitored by monthly bacteriologic and serologic examinations from weaning to slaughter. At weaning, individual sows were examined bacteriologically and serologically. At slaughter, cecal contents, ileocecal lymph nodes, and carcass swab samples were obtained from 131 pigs. A total of 88 pigs were found to be shedding Salmonella on one or more occasions. Only the Salmonella serotype Typhimurium was detected during the study period. At weaning, no sows or piglets were found to be shedding, but a serological reaction was detected in 11 sows. The prevalence in culture peaked in the nursery and subsequently declined to undetectable levels before slaughter. The seroprevalence peaked approximately 60 days after the peak prevalence in culture. Salmonella was detected in individual fecal samples at least once in 53 % of the pigs, and 62 % of the pigs were seropositive more than once. Only 3. 7 % of all pigs were found to be culture positive on more than one occasion. Piglets from seroreacting sows had a significantly (P = 0. 0339) lower probability of shedding in the nursery. Under the assumption that shedding lasted at least 1 or 2 weeks, the average <b>shedding</b> <b>time</b> was estimated to have been 18 or 26 days. An association between serology, on-farm bacteriology, and Salmonella prevalence in culture at slaughter was shown.

40|$|AbstractThe {{shedding}} {{of human}} rhinovirus (HRV) after an acute, naturally acquired infection {{has not been}} described in detail. We determined the duration of HRV shedding in immunocompetent children and adults, and in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinaemia. Subjects with symptoms of respiratory tract infection, and their household contacts, were screened for HRV by reverse transcription PCR. They were followed by serial, self-collected nasal swab specimens until negative for HRV or infected by another HRV type. We followed 62 HRV infections in 54 subjects. The mean (95 % CI) duration of HRV shedding was 11. 4 (8. 2 – 14. 7) days in children, 10. 1 (7. 4 – 12. 9) days in adults, and 40. 9 (26. 4 – 55. 4) days in patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia (p < 0. 001). The duration of respiratory tract symptoms correlated with the duration of virus shedding (p 0. 002). A new infection by another HRV type soon after the first episode was common. We conclude that the <b>shedding</b> <b>times</b> of HRV are relatively short in otherwise healthy individuals. In contrast, prolonged shedding over 28 days is frequent in patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia despite immunoglobulin replacement therapy...|$|R

40|$|Background:  From May-July 2011, Germany {{experienced}} a large Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) O 104 :H 4 outbreak. Our {{objective was to}} identify the prevalence of STEC O 104 :H 4 carriers in households in highly affected areas, the rate of secondary household transmissions, and the duration of long-term shedding. Methods:  In a cross-sectional study, we recruited case and control households to determine STEC household prevalence; we then conducted a prospective cohort study (≥ 2 -persons households with ≥ 1 case) for rates of household transmission and shedding duration. Results:  For part 1, we recruited 57 case households (62 cases and 93 household contacts) and 36 control households (89 household members). We only detected cases in previously known case households and identified 1 possible adult-to-adult household transmission. For part 2, we followed 14 households and 20 carriers. No secondary household transmission was detected in the prospective follow-up. The longest prolonged shedding lasted > 7 months, however, median estimated <b>shedding</b> <b>time</b> was 10 - 14 days (95 % CI: 0 - 33 days). Three carriers showed intermittent shedding.
