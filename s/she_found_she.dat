500|$|Shikasta was {{intended}} to be a [...] "single self-contained book", but as Lessing's fictional universe developed, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>she</b> had ideas for more than just one book, and ended up writing a series of five. Shikasta, and the Canopus in Argos series as a whole, fall into the category of soft science fiction ("space fiction" [...] in Lessing's own words) due to their focus on characterization and social and cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of science and technology. Robert Alter of The New York Times suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre literary critic Northrop Frye called the [...] "anatomy", which is [...] "a combination of fantasy and morality". Gore Vidal placed Lessing's [...] "science fiction" [...] "somewhere between John Milton and L. Ron Hubbard".|$|E
500|$|After her {{retirement}} {{in the early}} 1980s, Hudson started to {{study the effects of}} nuclear bombs and radiation on the environment and people; because of what <b>she</b> <b>found,</b> <b>she</b> subsequently focused her ministry on peace and protesting nuclear proliferation. In 1983, she protested the introduction of nuclear cruise missiles to Michigan. In 1990, she was arrested and imprisoned for 6 months for illegally accessing a bunker on Wurtsmith Air Force Base and painting [...] "Christ lives, Disarm" [...] on the side of it. Hudson had a strong belief that she was doing the right thing and living out her faith, and stated that [...] " [...] put life before the law." [...] In this, she was acting upon a determination by her congregation that the members were free to take social stands about which they felt deeply as individuals, without, however, representing the congregation.|$|E

500|$|Constantine {{originally}} did {{a year of}} Montessori training {{after she}} had left school but she then moved onto other projects such as studying sculpture in Brussels. She later said of this time that she [...] "lost [...] virginity, went a bit mad." [...] Constantine had taught children for three years, and also worked as a shop girl for Harrods. She found the job, in her own words, [...] "boring" [...] and even tried shoplifting {{for the sake of}} excitement, but she has since expressed admiration for shop girls. Constantine's love for horses had inspired her to become a mounted policewoman in London, but was deterred when <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>she</b> was required to do four years walking the beat. She wrote a book about present giving, which prompted The Daily Telegraph to write a hostile article implying she had never done a day's work in her life, something which deeply upset her. She has stated defiantly [...] "I've always worked." ...|$|E

2500|$|That same fall, Karen {{enrolled}} at Downey High School, where <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>she</b> {{had a knack}} for playing the drums. She had initially tried playing the glockenspiel, but had been inspired by her friend Frankie Chavez, who had been drumming since he was three. She became enthusiastic about the drums, and began to learn complex pieces, such as Dave Brubeck's [...] "Take Five". Chavez persuaded her parents to buy a Ludwig drum kit in late 1964, and she began lessons with local jazz players, including how to read concert music. She quickly replaced the entry-level kit with a large Ludwig set that was a similar set-up to Brubeck's drummer, Joe Morello. Richard and Karen gave their first public performance together in 1965, as part of the pit band for a local production of Guys and Dolls.|$|E

2500|$|During {{a behind-the-scenes}} video posted by Neighbours, Phillipps hinted that Daniel could find romance with {{established}} character Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow), {{who was in}} a relationship with Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) at the time. Phillipps later said that Daniel and Amber would become friends, as they bond over their shared love for photography. When Josh began to worry about Daniel's intentions towards his girlfriend, Daniel was [...] "able to put Josh at ease". He and Amber were honest about their connection and passed it off as platonic love. A few weeks later, Amber and Daniel almost shared a kiss, as she started to fall out of love with Josh. Rosenow explained that Amber was attracted to Daniel's caring side and liked how he noticed things about her that Josh never had. When it became difficult for them to be apart, they spent the afternoon together, which resulted in their near kiss. With Amber feeling guilty about betraying Josh, she decided to break-up with him, but when he made a romantic gesture, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>she</b> could not go through with it.|$|E
2500|$|She was {{the fourth}} woman in the United States to obtain a pilot's certificate, which she earned on 24 July 1912, {{at the age of}} 21, while {{residing}} in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Initially, she planned to get her certificate and use money she earned from exhibition flying to pay for her music lessons. However, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>she</b> liked flying so much that she gave up her piano career and decided to become an aviator. In January 1911, Stinson went to St. Louis to take flight lessons from Tony Jannus who only allowed her to fly as a passenger. She then took flying lessons from the well-known aviator Max Lillie, a pilot for the Wright Brothers, who initially refused to teach her because she was female. But she persuaded him to give her a trial lesson. She was so good that she flew alone after only four hours of instruction. A year after receiving her certificate, she began exhibition flying. On the exhibition circuit, she was known as the [...] "Flying Schoolgirl." [...] Katherine Stinson tried to tell newspaper reporters she was actually 21, not 16, but they refused to believe her.|$|E
60|$|And now, Mr Wegg {{at length}} pushed away his plate {{and put on}} his spectacles, and Mr Boffin lighted his pipe and looked with beaming eyes into the opening world before him, and Mrs Boffin {{reclined}} in a fashionable manner on her sofa: as one who {{would be part of}} the audience if <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>she</b> could, and would go to sleep if <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>she</b> couldn't.|$|E
