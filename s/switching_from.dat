5|$|NASA's Space Shuttle used 400,000 feet (76mi, 122km) as its {{re-entry}} altitude (termed the Entry Interface), which roughly {{marks the}} boundary where atmospheric drag becomes noticeable, thus beginning {{the process of}} <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> steering with thrusters to maneuvering with air surfaces.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> private transport to public transport.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} solve this problem, we propose to {{announce}} the mode switch as the concatenation of two switches we have discussed previously, namely a <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> MODE 3 to MODE 1 followed by a <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> MODE 1 to MODE 2. This means that when a node <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> MODE 3 to MODE 2 it has to send two update entries, contained in the same update message.|$|R
5|$|In 1913, Phoenix {{adopted a}} new form of government, <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> the mayor-council system to the council-manager system, {{making it one of the}} first cities in the United States with this form of city government, where a city manager supervises all city {{departments}} and executes the policies adopted by the Council. Today, Phoenix represents the largest municipal government of this type in the country.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 2007, a Green Line train {{carrying}} approximately 120 people derailed {{near the}} Mount Vernon Square station in downtown Washington. Trains were single-tracking at the time, and the derailment {{of the fifth}} car occurred where the train was <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> the south to northbound track. The crash injured at least 18 people and prompted the rescue of 60 people from a tunnel. At least one person had a serious but non-life-threatening injury.|$|E
5|$|The 98%-ish {{complete}} beta and {{an earlier}} version were eventually leaked and made playable. Soon afterward, an unofficial restoration effort known as Chrono Trigger: Flames of Eternity became popular and aimed to fully complete the game's development, <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> using the earlier version as a base to the latest released version. While it received heavy criticism from the first developers and a very mixed reaction from the fan base {{for some of the}} changes, it nonetheless is the most stable version of the game and is under active development.|$|E

5|$|The {{common eland}} is {{sometimes}} farmed and hunted for its meat, {{and in some}} cases can be better used than cattle because it is more suited to African climates.

According to an advertisement in the Moving Picture News, the weekly release dates were changed at the request of exhibitors.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} controversy regarding Holden's decision {{to retain the}} Commodore name for the 2018 model, despite it being dimensionally smaller than its predecessor, lacking a V8 engine option and <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> a RWD to a FWD drivetrain. Whilst the decision has been {{considered to be a}} safe choice in order to preserve sales, the retention of the Commodore name has been critiqued for Holden missing the opportunity to rebrand its sedan range and push its offering into the more lucrative semi-premium end of the market.|$|E

5|$|Grandmaster Flash {{suggests}} that Herc {{may not have}} kept pace with developments in techniques of cueing (lining up a record to play at a certain place on it). Developments changed techniques of cutting (<b>switching</b> <b>from</b> one record to another) and scratching (moving the record by hand to and fro under the stylus for percussive effect) in the late 1970s. Herc said he retreated from the scene after being stabbed at the Executive Playhouse while trying to intercede in a fight, and the burning down {{of one of his}} venues. In 1980, Herc had stopped DJing and was working in a record shop in South Bronx.|$|E
5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). When <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications. The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Adlertag did not deter the Luftwaffe from {{continuing}} its campaign. The assault against RAF airfields continued throughout August and into September 1940. The battles involved {{large numbers of}} aircraft and heavy losses on both sides. The Luftwaffe failed to develop any focused strategy for defeating RAF Fighter Command. At first, it attempted to destroy RAF bases, then switched to strategic bombing by day and night. It tried to achieve the destruction of several British industries at the same time, <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> bombing aircraft factories, to attacking supporting industries, import or distribution networks such as coastal ports. An attempt was even made against unrelated targets, such as destroying {{the morale of the}} British population.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} whether the <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> fixing to continuous trading or the use of a liquidity provider agreement improves volume on Alternext. The sample period ranges from May 2, 2006 to April 28, 2008. It includes 32 companies that <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> fixing to continuous trading and 25 companies that signed a liquidity provider agreement. The empirical study indicates that the <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> fixing to continuous trading was successful with respect to the number of shares traded. However, liquidity provider agreements do not significantly improve volume...|$|R

5|$|The {{opening of}} {{this stretch of}} SR52 had many effects on the {{transportation}} of the East County region. Traffic decreased significantly on I-8 in early 1994, with an estimated 30,000 commuters <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> I-8 to SR52. Fewer cars traveled on {{the western part of}} Mission Gorge Road, leading to a decrease in revenue for businesses located along that road. On Mast Boulevard and Mission Gorge Road in Santee, much more traffic was present, leading to residents complaining to the city. In 1998, the city began to widen Mission Gorge Road between Carlton Hills Drive and Fanita Road to handle the extra traffic from the incomplete SR52.|$|E
5|$|After the nationalization, {{the company}} started a {{renovation}} {{process of the}} infrastructure and rolling stock. Combined with a municipal policy of low fares, the company started going with a loss. Five new trams were delivered from 1948 to 1952, and built at the depot at Holtet, with used equipment {{from some of the}} older trams. An additional nine new trams were delivered between 1952 and 1955. Five additional trams were rebuilt from 1955 to 1960, by which time all the narrow trams had been rebuilt or retired. The use of a unique voltage gave operational difficulties, as fuses could regularly blow at Oslo Hospital if errors were made while <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> the one supply to the other. In addition, all the trams were custom-built with extra equipment with limited spare parts. All the trams delivered during the 1950s were built so they could later be converted to only use 600 volt supply. The depot was expanded in 1952.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2000, SFI, {{the owner}} of the Litten Tree bar chain, {{announced}} a £31.6 million takeover of Slug and Lettuce, paid for in shares, and McKenzie left the chain in order to pursue new challenges. By this time the chain had 32 outlets. According to analysts, the chain was too small and had too much debt to survive alone. SFI refurbished a number of their existing pubs under the Slug and Lettuce concept, and by 2004 the chain had 56 outlets. In 2005, SFI attempted to reposition the chain as an upmarket place to eat, in anticipation of the forthcoming smoking ban. In June 2005 SFI went into administration, and sold 98 of its 150 outlets to the Laurel Pub Company, controlled by Robert Tchenguiz, for £80 million. In 2008 Laurel itself collapsed, and the Slug chain became a part of the Bay Restaurant Group, later Town & City Pub Company. The chain has withdrawn from a number of locations, including Glasgow and Cardiff, leaving it with only one location in Scotland, and no presence in Wales. In 2010, Town & City began to refurbish the outlets, <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> a brown colour scheme to aubergine and updating upholstery and lighting. In June 2011 Town & City merged with the Stonegate Pub Company.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1938 season, the Victorian Football Association (VFA), the second-tier senior {{football}} {{competition in}} the state, made an ambitious break from tradition in what was ultimately a successful ploy to improve its popularity: it legalised throwing the ball in general play and made a few other rule changes to create a distinct and faster variation of Australian rules football, and ended the legal framework which required players to obtain a clearance when <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> the VFL to the VFA (or vice versa). On March 31, Nash caused a sensation when {{he became the first}} VFL player to defect under this schism, transferring from South Melbourne to Camberwell without a clearance. Nash was already one of the highest paid players in the VFL, but accepted an offer of £8/week to captain-coach the Camberwell Football Club, £3/week to captain-coach the sub-district Camberwell Cricket Club and a job as a Camberwell Council official.|$|E
5|$|The A5 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system. Toll charged along the A5 route between Osijek and the Sredanci interchange depends on the route traveled and ranges from 4.00 kuna (0.54 euro) to 30.00 kuna (4.05 euro) for passenger cars and 13.00 kuna (1.76 euro) to 98.00 kuna (13.24 euro) for semi-trailer trucks. Motorcycles are charged {{approximately half of the}} passenger car rate. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and a number of prepaid toll collection systems. The latter include smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an electronic toll collection system which is used by motorways across Croatia, with discounted rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. Toll collection systems along the A5 and A3 are unified; vehicles <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> one motorway to the other at Sredanci, for example, do not pass toll plazas at the interchange.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{passengers}} decreased from 12.3 million passengers in 1947 to 4.4 million in 1949, due to passengers <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> SIRT to city-operated buses due to a bus fare cut. On September 5, 1948, 237 of the previous 492 weekday trains were cut; the express service would be reduced during rush hours, and all night trains after 1:29 A. M. would be cancelled. Thirty percent of the company's personnel were laid off. On September 7, 1948, Staten Island Borough President Cornelius Hall continued to rally against the cuts made by the SIRT at a Public Service Commission hearing in Manhattan. Commuters testified that trains were missing connections to ferry boats and that some trains were being held at the Saint George Terminal in the rush hour to wait for two boatloads of passengers. Previously, they said, the trains pulled out with only one boatload of passengers. On September 13, 1948, the SIRT agreed to add four trains, and to extend the schedule of four others. On September 22, 1948, the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed the SIRT to abandon the ferry it had operated for 88 years between Tottenville and Perth Amboy, New Jersey; the ferry operation was transferred to Sunrise Ferries, Inc of Elizabeth, New Jersey on October 16.|$|E
