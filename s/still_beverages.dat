40|$|An interlaboratory {{comparison}} {{was carried out}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a method based on HPTLC in which reagent-free derivatization is followed by UV/fluorescence detection. The method was tested for the determination of sucralose (C 12 H 19 Cl 3 O 8; (2 R, 3 R, 4 R, 5 S, 6 R) - 2 -[(2 R, 3 S, 4 S, 5 S) - 2, 5 -bis(chloromethyl) - 3, 4 -dihydroxyoxolan- 2 -yl]oxy- 5 -chloro- 6 -hydroxymethyl) oxane- 3, 4 -diol; CAS Registry No. 56038 - 13 - 2) in carbonated and <b>still</b> <b>beverages</b> at the proposed European regulatory limits. For <b>still</b> <b>beverages,</b> a portion of the sample was diluted with methanol¿water. For carbonated beverages, a portion of the sample was degassed in an ultrasonic bath before dilution. Turbid beverages were filtered after dilution through an HPLC syringe filter. The separation of sucralose was performed by direct application on amino-bonded (NH 2) silica gel HPTLC plates (no cleanup needed) with the mobile phase acetonitrile¿water. Sucralose was determined after reagent-free derivatization at 190 °C; it was quantified by measurements of both UV absorption and fluorescence. The samples, both spiked and containing sucralose, were sent to 14 laboratories in five different countries. Test portions of a sample found to contain no sucralose were spiked at levels of 30. 5, 100. 7, and 299 mg/L. Recoveries ranged from 104. 3 to 124. 6 % and averaged 112 % for determination by UV detection; recoveries ranged from 98. 4 to 101. 3 % and averaged 99. 9 % for determination by fluorescence detection. On the basis of the results for spiked samples (blind duplicates at three levels), as well as sucralosecontaining samples (blind duplicates at three levels and one split level), the values for the RSDr ranged from 10. 3 to 31. 4 % for determinations by UV detection and from 8. 9 to 15. 9 % for determinations by fluorescence detection. The values for the RSDR values ranged from 13. 5 to 31. 4 % for determinations by UV detection and from 8. 9 to 20. 7 % for determinations by fluorescence detection. JRC.

50|$|Fetal alcohol {{syndrome}} (FAS) is {{categorized as}} a group of birth defects ranging from mental retardation to various growth and behavioral problems. The March of Dimes has provided grant funding for FAS research, and they supported the National Council on Alcoholism in its push for legislation to bring public attention to the dangers of alcohol use by pregnant women.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a detailed {{examination of the}} change in public attitudes toward the control, or prohibition, of the sale and consumption of beverage alcohol in Saskatchewan. These attitudes changed dramatically, resulting first in implementation and then the failure of prohibition. The thesis examines the early attempts to restrict the liquor traffic in Canada, before focusing on Saskatchewan. It notes the particular problems associated with the bars in the province, and the increasing demand for more restrictive controls on these establishments. Before World War I support for tougher liquor regulations were limited. Only a small but vocal group demanded decisive action by the provincial government. These prohibitionists took advantage of wartime patriotism to gamer enough support to defeat the liquor interests in a provincial plebiscite in 1916. This vote prompted the government to enact prohibitory legislation which prohibitionists felt would alleviate many of the ills that plagued society. The promise of improved conditions never materialized because of severe enforcement difficulties. The inability of the federal and provincial governments to harmonize legislation, the aptitude and success of those circumventing the liquor laws, and the lack of co-operation {{on the part of the}} public, contributed to the continuance of poor conditions throughout the province. When residents realized the relative ease with which one could <b>still</b> procure <b>beverage</b> alcohol, and risk of prosecution to be minimal, many continued to drink. For the people in Saskatchewan, prohibition created more problems than it solved. Letters to the various Premiers, files from the various agencies formed to enforce the liquor laws, and various provincial newspapers, all clearly indicate the strong dissatisfaction residents felt about conditions that resulted from prohibition. The government, too, recognized the problems that the implementation of prohibitory legislation brought with it, but its hands were tied because it was acting on the wishes of the people. In the end, however, it was these same people that put a stop to the prohibition experiment...|$|R
