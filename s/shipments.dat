40|$|In many {{practical}} situations {{the coordination}} of transportation management and inventory management may lead to considerable cost reductions. Transportation management includes the application {{of different types of}} <b>shipment</b> consolidation policies. <b>Shipment</b> consolidation takes into account the logistics strategy of combining two or more <b>shipment</b> orders to optimize transportation. When the <b>shipment</b> consolidation policy changes, the <b>shipment</b> lead time changes as well and if the lead time changes, the inventory policy needs to be re-evaluated, since changing lead times affect customer service. In this paper the lead time comprises two elements: waiting time due to order consolidation and the <b>shipment</b> time. The lead time is an important parameter for inventory management. We derive approximations for the lead time behaviour in (s,nQ) models where the items are consolidated according to different types of consolidation policies...|$|R
