25|$|Twinning is the intergrowth {{of two or}} more crystal of {{a single}} mineral species. The {{geometry}} of the twinning is controlled by the mineral's symmetry. As a result, there are several types of twins, including contact twins, reticulated twins, geniculated twins, penetration twins, cyclic twins, and polysynthetic twins. Contact, or simple twins, consist of two crystals joined at a plane; this type of twinning is common in spinel. Reticulated twins, common in rutile, are interlocking crystals resembling netting. Geniculated twins have a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the twin. Penetration twins consist of two single crystals that have grown into each other; examples of this twinning include cross-shaped <b>staurolite</b> twins and Carlsbad twinning in orthoclase. Cyclic twins are caused by repeated twinning around a rotation axis. It occurs around three, four, five, six, or eight-fold axes, and the corresponding patterns are called threelings, fourlings, fivelings, sixlings, and eightlings. Sixlings are common in aragonite. Polysynthetic twins are similar to cyclic twinning by the presence of repetitive twinning; however, instead of occurring around a rotational axis, it occurs along parallel planes, usually on a microscopic scale.|$|E

A presentation of the condition of the nonmetallic mineral resources is done with a compilation approach, and the given data are result of the various types of geological research, done continuously during a long period of time. A special attention will be paid to the economical significant locations, and for some of them there will be a suggestion of perspective areas for further research. The nonmetallic mineral resources are mostly located in the range of the Pelagonian massif (locations and presence of feldspars,micas, marbles, marble onyx, dysten, <b>staurolites,</b> granites, syenites, diatomaceous earth, etc.) but there are also many other locations which are not equally located and other geotectonic units, like bentonite, secondary quartzite, native sulfur, opalites, etc., (Serbian-Macedonian massif), then the talc, marl, travertine, etc., (Vardar area), plaster, marbles, etc., (Western Macedonian area). ...|$|R
40|$|The present area {{covers a}} part of the axial zone of the Hesperian Massif. Rocks of {{metamorphic}} and intrusive origin occur in three structural units: the central zone (which in fact forms part of what is called the “blastomylonitic graben”), the migmatic complex and the rocks in the S and SW. During the Hercynian orogeny these units were placed in juxtaposition. With respect to their age and composition the rocks can be subdivided into pre-Hercynian metasediments, metabasic rocks and orthogneisses, and Hercynian migmatites, palingenic granites and intrusive granodiorites, granites, pegmatites, aplites, quartz veins, granite porphyries, lamprophyres and olivine dolerites. Based on penological evidence, the geological history can be reconstructed as follows: Pre-Hercynian metasediments, bearing traces of a probably Precambrian deformation and metamorphism (resorbed <b>staurolites</b> and garnets enclosed in Hercynian metamorphic minerals) have intruded along fundamental N-S trending faults in the Upper Ordovician (460 - 430 x 106 years ago) by means of megacrystal-bearing two-mica granites, biotite granites and peralkaline granites. The intrusion of a basic dyke-swarm took place between the emplacements of the latter two types of granite series. During the Hercynian orogeny the pre-Hercynian rocks were at first penetratively deformed; the metasediments were (re) - folded and the granites were phyllonitized into coarse-grained augengneisses or mylonitized into granite mylonites (central zone). This Hercynian main phase deformation was followed by a period of Abukuma-type plutonometamorphism. A widespread metablastic recrystallization of the non-migmatic rocks of the central zone is characteristic. The metamorphic mineral assemblages in the non-migmatic rocks of the central zone are indicative of the cordierite-amphibolite facies and the mineral assemblages of the metasedimentary rocks in the SW and W indicate greenschist facies conditions, while the inclusions in the palingenic two-mica granite suffered superimposed hornblende-hornfels facies conditions. At deeper levels the Hercynian metamorphism culminated in anatexis. During a short period of tension and normal faulting the non-migmatic rocks of the central zone were brought into juxtaposition with the migmatites. More or less synchronously the active fundamental faults, separating the central zone from the western migmatites facilitated the rise of large amounts of granodioritic magma; immediately afterwards the ultimate products of anatexis, in as much as they were capable of intrusion, penetrated the migmatic complex and the granodiorites in the form of successive phases of two-mica granites. This period of plutonic activity was interrupted by the second and third Hercynian deformations that were only locally of a penetrative nature. The majority of the Hercynian granites and granodiorites were weakly foliated during the second deformation while the third deformation locally phyllonitized and mylonitized the rocks in the N, SW and W. The Hercynian orogenic cycle was concluded with the intrusion of a post-kinematic two-mica granite, two biotite granites (280 ± 11 X 106 years ago), some granite porphyries and lamprophyres. The few olivine dolerite dykes are probably younger. Accessory zircon occurring in metasediments, orthogneisses, migmatites and granites has been investigated for crystal habit, growth phenomena, inclusions, resorption, fluorescence and other properties. The various rock-types contain zircon populations with a more or less typical habit: i. e. a combination of the forms { 101 }, { 100 } and /or { 110 } and sometimes { 301 } and { 201 } for the zircons of the blastomylonitic orthogneisses, the post-kinematic granites and granite porphyries, while a combination of { 101 }, { 211 } and { 100 } and/or { 110 } is characteristic for the pre-Hercynian coarse-grained augengneisses and the Hercynian megacrystal-bearing granodiorites and two-mica granites. The zircons in the rocks belonging to the megacrystal-bearing granodiorite series clearly show differences in evolution. The zircons in the migmatic rocks indicate that conditions for anatexis favoured the regeneration of zircon. The fluorescence colours of the zircon crystals are yellow, orange and brown; some zircon populations also contain emerald green fluorescent crystals. A zonal variation in fluorescence colours is also present...|$|R
