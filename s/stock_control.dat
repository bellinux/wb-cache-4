5|$|Fish {{hatcheries}} provide larval {{and juvenile}} fish, crustaceans and shellfish, {{for use in}} aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding <b>stock,</b> <b>control</b> of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this {{while at the same time}} maximising growth rates.|$|E

This bundle, together with OCP's <b>Stock</b> <b>Control,</b> Finance and Payroll systems, introduced small businesses to a streamlined, computerised operation. The most popular floppy disk systems (except in East Europe) were the DISCiPLE and +D systems released by Miles Gordon Technology in 1987 and 1988 respectively. Both systems had the ability to store memory images onto disk snapshots could later be used to restore the Spectrum to its exact previous state. They were both compatible with the Microdrive command syntax, which made porting existing software much simpler.|$|E
5|$|Casey's initial {{need was}} for {{engineer}} units {{to accomplish the}} daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of tractors, graders, concrete mixers and welding equipment. In {{the absence of a}} proper <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.|$|E

The study examined medical <b>stocks</b> <b>control</b> system, factors affecting performance and then propose ways for improvement {{of the performance of}} medical <b>stocks</b> <b>control</b> system at Dodoma Regional Hospital. In the study both primary and secondary data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and observations from 68 employees of DRH and 80 patients. Findings were analysed through qualitative techniques in which explanations were drawn, and the summary was drawn in frequency and percentage tables and figures with the use of SPSS and Excel programs. The results show that at DRH there are no fixed pre-established stock levels, order quantities, and ordering time for non-vertical programme items, and stock records are mainly kept in paper files. For non-vertical programme items, order quantities and ordering time are mainly determined basing on the available funds and stock balances while main determinant of ordering time and order quantities for items in vertical programme are stock balances and consumption rate. The results reveal that performance of medical <b>stocks</b> <b>control</b> system has been mostly affected by low information sharing among the individuals involved in the system, limited supply of items at Medical Stores Department (MSD), lack of computerised system and insufficient funds allocation. In order to improve the performance of medical <b>stocks</b> <b>control</b> system, DRH management needs to strengthen its information sharing system, undertake effective budgeting and funds allocation for medical stocks, purchase items missing at MSD from authorised suppliers of medical stocks as well as improve data management, supervisions and management follow-ups in the medical <b>stocks</b> <b>control</b> system...|$|R

2500|$|Originally {{incorporated}} as Model Aircraft (Bournemouth) Ltd on 8 November 1937, {{the company}} started with one store in Brighton in the 1930s. When this was sold after about 40 years {{under the same}} ownership, the store was bought {{in order to be}} [...] "a showroom for the importers of many prestige model ranges". Following success at this store, the new owners then began to purchase other shops, in Crawley, Eastbourne, Guildford and Maidstone, and brand them as Model Aerodrome. During the mid-90s a computerised <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> system was implemented, and in 1995 and 1996 respectively, the company opened stores in Croydon and Plymouth. In March 1999, after the opening of their eighth branch in Bluewater, Kent, the company expanded its range to include Scalextric and Corgi products, and with this expansion of their product line, changed their name to Modelzone. They then eventually acquired a number of stores formerly owned by the Beatties chain of model shops (which had closed when its parent company, ERA Group, placed it into administration).|$|E

40|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of apportioning growing stock across diameter classes in multi- or uneven-aged forests is estimating how closely the target stocking value compares to the maximum stocking that could occur in a particular forest type and eco-region. Although the BDQ method {{had been used to}} develop uneven-aged prescriptions, it is not inherently related to any maximum stocking guide. Adapting Stand Density Index (SDI) to uneven-aged silviculture by apportioning stocking equally in all diameter classes has been proposed. SDImax is the maximum stocking possible for a given species and region and provides a consistent and reliable benchmark on which to base silvicultural prescriptions, which can be expressed as a percentage of maximum SDI (%SDImax). However, allocating a consistent percentage of maximum SDI desired after thinning across all diameter classes raises or lowers the resulting stocking curve, but does not change its shape, as could be done by changing the Q value in BDQ <b>stocking</b> <b>control.</b> This results in high numbers of small trees being retained, regardless of the %SDImax prescribed, and has been a major criticism of using SDI-based <b>stocking</b> <b>control</b> for fuels treatment biomass estimates. The SDI-Flex procedure presented here combines the flexibility of the BDQ method with an SDI-based stocking guide. In this method, a Flex Factor can is used to proportionally reduce the amount of SDI assigned to successively smaller dbh classes. A simple spreadsheet program can be used to iteratively manipulate both the Flex Factor and %SDImax values to arrive at a desired stocking configuration for a particular silvicultural objective...|$|R
