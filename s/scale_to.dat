5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference. Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the wavelength of visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal end of each <b>scale,</b> <b>to</b> about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light, which {{are determined by the}} thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{solid-phase}} oligonucleotide synthesis {{is carried}} out automatically using computer-controlled instruments (oligonucleotide synthesizers) and is technically implemented in column, multi-well plate, and array formats. The column format is best suited for research and large scale applications where a high-throughput is not required. Multi-well plate format is designed specifically for high-throughput synthesis on small <b>scale</b> <b>to</b> satisfy the growing demand of industry and academia for synthetic oligonucleotides. A number of oligonucleotide synthesizers for small scale synthesis and medium to large scale synthesis are available commercially.|$|E
5|$|Other uses of organobromine {{compounds}} include high-density drilling fluids, dyes (such as Tyrian {{purple and}} the indicator bromothymol blue), and pharmaceuticals. Bromine itself, {{as well as}} some of its compounds, are used in water treatment, and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds with an enormous number of applications (e.g. silver bromide for photography). Zinc–bromine batteries are hybrid flow batteries used for stationary electrical power backup and storage; from household <b>scale</b> <b>to</b> industrial scale.|$|E

5|$|Production of the fissile {{isotopes}} uranium-235 and plutonium-239 were enormous undertakings {{given the}} technology of the 1940s, and accounted for 80% of the total costs of the project. Uranium enrichment was carried out at the Clinton Engineer Works near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Theoretically, enriching uranium was feasible through pre-existing techniques, but it proved difficult to <b>scale</b> <b>to</b> industrial levels and was extremely costly. Only 0.71 percent of natural uranium was uranium-235, and {{it was estimated that}} it would take 27,000 years to produce a gram of uranium with mass spectrometers, but kilogram amounts were required.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{scale was}} {{developed}} by Saffir, a structural engineer, who in 1969 went on commission for the United Nations to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas. While performing the study, Saffir realized there was no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane. Mirroring {{the utility of the}} Richter magnitude scale in describing earthquakes, he devised a 1–5 scale based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures. Saffir gave the <b>scale</b> <b>to</b> the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding.|$|E
5|$|After {{showing the}} game at the Macworld Expo, Bungie was mobbed with {{interest}} and orders for the game. The game was not finished until December 14, 1994; Jones {{and a few other}} employees spent a day at a warehouse assembling boxes so that some of the orders could be filled before Christmas. The game was a critical and commercial success, and is regarded as a relatively unknown but important part of gaming history. It served as the Mac alternative to DOS PC-only games like Doom and System Shock. The game's volume of orders was unprecedented for the studio, who found that its old method of mail or phone orders could not <b>scale</b> <b>to</b> the demand and hired another company to handle {{the tens of thousands of}} orders. Marathon also brought Bungie attention from press outside the small Mac gaming market.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1405, the Yongle Emperor {{entrusted}} his favored eunuch commander Zheng He (1371–1433) as {{the admiral}} for a gigantic new fleet of ships designated for international tributary missions. The Chinese had sent diplomatic missions over land since the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE) {{and engaged in}} private overseas trade, but these missions were unprecedented in grandeur and <b>scale.</b> <b>To</b> service seven different tributary voyages, the Nanjing shipyards constructed two thousand vessels from 1403 to 1419, including treasure ships measuring 112m (370ft) to 134m (440ft) in length and 45m (150ft) to 54m (180ft) in width.|$|E
5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a <b>scale</b> <b>to</b> determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E
5|$|In about 1500 the Scottish monarchy {{turned to}} the {{recording}} of royal likenesses in panel portraits. More impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent {{for much of the}} sixteenth century, but it flourished after the Reformation. James VI employed Flemish artists Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson, who have left behind a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone, who was succeeded by a series of portrait painters as the fashion moved down the social <b>scale</b> <b>to</b> lairds and burgesses.|$|E

He shifted money to offshore accounts in western European banks and defeated coup plots by bribing army generals. In 1995 the government hanged environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa on trumped-up charges {{in the deaths of}} four Ogoni elders. Lawsuits under the American Alien Tort Statute against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of Shell's Nigerian operation, settled out of court with Shell continuing to deny liability.|$|E
5|$|Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due to {{the cold}} weather. All work was then done at Salt Wells. The plant was {{completed}} in January 1946, and all equipment was installed and working by May 1946. Work was initially dogged by an unacceptably large number of defects {{in the form of}} cracks or imperfections in the explosive blocks. The core of the problem was that the techniques used at Los Alamos did not <b>scale</b> <b>to</b> a production site, so different methods were required. Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech's Ira Bowen to assess the quality of the explosive blocks.|$|E
5|$|Sunday, August 24, 1924, was a {{warm summer}} day in Brooklyn, and Helen Palsgraf, a 40-year-old janitor and housekeeper, was taking her two daughters, Elizabeth and Lillian, aged 15 and 12, to Rockaway Beach. Having paid the {{necessary}} fare, {{they were on the}} platform at the East New York station of the LIRR on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, when a train, not theirs, pulled in. As it began to move again, two men raced for the train, and one made it without incident, as the doors had not closed. The other, a man carrying a package, leapt aboard, {{with the help of a}} platform guard pushing him from behind as a member of the train's crew pulled him into the car. But in the process, the man lost the package, which dropped and exploded, for it apparently contained fireworks. Either the force of the explosion or the panicking of those on the platform caused a tall, coin-operated <b>scale</b> <b>to</b> topple onto Helen Palsgraf. No one was hurt enough to spend the night in the hospital, though several people, Palsgraf among them, were listed as injured.|$|E

5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial <b>scale</b> <b>to</b> immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E
5|$|The non-sliding {{logarithmic}} scale, Gunter's rule, {{was invented}} shortly after Napier's invention. William Oughtred enhanced it {{to create the}} slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower <b>scale</b> <b>to</b> the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, {{at the expense of}} precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.|$|E
5|$|Without {{the support}} of the Communists, the {{increasingly}} unpopular and destructive Confrontation quickly came to an end. Secret talks between Malaysia and Indonesia were held throughout late 1965 and early 1966, and a peace treaty was signed in August of the latter year. Sukarno was toppled from power by the generals on accusations of collaborating with the rebels and replaced by Suharto as President on 12 March of the following year. The conflict had been an unqualified success for Britain and the West, as she had subdued a rising Communist power in Asia and prevented the 'domino effect' from taking off. And from a purely tactical standpoint, it had been a strong performance from British troops and commanders, as they had managed to confine a brewing disaster on a Vietnamese <b>scale</b> <b>to</b> a relatively small bush war that had a relatively small human cost and stabilised a potentially dangerous political situation of South East Asia.|$|E
