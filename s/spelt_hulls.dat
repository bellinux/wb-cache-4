40|$|Fibres are not digested by fowls, {{but their}} impact on {{digestive}} physiology, nutrient metabolism and intestinal microflora can be substantial. Analytical shortcomings have historically contributed to different notions on the significance of fibres, but modern techniques now enable us to better discriminate between various fractions of fibre and relate them {{with the performance of}} poultry. The four present studies examined relationships between different qualities and means of providing fibres, and the functionality of broiler chickens and laying hens. In broiler chickens, increasing the dietary levels of insoluble fibres stimulated fat and protein digestion, but not in a dose-dependent manner. In the small intestine, these effects were mirrored in altered tissue morphology and luminal microflora composition. Moreover, addressing the negative effects of soluble fibres in wheat on digestion by adding a xylanase to the diet improved feed utilization. These effects were not mirrored by macroscopic or microscopic changes of the small intestine. Effects {{similar to those of the}} xylanase were achieved by adding a protease, but not a coccidiostat, to the diet. There were no signs of the effects of the two enzymes being additive. In laying hens, supplementary roughage reduced beak-inflicted injuries and improved feed efficiency; the latter finding likely reflecting better plumage conditions. Increased dietary levels of fibres and fat reduced the liver fat and tended to improve feed efficiency; the latter result probably explained by beneficial effects of added fat on digestion. The diet with more fat and fibres also impaired the hygienic conditions in the stable, presumably due to the fibre fraction being mainly soluble in nature. Experimental lines of hens predisposed to perform severe feather pecking preferred a diet supplemented with <b>spelt</b> <b>hulls</b> more than corresponding hens not predisposed to perform severe feather pecking. This finding supported previous indications that injurious pecking correlates with the fibre content of the feed. It was concluded that the significance of fibres in poultry nutrition largely depends on the quality of fibres. Whereas soluble fibres primarily acted detrimentally on the functionality of the birds, insoluble fibres tended to act in the opposite direction. In poultry nutrition experiments, however, it remains difficult to separate the effects of increasing amounts of fibrous feedstuffs from those of simultaneous dietary fat supplementation, nutrient dilution or ingestion of fibrous materials such as litter. ...|$|E
40|$|Spelt wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Thell) (spelta group) is an ancient, hulled, {{specialty}} wheat {{which is}} presently grown {{on a limited}} scale as a fall-sown crop in Western Europe. Little {{is known about the}} agronomics and growth characteristics of spring spelt, a potential specialty wheat for western Canada. The main objectives of this study were to compare the yield potential and growth characteristics of spring spelt wheat to that of common spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Thell) in central Saskatchewan, using growth analysis; to investigate the response of spring spelt to seeding date; and to determine the effect of the hulls of spelt on seedling emergence and establishment under adverse temperature and moisture conditions. The seeding rate and growth analysis experiment was conducted in the field using two spring spelt cultivars (CDC Bavaria and PGR 8801) and a common wheat cultivar (Katepwa) at four seeding rates ranging from 150 to 450 seeds/m 2 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in 1995 and 1996. The response of spring spelt and common wheat to seeding date was measured from late April to early June under field conditions over two years. The role of <b>spelt</b> <b>hulls</b> on seed germination, seedling emergence and crop establishment was studied under field conditions using an early (late April) and a late (early June) date of seeding over two years. Seed germination, seedling establishment and seed water uptake were studied under controlled environment conditions at water potentials ranging from 0 to - 1. 8 MPa, at temperatures of 9, 16 and 23 °C. The field studies indicated that spring spelt can produce grain yield comparable to common wheat. The same seeding rate as common wheat (150 to 250 seeds/m 2) can be used for spring spelt wheat in central Saskatchewan. Spring spelt has a higher leaf area index (LAI), leaf area duration (LAD) and crop growth rate (CGR) than common wheat, giving rise to 24 per cent higher biological yield for spring spelt compared to that of common wheat. Optimal seeding date for spring spelt is late April to early May; with later seeding spring spelt's grain yield tends to decrease. Seedling establishment for spring spelt is lower and less stable than common wheat, though this variation in seedling plant density does not influence the final grain yield. Controlled environment studies indicated that the hull of spring spelt wheat acts as an obstacle to water uptake, leading to an approximate 25 per cent slower water uptake rate compared to naked seeds. The hull has negative impact on seed germination and seedling emergence. The negative impact of the hull on seed water uptake, seed germination and seedling emergence increases under drought conditions. Thus, only under sufficiently wet soil conditions may using hulled seed as the propagule lead to comparable establishment of spring spelt relative to common wheat. In conclusion, spring spelt can be grown successfully in central Saskatchewan, producing a comparable grain yield to common wheat provided it is seeded before mid-May...|$|E
2500|$|The four {{wild species}} of wheat, {{along with the}} domesticated {{varieties}} einkorn, emmer and <b>spelt,</b> have <b>hulls.</b> This more primitive morphology (in evolutionary terms) consists of toughened glumes that tightly enclose the grains, and (in domesticated wheats) a semi-brittle rachis that breaks easily on threshing. The result is that when threshed, the wheat ear breaks up into spikelets. To obtain the grain, further processing, such as milling or pounding, is needed to remove the hulls or husks. In contrast, in free-threshing (or naked) forms such as durum wheat and common wheat, the glumes are fragile and the rachis tough. On threshing, the chaff breaks up, releasing the grains. Hulled wheats are often stored as spikelets because the toughened glumes give good protection against pests of stored grain.|$|R
40|$|Both {{types of}} <b>spelt</b> wheat kernel, <b>hulled</b> and dehulled, {{can be used}} for sowing. Researchers still argue about which one of those types is more appropriate. The goal of this work was to {{contribute}} to better understanding of spelt wheat kernels’ use, which were differently processed in variable agroecological settings. Dynamics of water acquisition is the same for both hulled and dehulled kernels of spelt wheat, but the difference in water content required for germination leads to different times of this process. Negative influence of hulled kernels on germination is amplified in periods of drought and unfavorable temperatures. On the other hand, the advantage of the <b>hulled</b> <b>spelt</b> wheat kernels’ use in organic production is in its better protection from pathogenic fungi. It has been observed that the growth rate and the coleoptile length were higher in spelt wheat comparing to the common wheat. Also, spelt wheat showed much higher tolerance to lower oxygen inflow (hypoxia) in the stressful conditions of very humid and cold soil. Fast coleoptile growth led to faster germination of spelt wheat and reduced duration of hypoxia. These traits facilitate the germination of spelt wheat kernels which are firmly enveloped with hulls. Our present experience with differently processed spelt wheat kernels indicate the advantages of dehulled and disinfected seeds. But also, hulled kernels could improve its quality by additional processing...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium {{infestation}} and DON content {{were studied}} in genetic resources of spring wheat (einkorn, emmer wheat, spelt wheat, intermediate forms of bread wheat). The study {{aimed at the}} comparison of grain contamination rates in various wheat species being grown in organic farming systems. The trials were established on certified organic parcels in two different localities in the Czech Republic in 2009 and 2010. The PCR method and specific primers were used to detect Fusarium. The proportion of deoxynivalenol (DON) was indicated and measured by the immuno-affinity chromatography (ROSA® DON Quantitative Test). The grain DON contamination rate (1. 25 mg/kg) {{was set up in}} compliance with the European Commission (EC) Regulation No. 1126 / 2007. This regulation sets up limits that have never been exceeded in any of the varieties. The strongest contamination rate was identified in grains of the control bread wheat varieties, and in the SW Kadrilj cultivar (0. 98 mg/kg) being grown in Ceske Budejovice. On the other hand, quite a low proportion of DON was detected in the hulled wheat varieties (einkorn, emmer wheat, <b>spelt</b> wheat). <b>Hull</b> may serve as a protection of grains there, as it is eliminated just before the processing of grains. The occurence of Fusarium was influenced by a grown wheat species. The occurence of Fusarium poae in grains was influenced (P< 0. 01) by a reduced resistance of the crop stand to lodging (r= 0. 58). The occurence of this Fusarium species was the weakest one. Grains were less contaminated with Fusarium culmorum, whereas the contamination rate was dominantly influenced by the year, einkorn and emmer wheat were the least infested wheat species. Fusarium graminearum provoked the strongest and most serious contamination of grains. The proportion of DON in grains (r= 0. 69) was influenced (P< 0. 01) by the Fusarium graminearum contamination rate. Spring spelt wheat varieties were the least infested ones (Spalda bila jarni, VIR St. Petersburg). On the other hand, landraces of bread wheat and both control bread wheat varieties were the most contaminated ones (as they contained the highest proportion of DON in grains) ...|$|R
40|$|The area of {{cultivated}} land used for organic farming expands every year, as does consumer demand for organic food. Organic farming is a system of land cultivation without chemical inputs, because chemicals can have a negative {{impact on the}} environment, human health as well as health of farm animals. An important part of organic farming are also various sowing methods based on the alternation of a broad range of different crops. Dinkel wheat (Triticum spelta, also known as <b>spelt</b> or <b>hulled</b> wheat), is ideally suited for this system, as it is less demanding in terms of external environmental conditions than bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, also known as common wheat. The aim of the bachelor thesis was to gain insight {{about the impact of}} the seeding rate on the yield and the consequent profit from dinkel wheat in organic farming. A second objective was to evaluate any differences in the values of selected quality indicators of grain, depending on the seed rate. Finally, on the basis of the obtained results, to choose the seeding rate which proved to be ideal in given conditions. The results of our experiments with selected genotypes of spring and winter dinkel wheat and control varieties of bread wheat sown in different seeding rates (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 germinable seeds per m 2) in the organic way of farming in the Research Station in Prague - Uhříněves show that the spring genotypes of dinkel wheat had a peak of offsetting almost a month later, in comparison with the control variety of spring bread wheat. Winter genotypes of dinkel wheat had this peak of offsetting approximately two weeks later than the control variety of winter bread wheat. Both dinkel wheat and the control variety of bread wheat from low seeding rates (1. 0 and 2. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha) offset more as expected, and simultaneously achieved a higher average weight of dry aboveground biomass and biomass of the roots per plant than plants of high seeding rates (4. 0 and especially 5. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha). The evaluated genotypes of dinkel wheat compared to the control varieties of bread wheat were generally characterized by intense offsetting, higher weight of dry aboveground biomass, and especially higher weight of dry matter of roots per plant. Achieved yields were negatively influenced by the course of weather conditions, especially by the drought throughout most of the vegetation period in 2015 - spring varieties of wheat, however, were affected by the drought far more than winter wheat. Based on the resulting yields, we can say that in our experiment the spring genotypes of dinkel wheat had the highest yields in the seeding rate of 4. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha, for winter dinkel wheat the best seeding rate was 3. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha (however, variety of Rubiota had a high yield already with the seeding rate of 2. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha). To specify the information, it is needed to obtain results from more years. From the evaluated genotypes, the yield of white spring dinkel wheat slightly outperformed the control variety of bread wheat Granny and in particular the second genotype of dinkel wheat, T. spelta KEW. In the case of winter varieties, the yield of dinkel wheat Alkor outperformed the second variety of winter dinkel wheat Rubiota as well as the control variety of bread wheat Penalta. The evaluation of qualitative parameters showed that genotypes of dinkel wheat outperformed the control varieties of bread wheat, especially in the content of N-substances and wet gluten content in grain dry matter. Both spring genotypes of dinkel wheat also achieved very good results in the Zeleny sedimentation test - both exceeded the minimum value required from wheat for bakeries (30 ml). Also winter varieties of dinkel wheat Rubiota exceeded this limit. The number of decrease was high in the evaluated varieties of winter wheat, while spring wheat was negatively affected by sprouting due to the rainy weather just before the harvest. The level of seeding rate had no effect on the values of qualitative indicators...|$|R
40|$|This first {{monograph}} in the EARTH series The {{dynamics of}} non-industrial agriculture: 8, 000 years of resilience and innovation, approaches the {{great variety of}} agricultural practices in human terms. It focuses {{on the relationship between}} plants and people, the complexity of agricultural processes and their organisation within particular communities and societies. Collaborative European research among archaeologists, archaeobotanists, ethnographers, historians and agronomists using a broad analytical scale of investigation seeks to establish new common ground for integrating different approaches. By means of interdisciplinary examples, this book showcases the relationship between people and plants across wide ranging and diverse spatial and temporal milieus, including crop diversity, the use of wild foodstuffs, social context, status and choices of food plants. This book {{is a result of the}} work of one team involved in the Collaborative Research Program funded by the European Science Foundation (ESF) and entitled “Early Agricultural Remnants and Technical Heritage” (EARTH). Within this framework, senior and younger scientists from Europe and a few guest contributors from beyond met from 2005 to 2009 in different venues around Europe to exchange views, data and experiences on choices made by humans in selecting plants for multiple uses such as alimentation, fodder or raw materials for crafts and construction. These scientific exchanges led to this book, the goal of which is to portray the diversity of plant uses and choices, as well as address specific issues related to this diversity. The use of the word “plants” instead of “crops” through the whole monograph is a deliberate choice. First, this is because many contributions in the present volume do not make any clear-cut separation between the “traditional” classification of “domesticated”, “tended”, “semi-wild”, “wild”, etc. plants: most of the authors deal with a continuum of physiological states of plants used by humans, from wild plants to GMOs (genetically modified organisms), with as many possible intermediate states of adaptation to human needs, and introgressions (infiltration of the genes of one species into the gene pool of another). In addition, there are as many definitions of what a “crop” is as there are authors using this word. And finally, every human group classifies and uses plants according to its own cultural taxonomies that can make our current Western academic classifications useless in most cases. Dye plants as well as spices are only marginally mentioned – which some readers may regret – and not all the European countries are included, while some contributions deal with countries in Asia, Africa, North America and South America. In the same way, plants used as medicine are not directly addressed. This is due mainly to the area of expertise of this EARTH team and does not result from a deliberate choice to leave out these topics or consider them as less important or less worthy of interest. The present publication is divided into seven chapters, each focusing on plant-use related issues. Each chapter consists of an introductory section, in which the chapter leader summarises important aspects and issues related to the chapter topic, and then includes individual contributions to illustrate the main issues of the topic. In lines with this plan, L. Zapata coordinates an introductory methodological chapter with different contributions focusing on the various analytical tools used to address the study of plant use, both in the past and in the present. Ranging from archaeobotanical techniques (L. Scott- Cummings’ contribution) to current ethnobotanical methods (G. Cruz), on to the analyses of historical sources (J. L. Mingote, M. Russel and F. Sigaut) and those of ancient images (S. González Reyero), the chapter explores the ways in which each discipline has tackled the topics under discussion. Covering a large area, Europe and America, although focusing mostly on the former, the third chapter, coordinated by E. Marinova, explores crop diversity through time by looking at the archaeobotanical record in different regions. The European southeast is addressed by E. Marinova and T. Valamoti for a period spanning from the early Neolithic to the late Bronze Age. Sites in Bulgaria and Greece are examined showing the diversity of prehistoric agriculture. The patterns observed are explained by taking into account physical factors such as climate or geographical barriers as well as cultural ones. M. Rottoli makes a valuable and welcome contribution to the crop history of Italy from the beginnings of agriculture to the Roman period. By looking at the main crops involved in agriculture through time, this contribution explores the influence of population movements in the spread of crops to new areas. A survey with broader chronological scope (Neolithic to Middle Ages) is presented by S. Jacomet for central Europe, examining various crop introductions through time. Hexaploid and tetraploid wheats, <b>spelt,</b> millet, <b>hulled</b> barley or rye are some of the crop species considered, each introduced in the region at a certain point in the past. Crop diversity during the Neolithic in the Iberian Peninsula is addressed in the contribution by L. Peña-Chocarro and L. Zapata. The different combinations of species found in the varied territory of Iberia are explored and both ecological and socio-cultural motivations are discussed in order to explain the underlying reasons for such diversity. A timespan of 1400 years (from 500 BCE to 900 CE) is surveyed in C. Bakels’ paper on Western Europe, which provides an overview of the various factors (physical, socio-economic and cultural) influencing diversity in the region. With the same focus in Western Europe, F. Sigaut’s contribution analyses the various crop and non-crop introductions which occurred in the region, and contributed to enlarging crop diversity. In addition, technical innovations such as the scythe are also analysed, providing a better framework to explore diversity. The American section includes two contributions, the first by L. Scott-Cummings focusing on the American southwest and the second by M. Bruno with emphasis on the Andean area of the Titicaca Lake basin. In the first case, an overview of plant diversity through the analyses of coprolites from several sites is presented, showing the variability of species identified through pollen, macroremains and phytolith analysis. The work emphasises the role wild plants played in the Puebloan communities. Through archaeobotanical data, Bruno’s paper looks at the various processes involved in producing diversity: crop domestication, risk reduction and agricultural intensification, as well as political economic strategies, thus exploring the dynamic interactions between production, environment, culture and politics. In Chapter 4, L. Bouby and M. -P. Ruas examine the role of fruit-tree domestication and cultivation throughout time by looking at different aspects related to unnoticed uses and practices resulting from choices and intentional decisions. The other contributors lead the readers through various fruit tree cultures. First, R. Cuthrell reviews the uses of acorns by indigenous groups in California by looking at different types of data: ecological, ethnographical and archaeological. Second, D. J. Goldstein illustrates the role of some Prosopis tree species in the development of ancient agricultural systems in the Pre-Hispanic period in Peru. At the same time, the author guides the reader to the importance of these species in sustaining modern production in coastal Peru. M. Rottoli’s paper examines the changing role of fruits in human subsistence in Italy, from the gathering of wild fruits to their cultivation proper at the end of the Bronze Age or beginning of the Iron Age. The contribution of Bui Thi Maï and M. Girard focuses on an exotic species (Citrus) in Antiquity in the Mediterranean area. After an exhaustive introduction to the species’ botany, the authors describe and discuss critically the various sites where this plant has been attested in the pollen record. Based on this evidence, they propose the hypothesis that Citrus was present in southern Italy, probably before the first century of the Christian era, and that it has indeed been cultivated in the western part of the Ancient World since this period. The origins of viniculture during the prehistoric period in southern France are presented by L. Bouby, P. Terral and J. -F. Terral. The authors show that in addition to the specialised viticulture directly or indirectly promoted by Massaliotes and especially Romans in Mediterranean France, the indigenous Iron Age inhabitants seem to have grown grape more as a secondary crop. The growing of figs as a staple food in the pre-Hispanic period of the Canary Islands is discussed by J. Morales and J. Gil, based on archaeobotanical remains, ethnohistorical documents and palaeodiet studies, which indicate that this fruit played an important role in the diet of the first inhabitants of Gran Canaria. Fig and olive domestication and cultivation are the topic of the paper by Y. Aumeeruddy-Thomas, Y. Hmimsa, Mohammed Ater and B. Khadari. The authors explore the processes of incorporating forest, wild or spontaneous trees into agricultural systems in the Mediterranean. Based on their observations made in the Rif Mountain agroecosystems, they conclude that tree domestication is not as distinct as that of cereal crops, as wild, spontaneous and domesticated tree forms are still very closely linked. This situation suggests a possible continuum in tree domestication processes over a long period of time. In Chapter 5, G. Cruz-García and F. Ertuğ give an overview of several topics related to the use of wild plant resources in the past and present. An example of exploring wild plant resources by colonisation of new areas is given in J. Morales’ and J. Gil’s contribution,|$|R
