40|$|The <b>stellar</b> <b>scintillation</b> {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} limitation to the precision of ground-based photometry. The paper examines the problem of correlation of the scintillation of two close stars at the focus of a large telescope. The derived correlation functions were applied to data of the long-term study of the optical turbulence (OT) in the Northern Caucasus with MASS (Multi-Aperture Scintillation Sensor) instrument to predict the angular correlation of the scintillation at the Sternberg institute 2. 5 m telescope currently in construction. A median angular radius of the correlation as large as 20 arcsec was found for the case of Kolmogorov OT. On the basis of the obtained relations we also analyze the correlation impact in ensemble photometry and conjugate plane photometry. It is shown that a reduction of the scintillation noise up to 8 times can be achieved when using a crowded ensemble of comparison stars. The calculation of the angular correlation can be repeated for any large telescope at the site where the OT vertical profiles are known.

40|$|Many {{physical}} experiments require {{analysis of}} the statistics of fluctuating radiation. In {{the case of an}} ideal single-photon detector, the contribution of photon noise to the statistics of the registered signal has been thoroughly examined. However, practical photon counters have a dead time, leading to miscounting of certain true events, and sometimes the counters generate false after-pulses. This study investigate the impact of these two effects, and it presents the theoretical relations between the statistical moments of the radiation and the registered counts while also accounting for dead time and the probability of after-pulses. Expressions for statistical moments of any order are obtained {{on the basis of the}} generalized Poisson distribution (GPD). For counters with paralyzable dead time, alternative relations for the mean and variance are derived using generally accepted formulas. As an example, the measurements of <b>stellar</b> <b>scintillation</b> and the result of simple experiment are considered.

This paper examines the theoretical role of the outer scale L_ 0 of the optical turbulence (OT) which suppresses the low-frequency component of scintillation. It is shown that for typical values of L_ 0 ∼ 25 - 50 m, this effect becomes noticeable for a telescopes of diameter around 4 m. On extremely large, 30 - 40 m, telescopes with exposures longer than a few seconds, {{the inclusion of the}} outer scale in the calculation reduces the scintillation power by more than a factor of 10 relative to conventional estimates. The details of this phenomenon are discussed for various models of non-Kolmogorov turbulence. Also, a quantitative description of the influence of the telescope central obscuration on the measured scintillation noise is introduced and combined with the effect of the outer scale. Evaluation of the scintillation noise on the future TMT and E-ELT telescopes, predicts an amplitude of approximately 10 for a 60 s exposures.
