5|$|Basiliscus fled in {{the heat}} of the battle. One half of the Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and the other half {{followed}} the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and <b>satisfaction,</b> <b>that</b> the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.|$|E
5|$|Because Manor Marussia {{failed to}} notify the {{stewards}} of their inability to field a car, the team was summoned by the FIA to explain why they {{did not participate in}} qualifying. However, the hearing provided sufficient evidence to the FIA's <b>satisfaction</b> <b>that</b> the team would have been unable to field their cars, even if they had violated curfew. Despite this, Ecclestone subsequently announced that Manor Marussia would have to cover their freight charges to and from Australia, costs normally covered by Formula One Management.|$|E

This article deals with the concerns, the predicted rewards, and the intrinsic <b>satisfactions</b> <b>that</b> people who do conserve derive from their conserving behaviors. In order to investigate the factors that play a role in maintaining energy-conserving behavior, interviews were conducted which focused on the intrinsic <b>satisfactions</b> <b>that</b> are derived from people's everyday pursuits. The thirty participants were individuals who were known to be concerned about energy conservation issues, and special emphasis was placed on those satisfactions associated with their daily environmental stewardship activities. Eleven distinct types of satisfactions were found in the data with only one being economic in nature. The range of intrinsic <b>satisfactions</b> found suggests <b>that</b> many potentially fruitful avenues exist for encouraging the adoption of energy conservation practices among a much broader population...|$|R

5|$|The circuit {{passed its}} final {{inspection}} in May 2016 with FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting declaring his <b>satisfaction</b> <b>that</b> the circuit {{would be ready}} {{in time for the}} race. The circuit attracted some criticism from drivers who highlighted a lack of run-off in some corners and the tight pit entry positioned at one of the fastest points on the circuit. Following problems with loose kerbs in free practice, changes were made in turns 6 and 12, where the kerbs were replaced by painted markings on the track. Further revisions were made to the pit entry ahead of qualifying, extending the white line denoting the entry lane to allow drivers more time to react to cars entering the pit.|$|E

Why do people behave as they do? To the proverbial person on the street {{this is one of the}} most obvious questions to be asked of psychology. From a psychological perspective, however, this apparently simple query breaks down into a multitude of often complex issues. Despite considerable attention to many of these issues, there remains an avenue of exploration that is both promising and relatively neglected.

25|$|Positive affective {{display in}} service interactions, such as smiling and {{conveying}} friendliness, are {{positively associated with}} customer positive feelings, and important outcomes, such as intention to return, intention to recommend a store to others, and perception of overall service quality. There is evidence that emotional labor may lead to employees' emotional exhaustion and burnout over time, and may also reduce employees' job <b>satisfaction.</b> <b>That</b> is, higher degree of using emotion regulation on the job is related {{to higher levels of}} employees' emotional exhaustion, and lower levels of employees' job satisfaction.|$|E

At the same time, the general theories of behavioural change suggest possible explanations to criminal behaviour {{and methods of}} correcting deviant behaviour.
