40|$|Abstract- Silver sulfide, <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> {{complex and}} silver {{chloride}} complexes were tested and compared with free silver ion for their toxic effects in 96 -h flow-through acute toxicity tests using fathead minnows (Pimephules promelus). Thirty-day fathead minnow embryo-larval {{tests were conducted}} with silver sulfide and <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> complex. Extensive chemical analyses were performed to quantify actual exposures. Compared with free silver ion, silver chloride complexes were about 300 times less toxic acutely, silver sulfide was at least 15, 000 times less toxic acutely and <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> complex was more than 17, 500 times less toxic acutely. The estimated maximum acceptable toxicant concentrations (MATCs) determined from the embryo-larval tests with silver sulfide and <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> complex were greater than 1 1 mglL (as total silver) and greater than 16 but less than 35 mglL (as total silver), respectively. The MATC previously reported for free silver ion from tests with rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri] was greater than 0. 00009 but less than 0. 00017 mglL. These differences in acute toxicities and the differences of five orders of magnitude in the MATC values are attributed {{to the influence of}} chemical speciation on the effects of silver in the aquatic environment.

40|$|In colour photography, {{the film}} is first treated with bleach {{solution}} so that the reduced silver is oxidized to soluble silver ion which is subsequently dissolved in sodium thiosulphate bringing all silver into the solution. During bleaching, the ferricyanide bleach is reduced to ferrous state affecting its efficacy leading to its disposal. Similarly the build up of silver concentration in the thiosulfate complex also leads to its rejection. The disposal of large quantities of chemicals not only poses environmental hazard but also loss of valuable chemicals. This necessitates the recovery of <b>silver</b> from <b>thiosulfate</b> complex and regeneration of bleach solution which facilitate the recycling of the regenerated bleach and fixer solution in the system, thereby avoiding the pollution problem. Eventhough various methods are available for the recovery of silver and regeneration of bleach, electrolytic method offers the advantage of not altering the composition of solution and totally avoiding the use of unwanted chemicals, thereby making the solution suitable for efficient reuse.

Though the saturation level of [Ag(S 2 O 3) (2) ](3 -) on PAN(QPEI.

Cyanide is a very toxic chemical and if not used appropriately will cause environmental problems. There is considerable attention devoted to the development of non-cyanide lixiviants for the process of gold and <b>silver</b> ores. <b>Thiosulfate</b> solution is one of the proposed alternatives to cyanide and gold cementation by copper has been suggested as a promising method for gold recovery from leaching solution. Copper powder and rotating disc electrode were used for the kinetic study. The rate of gold cementation on copper disc is proportional to the initial gold concentration and disc rotating speed. The cementation reaction exhibited two distinct kinetic regions, an initial slow rate followed by an enhanced rate. The activation energy of the reaction was 5. 9 kJ/mol at low copper concentration and the reaction is mass transport controlled. With 30 ppm initial copper concentration, there was noticeable decrease in the reaction rate in high temperature range. EDS, XRD, and XPS analysis revealed that the deposits are a Au-Cu alloy instead of pure gold. The alloy composition ranged from Au₃Cu to AuCu₃ depending on the initial Cu/Au mole ratio in solution and applied potential. Electrochemical studies were performed using rotating disc electrode and electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance. Evans' diagrams were constructed under various experimental conditions. Corrosion current increased with increasing gold concentration, disc rotating speed, as well as thiosulfate concentration. These results confirmed those obtained in the kinetic study. Corrosion potential measurements indicated that passivation onset time was changed by gold concentration, copper concentration and disc rotating speed. Gold(I) -thiosulfate reduction was found to occur at approximately - 250 mV vs. SHE using EQCN.

40|$|Nowadays, keeping {{mining and}} the {{environment}} sustainable {{is a major concern}} all over the world. Using toxic chemicals such as cyanide and mercury in the gold leaching process {{is one of the main}} factors that need to be considered in terms of the environment. Finding alternative lixiviants is one solution that would decrease the uses of these toxic chemicals. Thiosulfate is one of the most promising alternative substitutes to cyanide kinetically and environmentally. Gold leaching in thiosulfate solutions was evaluated environmentally and kinetically in different ways: (1) applying a closed system to leach gold (2) evaluating the environmental and metallurgical optimum thiosulfate leaching characteristics for pure gold and pure silver and gold silver alloys (4, 8, 20 and 50 wt % silver), (3) studying the electrochemical behavior of gold, silver, and gold/silver alloys (4) optimizing the leaching conditions of gold ore samples supplied from Centamin Egypt Limited Company, (5) finally, studying the ability of thiosulfate solutions to dissolve mercury and evaluating gold, copper, and mercury recovery from ion-exchange resins. The study showed that the leaching rate of gold and silver in the closed vessel was greater than that obtained in the open vessel by 30 % and 45 % respectively. To avoid the losses of ammonia a closed leaching system is recommended. Gold and <b>silver</b> leaching in <b>thiosulfate</b> solution is preferable kinetically and environmentally if conducted in a closed vessel system. The effect silver alloyed with gold was evaluated and the result showed that the dissolution rate of pure gold is higher than that form 4 and 8 wt% Ag alloys. And the dissolution rate of gold from 20 and 50 % silver alloys is more than that obtained for pure gold. The silver dissolution rate is sensitive to copper(II) concentration being 1. 67 x 10 - 5 mol. m- 2. s- 1 at an initial copper(II) concentration of 1. 25 mM and 6. 6 x 10 - 5 mol. m- 2. s- 1 at an initial copper(II) concentration of 10 mM. Silver dissolution is more sensitive to ammonia than gold. From the electrochemical study on gold/silver alloys, it was found that an increase in silver in the alloy results in an increase of the current density from both gold and <b>silver</b> oxidation in <b>thiosulfate</b> solutions in the range of potentials 0. 242 - 0. 542 V. Also, it was found that in thiosulfate solutions containing thiourea, the oxidation current of gold/silver alloys decreased and the oxidation current from pure gold after the standard potential for gold oxidation (150 mV) is higher than the total oxidation current from gold-silver alloys. Leaching of a selected gold ore using thiosulfate solutions for 24 hours suggested the optimum conditions to leach the ore to be 0. 2 – 0. 4 M thiosulfate, 400 mM NH 3, 10 - 20 mM Cu(II), 30 ºC, 300 rpm, no air supplied, solid/liquid ratio 20 %, and mean particle size of < - 106 μm. Finally, the study showed that mercury dissolves in thiosulfate solutions as it dissolves in cyanide. Mercury dissolves in thiosulfate solutions in the order: HgS 2 <Hg 0 <Hg 2 Cl 2 <HgCl 2. The effect of mercury on gold and copper loading and recovery from resins was evaluated and the results showed that mercury does not influence gold and copper loading and recovery.

Exposure to ethylene (10 microliters per liter) accelerated the onset of senescence, as indicated by petal in-rolling, and stimulated ethylene production. Senescence was also hastened by basal application of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC).

Traditionally, basil {{has been used as a}} medicinal plant in the treatment of headaches, coughs, diarrhea, constipation, warts, worms, and kidney malfunction [1]. Phytohormones and environmental stresses are the effective factors in controlling abscission process [4]. It is demonstrated that the ethylene has an important role in initiation of the abscission layer in different plants [5]. Ethylene activates the biosynthesis genes of hydrolytic enzymes, e.g., cellulose and polygalacturonase, which induces separation of plant organs from the main plant [6],[7]. In addition, the abscission process could be regulated by the other phytohormones such as auxin (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA). The later induces the abscission process through stimulation of the ethylene biosynthesis while auxin is effective in delaying the abscission by reducing the sensitivity of cell to ethylene [4],[6],[8]. Abscission may be delayed by using some chemical components such as amino isobutyric acid and cobalt ions, (aminooxy) acetic acid, <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> (STS), and silver nitrate (AgNO 3) [8],[9]. Several studies demonstrated that spraying of silver ions decreases the flowers and flower bud abscission in orchid plant [10]. Additionally, it has been reported that silver ions decreased 100 % flower abscission of Alstroemeria plant as compared to untreated flower within two first days [11]. Moreover, ethylene is involved on senescence of flowers in Bougainvillea plant while this process may be postponed by spraying <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> [12].|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{involvement of}} Ca 2 + {{as a second}} messenger in snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus L.) shoot gravitropism, {{as well as the}} role of ethylene in this bending response, were analyzed in terms of stem curvature and gravity-induced asymmetric ethylene production rates, ethylene-related metabolites, and invertase activity across the stem. Application of Ca 2 + chelators (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, trans- 1, 2 -cyclohexane dinitro-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N',-tetraacetic acid) or a Ca 2 + antagonist (LaCl 3) to the spikes caused a significant loss of their gravitropic response following horizontal placement. Conversely, the Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187 or the agonist Bay K- 8644 increased gravibending. Longitudinally halved stem sections had significantly higher amounts of ethylene, 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid, and 1 -(malonylamino) cyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid compared with vertical controls, with the extra production arising exclusively from {{the lower half of the}} stem. trans- 1, 2 -cyclohexane dinitro-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid pretreatment completely abolished the gravity-induced ethylene gradient across the stem, thereby leading to a significant reduction of the curvature. Similarly, reduction of the ethylene produced in the gravistimulated with CoCl 2 or inhibition of its action by <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> or 2, 5 -norbornadiene significantly inhibited the subsequent gravibending. <b>Silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> and CoCl 2 also abolished the gravity-induced gradient of invertase activity across the stem, which is associated with the asymmetric stem elongation. These results suggest that cytosolic Ca 2 + may regulate auxin action in snapdragon spikes, manifested as increased ethylene production, which is, in turn, intimately correlated with stem bending. Therefore, both hormones seem to play significant roles in induction and progress of the gravibending of snapdragon spikes...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{in vitro}} potato shoot {{cultures}} for protoplast isolation is desirable for consistent protoplast qualities. Ethylene build-up {{in the culture}} vessels causes problems for leaf growth (e. g. decreasing leaf surface, dry weight and chlorophyll) in shoot culture. Fifty to one hundred μM <b>Silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> (STS) produced a larger leaf area {{as a source of}} plant material for protoplast isolation. STS also decreased the internode length of potato shoots but increased dry weight and chlorophyll. Regenerated plants were obtained from cultured protoplasts in a series of media based on the MS medium. Protoplasts of Delaware showed a better response in cell division and colony formation in agarose-solidified culture medium. Regenerated plants showed some degrees of aneuploid but basically were similar to the original potato plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between ethylene production and seed germination of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) was studied. For intact fruits, deoperculated fruits and true seeds, ethylene was only produced {{after the start}} of radicle emergence. Removal of the operculum or the whole pericarp, likely allowing better water uptake and gas exchange by the true seed, actually increased the time span between the start of radicle emergence and the beginning of ethylene production compared to intact fruits. ACC (1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid), AOA (aminooxy acetic acid), AIB (2 -amino isobutyric acid) and STS (<b>silver</b> <b>thiosulfate)</b> in the imbibition medium did not influence the germination pattern. Based on these findings, the function of ethylene during the germination of sugar beet is uncertain. status: publishe...|$|E

Five {{hours after}} cut {{carnations}} {{had been treated}} with a pulse of 1 or 4 mM <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> (STS), in vivo ethylene binding in petals was inhibited by 22 and 29 %, respectively. When binding was measured 4 days after the 4 -mM STS treatment, binding was inhibited by 81 %. 2, 5 -Norbornadiene, which substantially delays carnation senescence, inhibited ethylene binding by 41 % at a concentration of l 000 µ 1 / 1.

40|$|Upward {{physical}} restraint of the normally horizontal bracts of poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd.) resulted in increased ethylene production and epinastic {{curvature of the}} petioles after 5 days. Downward restraint caused little change in ethylene production or epinasty, indicating that the enhanced ethylene production observed in petioles bent upwards is not due to the bending stress alone. Epinasty, measured upon removal of upward {{physical restraint}}, was not affected by spraying plants with aminoxyacetic acid to reduce ethylene production or with <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> to prevent ethylene action. Removal of the bract blades prevented the epinastic response of the petiole, and the response was restored by applying indoleacetic acid to the cut petiole end. Redistribution of auxin appears {{to be responsible for}} both the epinasty and the increased ethylene production of reoriented poinsettia bracts...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ethylene}} {{on the growth}} rate of pollen tubes in styles of Petunia hybrida was examined. Apart from its strong inhibition of pollination-induced ethylene synthesis, aminoethoxyvinylglycine, placed on the stigma, did not impede tube growth. The inhibitors of the action of ethylene, <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> and 2, 5 -norbornadiene, were similarly ineffective. Application of the ethylene precursor, 1 -amino-cyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid, onto the stigma at different intervals prior to pollination evoked synthesis of ethylene, but was without effect on tube growth. However, prepollination (by 24 hours) with Nicotiana tabacum pollen, significantly enhanced tube growth of Petunia pollen. This enhancement was not counteracted by the pretreatment of stigmas with aminoethoxy-vinylglycine. It is concluded that the ethylene associated with pollination is without effect on pollen tube growth in the style, but that other pollination-induced factors may lead to an acceleration of growth...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Petioles of explants of Coleus blumei Benth. {{exposed to}} 20 ~ 1 / 1 {{ethylene}} abscised within 36 h. Pretreatment of explants with 4 mM <b>silver</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> (STS) inhibited ethylene-induced abscission. Delaying treat-ment with STS reduced its effectiveness in retarding ethylene-promoted abscission, suggesting that some events leading to abscission are initiated {{during the first}} hours of ethylene treatment. Microscopic study of abscis-sion zones of ethylene-treated xplants howed greatly increased amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum, disruptions of the plasma membrane, and some cell separation i {{the region of the}} middle lamella. Pretreatment with STS prevented ethylene-induced reorganization of the endomembrane system and the subsequent middle lamellar dissolution. The correlation between ethylene and the promotion of fruit, floral, or foliar abscission has been recognized for over 80 years (Neljubow 1901, Abeles 1973).
