60|$|Ad√®le was {{herself in}} a very few minutes. My cousin considerately {{slipped out of the}} room. Directly <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> found me {{kneeling}} by her side, her color became more natural.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> {{said she}} never should ask any one to act against {{principles}}, but principles in her time were for Church and State. Is Aunt Cherry in the vortex?" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> saw Uncle Chris {{coming down}} the aisle towards her. There {{was a man with}} him, and, as they moved closer in the dim light, Jill saw that it was Derek.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is this on her dress?" [...] said Ridgeway, {{kneeling}} beside her, {{and lifting}} his set and colorless face. At {{the sound of}} his voice, the color came faintly back to her cheek: <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> smiled.|$|E

You--have--made me--very--happy.' ...|$|E
60|$|All {{the while}} Isobel was only {{partially}} conscious.

6000|$|However, he {{took off}} his boots and went up softly.

6000|$|... "Go on, go on! Speak, I command you!" [...] said Van Helsing in an agonized voice.

6000|$|... "Well, Rachel," [...] {{he replied}} {{in his usual}} voice, upon which <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> quite widely and smiled with her {{familiar}} smile. He kissed her and took her hand.|$|R
