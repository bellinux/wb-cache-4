Virtually {{all of those}} were performed in medical facilities; only 19 births occurred elsewhere. Out of the total number, 32,677 children were born in wedlock or within 300days {{after the end of}} the marriage, and the average age of mothers at the birth of their first child was 28.4 years. General fertility rate, i.e. number of births per 1,000 women aged 15–49 is 42.9, with the age <b>specific</b> <b>rate</b> peaking at 101.0 per million for women aged 25–29. In 2009, 52,414 persons died in Croatia, 48.5% of whom died in medical facilities and 90.0% of whom were receiving medical treatment at the time. Cardiovascular disease and cancer were the primary causes of death in the country, with 26,235 and 13,280 deaths respectively. In the same year, there were 2,986 violent deaths, including 2,121 due to accidents. The latter figure includes 616 deaths in traffic accidents. In 2014, the birth rate was 9.3 per mille, exceeded by the mortality rate of 12.0 per mille. The infant mortality rate was 5.0 per mille in 2014. In terms of age structure, the population of Croatia is dominated by the 15–64year older segment (68.1%), while the size of the population younger than 15 and older than 64 is relatively small (15.1% and 16.9% respectively). The median age of the population is 41.4. The sex ratio of the population is 1.06 males per 1 female at birth and up to 14 years of age, and 0.99 males per 1 female between the ages of 15 and 64. But at ages over 64 the ratio is 0.64 males per 1 female. The ratio for the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>specific</b> growth <b>rate</b> of Escherichia coli and {{the concentration of}} limiting nutrient (glucose or phosphate or tryptophan) has been determined for populations in a steady state. At high concentrations the <b>specific</b> growth <b>rate</b> is independent of the concentration of nutrient, but at low concentrations the <b>specific</b> growth <b>rate</b> is a strong function of the nutrient concentration.

If parameters of the equation are estimated from the results obtained at low concentrations, then at high concentrations of nutrient, the <b>specific</b> growth <b>rate</b> is significantly higher than that predicted by Monod's equation.

Yeasts are well established for the production {{of a wide range of}} recombinant proteins, but there are also some limitations; e. g., metabolic and cellular stresses have a strong impact on recombinant protein production. In this work, we investigated the effect of the <b>specific</b> growth <b>rate</b> on the production of two different recombinant proteins. Our results show that human insulin precursor is produced in a growth-associated manner, whereas alpha-amylase tends to have a higher yield on substrate at low <b>specific</b> growth <b>rates.</b> Based on transcriptional analysis, we found that the difference in the production of the two proteins as function of the <b>specific</b> growth <b>rate</b> is mainly due to differences in endoplasmic reticulum processing, protein turnover, cell cycle, and global stress response.

We therefore examined the growth and elemental composition of Thalassiosira weissflogii grown into nutrient starvation and then recovery following nutrient readdition. During nitrate starvation, T. weissflogii continued dividing, producing cells with low quotas of N, P, and Si. Following nitrate readdition, cells immediately began taking up nitrate at relatively low net cell <b>specific</b> <b>rates</b> and to rebuild cellular stores of all nutrients. More than 30 hours elapsed before there was a visible increase in cell numbers. Cellular C/N and C/P ratios remained high and N/P ratios remained low for the remaining 45 hours of the experiment. Cells in the silicon starvation experiment abruptly ceased dividing at 1 - 3 µM dissolved silicon (DSi) and immediately resumed dividing upon resupply of DSi. Growth rates and net cell <b>specific</b> <b>rates</b> of silicon uptake recovered to maximal values within 3 to 7 hours, but net cell <b>specific</b> <b>rates</b> of nitrate and phosphate never did, driving a decline in N and P per cell during the whole experiment. Ratios of C/N and N/P remained close to Redfield values. While cell <b>specific</b> <b>rates</b> of silicon uptake scaled strongly with DSi concentrations during all portions of the silicon starvation experiment, during the nitrogen starvation experiment, they were directly related to cellular growth rates, suggesting that during nitrate starvation, silicon acquisition was acting as the rate limiting step for cell division...|$|R
