500|$|Admiral Husband Kimmel, Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, ordered Task Force (TF) 12—Lexington, three heavy cruisers {{and five}} destroyers—to depart Pearl Harbor on 5 December 1941 to ferry 18 U.S. Marine Corps Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers of VMSB-231 to {{reinforce}} the base at Midway Island. At this time she embarked 65 of her own aircraft, including 17 Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters. On the morning of 7 December, the Task Force was about [...] southeast of Midway when it received news of the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor. Several hours later, Rear Admiral John H. Newton, commander of the Task Force, received orders that cancelled the ferry mission and ordered him {{to search for the}} Japanese ships while rendezvousing with Vice Admiral Wilson Brown's ships [...] west of Niihau Island. Captain Frederick Sherman needed to maintain a continuous Combat Air Patrol (CAP) and recover the fuel-starved fighters which were on patrol. With the Marine aircraft aboard, Lexingtons flight deck was very congested and he decided to reverse the phase of the ship's electric propulsion motors and steam full speed astern in order to launch a new CAP and then <b>swap</b> <b>back</b> to resume forward motion to recover his current CAP. This unorthodox action allowed him to maintain a continuous CAP and recover his aircraft without the lengthy delay caused by moving the aircraft on the flight deck from the bow to the stern and back to make space available for launch and recovery operations. Lexington launched several scout planes to search for the Japanese that day and remained at sea between Johnston Island and Hawaii, reacting to several false alerts, until she returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 December. Kimmel had wanted to keep the ships at sea for longer, but difficulties refueling at sea on 11 and 12 December meant that the task force was low on fuel and was forced to return to port.|$|E

50|$|Most modern {{consumer}} desktop {{operating systems}} have both main memory which is physically housed in RAM microchips, and secondary storage {{such as a}} hard drive. Memory allocation is dynamic - each process gets as much memory as it requests. Active pages are transferred into main memory for fast access; inactive pages are pushed out to secondary storage to make room, as needed. When a single process starts consuming {{a large amount of}} memory, it usually occupies more and more of main memory, pushing other programs out to secondary storage - usually significantly slowing performance of the system. Even if the leaking program is terminated, it may take some time for other programs to <b>swap</b> <b>back</b> into main memory, and for performance to return to normal.|$|E

They concoct a scheme to switch places in order to meet their other family, and when Yuma's father decides to leave early, Kyanna gets taken back to Sydney as Yuma, and Yuma stays in Alice Springs as Kyanna. However, due to their desire to protect their mother from an Aboriginal stigma associated with women who give birth to twins, the girls decide not to reveal to their respective families and communities who they really are, and devise a way to <b>swap</b> <b>back</b> to their original families.|$|E

In a monetary economy, Alice may offer to sell Bob her house for one million dollars, and Bob may accept, and sell Alice his house for a same one million dollars - in this case they would each own a house, and each have paper wealth of one million dollars (the sale value of the house).

5000|$|Marvel: Future Fight {{has been}} {{described}} as a dungeon crawler. Players have the option to use either virtual joystick and button controls or tap-based controls. The player plays with a maximum team of 3 characters in a team on a level. The player controls one of the characters and may interchange with the other team members. A character swap will incur a cool down before the player can <b>swap</b> <b>back</b> to the previously used character.Each mission uses energy to play. Energy is gained by leveling up your SHIELD base with SHIELD XP, through in game rewards and achievements. There are over 135 different playable characters. The player's character has a default attack mode which does substantial damage involving repetitive melee/weapon attacks based on the character type chosen. The active character will lock onto a target and continue moving toward it to attack it unless input to behave otherwise. Apart from the default attack mode each character has additional special skills these may be directed attacks,AOE attacks or induce application of buffs or shields and are unique to each character. Each skill comes with a cool down. Skills are either active or passive. An active skill is initiated by the user, while passive skills will trigger on specific conditions met during game play. A character will start out with 2 skills initially and gain upto 6 skills as it is ranked up.Apart from the 6 skills each character has an additional Leadership skill unlocked through mastery of the character. This skill is active when the character is in the leadership position of the team. All team members will receive the benefits of the leadership skill for the entire duration of the level.Another skill type called tier-2 skill is unlocked when the character attains tier-2 status. Certain characters start out as automatic tier-2 charactersThe player can have a maximum of 5 teams set up. There are also team bonuses, for certain sets of character team combinations. Characters are unlocked and ranked up by obtaining Biometrics, which can be found in certain missions as well as the Game store. Characters can get better upgrade options at higher levels and can be leveled up through character XP. Players are able to customize heroes to their play style through upgrades, such as upgrading skills, gear, and equipping ISO-8. Upgrading skills increases their damage level, upgrading gear improves a specific trait of the hero, like HP or Attack Speed, and equipping ISO-8 sets provides varying buffs and traits. In the various stores, in addition to Biometrics, players can also buy chests, energy, clear tickets, ISO-8, Biometric packages, and other supplies. Certain stores require tokens while the Game store require either gems or real currency the uniform store and SHIELD lab mini-store require gems and gold.|$|E
