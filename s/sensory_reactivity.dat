50|$|Strelau {{is author}} of the Regulative Theory of Temperament (RTT) that {{concentrates}} on formal aspects of behavior comprising energetic and temporal characteristics composed of such traits as: <b>sensory</b> sensitivity, emotional <b>reactivity,</b> endurance and activity (energetic aspect), briskness and perseveration (temporal combustion). The Formal Characteristics of Behavior - Temperament Inventory (FCB-TI), developed by Strelau and Bogdan Zawadzki and adapted to many language versions allows for measuring these traits. A lot of empirical evidence has been collected by Strelau and his collaborators demonstrating that heritability explains about 40 {{percent of the variance in}} RTT temperament traits. In many studies, conducted among others on victims of disasters and catastrophes it came out that such traits as emotional reactivity, perseveration and activity are significant moderators of psychological consequences (e.g. PTSD) of experienced trauma.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Personality dispositions may {{influence}} perceptions of work stress. The paper examines {{the relationship between}} temperament in terms of Strelau's Regulative Theory of Temperament and the effort-reward imbalance and its components. Material and Methods: There were 890 participants (360 men) aged 37. 9 years on average. Temperament traits of briskness and perseveration (temporal characteristics of behavior), <b>sensory</b> sensitivity, emotional <b>reactivity,</b> endurance and activity (energetic characteristics of behavior) were measured by Strelau & Zawadzki's Formal Characteristics of Behavior-Temperament Inventory (FCB-TI) in 1997 and 2001. Effort and reward at work were assessed with the original effortreward imbalance (ERI) questionnaire of 2007. Results: Higher ERI at work was predicted by higher emotional reactivity, higher perseveration, lower briskness, and lower endurance. Higher effort and lower rewards at work were predicted by higher perseveration and lower endurance. The FCB-TI temperament characteristics accounted for 5. 2 %, 4. 8 % and 6. 5 % {{of the variance in}} the ERI, effort and reward, respectively. Lower emotional reactivity, lower perseveration, higher briskness and higher endurance predicted higher esteem at work, job promotion and job security. Conclusions: Individual differences in arousability, reflected in temporal and energetic characteristics of behavior, may predispose to or to protect from an effort-reward imbalance at work. Individual differences should be acknowledged in work stress prevention and developing interventions...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{main goal}} of the {{research}} was to assess temperamental determinants of trauma symptoms in firemen, policemen and soldiers. The temperament traits which were considered were those postulated by the Regulative Theory of Temperament (briskness, perseveration, <b>sensory</b> sensitivity, emotional <b>reactivity,</b> endurance and activity). Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was run on non-clinical samples. The participants were 417 men, White-Caucasian only: 284 firemen (aged 21 – 55), 58 policemen (aged 22 – 45), and 75 soldiers (aged 21 – 42). Temperament was assessed using the Formal Characteristics of Behavior – Temperament Inventory. Intensity of trauma symptoms was assessed with the PTSD-Factorial Version Inventory, a quantitative measure of trauma-related symptoms. The respondents were examined in their place of work. The study included only men reporting at least 1 traumatic event during {{the year before the}} trauma diagnosis. Results: Emotional reactivity had a significant positive effect on the intensity of trauma symptoms only in the group of firemen. Emotional reactivity accounted for 16 % of the variance of trauma intensity symptoms in this occupational group. Negative significant effect on trauma symptoms was found for briskness only in the soldiers group (briskness explained 20 % trauma intensity variance in this group).

Results Results suggest that older boys with FXS display increased cardiac reactivity to auditory input than younger boys with FXS that distinguishes them from typically developing controls. Higher mental age was associated with decreased latency to react.

40|$|Background: It is {{commonly}} reported {{that children with}} autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit hyper-reactivity or hypo-reactivity to sensory stimuli. Electroencephalography (EEG) {{is commonly}} used to study neural <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity,</b> suggesting that statistical analysis of EEG recordings is a potential means of automatic classification of the disorder. EEG recordings taken from children, however, are frequently contaminated with large amounts of noise, making analysis difficult. In this paper, we present a method for the automatic extraction of noise-robust EEG features, which serve to quantify neural <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity.</b> We show the efficacy of a system for the classification of ASD using these features. Methods: An oddball paradigm was used to elicit event-related potentials {{from a group of}} 19 ASD children and 30 typically developing children. EEG recordings were taken and robust features were extracted. A support vector machine, logistic regression, and a naive Bayes classifier were used to classify the children as having ASD or being typically developing. Results: A classification accuracy of 79 % was achieved, making our method competitive with other automatic diagnosis methods based on EEG. Additionally, we found that classification performance is reduced if eye blink artifacts are removed during preprocessing. Conclusions: This study shows that robust EEG features that quantify neural <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> are useful for the classification of ASD. We showed that noise-robust features are crucial for our analysis, and observe that traditional preprocessing methods may lead to poor classification performance {{in the face of a}} large amount of noise.

40|$|The {{present study}} explores the {{relationship}} between Cloninger scales and Strelau's Regulative Theory of Temperament (RTT) traits. Cloninger's psychobiological model identifies four dimensions of temperament (Novelty seeking, Harm Avoidance, Reward Dependence and Persistence) and three dimensions of character (Self-Directedness, Cooperativeness and Self-Transcendence). RTT proposes the traits of Briskness, Perseveration, <b>Sensory</b> Sensitivity, Emotional <b>Reactivity,</b> Endurance and Activity as the basic dimensions underlying individual differences. The relationships between the dimensions of Cloninger's Temperament and Character and Strelau's Regulative Theory of Temperament are investigated {{in a sample of}} 282 participants. Data analysis demonstrated some significant correlations between the two models. The strongest associations were found between the dimension of Harm Avoidance from Cloninger’s concept and Strelau’s RTT traits (positive correlations from r =. 73 for Emotional Reactivity to r =. 48 for Perseveration, and negative correlations from r =-. 57 for Endurance to r =-. 51 for Briskness). However, there is not enough evidence to suggest that the two models offer an alternative way of explaining individual differences. According to RTT, temperamental traits are expressed in formal characteristics of behavior (energetic and temporal) and every kind of behavior (irrespective of its content) can be described in the same formal categories. In the Psychobiological Model of Personality the traits are characterized rather by the content or goals of behavior. In this model, in addition to underlining the biological variation of heritable traits, the social, cultural and phenotypical levels of behavior are reflected...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{is often}} accompanied by hyper- and hyporeactivity to <b>sensory</b> stimuli. Atypical <b>reactivity</b> to <b>sensory</b> information can lead to stress reactions. Clinical practice suggests that that {{this can lead to}} long term distress and impairments in day-to-day functioning. It seems reasonable to assume that coping strategies could be of influence on the level of distress associated with atypical reactivity. Methodology: Results of 44 adults (23 men, 21 women; full scale IQ > 85) with ASD on the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ) were compared to the results on the Utrechtse Coping Lijst (UCL). Results: Preliminary analyses show that of all scales only scores on the subscale ‘Passive reaction pattern’ significantly predicted scores on the scales ‘Hyperreactivity' (b= 2. 61, t (29) = 3. 69, p=. 001, R²=. 319) and ‘Hyporeactivity' (b= 1. 61, t (29) = 2. 69, p=. 012, R²=. 199) of the GSQ. This could indicate that a passive reaction pattern influences the reactivity to stimuli, or vice versa. ‘Passive reaction pattern’ also significantly predicted the scores on some but not all of the sense-specific scales, e. g. proprioceptive stimuli (b=. 509, t (29) = 3. 78, p=. 001, R²=. 330). Perspectives: Investigating which coping strategies are related to hyper- or hyperactivity is essential for the development of interventions focusing on sensory issues and aiming at stress reduction for adults with ASD. The results obtained in this research will be used in the development of such an intervention.

40|$|Allergic asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disorder {{with an increased}} responsiveness of the airways to non-specific stimuli referred to as airway hyperreactivity (AHR). Previous studies indicate that neurotrophin levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) are increased after allergen provocation in patients suffering from asthma. In addition, a lot of in vivo and in vitro studies provide evidence that these factors, in particular NGF, exert multiple functions on diverse immune cell subpopulations and {{may be involved in}} the induction of AHR. The aim of Paper 1 was to investigate whether neurotrophins may affect immune cell function within the airways. We investigated therefore the effects of these factors on survival and activation of eosinophils that were obtained from peripheral blood and BALF after segmental allergen provocation. Our data clearly indicate that both NGF, BDNF, NT- 3 and NT- 4 increase activation and promote survival, but, interestingly, these effects were restricted to BALF eosinophils. In order to identify the underlying mechanism that caused a different response to neurotrophins in the investigated eosinophil populations, we analyzed neurotrophin receptor expression. We could clearly demonstrate that expression of p 75 NTR, TrkA, TrkB and TrkC was upregulated in BALF eosinophils compared to blood eosinophils. In conclusion, study 1 was was the first study suggesting that not only NGF, which has been extensively investigated in the past decades, but also BDNF, NT- 3 and NT- 4 may directly affect immune cell function and may contribute to airway inflammation by direct interaction with the neurotrophin receptors p 75 NTR, TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC on the surface of BALF eosinophils. Furthermore, this study indicates that neurotrophin receptor expression is regulated in an allergen-dependent manner which has not been described before. In order to analyze which of these neurotrophin receptors may be involved in eosinophilia in vivo, we performed study 2 (shown in Paper 2) in a murine model of allergic asthma. In this model, we could observe a similar allergen-dependent upregulation of neurotrophin receptor mRNA expression in the lung tissue like in human eosinophils. This finding was accompanied by an increase in neurotrophin receptor immunoreactice immune cells located peribronchially and perivascularly. Trk receptors were antagonized by intranasal application of REN 1826, a novel soluble pan-Trk receptor decoy, in OVA sensitized and OVA-aerosol challenged mice. Our data indicate that the effects of neurotrophins on eosinophil function in vitro may be probably attributed to p 75 NTR activation 104; 145 since the number of eosinophils recruited to the airways was unaltered by treatment with REN 1826. However, abrogation of Trk mediated signals significantly reduced Th 2 cytokine synthesis pointing out a possible role of Trk receptors in T-lymphocyte regulation. Furthermore, we observed a constitutive Trk receptor expression in nerve fibers surrounding the airways and in airway smooth muscle cells. These cells were implicated in the development of AHR. Therefore, we hypothesized that Trk receptors may play a functional {{role in the development of}} AHR. An indeed, antagonization of Trk receptor mediated signals by local treatment with REN 1826 reduced the sensitivity of afferent sensory nerves in response to inhaled capsaicin and abrogated reflex bronchospasm after irritation of sensory nerves. In contrast, airway smooth muscle function remained unaltered as indicated by unchanged EF 50 values after MCh challenge. Therefore, we suggested that Trk receptors might contribute to AHR by induction of functional changes in sensory nerves. In conclusion, Paper 2 provides new evidence that the neurotrophin/Trk receptor system play a critical role in regulating airway inflammation in vivo and that Trk receptors might contribute to the development of AHR by amplification of <b>sensory</b> nerve <b>reactivity.</b> In summary, the results of both studies indicate that neurotrophins and their receptors may be involved in multiple functional changes of diverse cell types which are key players in allergic asthma. On the basis of our data obtained during this MD/PhD project, we hypothesize that antagonization of neurotrophins or their receptors might be a useful tool in asthma treatment...|$|R
40|$|Unusual {{responses}} to sensory stimuli {{have been reported}} in nearly all children with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). A few studies on adults indicate that the sensory and perceptual problems persist into adulthood. Sensory symptoms have not been included in the diagnostic criteria for ASC but in the new diagnostic manual (DSM- 5, 2013) hyper- or hyporeactivity or unusual sensory interests were included in the diagnostic criteria for ASC. Sensory phenomena are mostly investigated in studies involving children and the scales used to measure <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> have been constructed {{on the basis of the}} scientific literature and parents’ reports. The experiences of adults with ASC are not well understood and have not been systematically used to develop measures. The overall aim of the thesis was to capture the first-hand experiences of and perspectives on <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> and translate them into a self-rating scale. To fulfil this overarching aim the personal sensory experiences of adults with ASC were investigated and the variations and range of atypical sensory phenomena explored and described in two qualitative studies (study I and II). The analyses of the firstperson descriptions enabled the development of items for a scale. These were reduced in steps and the final scale which was named the <b>Sensory</b> <b>Reactivity</b> in Autism Spectrum scale (SR-AS) comprised 32 items in four subscales: high awareness/ hyperreactivity, low awareness/hyporeactivity, strong sensory interests and sensory/motor. The SR-AS was validated using content and factor analyses. Its discriminative validity was then investigated as well as its reliability in the form of internal consistency (study III). In the final step the scale was used to identify clusters of atypical sensory functioning in adults with ASC by hierarchical cluster analysis (study IV). Three different sensory clusters were found. The main contribution of this thesis is its presentation of individual experience and perspectives and the creation of an clinical tool to measure atypical <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> frequently experienced by people with ASC. The ways in which the SR-AS can be used comprise assessment of individual sensory patterns for self-knowledge and awareness, to enable the development of coping strategies and to provide information on environmental adjustments required. In diagnostic processes where other criteria for ASC are fulfilled the SR-AS can be used for assessing sensory symptoms according to the DSM- 5...|$|E
40|$|Recent reports {{identify}} sensory subtypes in ASD {{based on}} shared patterns {{of responses to}} daily sensory stimuli [Ausderau et al., 2014; Lane, Molloy, & Bishop, 2014]. Lane et al. propose that two broad sensory dimensions, <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> and multisensory integration, best explain the differences between subtypes, however this {{has yet to be}} tested. The present study tests this hypothesis by examining the latent constructs underlying Lane's sensory subtypes. Participants for this study were caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 2 – 12 years. Caregiver responses on the Short Sensory Profile (SSP), used to establish Lane's sensory subtypes, were extracted from two existing datasets (total n[*]=[*] 287). Independent component analyses were conducted to test the fit and interpretability of a two-construct structure underlying the SSP, and therefore, the sensory subtypes. The first construct was largely comprised of the taste/smell sensitivity domain, which describes hyper-reactivity to taste and smell stimuli. The second construct had a significant contribution from the low energy/weak domain, which describes behaviors that may be indicative of difficulties with multisensory integration. Findings provide initial support for our hypothesis that <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> and multisensory integration underlie Lane's sensory subtypes in ASD...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: It {{is common}} in asthma and allergy clinics to see {{patients}} presenting with upper and lower airway symptoms that are induced by chemicals and scents and not explained by allergic or asthmatic reactions. Previous {{studies have shown that}} these patients often have increased cough sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin; such sensitivity is known to reflect the airway <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the duration of symptoms induced by chemicals and scents and to measure health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with chemically induced airway symptoms. We also wished to determine and compare repeatability of the cough response to capsaicin inhalation, and to evaluate the patients ’ airway <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> in a long-term perspective. PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen patients with a history of at least 12 months of airway symptoms induced by chemicals and scents were followed over 5 years with repeated questionnaires, measurements of HRQL, and capsaicin inhalation tests. RESULTS: The symptoms persisted and did not change significantly over time, and the patients had a reduced HRQL that did not change during the 5 -year period. The capsaicin sensitivity was increased at the start of the study, the cough sensitivity was long-lasting, and the repeatability of the capsaicin inhalation test was considered to be good in a long-term perspective. CONCLUSIONS: Upper and lower airway symptoms induced by chemicals and scents represent an entity of chronic diseases, different from asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with persistent symptoms, a reduced HRQL, and unchanged sensory hyperreactivity...|$|E
40|$|Tori L Schaefer, Matthew H Davenport, Craig A Erickson Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Cincinnati Children&# 39;s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA Abstract: Fragile X {{syndrome}} (FXS) is {{the most}} common single gene cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Caused by a silenced fragile X mental retardation 1 gene and the subsequent deficiency in fragile X mental retardation protein, patients with FXS experience a range of physical, behavioral, and intellectual debilitations. The FXS field, as a whole, has recently met with some challenges, as several targeted clinical trials with high expectations of success have failed to elucidate significant improvements in a variety of symptom domains. As new clinical trials in FXS are planned, there has been much discussion about the use of the commonly used clinical outcome measures, as well as study design considerations, patient stratification, and optimal age range for treatment. The evidence that modification of these drug targets and use of these failed compounds would prove to be efficacious in human clinical study were rooted in years of basic and translational research. There are questions arising as {{to the use of the}} mouse models for studying FXS treatment development. This issue is twofold: many of the symptom domains and molecular and biochemical changes assessed and indicative of efficacy in mouse model study are not easily amenable to clinical trials in people with FXS because of the intolerability of the testing paradigm or a lack of noninvasive techniques (prepulse inhibition, <b>sensory</b> hypersensitivity, startle <b>reactivity,</b> or electrophysiologic, biochemical, or structural changes in the brain); and capturing subtle yet meaningful changes in symptom domains such as sociability, anxiety, and hyperactivity in human FXS clinical trials is challenging with the currently used measures (typically parent/caregiver rating scales). Clinicians, researchers, and the pharmaceutical industry have all had to take a step back and critically evaluate the way we think about how to best optimize future investigations into pharmacologic FXS treatments. As new clinical trials are coming down the drug discovery pipeline, it is clear that the field is moving in a direction that values the development of molecular biomarkers, less subjective quantitative measures of symptom improvement, and rating scales developed specifically for use in FXS in conjunction with drug safety. While summarizing preclinical evidence, where applicable, and discussing challenges in FXS treatment development, this review details both completed clinical trials for the targeted and symptomatic treatment of FXS and introduces novel projects on the cusp of clinical trial investigation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between noncognitive symptoms and premorbid temperament in a group with Alzheimer’s disease. The relationship between premorbid temperament and noncognitive symptoms can be used to understand symptom susceptibility and risk, caregiver burdens, as well as providing insights into the neuroanatomical substrates of temperament and noncognitive behaviour. Sixty-three primary caregivers of Alzheimer’s patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria for this study. Information regarding the noncognitive symptoms and premorbid temperament was procured from the primary caregivers. In fifty-one cases, a secondary caregiver also provided information about the premorbid temperament of the Alzheimer’s patient. The latter was obtained to enhance the reliability of retrospective data. The Behaviour Rating Scale for Dementia, the Formal Characteristics of Behaviour-Temperament Inventory, and the Blessed Dementia scale were used to elicit data on noncognitive symptomatology, premorbid temperament, and current cognitive status, respectively. ii Noncognitive symptoms were grouped into two clusters namely neuropsychiatric and neurobehavioural disturbances. The neuropsychiatric cluster included mood and psychotic symptoms and the neurobehavioural cluster included vegetative and overall behavioural dysregulatory symptoms. Results showed that there is a wide spectrum of noncognitive symptom manifestation in patients’ profiles and that the neurobehavioural dysregulatory symptoms are more common than the neuropsychiatric symptoms in this Alzheimer’s cohort. With regard to symptom manifestation and cognitive status, a Pearson product moment correlational analysis showed that a lower level of cognitive functioning is significantly associated with aggressive episodes and a higher level of cognitive functioning with manifestations of depressive symptoms. In terms of interrater concordance on premorbid temperament ratings, intraclass correlations were significant for five of the six temperament domains, thus indicating a reliable estimate of premorbid disposition. Canonical correlational analysis yielded two significant variates. The first variate indicated that Alzheimer’s disease patients with a proclivity for aggressive behaviours and general behavioural deregulation but lower depressive profiles, were premorbidly more emotionally reactive, had low sensory thresholds (high sensitivity), and greater cognitive deficit. The second variate showed that patients with Alzheimer’s disease who tended to manifest with depressive and dysregulatory behaviour appear to have been premorbidly perseverative in temperament with a low sensory threshold (high sensitivity) and the tendency to maintain and attain a low level of activity (stimulation). Taken together, the significant variates revealed a dimensional relationship between depressive symptoms, aggressive symptoms, and behavioural dysregulation; and <b>sensory</b> sensitivity, emotional <b>reactivity,</b> perseverance, and activity, with cognitive status serving as a moderating variable. In conclusion, the study indicated a dimensional relationship between specific premorbid temperament traits and noncognitive symptoms, thereby highlighting the possible predictive influence of premorbid temperament on noncognitive manifestations in Alzheimer’s disease patients.

40|$|AbstractThe {{neonatal}} period {{is considered to}} be essential for neurodevelopment and wellbeing throughout the life span, yet little is known about brain–behavior relationships in the {{neonatal period}}. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association between neonatal sensory–motor regulation and white-matter (WM) integrity of major fiber tracts in the neonatal period. We hypothesized that WM integrity of sensory–motor systems would predict neurobehavioral maturation during the first month of life. Forty-nine premature neonates underwent magnetic-resonance-imaging at term. Diffusion-tensor-imaging analysis was performed in major WM tracts along with repeated neonatal neurobehavioral evaluations assessing <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> and motor regulation. Difficulties in one or more behavioral sub-category, mostly in auditory and visual attention, hypotonicity and jitteriness, were documented in 78. 3 % infants at term. Sixty-six percent of infants experienced difficulties, mostly in auditory attention, head–neck control, hypotonicity and motor asymmetry, at 44 weeks. Attention difficulties were associated with reduced integrity of cerebral and superior cerebellar peduncles; while tonicity was associated with reduced integrity of the corpus-callosum and inferior–posterior tracts. Overall, results showed that early maturing tracts were related with the degree of typicality of <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> status while late maturing tracts were related with the degree of typicality of tonic regulation. WM integrity and maturation factors explained 40. 2 % of the variance in neurobehavior at 44 weeks.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{determine}} if parasympathetic nervous system (PsNS) activity is a significant biomarker of sensory processing difficulties in children. Several studies have demonstrated that PsNS activity is an important regulator of reactivity in children, and thus, it is of interest to study whether PsNS activity is related to <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> in children who have a type of condition associated with sensory processing disorders termed sensory modulation dysfunction (SMD). If so, this will have important implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying sensory processing problems of children and for developing intervention strategies to address them. The primary aims of this project were: (1) to evaluate PsNS activity in children with SMD compared to typically developing (TYP) children, and (2) to determine if PsNS activity is a significant predictor of sensory behaviors and adaptive functions among children with SMD. We examine PsNS activity during the Sensory Challenge Protocol; which includes baseline, the administration of eight sequential stimuli in five sensory domains, recovery, and also evaluate response to a prolonged auditory stimulus. As a secondary aim we examined whether subgroups of children with specific physiological and behavioral <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> profiles can be identified. Results indicate that as a total group the children with severe SMD demonstrated a trend for low baseline PsNS activity, compared to TYP children, suggesting this may be a biomarker for SMD. In addition, children with SMD as a total group demonstrated significantly poorer adaptive behavior in the communication and daily living subdomains and in the overall Adaptive Behavior Composite of the Vineland than TYP children. Using latent class analysis, the subjects were grouped by severity and the severe SMD group had significantly lower PsNS activity at baseline, tones and prolonged auditory. These results provide preliminary evidence that children who demonstrate severe SMD may have physiological activity that is different from children without SMD, and that these physiological and behavioral manifestations of SMD may affect a child's ability to engage in everyday social, communication, and daily living skills.

40|$|A high {{incidence}} of sensory processing difficulties exists in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and children with idiopathic Sensory Modulation Disorder (SMD). This is the first study to directly compare and contrast these clinical disorders. Sympathetic nervous system markers of arousal and reactivity were utilized in a laboratory paradigm that administered a series of sensory challenges across five sensory domains. The Short Sensory Profile, a standardized parent-report measure, provided a measure of sensory-related behaviors. Physiological arousal and <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> were lower in children with ASD whereas reactivity after each sensory stimulus was higher in SMD, particularly to the first stimulus in each sensory domain. Both clinical groups had significantly more sensory-related behaviors than typically developing children, with contrasting profiles.

40|$|Anxiety is {{associated}} with an exaggerated expectancy of harm, including overestimation of how likely a conditioned stimulus (CS+) predicts a harmful unconditioned stimulus (US). In the current study we tested whether anxiety-associated expectancy of harm increases primary sensory cortex (S 1) activity on non-reinforced (i. e., no shock) CS+ trials. Twenty healthy volunteers completed a differential-tone trace conditioning task while undergoing fMRI, with shock delivered to the left hand.

Right S 1 activity also correlated with individual differences in both primary auditory cortices (A 1) and amygdala activity.

Current literature suggests that two-thirds of all dogs have been infected with this parasite, and 7 % of all humans have antibodies to T. canis. T. canis completes its life cycle in dogs, but when it infects aberrant mammalian hosts (e. g., humans or mice), larvae migrate through various organ systems including the brain, where they can remain viable and mobile for extended periods of time. Changes in motor activity, <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity,</b> and learning of mice infected with T. canis have been observed. The pattern of behavioral changes {{is influenced by the}} infection regime and exposure to other toxicants such as lead. Scope of the Problem The clinical manifestation of many diseases are dependent on factors such as the genetic constitution and environmental history of both the host and the infectious agent. The concept of zoonosis, the transmission of...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{addition}} to difficulties in social communication, current diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum conditions (ASC) also incorporate sensorimotor difficulties; repetitive motor movements and atypical reactivity to sensory input (APA, 2013). This paper explores whether sensorimotor difficulties {{are associated with}} the development and maintenance of symptoms in ASC. Firstly, studies have shown difficulties coordinating sensory input into planning and executing movement effectively in ASC. Secondly, studies have shown associations between <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> and motor coordination with core ASC symptoms, suggesting these areas each strongly influence the development of social and communication skills. Thirdly, studies have begun to demonstrate that sensorimotor difficulties in ASC could account for reduced social attention early in development, with a cascading effect on later social, communicative and emotional development. These results suggest that sensorimotor difficulties not only contribute to non-social difficulties such as narrow circumscribed interests, but also to the development of social behaviours such as effectively coordinating eye contact with speech and gesture, interpreting others’ behaviour and responding appropriately. Further research is needed to explore the link between sensory and motor difficulties in ASC, and their contribution to the development and maintenance of ASC...|$|E
40|$|Selective mutism (SM) is a {{childhood}} anxiety disorder. Since anxiety {{is related to}} Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) {{the purpose of this}} study was to find out if sensory processing difficulties are present in children with SM. Clinical information was collected online from 147 caregivers and the data were complete for 122 subjects (ages 3 - 18). Short Sensory Profile (SSP) assessment was used to measure <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> in a group of children with SM. According to SSP definite sensory impairments were detected in 64 % of the children with SM, whereas probable sensory impairments were present in 24 % of the SM group. The highest rates of SPD were reported in three sections of SSP: taste/smell sensitivity, visual/auditory sensitivity and auditory filtering. Moreover, SPD was present at higher rate in children with SM compared to a group of typically developing children. The above findings suggest that a vast percentage of children with SM may be affected by SPD, regardless of other co-occurring diagnoses. This pioneering result has an implication for complementing the existing SM therapy methods with Sensory Integration training (SI) and/ or neurosensorimotor reflex integration techniques...|$|E

Aims: In individuals with Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL; Batten disease), a rare neurodegenerative disorder, to explore 1) the pain experience, 2) {{the relationship between}} pain and self-injurious behavior (SIB), 3) the degree of <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity,</b> and 4) the degree of <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> in comparison to individuals without NCL. Method: Following informed consent, eight participants with NCL (M age= 14. 8 years, range= 8 - 22) were characterized in terms of pain experience (frequency, type, intensity, interference, expression, and coping) and severity of SIB. A brief sensory test (light touch, repeated Von Frey monofilament) was conducted with each participant with NCL {{as well as with}} a sibling comparison group without NCL (n= 8, M age= 23. 5 years, range = 8 - 37). During sensory testing, pain expression was measured using the Battens Observational Pain Scale (BOPS) and infrared thermography (IRT) was used to quantify changes in skin/eye temperature. Results: Individuals with NCL experienced pain frequently and from multiple sources that most negatively impacted enjoyment of life, mood, sleep, and social interactions. Individuals with NCL {{were significantly more likely to}} express their pain using vocal/social pain behaviors rather than body and limbs (p<. 05) or physiological behaviors (p<. 01). When in pain, individuals tended to seek social support more often. Individuals with NCL who had moderately severe SIB showed significantly more pain behaviors than individuals with mild or no SIB (p<. 05). Individuals with NCL were reactive to the sensory testing as IRT temperatures significantly increased (p<. 001). Across combined conditions (light touch, repeated Von Frey), individuals with NCL were significantly more reactive (BOPS total score) to sensory testing compared to individuals in the sibling comparison group (p<. 05). Similarly, IRT difference scores between sensory conditions revealed a significant increase in temperature at all face/eye sites for individuals with NCL compared to siblings (p<. 001). Interpretation: In this sample of individuals with NCL pain was intense and frequent with multiple sources that interfered with a range of daily activities. Individuals with moderately severe SIB may be more sensitive to pain or may experience more pain in general. BOPS scores were elevated prior to sensory testing suggesting that individuals with NCL are living with ongoing pain. The increased pain expression during the repeated application of the Von Frey filament, a partial test of central sensitization, further suggests that the pathophysiology of the ongoing pain individuals with NCL are living with is likely centrally not peripherally mediated...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{possible}} correlations between overall sensory processing responsivity and relationship attachment, as well as between sensory subscales and relationship attachment. It also tested for a difference between sensory processing patterns among young adults with and without ADHD. The sample included 370 college students: 32 who had received an ADHD diagnosis and 338 who had not. Participants completed an online self-report survey made up of various demographics questions, the Sensory Processing Quotient (SPQ), and the Experiences in Close Relationships – General/Global Scale (ECR-General). A significant correlation was discovered between general SPQ scores and relationship anxiety (r = -. 118, p =. 030). Significant correlations were also evident between vision scores and both relationship anxiety (r = -. 183, p 3 ̆c. 001) and avoidance (r = -. 131, p =. 013). Correlations were small but statistically significant. Finally, no significant difference in total SPQ scores was discovered between young adults with and without ADHD. Results imply that <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> is related to relationship attachment, but not to ADHD. Therefore, sensory processing difficulties may be completely unrelated to ADHD symptomology. However, these results are inconsistent with previous research, and further studies need to take place to ensure reliability of results...|$|E
40|$|The Developmental, Individual Difference, Relationship-Based Model (DIR) is an {{approach}} used {{for young children}} with autistic spectrum disorders (Greenspan 2 ̆ 6 Wieder, 1999). The interventions derived from this model are anchored {{in the understanding of}} each child 2 ̆ 7 s unique profile of functional development capacities, enabling parents and professionals to construct an intervention plan geared to these individual characteristics. This study examined the change in autistic symptomatology and functioning in preschoolers participating in a DIR school program. The purpose was to examine the impact of DIR treatment on the children as well as to clarify associations between aspects of autistic symptomatology and functioning, which may be pertinent to future intervention and treatment planning. The participants were 13 three to five year olds diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder who attended a full day preschool program that utilizes the DIR approach. Nine children were studied for one year (two time points) and four children were studied for two years (four time points). Time sampling procedures were used to measure change across the following dimensions: autistic symptomatology, social-emotional functioning, adaptive behavior, stereotypic behavior, <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity,</b> and parent stress. ^ Significant differences across one year were found for autistic symptomatology, stereotypic behavior, sensory seeking behaviors, and adaptive behavior.

40|$|The endocannabinoids {{anandamide}} and 2 -arachidonoyglycerol (2 -AG) {{may contribute}} to the regulation of mood and emotion. In this study, we investigated the impact of the endocannabinoid transport inhibitor AM 404 on three rat models of anxiety: elevated plus maze, defensive withdrawal and separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. AM 404 (1 - 5 mg kg - 1, intraperitoneal (i. p.)) exerted dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effects in the three models. These behavioral effects were associated with increased levels of anandamide, but not 2 -AG, in the prefrontal cortex and were prevented by the CB 1 cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant (SR 141716 A), suggesting that they were dependent on anandamide-mediated activation of CB 1 cannabinoid receptors. We also evaluated whether AM 404 might influence motivation (in the conditioned place preference (CPP) test), <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> (acoustic startle reflex) and sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex). In the CPP test, AM 404 (1. 25 - 10 mg kg - 1, i. p.) elicited rewarding effects in rats housed under enriched conditions, but not in rats kept in standard cages. Moreover, AM 404 did not alter reactivity to sensory stimuli or cause overt perceptual distortion, as suggested by its lack of effect on startle or PPI of startle. These results support a role of anandamide in the regulation of emotion and point to the anandamide transport system as a potential target for anxiolytic drugs. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} a {{preliminary}} investigation of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) functioning in children with disturbances in sensory processing. The specific aims {{of this study were}} to (1) provide preliminary data about group differences in parasympathetic functions, as measured by the vagal tone index, between children with disturbances in sensory processing and those without; (2) determine effect size and power needed for future studies; and (3) to lay the foundation for further examination of the relations of parasympathetic functioning and functional behavior in children with disturbances in sensory processing. Participants were 15 children, nine with disturbances in sensory processing and six typically developing children. Heart period data were continuously collected for a 2 -minute baseline and during administration of the 15 -minute Sensory Challenge Protocol, a unique laboratory protocol designed to measure <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> (Miller, Reisman, McIntosh, 2 ̆ 6 Simon, 2001). Groups were compared on vagal tone index, heart period, and heart rate using two-tailed, independent sample t tests. Children with disturbances in sensory processing had significantly lower vagal tone than the typically developing sample (t(13) = 2. 4, p =. 05). Statistical power analysis indicated that, for future studies, a sample size of 20 in each group would yield adequate statistical power. Although the number of subjects in this pilot study is small, the results from this study support further investigations of parasympathetic functions and functional behavior in children with disturbances in sensory processing...|$|E
40|$|Young {{children}} are often hyperreactive to somatosensory inputs hardly noticed by adults, {{as exemplified by}} irritation to seams or labels in clothing. The neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying changes in <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> are not well understood. Based {{on the idea that}} neurodevelopmental changes in somatosensory processing and/or changes in sensory adaptation might underlie developmental differences in somatosensory reactivity, high-density electroencephalography was used to examine how the nervous system responds and adapts to repeated vibrotactile stimulation over childhood. Participants aged 6 – 18 yr old were presented with 50 -ms vibrotactile stimuli to the right wrist over the median nerve at 5 blocked interstimulus intervals (ranging from 7 to 1 per second). Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) revealed three major phases of activation within the first 200 ms, with scalp topographies suggestive of neural generators in contralateral somatosensory cortex. Although overall SEPs were highly similar for younger, middle, and older age groups (6. 1 – 9. 8, 10. 0 – 12. 9, and 13. 0 – 17. 8 yr old), there were significant age-related amplitude differences in initial and later phases of the SEP. In contrast, robust adaptation effects for fast vs. slow presentation rates were observed that did not differ as a function of age. A greater amplitude response in the later portion of the SEP was observed for the youngest group and may be related to developmental changes in responsivity to somatosensory stimuli. These data suggest the protracted development of the somatosensory system over childhood, whereas adaptation, as assayed in this study, is largely in place by 7 years of age...|$|E
40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined complex neurodevelopmental {{syndrome}} {{characterized by}} impairments in social communication, {{by the presence}} of restricted and repetitive behaviors, interests and activities, and by abnormalities in <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity.</b> Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising, emerging tool for the study and potential treatment of ASD. Recent studies suggest that TMS measures provide rapid and noninvasive pathophysiological ASD biomarkers. Furthermore, repetitive TMS (rTMS) may represent a novel treatment strategy for reducing some of the core and associated ASD symptoms. However, the available literature on the TMS use in ASD is preliminary, composed of studies with methodological limitations. Thus, off-label clinical rTMS use for therapeutic interventions in ASD without an investigational device exemption and outside of an IRB approved research trial is premature pending further, adequately powered and controlled trials. Leaders in this field have gathered annually for a two-day conference (prior to the 2014 and 2015 International Meeting for Autism Research, IMFAR) to share recent progress, promote collaboration across laboratories, and establish consensus on protocols. Here we review the literature in the use of TMS in ASD {{in the context of the}} unique challenges required for the study and exploration of treatment strategies in this population. We also suggest future directions for this field of investigations. While its true potential in ASD has yet to be delineated, TMS represents an innovative research tool and a novel, possibly transformative approach to the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders.

This study, performed per OECD 408 guidance, examined the 90 -day subchronic safety/toxicity of an extract standardized to 50 % p-synephrine at doses of 100, 300 and 1000  mg/kg/day to male and female rats. No adverse effects were observed with respect {{to any of the}} observed parameters of clinical signs, functional observations of <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity,</b> grip strength and motor activity, ophthalmology, body weights, hematology, food consumption, urinalysis, organ weights, as well as gross and microscopic pathology at termination at any of the doses in either sex. Treatment at 1000  mg/kg body weight/day of the extract resulted in non-adverse effects including fully reversible signs of repetitive head burrowing in the bedding material and piloerection for short periods of time in both sexes immediately after administration, which gradually disappeared by treatment day- 81. A slight and reversible elevation of BUN and urea levels in male rats, and slight to mild increase in the relative but not absolute heart weights of male and female rats was observed. Based on these results, the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this bitter orange extract standardized to 50 % p-synephrine was 300  mg/kg, while the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was 1000  mg/kg.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{contribution}} is to broaden the scope of music analysis from a disembodied cognitivist approach to an experiential approach. Revolving around the definition of music as a temporal and sounding art, it argues for an analytical approach that brings together the richness of sensory experience and principles of cognitive economy. Musical sense-making, in this view, relies on two distinctive strategies: tracking the moment-to-moment history of the actual unfolding or recollecting actual and previous sounding events {{in a kind of}} synoptic overview. Both positions are not opposed but complement each other. What is needed, however, is a comprehensive framework that provides both conceptual and operational tools. Five major possibilities are proposed: (i) the concepts of perspective and resolution, which refer to the distance the listener takes with respect to the sounding music and the fine-grainedness of his/her discriminative abilities; (ii) the continuous/discrete dichotomy which conceives of the music as one continuous flow as against a division in separate and distinct elements; (iii) the in time/outside-of-time distinction, with the former proceeding in real time and the latter proceeding mostly outside of the time of actual unfolding; (iv) the deictic approach to musical sense-making, which describes the actual context of the referential exchange between the music and the listener; and (v) the levels of processing, which span a continuum between primitive <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> and high-level symbolic processing. All these approaches are brought together in an encompassing framework that tries to provide the operational tools for analysis-by-ear, which offers the first and most direct access to the music as it unfolds in time. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Literature on {{sleep and}} child {{development}} {{is growing in}} novel directions across several disciplines necessitating guiding conceptual principles and methodological tools. First, this volume presents a summary of discussions from an SRCD-sponsoredmultidisciplinary forum on sleep and development, which includes presentation of key issues and guiding recommendations for research priorities in this fast developing field. Second, enhancing accessibility to child development researchers, state of the science sleep assessment methodologies are presented {{with a discussion of}} their advantages and disadvantages. Third, seven empirical studies conducted with “typically ” developing infants and children provide examples of relations between sleep and some of the many individual and familial factors that influence and are influenced by sleep. In the presentation of empirical findings, a developmental ecological systems perspective adapted to sleep was espoused to illustrate some of the multiple levels of influence in the study of child sleep and development. Collectively, studies in this volume build significantly on the literature through: (a) illustrating linkages between various sleep parameters (e. g., quality, sleeping arrangements) and other key developmental domains (e. g., attachment, parenting); (b) demonstration of longitudinal relations connecting sleep with development, which is scarce in this field; and (c) utilization of actigraphy-based assessments of sleep duration and quality, which are underutilized in the literature yet important for amore nuanced understanding of sleep and development. We proposed an ecological systems perspective adapted to sleep (Sameroff, 2000; Sadeh & Anders, 1993) as an organizing framework for presenting the empirical papers illustrating some of the multiple influences on children’s sleep. Chapter IV in this monograph reflects the “child level ” of influence by presenting a study of relations between <b>sensory</b> <b>reactivity</b> in infants and the development of their sleep patterns.
