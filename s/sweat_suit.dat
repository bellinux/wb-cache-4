The walking test of 2 kilometres of length offers the possibility to determine the Fitness Index (general ability) and evaluate maximal consumption of oxygen VO 2 max. Since the individuals were older, very demanding tests were not recommendable, so we chose UKK test of 2 kilometre walking. Although it engages great muscle groups, it is not considered a risky activity which can bring to quick body exhaustion.

40|$|Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) {{athletes are}} weighed 24 h prior to competition. In order {{to compete in}} a lower weight class MMA athletes will often rapidly lose weight via dehydration. Despite the prevalence, there is {{currently}} no known published data examining the effects of acute dehydration on physiology and performance in mixed martial arts athletes. The present study aimed to examine: i) the effects of 5 % acute dehydration on performance (vertical jump, medicine ball throw, grip strength and repeated sled push) and physiology (body weight, haematocrit, urine specific gravity, serum osmolality and urine osmolality) of MMA athletes. A total of 14 MMA athletes between the ages of 18 and 40 y with at least 2 y of competitive experience were recruited. Participants performed a familiarisation session, followed by two experimental sessions including a control protocol (CONT) or a dehydration protocol (DHY) in a randomised order. During the DHY athletes cycled for 3 h in a heated chamber (40 ˚C and 30 % relative humidity) wearing a <b>sweat</b> <b>suit</b> in order to lose 5 % of their bodyweight (BW). Athletes then underwent a 3 h recovery period, during which they consumed fluids/food ad libitum. Athletes then performed a series of performance tests, including vertical jump, medicine ball throw, wrist grip and repeated sled push. A further 21 h recovery period was allowed before athletes performed the same tests. Prior to weight loss, immediately post weight loss, pre performance testing (3 h post weight loss) and 24 h post weight loss, urine and blood samples were collected and body weight was measured. A lower average speed during the repeat sled push (5. 65 ± 1. 3 km. h- 1) was observed 3 h post DHY compared with 3 h post CONT (6. 99 ± 0. 85 km. h- 1; P- 1) when compared with 24 h post CONT (7. 12 ± 0. 95 km. h- 1; P- 1 and 9. 14 ± 1. 1 km. h- 1 were observed 3 h post DHY/CONT and 8. 82 ± 1. 41 km. h- 1 and 9. 35 ± 1. 06 km. h- 1 24 h post DHY/CONT. A decreased time to fatigue and increased perceived exertion was also observed. The decrements in performance were observed at both 3 h and 24 h post DHY with the decrements still being present but not as large 24 h. When comparing measures of hydration in the DHY with CONT, significantly lower measures of hydration were observed 30 min post DHY and 3 h post DHY. None of the measured markers of hydration indicated athletes were dehydrated 24 h post DHY. The observations of this present study indicate that current weight loss practices in MMA and other combat sports may not be conducive to the best physical performance possible. Current practices should be reconsidered since performance was compromised even following 24 h of recovery. Future research should investigate possible physiological mechanisms behind the observed decrement in performance...|$|E

When I asked Leonard “how does it feel when you’re making history?”, he responded that when people “make history”, they are usually too busy doing it to fully notice the magnitude of what they are achieving. Afterwards, what one recalls often overlaps and gets filtered through the authorized account of the event. This notion came to mind after reading Goa: 20 Years of Psychedelic Trance.

40|$|Sweat {{evaporation}} {{provides the}} primary avenue of heat loss during vigorous exercise in hot weather; therefore, sweat losses can be substantial. Besides containing water, sweat contains electrolytes that are lost through the excretion of bodily fluids. If not appropriately replaced, water and electrolyte imbalances (dehydration and hyponatremia) can develop and adversely affect and individual’s exercise performance and perhaps health (Sawka & Noakes, 2007). It {{is clear that}} hydration strategies have effect exercise performance in the heat. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the effects of different hydration methods on exercise performance in the heat. Method: 9 male participants ages 20 ± 2. 2 with a basic level of cycling ability completed a series of three 30 -minute sessions of cycling in 34 ˚C heat; followed by a 5 -minute average power test measuring average power output (APO) and total work done (TWD), during which they followed three hydration protocols. Participants wore <b>sweat</b> <b>suits</b> for the duration of the testing. A no water hydration protocol (NW); a forced drinking (F) protocol, participants consumed cups containing 200 ml on three occasions; and an ab libitum (AL) condition, participants consumed water when they chose. Baseline measures were taken pre and post sessions to determine hydration status; urine colour (UCOL), specific gravity (USG) and mass (M). Measures of thermal comfort (TC), thirst (T), rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and gut fullness (GF) were collected. Results: Exercise in heat influenced performance over the period of time by increasing measures such as heart rate, peripheral temperature, thermal comfort and gut fullness but caused no significant effect. The 5 -minute time trial found a significant decrease in performance; APO (p= 0. 0005), TWD (p= 0. 001). When partaking in the no water trial, performance was maintained in both the forced and ad libitum trials. No significant difference between groups was seen in any other measures, other than perception of thirst (p= 0. 055) during the 30 -minute sub maximal exercise. This indicates performance can be maintained through the ad libitum fluid ingestion protocol and still perform similarly to a participant maintaining a forced ingestion protocol, thus ad libitum is an effective hydration strategy...|$|R
6000|$|A strict rule is {{not only}} {{necessary}} for ruling; it is also necessary for rebelling. This fixed and familiar ideal is necessary to any sort of revolution. Man will sometimes act slowly upon new ideas; but he will only act swiftly upon old ideas. If I am merely to float or fade or evolve, it may be towards something anarchic; but if I am to riot, it must be for something respectable. This is the whole weakness of certain schools of progress and moral evolution. They suggest {{that there has been}} a slow movement towards morality, with an imperceptible ethical change in every year or at every instant. There is only one great disadvantage in this theory. It talks of a slow movement towards justice; but it does not permit a swift movement. A man is not allowed to leap up and declare a certain state of things to be intrinsically intolerable. To make the matter clear, it is better to take a specific example. Certain of the idealistic vegetarians, such as Mr. Salt, say that the time has now come for eating no meat; by implication they assume that at one time it was right to eat meat, and they suggest (in words that could be quoted) that some day it may be wrong to eat milk and eggs. I do not discuss here the question of what is justice to animals. I only say that whatever is justice ought, under given conditions, to be prompt justice. If an animal is wronged, we ought to be able to rush to his rescue. But how can we rush if we are, perhaps, in advance of our time? How can we rush to catch a train which may not arrive for a few centuries? How can I denounce a man for skinning cats, if he is only now what I may possibly become in drinking a glass of milk? A splendid and insane Russian sect ran about taking all the cattle out of all the carts. How can I pluck up courage to take the horse out of my hansom-cab, when I do not know whether my evolutionary watch is only a little fast or the cabman's a little slow? Suppose I say to a sweater, [...] "Slavery suited one stage of evolution." [...] And suppose he answers, [...] "And <b>sweating</b> <b>suits</b> this stage of evolution." [...] How can I answer if there is no eternal test? If sweaters can be behind the current morality, why should not philanthropists be in front of it?

An abiding image of Thompson the coach came in the 1989 FA Cup final against Merseyside rivals Everton when a last minute chance for Everton to equalise went awry, and the camera caught Thompson, <b>sweating</b> in his <b>suit</b> and tie, sitting on the Wembley bench while shaking his fists in relief, delight and anticipation. Sadly for him, Everton did equalise moments later and forced extra-time, though Liverpool did eventually win.|$|R
