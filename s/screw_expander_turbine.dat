40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} small-size <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> for the energy conversion of hot spring water are described in this report. Recently, the <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> has been recognized as an effective machine for low temperature energy conversion, i. e. hot spring water. Usually in the low temperature energy conversion cycle, organic working mediums such as NH 3 or fron are used. With the organic working mediums, the performance tests of <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> under the same conditions of a practical conversion cycle are very difficult. On the other hand, usually small-size <b>screw</b> <b>expanders</b> may be produced by adapting the massproduced screw compressors. We therefore made compression tests with air using small-size <b>screw</b> <b>expanders.</b> For a small-size <b>screw</b> <b>expander,</b> the compression tests with air are rather easy than the expansion tests with air or organic working mediums. If {{the performance of the}} expansion with organic working mediums could be estimated by the compression tests with air, it might be an effective technique for the design of the low temperature energy conversion cycle using the small-size <b>screw</b> <b>expander.</b> In this paper, we report the experimental results of the compression tests with air, of the expansion tests with air or R II, and comprise the results. The principal specifications of the two testing <b>screw</b> <b>expanders</b> are the built-in volume ratios are 2. 0 and 2. 4, and the exit displacement, 0. 816 m 3 / 1000 rev., which is the same for both expanders...|$|R

The <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> design is {{a modified version of}} its existing refrigeration compressor used on water-cooled chillers. Starting the ORC development program with existing refrigeration screw compressor hardware has resulted in reduced development time and lower development cost.

Due to the smaller volume flows inside these systems, non-conventional expansion technologies such as <b>screw</b> <b>expanders</b> become more interesting. Recent economic studies have shown {{the important role of}} screw machines in such cycles. However, {{in order to get a}} better understanding of the expansion behaviour in an ORC, appropriate simulation models of <b>screw</b> <b>expanders</b> are necessary. The flow inside an oil-injected twin <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> is modeled in detail with 3 D CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) calculations.

The oil-phase was modeled with an Eulerian multiphase model and the working fluid is treated compressible. The performance of the <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> is strongly affected by the oil-injection which provides lubrication and a better sealing of the gaps.

Solar thermal energy, the heat of biomass combustion and waste heat may be used to drive a combined heat and power (CHP) system. In recent years, several micro-CHP systems with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) suitable for domestic applications (1 - 10 kW) driven by solar thermal, biomass-fired boilers and waste heat resources have been investigated. These ORC-based micro-CHP systems have lower operation pressures and temperatures compared to conventional steam-Rankine cycle CHP systems and hence safer for household applications. However, the lack of commercially available expanders applicable to ORC-based micro-CHP systems has hindered the development of these novel CHP systems. This paper summarizes the findings of the market research for the expanders and discusses the selection and choices of the expanders for ORC-based micro-CHP systems.

Among all kinds of renewable energy, geothermal energy has good development feasibility due to its low investment and operation costs, independence to weather and climate change, and stable power generation. In China, high-temperature geothermal resource is rare; however, low-medium temperature geothermal resource is widely distributed. Therefore, small and medium sized geothermal power system based on low-medium temperature organic Rankine cycle(ORC) {{is a good choice}} for geothermal exploitation. Expander is the key device in such system. Single <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> has proper size and good output performance. Therefore, in order to test the application of single <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> in geothermal exploitation, compressed air was used as working fluid to conduct experimental study at different temperature. The results show that at the same rotational speed, the single <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> at a higher air temperature has a bigger output power, a smaller gas consumption rate, a bigger expansion ratio, a bigger temperature drop, a higher thermal efficiency, and a smaller irreversible loss. Moreover, if a lubricant circle is added in the experimental system, the single <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> with lubricant at a lower air temperature will have the same performance as the expander without lubricant at a higher air temperature. Therefore, the performance of single <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> can be improved by adding a lubricant circle and raising compressed air temperature...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the {{thermodynamic}} modeling of <b>screw</b> <b>expanders</b> in a trilateral flash cycle. In this process a liquid is pumped from low to high pressure and then heated up close to saturation point. Instead of a vaporous working fluid as usual, a hot liquid is filled in the working chamber of the <b>screw</b> <b>expander.</b> During the filling process {{the pressure of the}} liquid drops below the saturation pressure while the temperature remains almost constant due to a fast process. Hence the liquid is in a metastable state. The liquid aspires a stable state and therefore is vaporized during the filling and expansion process due to its increasing chamber volume. Thus a two-phase mixture, vapor and liquid, exists in the working chamber. The simulation presented includes the calculation of fluid states within each chamber to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, which assumes that a sufficient heat transfer exists between the phases to reach a stable state within a time step. Thermodynamic simulations are carried out using water as the working fluid for an exemplary <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> geometry.

The application in vehicles {{for the purpose of}} heat recovery, which is characterized by the small machine dimensions due to relatively low system mass flows, is a still unexplored area for the screw-type machine. The <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> is to be used in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC). Compared to other expander designs in general <b>screw</b> <b>expanders</b> are characterized by high efficiency together with relatively low geometrical dimensions. Within the presented investigation mainly the performance characteristic of a <b>screw</b> <b>expander,</b> geometrically designed for a particular operating point, is determined {{as a function of the}} system parameters – inlet pressure and temperature – as well as the rotational speed of the expander. Here, based on an iterative coupling of thermodynamic and thermal simulations the influence of the thermal deformation on the machine performance in particular is analyzed. The results of the thermodynamic simulation, mainly based on so-called chamber models, represent the thermodynamic and fluid dynamic performance of the screw machine by means of mass and energy conservation.

40|$|Performance of Organic Rankine Cycles is {{sensitive}} {{not only to}} the entry  temperature ratio betweenheat source and heat sink but also to the temperature  degradation of the heat source flow, caused bythe heat transfer to the process in pre-heater, evaporator and super heater. In order to adopt the cycleto the great variety of heat sources a multitude of fluids are required. Alternatively fluid mixtures,trans-critical or supercritical fluid conditions can be used to match the process temperatures with theheat source. <b>Screw</b> <b>expanders</b> offer an alternative, new approach to the matching problem of ORC’s asthey allow for flexible multi-phase expansion. Hereby the vapour fraction at the expander entry can beused to  partially match the temperatures of the process to a particular heat source. To provide aperspective on the use of such <b>screw</b> <b>expanders</b> in ORC-systems previous experimental andcommercial experience have been reviewed and discussed. <b>Screw</b> <b>expanders</b> are versatile machines used for the production of mechanical work in power rangesfrom 3 kW to 1. 5 MW. As the functional characteristics differ significantly  from dynamic expandersthe explanatory models used to generalise results are different. Plenty of research has resulted in wellgeneralized explanatory models for dynamic <b>expander</b> analysis. For <b>screw</b> <b>expanders</b> similarexplanatory models exist mainly in commercially confidential environments. A few public sourcesdisclose test data. In the few cases data has been investigated the analyses tend to rely onthermodynamic models suitable for dry gas expansion. Typically that leads to reasonable replicationof test results but seldom to models suitable for detailed understanding of the process. In applicationswith 2 -phase expansion the theories used to simulate functional characteristics is entirely insufficient. The main reason for  the scarcity of work in this field is probably the empirical difficulties in obtaininggood measuring data in multi-phase conditions. This paper describes a review of multi-phase <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> experiences and explains why a uniquetheory is required to model its characteristics. In the absence of such a unique theory a correlationbased in empirical data is presented. This allow for estimations of <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> efficiency in multi-phase conditions. Measured efficiency with dry expansion, or such efficiency simulated, can be usedto estimate adiabatic efficiency with expansion entry vapor fractions ranging from 0 to 1 by using thiscorrelation. Hence estimating expansion efficiency during multi-phase expansion is simplified,allowing for better optimisation of the ORC-systems.

In small scale ORC systems (below 300 kWe) with a low temperature heat source (from 55 ◦C till 150 ◦C), twin <b>screw</b> <b>expanders</b> are commonly used to recover the mechanical power.

40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>expanders</b> offer a high {{potential}} for energy conversion {{in the lower}} and medium power range, for instance as expansion engines in closed loop power cycles. A common field of application is waste heat recovery where a certain heat flow is available to evaporate a working fluid in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC). In order to reach maximum cycle efficiency, the expander has to be designed {{with regards to the}} specific case of application. Design parameters, such as rotor geometry, size and inner volume ratio, have to be chosen in accordance to system parameters, for instance pressure levels and mass flow. Given that the available heat flow for the application is restricted, it is necessary to variably determine inlet and outlet pressure as well as the expansion mass flow in order to maximize the power output of the case specifically designed <b>screw</b> <b>expander.</b> The paper contains results of an exemplary design and dimensioning process of a <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> for an organic Rankine cycle for exhaust heat recovery of internal combustion engines. Both geometric parameters and system parameters are varied in a wide range to maximize the overall power output. It is shown that especially for small scale applications a combination of an uncommonly large inner volume ratio with high inlet pressures can be advantageous despite the fact that only relatively small isentropic expander efficiency is reached. Further proceeding includes consideration of several part load Rankine cycle operation points where a method of averaging the final expander size is presented. During the dimensioning process chamber model simulation is used to predict the operation behavior of the <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> where the chamber model of the machine is scaled under consideration of geometrical similarity (except of gap heights) during the simulation process at constant circumferential speed. Thus, it is assured that the actual expander mass flow matches the calculated ORC mass flow. Moreover, to estimate overall performance of the heat recovery system, a characteristic map of the selected <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> is calculated to find pressure and expander speed depending operating points for part and full load. With the aim of validating the theoretical approach, experimental investigations of the designed machine are carried out on a water steam test rig at TU Dortmund University.

40|$|The {{performance}} characteristics of an evaporator system with spring steam and a direct-contacttype condenser system for energy conversion of hot springs {{are described in}} this report. The newly devised evaporator system is composed by a spring steam separator, a hot water tank, a heat exchanger remaked of the shell-and-tube V-type, and a lubricant separator tube. The spring steam, which is separated from spring hot water by the spring steam separator, is blown up {{in the form of}} bubbles in the hot water through the bubble-making plate placed under the Uvtype tubes. These steam bubbles enhance turbulent flows around the If-type tubes, incresing the heat transfer rate. Therefore, the pump of hot water could be omitted in the present system. The working medium heated in the U'-type tubes is first led into the lubricant separator, where it is separated from the lubricant, and then goes into the flusher. In the flusher, the necessary amount of working medium for electric power generation is evaporated, and its gas is fed into the <b>screw</b> <b>expander.</b> The rest liquid of the working medium is returned to the Ll-type tubes by the pump and is reheated with the hot water. The lubricant separated by the lubricant separator, and then moves to the <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> because of its own high pressure, therefore the pump of the lubricant could be omitted in this system. In the present test, evaporator system is composed of bare copper tubes (25. 44 > x 2 t x effective length 60 m) and the overall heat transfer coefficients with the from R 11 are about 1. 0 kW/m 2 K. Secondly, the newly devised condenser system is similary built by modifying the usual mass-produced shelland- tube U-type heat exchanger. The working medium liquid filling the tube chamber is chilled by the cooling water which flows in the tubes. The working medium gas from the <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> is blown up into the working medium liquid through the perforated metal plate with (408 x 4 Φ bubble holes) which is placed under the working medium liquid. The blown working medium gas bubbles are condensed efficiently through the direct-contact heat exchange. From the experiments of the new condenser system with R 11, we obtained the value of 2. 5 kW/m 2 K for the overall heat transfer coefficients of this condensor system with bare copper tubes (25. 4 Φ x 2 t x effective length 85 m) ...|$|R

The system has the merits of effecting the power generation cycle at lower temperature level with solar energy more efficiently and can provide both thermal energy and power for remote off-grid regions. A case study was carried out to evaluate an annual energy and exergy efficiency of the system under the climate of northwestern region of China. It is found that both the main energy and exergy loss {{take place at the}} parabolic trough collector, amount to 36. 2 % and 70. 4 %, respectively. Also found is that the studied system can have a higher solar energy conversion efficiency than the conventional solar thermal power generation system alone. The energy efficiency can be increased to 58. 0 % from 10. 2 %, and the exergy efficiency can be increased to 15. 2 % from 12. 5 %. Moreover, the economical analysis in terms of cost and payback period (PP) has been carried out. The study reveals that the proposed system the PP of the proposed system is about 18 years under present energy price conditions. The sensitivity analysis shows that if the interest rate decreases to 3 % or energy price increase by 50 %, PP will be less than 10 years.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown {{that the use of}} two-phase <b>screw</b> <b>expanders</b> in power generation cycles can achieve an increase in the utilisation of available energy from a low temperature heat source when compared with more conventional single-phase <b>turbines.</b> However, <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> efficiencies are more sensitive to expansion volume ratio than turbines, and this increases as the expander inlet vapour dryness fraction decreases. For singlestage screw machines with low inlet dryness, this can lead to under expansion of the working fluid and low isentropic efficiency for the expansion process. The performance of the cycle can potentially be improved by using a two-stage expander, consisting of a low pressure machine and a smaller high pressure machine connected in series. By expanding the working fluid over two stages, the built-in volume ratios of the two machines can be selected to provide a better match with the overall expansion process, thereby increasing efficiency for particular inlet and discharge conditions. The mass flow rate though both stages must however be matched, and the compromise between increasing efficiency and maximising power output must also be considered. This research uses a rigorous thermodynamic screw machine model to compare the performance of single and two-stage expanders over a range of operating conditions. The model allows optimisation of the required intermediate pressure in the two- stage expander, along with the rotational speed and built-in volume ratio of both screw machine stages. The results allow the two-stage machine to be fully specified in order to achieve maximum efficiency for a required power output...|$|R

Taking the suction loss, leakage loss, and real gas effect into consideration, a thermodynamic model is developed using continuity and energy conservation equation. The developed model is verified by comparing predicted results of power output and internal efficiency with experimental data.

40|$|Rankine cycle systems, using steam as {{a working}} fluid, are not well suited to the {{recovery}} of power from heat sources in the 300 – 450 °C temperature range, such as internal combustion engine exhaust gases, mainly due to the relatively large enthalpy of vaporization of water.

The efficiency of <b>screw</b> <b>expander</b> machines is sensitive to expansion volume ratio, which, for given inlet and discharge pressures, increases as the expander inlet vapour dryness fraction decreases.

The cycle efficiency can potentially be improved by using a two-stage expander, consisting of a machine for low-pressure expansion and a smaller high-pressure machine connected in series. By expanding the working fluid over two stages, the built-in volume ratios of the two machines can be selected to provide a better match with the overall expansion process, thereby increasing the efficiency.
