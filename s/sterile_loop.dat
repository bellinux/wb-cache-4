30|$|Sample {{preparation}} {{was carried}} out according to the Bruker protocols using three methods: (1) direct transfer (DT), (2) extended direct transfer (eDT), and (3) ethanol (EtOH)–formic acid (FA) extraction. In the DT method, a thin smear of biological material was placed onto a target plate, which was immediately overlaid with 1  μl of alpha-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (HCCA; Bruker Daltonics, Gr.), prepared according to the protocol of the manufacturer. In the eDT method, the biomass was treated with 1  μl of 70  % FA on the target plate prior to the HCCA matrix overlay. In the EtOH–FA method, one or two loops of yeast biomass (1  μl volume, <b>sterile</b> inoculation <b>loop)</b> {{was used for the}} crude protein extraction, as described previously (Lacroix et al. 2014). One microliter of the crude protein extract was spotted onto the target plate, and after air-drying, it was overlaid with 1  μl of HCCA matrix solution. For all methods, each tested strain was spotted in duplicate. Standard commercially available Bruker Daltonics database (BDAL) was used in this study: individual spectra using the MALDI Biotyper automated FlexControl software version 3.0 (Bruker Daltonics). The MALDI-TOF MS identification results were automatically classified using the log-score values generated by the MALDI Biotyper software (Bruker Daltonics, Germany), performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Scores higher than 1.7 indicated genus-level identification.|$|R
40|$|Antibodies to Neisseria gonorrhoeae were {{detected}} in the urethral exudates of 29 of 35 men with uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis. A large fraction of this local antibody was secretory IgA. Despite {{the high incidence of}} gonorrhea [1], {{little is known about the}} nature of the response of the host to this infection. In the male, uncomplicated gonorrhea is an infection of the urethral mucosa [2]. Other types of infections of mucosal surfaces have resulted in the local production of specific antibodies of a unique immunoglobulin class, secretory IgA [3]. Since this class of antibody is important in host resistance [4, 5], we looked for such antibodies in the urethral secretions of 35 men with uncomplicated, culturally proven gon-orrhea [6]. Materials and Methods Patients who came to a venereal disease clinic with urethral discharge were studied. The number of previous gonococcal infections was ascertained from the clinic record and by a careful history. The urethral exudate (approximately 0. 05 - 0. 1 ml) was aspirated into a tuberculin syringe, mixed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and centrifuged at 150 g for 10 min; the super-natant, a 1 : 10 - 1 : 20 dilution, was frozen.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} to determine, the {{antibacterial}} effects of red, blue, green and yellow fabric and nutrient dyes, which were commonly used in our daily life on Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with different concentration. Methods: Serial dilutions of commercially available green, red, yellow, and blue fabric and food dyes in sterile saline were prepared. One milliliter from each concentration of dyes was splitted into the tubes. McFarland 0. 5 standard were used to adjust the turbidity of bacterial suspensions of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus standard strains. This suspension of each strain dispensed 100 microliters to all food and fabric dyes concentrations and incubated at 37 °C. After overnight incubation 1 microliter suspension from each tube is plated on Mueller Hinton agar to determine bactericidal with <b>sterile</b> disposable <b>loop.</b> After incubation of these plates at 37 °C for 18 - 24 hours, colonies were counted. Results: Green, yellow and red colors of fabric and food dyes were inhibited MRSA, and they showed significantly less effect against P. aeruginosa. However, blue fabric and food dye antibacterial affects, were greater than other colors against MRSA and also against P. aeruginosa. Conclusion: In this study, we determined that inhibition effect of food and fabric dyes, on bacterial growth can be variable belong to the color and concentration of dye. Our in vitro findings were indicated that colors of dyes can be a factor to inhibit bacterial contamination and true color choice will be helpful for painting especially high risk places for bacterial contamination.

30|$|Escherichia coli {{species were}} cultured {{according}} to the manufacturer guidelines. Briefly, a single colony of E. coli was taken from a refrigerated stock and pre-cultured in 20  mL tryptic soy broth (TSB) by incubation at 37  °C for 24  h. Then, it was transferred into tryptic soy agar (TSA) and incubated for 24  h at 37  °C. The top of each colony was touched with a <b>sterile</b> <b>loop,</b> and the growth was transferred into a tube containing 4 to 5  mL of distilled water (IROST 2016). A McFarland standard 0.5 was used to determine the cell concentrations. The cell density was compared to that standard using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer, an equivalent optical density of 0.1 at 625  nm with regard to the calibrated standard cell suspensions in distilled water (Dhara and Tripathi 2013). A barium sulfate turbidity standard was used to standardize the inoculums density for a susceptibility test; its turbidity was equivalent to that of a 0.5 McFarland standard the latter made according to Garcia (2010). To obtain the required cell suspensions, the stock was serially diluted in distilled water. This resulted in a suspension containing approximately 102, 104 and 106  CFU/mL. The standard plating method was applied to confirm the bacterial concentrations. This test was done in triplicates on tryptic soy agar. Samples were plated in triplicates.

40|$|Materials 1. Glass culture tubes {{with metal}} caps and labels - Growth medium, from media room or {{customized}} - Glass pipette tubes - Parafilm ### Equipment 1. Vortexer - Fireboy or Bunsen burner - Motorized pipette - Micropipettes and sterile tips ### Procedure For a typical liquid culture, use 5 ml of appropriate medium. The amount in each tube {{does not have}} to be exact if you are just trying to culture cells for their precious DNA. 1. Streak an agar plate from glycerol stock. Incubate plates until colonies grow. - Most incubations with E. coli take place at 37 °C. Often bacteria with temperature sensitive mutations need to be grown at 30 ° instead. - The reason you need to streak plates is to be certain that you are starting from a single clonal population of cells. In this case, colonies that are picked are assumed to arise from a single cell dividing to form the colony. - Agar plates are just the standard. There are many different plating media that can be used (i. e., blood agar). - Take your plates from the warm room. Take an aliquot of the antibiotic(s), if needed, from the freezer, and set it on the bench to thaw. - Flame a glass pipette, open the bottle of medium and flame the mouth, measure out the amount you need to fill your tubes, flame the cap and recap the bottle as quickly as possible. - Remove the tube cap, flame the top of the culture tube, pipette in 5 ml, flame the top of the tube, and cap it. - Pick up one colony by tapping a small (0. 1 μl) pipette tip (held on a pipette) on the surface of the plate. Uncap a tube, flame the top, tip the tube so as to transfer cells from the pipette tip to the surface of the media without touching the inside of the tube with the non-sterile portion of the pipetter, flame, cap. You can also use a sterile toothpick for transfer. - Often people use just a <b>sterile</b> metal <b>loop</b> (<b>sterile</b> by flaming) to place the colony in the tube. This is because flaming assures the sterility of the loop, whereas disposables such as pipette tips and toothpicks can be contaminated, and cannot be flamed on the spot. - Pipette the desired amount of antibiotic into each tube along the wall. Do not put the non-sterile part of the pipette inside the tube and use a new tip for each tube. - Vortex each tube for 1 - 2 seconds to mix well. - Take the tubes to incubate. Turn the rotating rack off using the dial to decrease the speed. Do not use the switch because the stop will be too abrupt. Add your tubes in a balanced layout. If you have an odd number, use extra empty tubes for balance. Turn the rotation back on to 7 (applies to MIT building 68 5 th floor warm room). *Do not forget to turn the rack back on. * - Incubation once again is often at 37 °C in an incubator or warm room. - Wait overnight or until your cells have reached the desired concentration. - The amount of time you wait depends on the reason for growing the cells. To miniprep plasmid DNA, an overnight culture is sufficient. However, when doing measurements of protein levels, take care to take readings at the same cell culture density each time...|$|R

30|$|A {{total of}} eight {{isolates}} {{were used for}} the pathogenicity test against larvae and adults of H. postica. Therefore, each fungal isolate was plated on PDAY and incubated at 25  °C for 4  weeks. Conidial suspensions were prepared by adding 10  ml of 0.1 % Tween 80 (AppliChem) into the 4 -week-old Petri dishes, and the conidia were taken from the agar surface, using a <b>sterile</b> inoculation <b>loop</b> to dislodge. The concentrations of conidial suspensions were determined, using a Neubauer hemocytometer and adjusted to 1 [*]×[*] 107 conidia/ml. For the screening test, H. postica larvae and adults were collected from infested alfalfa fields in the Adana and Igdir, Turkey. Healthy larvae and adults were randomly selected and used for bioassays. For bioassays, 30 third instar larvae and adults were used for each test and each fungal isolate. All experiments were repeated three times on different days, using fresh collected larvae. Larvae and adults were inoculated by dipping into 1  ml of 1 [*]×[*] 107 conidia/ml suspension, prepared from different cultures at different times for 4 – 5  s. Thereafter, they were placed in plastic boxes (15  cm wide[*]×[*]  8  cm deep) including alfalfa leaves. The control groups of larvae and adults were treated by a sterile water supplemented with 0.1 % Tween 80. All boxes were incubated at 20  °C for 1  week, at 12 / 12 photoperiod. Fresh alfalfa leaves were provided daily for 7  days. The mortality rates of larvae and adults were estimated daily after inoculation for 14  days. Dead insects were surface sterilized by dipping into 1 % sodium hypochlorite for 3  min followed by 70 % ethanol for 3  min and washed three times in sterile distilled water. Then, they were placed on a wet filter paper in sterile plastic Petri dishes, covered with parafilm, and incubated at 25  °C to stimulate fungal sporulation on the cadavers. Finally, the pathogenicity of the isolates was measured by determination of mortality rates and calculation of percentage of mycoses by using Schneider-Orelli’s formula (Püntener 1981). The isolates that caused more than 90 % of mortality (total or confirmed) were selected to the next phase of the study.|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{contamination}} of metalworking fluids {{is an ongoing}} problem. The fluid provides nutrients and thus the mocrobes degrade the emulsion oil fluid. Samples were obtained from a metal fabrication factory that was experienceing intermittent contamination and fouling of machinery with the resulting biofilm. The funal contaminant was isolated and then identified by morphological characteristics based on the Saccardo System of Classification. Morphological characteristics were observed with two approaches, light and scanning electron microscopies. The fungal contaminant was identified as Penicillium. Culture tubes of naphthenic metalworking fluid were incolulated with a <b>sterile</b> <b>loop</b> of conidia. The fluid was preared as one part oil to six parts sterile municipal water for incubation periods, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks at 23 degrees Celcius and 37 degrees Celcius. The interaction between the metalworking fluid and fungal contaminant was characterized by gas chromatography. The gas chromatograph curves were digitized into area sthat corresponded to boiling point fractins of standard alkanes. Gas chromatographs showed unique peak differences between culture samples of different ages and termperatures. The boiling point fraction of 60 - 110 degrees Celcius contained unique peaks that were observed with Penicillium and occurred as early as two weeks of age. The fungal cultures showed decreases in the relative percent of {{the areas of the}} gas chromatograph in higher boiling point fractions, by the age of 5 weeks. These fungal chemical byproducts found in the 60 - 100 degrees Celcius fraction correspond to compounds of 6 - 10 carbon atoms.

This cell suspension was diluted 100 times to obtain 106  CFU/mL before use. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and then added to bacteria suspension to obtain the final concentration of 5  % (v/v) DMSO or less. Serial twofold dilutions from 200  μg/mL of the compounds were performed in 96 -well micro-titer plates. Each well contained 100  μL of sample of each concentration. Then each well was infunded 100  μL of the bacterial suspension. The final concentration range of the test compounds was 100 – 0.781  μg/mL, and the plates were incubated at 37  °C for 24  h. After incubation, the wells were examined for growth of microorganisms by measuring optical density (OD) value of the wells. Each experiment was repeated three times and Norfloxacin, bacteria suspension of 5  % (v/v) DMSO were used as a positive control and a blank control, respectively. By comparing to OD values, we can point out MIC values of these compounds among the selected concentration range.|$|E
40|$|Sputum smear {{microscopy}} is {{fast and}} inexpensive technique for detecting tuberculosis (TB) in high incidence areas but has low sensitivity. Physical and chemical sputum processing along with centrifugation {{have been found}} to show promise in overcoming this limitation. Our objective was to compare the sensitivity of smear microscopy obtained with smears made directly from respiratory specimens to those from concentrated specimens. By active screening, 915 TB suspects were identified from Dhaka Central Jail and sputum specimens were aseptically collected. Direct smears were prepared by taking {{a small portion of the}} purulent part of the sputum with a <b>sterile</b> <b>loop.</b> The specimens were then processed by a standard N-acetyl-L-cysteine-NaOH digestion-decontamination method to prepare concentrated specimens. Both smears were then air dried, heat fixed, and stained by the Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique. The stained slides were examined under oil immersion and were graded following International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases guidelines. All the specimens were inoculated into Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) media and culture results were considered as gold standard to calculate sensitivity. Of 915 specimens, 73 (8 %) specimens were positive both on direct and concentrated methods, one sample was positive on direct microscopy but was negative on concentrated method. An extra 14 (1. 5 %) samples were positive on concentrated method which were negative on direct smear. In L-J media 105 specimens were found positive for TB bacilli and of them, 74 (70. 5 %) and 87 (82. 9 %) were positive in direct and concentrated smear, respectively. The sensitivity of direct and concentrated smear microscopy was different when using positive culture as the gold standard (71 % vs. 83 %). The results showed that concentrated technique increases the sensitivity of microscopy up to 12 %. Therefore, the national programs in high TB burden countries may consider incorporating the technique into their guidelines at least in the district and higher level laboratories to improve case finding strateg...|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar, por meio de estudo bacteriológico in vitro, o efeito de dois tipos de laser de baixa energia (LBE) sobre diferentes populações bacterianas habitualmente presentes em feridas pós-traumáticas. MÉTODOS: Foram colhidos swabs diretamente do sítio de infecção de pacientes internados com osteomielite pós-traumática crônica. As bactérias isoladas foram Acinetobacter baumanii complex, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonela sp, Serratia sp e Staphylococcus aureus. O {{material}} coletado foi semeado em meio ágar-sangue, através de alça estéril, utilizando-se 30 placas de Petri para cada germe. Foram utilizados dois aparelhos de LBE: Ibramed Laser Pulse # 01189, com 15 W/ 904 nm por 200 segundos, e Phisiolux dual Bioset # 9909001, com 20 W/ 904 nm por 230 segundos. Nos grupos I (n = 10) e II (n = 10), as bactérias sofreram irradiação pelo laser. O grupo III (n = 10) serviu de controle, não sendo irradiado. As bactérias dos grupos I e II foram irradiadas em câmara de fluxo laminar, previamente esterilizada por raio ultravioleta. O laser foi administrado de forma direta, central e perpendicularmente à superfície de cultivo das bactérias, com distância-padrão de 1 cm, através de orifício confeccionado na tampa das placas. O crescimento bacteriano foi analisado após 12 e 24 horas da irradiação. Os resultados foram processados estatisticamente, utilizando-se o teste não-paramétrico de Kruskall-Wallis, com nível de significância p OBJECTIVE: To {{perform an}} in vitro bacteriologic study {{to evaluate the}} effect of two types of low level laser (LLL) on different bacterial populations usually present in post-traumatic wounds. METHODS: Swabs were prepared directly at the infection site of patients hospitalized with chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis. Isolated bacteria were Acinetobacter baumanii complex, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonela sp, Serratia sp, and Staphylococcus aureus. The material collected was seeded in agar-blood medium with a <b>sterile</b> <b>loop,</b> using 30 Petri dishes for each germ. Two LLL devices were used: Ibramed Laser Pulse # 01189, with 15 W/ 904 nm for 200 seconds, and Phisiolux dual Bioset # 9909001, with 20 W/ 904 nm for 230 seconds. In groups I (n = 10) and II (n = 10), bacteria were irradiated with laser. Group III (n = 10) was the control group and was not irradiated. Bacteria in groups I and II were submitted to radiation in a laminar flow chamber that was previously sterilized with UV rays, and the laser was directly, centrally, and perpendicularly applied to the bacteria cultivation surface, from a standard distance of one centimeter, through an orifice made in {{the lid of the}} dishes. Bacterial growth was analyzed 12 and 24 hours after the irradiation. Results were statistically processed using the non-parametric test of Kruskall-Wallis, with a significance level p < 5 %. RESULTS: A similar behavior was seen in the bacterial population of the three groups studied after 12 and 24 hours of irradiation with the two types of LLL, and there was no statistically significant difference in the bacterial growth between groups I and II and between these two groups and group III (control). CONCLUSION: In the conditions of this study, the effect of LLL showed to be innocuous for {{the increase in the number}} of units forming bacterial colonies, in the doses used in this study, as an adjuvant for the wound healing process, even under contamination by the bacteria being evaluated...|$|E
