However, in Irish reference books, such as Handbook of Irish Philately, the term forerunners usually refers to political and propaganda labels. These often resemble stamps, but few of them were used on Irish mail {{and they had no}} legal standing for mail in Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Postage stamps {{are also}} object of a {{particular}} form of collecting. <b>Stamp</b> <b>collecting</b> {{has been a very}} popular hobby. In some cases, when demand greatly exceeds supply, their commercial value on this specific market may become enormously greater than face value, even after use. For some postal services the sale of stamps to collectors who will never use them is a significant source of revenue; for example, stamps from Tokelau, South Georgia & South Sandwich Islands, Tristan da Cunha, Niuafo´ou and many others. <b>Stamp</b> <b>collecting</b> is commonly known as philately, although strictly the latter term refers to the study of stamps.|$|E

25|$|The {{subjects}} {{found on}} the face of postage stamps are generally what defines a particular stamp issue to the public and are often a reason why they are saved by collectors or history enthusiasts.

25|$|Stamp {{clubs and}} philatelic {{societies}} {{can add a}} social aspect to <b>stamp</b> <b>collecting</b> and provide a forum where novices can meet experienced collectors. Although such organizations are often advertised in stamp magazines and online, the {{relatively small number of}} collectors - especially outside urban areas - means that a club may be difficult to set up and sustain. The Internet partially solves this problem, as the association of collectors online is not limited by geographical distance. For this reason, many highly specific stamp clubs have been established on the Web, with international membership.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stamp</b> <b>collecting</b> is {{generally}} accepted {{as one of}} the areas that make up the wider subject of philately, which is the study of stamps. A philatelist may, but does not have to, collect stamps. It is not uncommon for the term philatelist to be used to mean a stamp collector. Many casual stamp collectors accumulate stamps for sheer enjoyment and relaxation without worrying about the tiny details. The creation of a large or comprehensive collection, however, generally requires some philatelic knowledge and will usually contain areas of philatelic studies.|$|E

25|$|Klokker trialled for Warwickshire in 2005, {{while playing}} club cricket for Berkswell near Coventry, Warwickshire, and {{working for a}} <b>stamp</b> <b>collecting</b> company. He went on to make his {{first-class}} debut for Warwickshire in the 2006 County Championship against Sussex at Hove, following injuries to regular wicket-keepers Tim Ambrose and Tony Frost.

These were his only appearances for the county.|$|E

According to some of his colleagues, [...] "Moser was rather shy, taciturn, formal and {{constrained}} in public or in official functions. In a relaxed atmosphere among students, collaborators or friends, he became extrovert and surprised many by his sense of humour and ready wit." [...] He had a commitment to both mycological research and mycological education, and was fluent in several languages. He was known as an intellectual and a wide-reader, with interests in fine art, classical music, literature, exploration, geography and botany. In addition to reading and walking, he enjoyed <b>stamp</b> <b>collecting</b> and growing plants from seeds he had collected on his research trips. He was a capable cook, often creating mushroom-based dishes for guests, though was on one occasion poisoned during [...] "gastronomic experiments with Phaeolepiota and Agaricus". He was also known to make chanterelle schnapps, drinking it with his students and sharing his recipe with colleagues.|$|E
500|$|George {{preferred}} {{to stay at}} home pursuing his hobbies of <b>stamp</b> <b>collecting</b> and game shooting, and lived a life that later biographers would consider dull because of its conventionality. He was not an intellectual: on returning from one evening at the opera he wrote, [...] "Went to Covent Garden and saw Fidelio and damned dull it was." [...] Nonetheless, he was earnestly devoted to Britain and its Commonwealth. He explained, [...] "it has always been my dream to identify myself with the great idea of Empire." [...] He appeared hard-working and became widely admired by the people of Britain and the Empire, as well as [...] "the Establishment". In the words of historian David Cannadine, George V and Queen Mary were an [...] "inseparably devoted couple" [...] who upheld [...] "character" [...] and [...] "family values". George established a standard of conduct for British royalty that reflected the values and virtues of the upper middle-class rather than upper-class lifestyles or vices. He was by temperament a traditionalist who never fully appreciated or approved the revolutionary changes under way in British society. Nevertheless, he invariably wielded his influence as a force of neutrality and moderation, seeing his role as mediator rather than final decision maker.|$|E
