25|$|There is {{significant}} genetic, linguistic, cultural, and <b>social</b> <b>diversity</b> among modern Malay subgroups, mainly attributed to centuries of migration and assimilation of various {{ethnic groups and}} tribes within Southeast Asia. Historically, the Malays are descended from the Malayic-speaking Austronesians, various Austroasiatic tribes, Cham and Funan settlers of ancient polities in coastal areas of Malay peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo; Brunei, Old Kedah, Langkasuka, Gangga Negara, Old Kelantan, Negara Sri Dharmaraja, Malayu and Srivijaya.|$|E

By the late 18th century, the site had an admission fee for its many attractions. It regularly drew enormous crowds, with its paths often noted for romantic assignations; tightrope walkers, hot air balloon ascents, concerts and fireworks providing amusement. Although the gardens were originally designed for the elites, they soon became places of great <b>social</b> <b>diversity.</b> Public firework displays were put on at Marylebone Gardens, and Cremorne Gardens offered music, dancing and animal acrobatics displays.|$|E
40|$|A purported {{downside}} of <b>social</b> category <b>diversity</b> is decreased relationship focus (i. e., one’s focus on establishing a positive social bond with a coworker). However, {{we argue that}} this lack of relationship focus serves as a central mechanism that improves information processing even prior to interaction and, ultimately, decision-making performance in diverse settings. We introduce the construct of premeeting elaboration (i. e., {{the extent to which}} individuals consider their own and others’ perspectives in the anticipation of an interaction) and explore its link with <b>social</b> category <b>diversity</b> and relationship focus. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that when disagreement occurs, <b>social</b> category <b>diversity</b> increases premeeting elaboration, with relationship focus as a central causal mechanism. Experiment 3 shows that premeeting elaboration has important implications for performance: disagreeing dyads with <b>social</b> category <b>diversity</b> elaborate more prior to meeting and, as a result, perform better on a decision-making task than those with social category homogeneity. We discuss the value of studying early-stage interaction and propose a reconsideration of the “downside” of <b>social</b> category <b>diversity.</b> Kellogg School of Managemen...|$|R

25|$|There is also {{a growing}} concern over the {{treatment}} of multilingualism in education, especially in many countries that were once colonized. Deciding on which language of instruction would be most beneficial to effective communication on the local and state level is a task requiring thoughtful planning and is surrounded by debate. Some states prefer instruction only in the official language, but some aim to foster linguistic and thus <b>social</b> <b>diversity</b> by encouraging teaching in several (native) languages. One reason some states prefer a single language of instruction is that it supports national unity and homogeneity. Some states prefer incorporating different languages {{in order to help}} students learn better by giving them diverse perspectives.|$|E

[...] The sociologist Thomas Ford Hoult wrote that Bell et al.′s conclusion that childhood gender nonconformity and adult sexual orientation have a biological basis is a legitimate hypothesis, but one that it is not confirmed by their failure to find a direct connection between sexual orientation and parent-child interaction.|$|E
500|$|The Polish [...] "Golden Age", {{the period}} of the reigns of Sigismund I and Sigismund II, the last two Jagiellonian kings, or more {{generally}} the 16th century, is most often identified with the rise of the culture of Polish Renaissance. The cultural flowering had its material base in the prosperity of the elites, both the landed nobility and urban patriciate at such centers as Cracow and Danzig. As was the case with other European nations, the Renaissance inspiration came in the first place from Italy, a process accelerated to some degree by Sigismund I's marriage to Bona Sforza. Many Poles traveled to Italy to study and to learn its culture. As imitating Italian ways became very trendy (the royal courts of the two kings provided the leadership and example for everybody else), many Italian artists and thinkers were coming to Poland, some settling and working there for many years. While the pioneering Polish humanists, greatly influenced by Erasmus of Rotterdam, accomplished the preliminary assimilation of the antiquity culture, the generation that followed was able to put greater emphasis on the development of native elements, and because of its <b>social</b> <b>diversity,</b> advanced the process of national integration.|$|E

500|$|During the 1880s, Brazil {{continued}} to prosper and <b>social</b> <b>diversity</b> increased markedly, {{including the first}} organized push for women's rights. The country had greatly changed in the five decades since Pedro II's accession to the throne. The liberalism adopted by successive Government cabinets favored private initiatives and resulted in decades of economic prosperity. It [...] "had an economy that was rapidly developing in 1880s". Brazil's international trade reached a total value of Rs 79.000:000$000 (see Brazilian currency) between 1834 and 1839. This {{continued to}} increase every year until it reached Rs 472.000:000$000 between 1886 and 1887 (an annual growth rate of 3.88% since 1839). Brazilian economic growth, especially after 1850, compared well {{with that of the}} United States and European nations. The national revenue, which amounted to Rs 11.795:000$000 in 1831, rose to Rs 160.840:000$000 in 1889. By 1858, it was the eighth largest in the world. To give an idea of the economic potential of the country during the Empire, if [...] "it had been able to sustain the level of productivity achieved in 1780 and managed to increase exports at a pace equal to that verified {{in the second half of}} 19th century, its per capita income in 1950 would be comparable to the average per capita income of the Western European nations".|$|E

2500|$|Through an {{analysis}} of public responses to two separate but related events in contemporary Singapore — a church's claim that [...] "homosexuals can change" [...] and a former prime minister's published comments about openly gay civil servants in his administration — this article explores how a [...] "gay community" [...] has been imagined in Singapore, where homosexual acts remain illegal and where a [...] "conservative majority" [...] has been ideologically mobilised {{by the state and}} moral-religious entrepreneurs. A close reading of the debates within SiGNeL (the Singapore Gay News List) and the local mass media reveals ideological struggles — and, in particular, gay activists’ role in these struggles — surrounding a basic contradiction between Singapore's exclusionary laws and practices, and official state rhetoric about active citizenship, <b>social</b> <b>diversity,</b> and gradual liberalisation. This rhetoric is aimed primarily at attracting foreign talent and retaining mobile Singaporean talent in a globally integrated economy that is increasingly dependent upon creativity and innovation.|$|E

However many facets of history, race {{and culture of}} this area are still relatively unexplored. Debates and doubts centering around the autochthonous status of the early settlers continue- {{it is very difficult}} to ascertain how human groups and settlements were formed in the pre-historic times, whether they were the original inhabitants or migrated from some other place and if they migrated, which route did they take. However, the infiltration and admixture of new racial and cultural elements, from time to time, have made the Indian population more diverse and heterogeneous...|$|R

2500|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that {{the sheer number}} of Irish {{speakers}} in the nineteenth century and their <b>social</b> <b>diversity</b> meant that both religious and secular authorities had to engage with them. This meant that Irish, rather than being marginalised, was an essential element in the modernization of Ireland, especially before the Great Famine of the 1840s. Irish speakers insisted on using the language in the law courts (even when they knew English), and it was common to employ interpreters. It was not unusual for magistrates, lawyers and jurors to employ their own knowledge of Irish. Fluency in Irish was often necessary in commercial matters. Political candidates and political leaders found the language invaluable. Irish {{was an integral part of}} the [...] "devotional revolution" [...] which marked the standardisation of Catholic religious practice, and the Catholic bishops (often partly blamed for the decline of the language) went to great lengths to ensure there was an adequate supply of Irish-speaking priests. Irish was widely and unofficially used as a language of instruction both in the local pay-schools (often called hedge schools) and in the National Schools. Down to the 1840s and even afterwards, Irish speakers could be found in all occupations and professions.|$|E

(2010) An Opportunity for Renewal: The Participatory Process and <b>Social</b> and Income <b>Diversity</b> in Brownfield Developments Urban and Regional Planning, {{advanced}} level, master thesis for master exam in Urban and Regional Planning, 30 ECTS credits. Supervisor: Dr. Thomas Borén Language: English   Participatory {{planning and}} the redevelopment of brownfield locations have both figured prominently in urban and regional planning strategies in recent decades. Despite their growing importance, these trends have rarely been analysed in concert however. Further, {{the issues of}} <b>social</b> and income <b>diversity</b> within this context have received less attention. In recognizing this void, this paper explores the use of participatory planning in brownfield developments, {{with an emphasis on}} <b>social</b> and income <b>diversity.</b> Through a review of the participatory planning theories of communicative action and the just city, strategies for promoting participatory planning and <b>social</b> and income <b>diversity,</b> are identified. A case study of Norra Djurgårdsstaden, a brownfield development in Stockholm, Sweden is employed to analyse these strategies. In undertaking the case study, data was collected through interviews and planning documents. This study found that the inherently high cost of redeveloping brownfield locations inhibits <b>social</b> and income <b>diversity</b> and requires an overt response to mitigate it. Participatory planning offers the possibility of engaging stakeholders who may otherwise be ignored, providing the opportunity to create a more inclusive development. It is also clear that an inclusionary goal must be part of a wider strategy, or is otherwise likely to be ignored...|$|R
