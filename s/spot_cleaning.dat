50|$|Sand sifting by handis {{used for}} smaller areas or {{sensitive}} habitat.Sand and debris is collected into a windrow or pile and manually shoveled onto screened sifting trays {{to separate the}} debris from the sand. While effective, it requires the movement of sand {{to the site of}} the tray, and then redistribution of the sand after sifting. A more efficient method is the use of a screened fork at the place where the debris is located. The effort to manually agitate the sand can become tiresome; however, a recent development of a battery-powered sand rake combines the <b>spot</b> <b>cleaning</b> effectiveness of manual screening with the ease of an auto-sifting hand tool.|$|E
40|$|The Liquid Waste Technology Development {{organization}} is investigating technologies to support closure of radioactive waste tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Tank closure includes {{removal of the}} wastes that have propagated to the tank annulus. Although amounts and types of residual waste materials in the annuli of SRS tanks vary, simple salt deposits are predominant on tanks with known leak sites. This task focused on developing and demonstrating a technology to inspect and spot clean salt deposits from the outer primary tank wall located in the annulus of an SRS Type I tank. The Robotics, Remote and Specialty Equipment (RRSE) and Materials Science and Technology (MS&T) Sections of the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) collaborated to modify and equip a Force Institute magnetic wall crawler with the tools necessary to demonstrate the inspection and <b>spot</b> <b>cleaning</b> in a mock-up of a Type I tank annulus. A remote control camera arm and cleaning head were developed, fabricated and mounted on the crawler. The crawler was then tested and demonstrated on a salt simulant also developed in this task. The demonstration showed that the camera is capable of being deployed in all specified locations and provided the views needed for the planned inspection. It also showed that the salt simulant readily dissolves with water. The crawler features two different techniques for delivering water to dissolve the salt deposits. Both water spay nozzles were able to dissolve the simulated salt, one is more controllable and the other delivers a larger water volume. The cleaning head also includes a rotary brush to mechanically remove the simulated salt nodules in the event insoluble material is encountered. The rotary brush proved {{to be effective in}} removing the salt nodules, although some fine tuning may be required to achieve the best results. This report describes the design process for developing technology to add features to a commercial wall crawler and the results of the demonstration testing performed on the integrated system. The crawler was modified to address the two primary objectives of the task (inspection and <b>spot</b> <b>cleaning).</b> SRNL recommends this technology as a viable option for annulus inspection and salt removal in tanks with minimal salt deposits (such as Tanks 5 and 6.) This report further recommends that the technology be prepared for field deployment by: (1) developing an improved mounting system for the magnetic idler wheel, (2) improving the robustness of the cleaning tool mounting, (3) resolving the nozzle selection valve connections, (4) determining alternatives for the brush and bristle assembly, and (5) adding a protective housing around the motors to shield them from water splash. In addition, SRNL suggests further technology development to address annulus cleaning issues that are apparent on other tanks that will also require salt removal in the future such as: (1) Developing a duct drilling device to facilitate dissolving salt inside ventilation ducts and draining the solution out the bottom of the ducts. (2) Investigating technologies to inspect inside the vertical annulus ventilation duct...|$|E

The band then perform [...] "Shine a Light", and the cleaning lady is shown waking up as a vampire. She is then confronted with a cross by the band's manager (showing that he is aware of what Harry is), before he enters the studio and suggests that the band have a party. During the party, with all female guests, Danny goes outside to where Tom is sitting alone, and they again discuss Harry's behaviour. When he goes back inside he finds that everyone (apart from Dougie) has joined Harry upstairs in his room. Harry is then shown having sex and biting all of the females he is with, {{while the rest of the}} band joins Tom outside. Tom then <b>spots</b> the <b>cleaning</b> lady in the grounds and goes after her, leading to him being pinned down on the ground and attempting to bite him. He pushes her off and runs to Danny and Dougie telling them what's happened but they openly laugh at his suggestion that she had fangs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractStockaded {{villages of}} the Qiang {{nationality}} {{that are made}} up of watchtowers and watch-houses {{are an important part of}} its cultural heritage. The earliest documentary records of its blockhouse-styled construction can be found in Biography of the Ethnic Minority Groups in Southwest China of History of Eastern Han. In 2006, watchtowers and stockaded villages of the Qiang nationality was placed in the preparatory declaration list of world cultural heritage in China and became a minority architectural heritage that is of potential value for world cultural heritage. The Wenchuan earthquake, which happened on May 12 th, 2008, caused severe damage to settlements of the Qiangs in the upper reaches of Min River, including the “Tangping Qiang village,” which plays a prominent role in Qiang stockaded villages. In conserving this important architectural heritage, we observe the idea “everything for heritage value”. We discuss and draw up a series of salvage conservation countermeasures and research for antiseimatic key technology during post-earthquake reconstruction period of Tibetan and Qiang settlement engineering projects, including six engineering principles on priority of structure rescue, heritage value, former address maintenance, traditional way of use, protection against and mitigation of earthquake disasters, and <b>spot</b> <b>cleaning</b> and separating. We draw up three rules in engineering strategy, namely: (1) we should follow ultimate orientation of heritage value protection in rescue, maintenance, and protection engineering; (2) degrees of priority of engineering measures should be differentiated according to the situation of the disaster and residential situations of stockaded villages and; (3) we should keep local smiths and conventional art as the base, and modern technology as a supplement in rescue, maintenance, and protection engineering...|$|E
40|$|Insufficient {{hygienic}} {{practices in}} Irish hospitals coupled {{with one of}} the highest number of reported cases of MRSA in Europe have highlighted the need for solutions to aid in the task of cleaning. This automated cleaning system consisted of two robots: a core robot developed separately with navigational and task scheduling capabilities integrated. The cleaning task was carried out by making use of a commercially available Roomba vacuum cleaner which had been adapted to operate in conjunction with the core robot. A uni-directional communications was established; commands were sent from the core robot to the Roomba. A visual analysis software, by the name of RoboRealm, was integrated into the system as the primary component. The initial role of the software was to allow the vacuum robot to orientate itself in order to enable transport from location to destination by means of visually tracking an object of interest. The object was to be located on the rear of the core robot. Subsequently the visual recognition aspect took on a greater role and encompassed a system by which commands were issued by the main robot and visually interpreted by the Roomba. This enabled the cleaning system to issue uni-directional commands and therefore carry out regular cleaning of any room, <b>spot</b> <b>cleaning</b> on a small spillage, following from one location to a destination or pause at any point during transport for emergency reasons. All tasks were deemed to be completed, however the prototype has not been completed and future work is still required in order to further the work carried out thus far. The robot successfully received the commands and activates the relevant programming as instructed. A critical analysis and recommendations for future work finish the report...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a recently invented "steam pasteurization" (S) process in reducing pathogenic bacterial populations on surfaces of freshly slaughtered beef was determined and {{compared with that of}} other standard commercial methods including knife trimming (T), water washing (35 °C; W), hot water/steam vacuum <b>spot</b> <b>cleaning</b> (V), and spraying with 2 % vol/vol lactic acid (54 °C, pH 2. 25; L). These decontamination treatments were tested individually and in combinations. Cutaneus trunci muscles from freshly slaughtered steers were inoculated with feces containing Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, and Salmonella typhimurium over a predesignated meat surface area, resulting in initial populations of ca. 5 log CFU/cm 2 of each pathogen. Tissue samples were excised from each portion before and after decontamination treatments, and mean population reductions were determined. Treatment combinations evaluated were the following (treatment designations within the abbreviations indicate the order of application) : TW, TWS, WS, VW, VWS, TWLS, and VWLS. These combinations resulted in reductions ranging from 3. 5 to 5. 3 log CFU/cm 2 in all three pathogen populations. The TW, TWS, WS, TWLS, and VWLS combinations were equally effective (P > 0. 05), resulting in reductions ranging from 4. 2 to 5. 3 log CFU/cm 2. When used individually, T, V, and S resulted in pathogen reductions ranging from 2. 5 to 3. 7 log CFU/cm 2 Steam pasteurization consistently provided numerically greater pathogen reductions than T or V. Treatments T, V, and S were all more effective than W (which gave a reduction on the order of 1. 0 log CFU/cm 2) Steam pasteurization is an effective method for reducing pathogenic bacterial populations on surfaces of freshly slaughtered beef, with multiple decontamination procedures providing greatest overall reductions...|$|E
