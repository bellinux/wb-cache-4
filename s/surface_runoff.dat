5|$|A {{river is}} a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river {{is said to be}} larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through <b>surface</b> <b>runoff,</b> groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E
5|$|Most of Sikkim, {{including}} Gangtok, is underlain by Precambrian rocks {{which contains}} foliated phyllites and schists; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides. <b>Surface</b> <b>runoff</b> of water by natural streams (jhora) and man-made drains {{has contributed to}} the risk of landslides. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-IV (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount Kanchenjunga (8,598m or 28,208ft)—the world's third-highest peak—is visible {{to the west of the}} city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.|$|E

5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its karstic nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, <b>surface</b> <b>runoff</b> from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface drainage network and the internal karst drainage system. Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended underground drainage system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Texas filed a {{trespass}} to try title suit {{to reclaim}} the lake bed for the state. In Welder v.

Without permission from the Texas Attorney General, the Texas Land Commissioner then sold the bed to a private buyer for agricultural use in 1918. In the 1948 case of State v. Bryan, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin upheld the sale as valid under color of law, and immune from a trespass to try title suit due to the one-year statute of limitations on land sales. However, under the Texas Water Rights Adjudication Act of 1967, Green Lake was classified as a public body of water.

Furthermore, increased urbanisation since the 1960s in Morpeth meant that most water falling on the town would have drained directly to the river channel. Other tests investigating the catchment lag time (time lapse between the midpoint of storm rainfall and peak river level) indicate that the Wansbeck has a LAG time of only 8 hours. This means that any water falling in the catchment area would have been rapidly converted into channel flow by <b>surface</b> <b>runoff</b> and to a lesser extent by throughflow.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Flood {{management}} has to undergo changes {{in order to}} meet the present societal needs. At watershed scale, zones of human activities are found dispersed and logically any protection measure needs to be oriented for the entire area. Retention of excess flow volume locally and consequent discharge into the watercourse is a good management plan for a holistic protection. Structural mitigation measures such as dry dams are undertaken for such dispersed retention management in this study. Dry dams are considered eco-friendly because of their peak reduction reputation without rupturing the normal flow regime of the river. The present approach analyses flood mitigation with different configurations of dry dam dispersion. For this three physical models were linked together to reproduce observed physical processes of a test watershed. The chain of models composed of a rainfall generator, a hydrological model and a hydraulic model is employed on the example watershed. The rainfall generator furnishes rainfall fields to be fed into the distributed hydrological model for obtaining <b>surface</b> <b>runoffs</b> along the watershed slopes. This <b>surface</b> <b>runoffs</b> are in turn input into the hydraulic model to be routed along the drainage network to the outlet. Thus a watershed flow regime from the developed chain of models is built from a set of rainfall scenarios. Thereafter a modified regime in the presence of hydraulic structures is calculated. Any mitigation extent achieved is measured by comparing the resulting watershed regimes in the presence and absence of hydraulic structures. This approach permits one to compare different mitigation strategies for a given watershed with dispersed zones of interest.
