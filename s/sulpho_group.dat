40|$|A new low-molecular-weight bound {{sulphite}} {{was found}} in yeast enzyme reaction systems which convert the sulphur of 35 S-labelled adenosine 3 '-phosphate 5 '-sulphatophosphate into exchangeable radioactive sulphite. This bound sulphite was separated from other components by paper electrophoresis and Sephadex G- 25 chromatography, and {{shown to be a}} peptide with multiple thiol groups and an estimated mol. wt. of 1400. The labelled sulphur in this peptide is highly exchangeable with unlabelled sulphite, but exchangeability decreases with time and freeze-drying. The low-molecular-weight acceptor is tightly bound to enzyme B of the yeast system and, apparently, accepts the <b>sulpho</b> <b>group</b> of adenosine 3 '-phosphate 5 '-sulphatophosphate and is released as bound sulphite only in the presence of enzymically or chemically reduced fraction C. It is proposed that the low-molecular-weight acceptor is a carrier peptide which, after release of the reduced sulphur, becomes re-oxidized and returns to enzyme B. Fraction C appears to function as an obligatory reductant of the oxidized acceptor before it can accept another-SO- 3 -moiety from adenosine 3 '-phosphate 5 '-sulphatophosphate. These findings are consistent with mechanisms proposed for sulphate reduction in spinach and Chlorella, and suggest that fraction C is the natural thiol required in these systems. An improved column technique for the preparation of adenosine 3 '-phosphate 5 '-sulphatophosphate is described...|$|E
