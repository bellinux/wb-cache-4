5000|$|Silibinin (INN), {{also known}} as silybin (both from Silybum, the generic name of the plant from which it is extracted), is the major active {{constituent}} of silymarin, a standardized extract of the milk thistle seeds, containing a mixture of flavonolignans consisting of silibinin, isosilibinin, silicristin, <b>silidianin,</b> and others. Silibinin itself {{is a mixture of}} two diastereomers, silybin A and silybin B, in approximately equimolar ratio. [...] The mixture exhibits a number of pharmacological effects, particularly in the liver, and there is some clinical evidence for the use of silibinin as a supportive element in alcoholic and child grade 'A' liver cirrhosis.|$|E
30|$|Carduus marianus, Silybum marianum, or {{milk thistle}} is an edible Mediterranean herbal {{with a very}} long history as {{medicinal}} plant. Probably, this practice was also supported by the religious connotations of its name (e.g. chardon marie, Mariendistel, Saint Mary’s thistle, etc.). The currently employed standardized milk thistle extracts made from the fruits contain 30 – 65  % silymarin as active ingredient. Silymarin is a complex mixture of polyphenolic molecules, including seven closely related flavonolignans, i.e. silibin A, silibin B, isosilibin A, isosilibin B, silichristin, isosilichristin, <b>silidianin</b> and the flavonoid taxifolin, the most effective antioxidant of these molecules [1]. Silymarin administered per os has become a frequently applied therapy for various liver disorders. Silymarin is classified by the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system as liver therapy (A 05 BA 03). Approved indications are described as toxic and inflammatory liver diseases although at low doses it is also recommended for dyspepsia.|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND & AIMS: Silymarin is {{a mixture}} of flavonolignans {{extracted}} from the milk thistle. Silymarin contains several molecules, including silibinin A, silibinin B, isosilibinin A, isosilibinin B, silicristin, and <b>silidianin.</b> Intravenous infusion of silibinin induces dose-dependent reduction of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the principal isomers contained in silymarin preparations for their ability to inhibit HCV enzymatic functions and replication in different models. METHODS: The inhibitory activity of silymarin components was tested in HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and NS 3 / 4 A protease enzyme assays. Their ability to inhibit replication of an HCV genotype 1 b replicon model and the JFH 1 infectious HCV model in cell culture was also studied. RESULTS: Silibinin A, silibinin B, their water-soluble dihydrogen succinate forms and Legalon SIL, a commercially available intravenous preparation of silibinin, inhibited HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase function, with inhibitory concentrations 50 % of the order of 75 - 100 microM. Silibinin A and silibinin B also inhibited HCV genotype 1 b replicon replication and HCV genotype 2 a strain JFH 1 replication in cell culture. None of these compounds inhibited HCV protease function. CONCLUSIONS: Silibinin A and silibinin B, as well as Legalon SIL, inhibit HCV replicon and JFH 1 replication in cell culture. This effect is at least partly explained by the ability of these compounds to inhibit HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. Our results provide a basis for the optimization and subsequent development of members of the Flavonoid family as specific HCV antivirals...|$|E
