40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringDanny H. RogersCenter pivot {{irrigation}} systems {{are used in}} crop production across the state of Kansas. The American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) standard on uniformity testing of a center pivot system calls for collectors {{to be used to}} measure the water depth emitted by the irrigation system. The standard was designed without specially considering the low pressure sprinklers now commonly used on center pivot systems; the recommended collectors may not accurately measure the applied depth from these sprinklers. The collector size effect on measured water depth and measured depth variability was studied for <b>spinning</b> <b>plate,</b> fixed plate, and wobbling plate sprinkler systems. Five different collector sizes (C 2 (5. 5 cm), C 4 (10. 0 cm), C 6 (14. 8 cm), C 8 (20. 0 cm), and C 10 (27. 4 cm)) were studied using four 5 x 5 Latin squares. Each collector’s water depth was measured and statistically analyzed. Two analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of the collector size effect were reported. Past experimental results were compared to this experiment’s results. The ANOVA for the measured water depth reported no collector size effect for the <b>spinning</b> <b>plate</b> and wobbling plate systems. The ANOVA of the variability of measured depths showed significant differences between collector sizes for the <b>spinning</b> <b>plate</b> system but not for the wobbling plate system. Previous studies of <b>spinning</b> <b>plate</b> and wobbling plate systems reported acceptable variability for all collector sizes. Although some collector sizes measured significantly different mean depths, the numerical difference in mean depths was small. Any studied collector size could be used to measure the water depth of wobbling plate systems, but the C 4 collector is ideal. C 4 and C 6 collectors are ideal for measuring <b>spinning</b> <b>plate</b> systems. Significant differences between measured depths were reported for the fixed plate system. The C 10 measured significantly lower water depths than all other collectors, and the C 4 collector measured lower depths than the C 2 and C 8 collectors. The variability of mean depths was similar and high for all collector sizes. Previous experiments also indicated that different collector sizes measured different depths and had high variability of depth measurements for the fixed plate sprinkler systems. The distinct stream pattern provides a challenge for accurately measuring the water depth with these collector sizes; other methods of measuring uniformity should be considered for fixed plate sprinklers...|$|R

Centrifugal atomisation is generally conducted under an inert atmosphere of Ar or N2 to prevent oxidation of the fine droplets or can be operated under vacuum.|$|R
