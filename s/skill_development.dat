They are acquired by the player through real-time negotiation: upon contacting a demon, they must successfully negotiate a conversation with them which can entail either friendly persuasion or intimidation of a demon. Once a demon is allied with the player, they aid them in combat: only one demon can be summoned at any one time, and when summoned that demon follows the player around as they navigate environments. Each time a demon is summoned, it costs {{a certain amount of}} magnetite, an in-game currency. Several demons can be held by them on the go, while further demons can be stored in Shinjuku Babel. Demons and the player gain experience levels separately: when the avatar has gained a level, they can assign stat points to various attributes. These in turn effect their abilities in battle and further <b>skill</b> <b>development.</b> Two different demons can be fused into a new demon in a location known as the Cathedral of Shadows: upon fusion, the new demon can inherit different skills from its demon parents. The skills a demon possesses can be altered or enhanced depending on their use in battles.|$|E

The National <b>Skills</b> <b>Development</b> Strategy, the Human Resource Development Strategy for South Africa and the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA) are other legislative measures introduced by the South African government to contribute to the importance of training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> in organisations. It is necessary for the public sector organisations to train and develop the skills of its personnel in order to improve organisational, team and individual performance. Training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> should also assist in forming the basis for lifelong learning and to increase productivity and quality of work. A comprehensive human resource training and development strategy should be linked to the business strategy and the human resource management strategy in organisations. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} analyse the views of employees and to determine their level of awareness regarding training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> and how these can improve performance in the Free State Province municipalities. To reach this primary objective, a number of secondary objectives were considered as relevant. These included exploring the concepts of training, <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> and performance management. An analysis of statutory and regulatory guidelines pertaining to training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> and the assessment of structures, procedures and processes that exist in municipalities for the promotion of training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> were also highlighted. The effects of adequate training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> on performance in the Free State Province municipalities were analysed. Lastly, guidelines and recommendations regarding training, <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> and performance management were developed for municipalities in the Free State Province. The research was conducted in the Free State Province municipalities. It comprised of a literature study and an empirical survey using questionnaires and interviews to obtain information from managers, supervisors and frontline staff in the Free State Province municipalities. The respondents were tested on their views regarding the impact of training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> programmes in improving performance in their workplace. The findings of this research demonstrated that training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> enhances performance of personnel in specific functional areas in the Free State Province municipalities, and for this to be more effective on performance in municipalities, it should be provided adequately in specific areas of the Local Government Five Year Strategic Agenda, particularly to the Free State Province municipalities. Some of the most important findings of this research are the following: •that most of the managers and frontline staff in Free State Province municipalities received adequate training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> programmes; •that most of the trainings and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> programmes received by managers in the Free State Province municipalities were related to their job tasks; •that managers and frontline staff in Free State Province municipalities felt motivated to do their job tasks after they were provided with training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> programmes; •that managers in Free State Province municipalities still find it difficult to ensure public participation by their communities even after training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> programmes were provided to them; and •that adequate training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> of personnel improves performance in many functional areas in municipalities in Free State Province.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{conflicts in}} the role of business as a social partner in the South African economy by studying <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> in the Border-Kei Region. <b>Skills</b> <b>development</b> is a key component of the South African government’s programme of labour market regulation and is founded on a participatory approach. The <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> framework requires the participation and co-operation of multiple social partners but relies heavily on the role of business in the attainment of national and sectoral <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> objectives. Unfortunately, however, there are significant {{conflicts in the}} role which business is expected to play which consequently hinder the efficiency of the framework and the likelihood that that these objectives will be realised. One of the most pertinent examples of these conflicts is the voluntary nature of the <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> framework, which incentivises but does not compel organisations to invest in training and development. Other conflicts include dissonances between national and employer led strategies and organisational disincentives to engage in training and development. This qualitative study uses an interpretive approach to study how and to what extent the <b>Skills</b> <b>Development</b> Act is implemented in selected organisations in Buffalo City as well as studying the issues pertaining to the implementation process. By using a purposive sampling approach, this research includes both primary data in the form of semi-structured interviews and secondary data in the form of documentary sources. The data represents the perspectives of business, labour and government and provides significant depth of insight into the discussions and issues surrounding <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> in Buffalo City.

Over time, a professional clan which favoured the society with services of prostitution also evolved. Men and women belonging to the community committed themselves to the sex trade, where men stayed as supportive influences and women were the main workers. The non-elite had a parallel system, that of brothels, which evolved much later when they no longer were controlled by the kings and nobility was loosened. It coincided with the growth of sea-trade where sailors became good clientele for the low-ranking prostitutes. During the British Raj, the earlier nobility was replaced by a new nobility composed of those who showed loyalty for the British. This new nobility was incapable of taking the role of patrons like earlier kings, and so the British provided much need patronage for the profession to grow and regulated the trade.|$|E

However, though the feedback was virtual, the performances were not widely virtual until the 1990s. With the early-stage experimentation, not many positive results were found causing some doubt of the systems. Some even found that too much virtual feedback increased poor performance outside of the controlled environment. As virtual reality systems and virtual environments became more accessible and affordable, though, so too did the implementations of and research on them. The use of these systems in positive motor <b>skill</b> <b>development</b> began somewhere in the late 1990s as more researchers realized the benefit of internal, corrective feedback in such environments. Additionally, at the same time, researchers across the world began experimenting with the effect of virtual reality in therapeutic measures for anxiety disorder and phobias. With positive results, such as better motor control and lower anxiety in relation to phobias, coming from these experiments, researchers began looking into virtual reality systems {{as a form of}} rehabilitation in the early 2000s, and the research has expanded since. Now, common gaming consoles such as the Wii and Kinect allow researchers to use cheaper, more readily available systems in their labs, as well, opening up new possibilities for games and rehabilitation options. Case studies and use of systems in actual therapy offices have suggested that this field has the potential to impact therapy outside the lab setting, as well, making it a rapidly growing field of interest. Currently, several reviews of the findings have also suggested positive effects of this form of rehabilitation, garnering support for this field as well.|$|E

To achieve this, a literature review was conducted which provided for an understanding on how <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> structures and strategies have changed in recent times and how the laws which provide the framework and landscape for <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> in South Africa, have been adapted to accommodate these changes. The literature review continued with an analysis of various theoretical training and <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> models in order to determine an optimal systematic approach to training and development in South Africa, and to determine the sequential flow of skills planning and implementation process flow steps. From the literature and theoretical models, an all-embracing <b>skills</b> <b>development</b> planning and implementation process flow model was developed for implementation in local government authorities. This model was used as the basis for the development of a survey questionnaire to establish to what extent metropolitan municipalities, agreed or disagreed, that it implemented the aspects of the proposed model developed in this study.
