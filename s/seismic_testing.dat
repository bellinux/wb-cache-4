In particular, {{the importance of}} shear {{wave velocity}} in geotechnical earthquake engineering has been widely recognized for seismic design and seismic performance evaluation. In the present study, various in-situ <b>seismic</b> <b>tests</b> were performed to evaluate geotechnical dynamic characteristics at 183 sites in Korea, and shear wave velocity profiles with depth were determined to {{be representative of the}} dynamic properties at the investi-gated sites. Subsurface soil and rock layers at the target sites were reclassified into five geotechnical layers: fill, alluvial soil, weathered soil, weathered rock, and bedrock, taking into account their general uses in geotechnical earthquake engineering practice. Average shear wave velocity profiles for the five geotechnical layers were obtained by synthesizing the shear wave velocity profiles from <b>seismic</b> <b>tests</b> in the field.
