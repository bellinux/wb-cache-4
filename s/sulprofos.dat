40|$|Cytochrome P 450 (P 450) and flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) enzymes {{are major}} {{catalysts}} {{involved in the}} metabolism of xenobiotics. The sulfoxidation of the thioether pesticides, phorate, disulfoton, <b>sulprofos,</b> and methiocarb, was investigated. Using pooled human liver microsomes (HLMs), thioether compounds dis-played similar affinities; however, phorate and disulfoton displayed higher intrinsic clearance rates than either <b>sulprofos</b> or methio-carb. The sulfoxidation of thioethers by HLMs {{was found to be}} predominantly P 450 -driven (85 – 90 %) compared with FMO (10 – 15 %). Among 16 cDNA-expressed human P 450 isoforms and 3 human FMO isoforms examined, the following isoforms and their polymorphisms had the highest rates for sulfoxidation, as follows...|$|E
40|$|A {{bioassay}} {{technique was}} developed to test the efficacy of insecticides against potato moth (Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller)) on tomatoes. The technique tested efficacy against both larvae in mines and neonate larvae {{that had not yet}} penetrated the leaf, and explained the failure of some insecticides to control P. operculella infestations in commercial tomato crops. Neonate larvae placed on leaves of potted plants several days before treatment provided larvae for testing of insecticides against larvae in mines; other neonates were placed on leaves after treatment to test efficacy against larvae yet to penetrate the leaf. The plants were sprayed with the candidate insecticides, held for 5 - 7 days, and larval mortality assessed. Chlorfenapyr (100, 200 g a. i. ha- 1) and abamectin (8. 1 g a. i. ha- 1) were effective against neonate larvae and larvae in mines. <b>Sulprofos</b> (720 g a. i. ha - 1), methomyl (450 g a. i. ha- 1) and spinosad (96 g a. i. ha- 1) were effective against neonate larvae but not against larvae in mines. Methamidophos (1102 g a. i. ha- 1), endosulfan (700 g a. i. ha- 1) and Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (1000 g ha- 1) had some effect against exposed larvae but little against larvae in mines. Thiodicarb (525 g a. i. ha- 1), azinphos-ethyl (440 g a. i. ha - 1), imidacloprid (59. 5 g a. i. ha- 1), hexaflumuron (50 g a. i. ha- 1), methoxyfenozide (300 g a. i. ha- 1) and tebufenozide (200 g a. i. ha- 1) were ineffective. A field trial using chlorfenapyr (25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 g a. i. ha- 1) and methamidophos (1102 g a. i. ha- 1) validated the bioassay technique, with chlorfenapyr effective in reducing the numbers of larvae in mines in leaves...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Four laboratory bioassays, including 1) proboscis extension and 2) gustatory response, 3) lethal concentration, and 4) mean lethal time to mortality, were used to investigate the effects of seventeen insecticides mixed with two sugar feeding stimulants on feeding behavior and mortality of pheromone trap captured adult male corn earworms, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), to screen and evaluate toxicants for use in an attracticide formulation. Commercially-available formulations of acephate, boric acid, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, DDVP, dimethoate, endosulfan, imidacloprid, lambda-cyhalothrin, malathion, methomyl, oxamyl, profenofos, <b>sulprofos,</b> and thiodicarb, mixed with two concentrations of sucrose and fi-uctose feeding stimulants at toxicant concentrations up to 10, 000 ppm AI (I%) (wt:vol), were evaluated for proboscis extension response. Data from this bioassay indicate that none of these insecticides inhibited proboscis extension below 100 ppm Al concentrations. The same test mixtures were evaluated for gustatory response. Response inhibition varied between toxicants, but most insecticides elicited no significant inhibition of gustatory response at toxicant concentrations causing mortality, Acephate, carbaryl, lambda-cyhalothrin, malathion, methomyl, profenofos, and thiodicarb mixed with 2. 5 M sucrose were evaluated for toxicity to adult male corn earworms via ingestion. Twenty-four hr LCggs are ranked as follows: thiodicarb 2. 0 ppm Al) < methomyl (2. 5) < lambda-cyhalothrin (4. 4) < profenofos (8. 4) < acephate (12. 3) < malathion (58. 2) < carbaryl (73. 0). Mean lethal times to mortality were estimated for the LCgg concentration and are ranked as follows: lambda-cyhalothrin (59 niin) < profenofos (258) < carbaryl (260) < methomyl (378) < acephate and thiodicarb (540) < malathion (780). All toxicants caused mortality in less than 3 hrs at the 5 X LCgg concentration and less than 2 hrs for IOX the LCgg concentration. The results of these bioassays identify the potential of using feeding stimulants mixed with insecticides at reduced concentrations for control of adult H. ze...|$|E
