50|$|Other common waterbirds {{include the}} <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe,</b> red-necked phalarope, great {{northern}} diver, red-throated diver and whooper swan.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife in {{the area}} {{includes}} the common scoter, the velvet scoter, the Eider duck, the wigeon, the long-tailed duck, the red-breasted merganser, the great northern diver and the <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe.</b>|$|E
50|$|The winter plumage of the {{red-necked grebe}} is duskier {{than that of}} other grebes; its dark grey cap is less defined, and merges into the grey face, and a pale {{crescent}} that curves around {{the rear of the}} face contrasts {{with the rest of the}} head. The front of the neck is whitish or light grey, the hind neck is darker grey, and the yellow of the bill is less obvious than in summer. Although the red-necked grebe is unmistakable in breeding plumage, it is less distinctive in winter and can be confused with similar species. It is larger than the <b>Slavonian</b> (horned) <b>grebe,</b> with a relatively larger bill and a grey, rather than white face. It is closer in size to the Eurasian great crested grebe, but that species is longer-necked, has a more contrasting head pattern, and always shows white above the eye.|$|R

50|$|Steinkjer, {{with its}} varied habitats, {{provides}} the local birdlife {{with some of}} the best localities within the region. One of these is Lake Lømsen with its breeding population of <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe.</b> The surrounding woodlands and farmlands hold a host of the commoner Scandinavian species, some, like fieldfare and redwing, can be found in good numbers.|$|E
50|$|Purple Heron (Ardea purpurea), Grey Heron (Ardea cinerea), Little Egret (Egretta garzetta), Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), Great Bittern (Botaurus stellaris), Red-crested Pochard (Netta rufina), Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeata), Wigeon (Anas penelope), Northern Pintail (Anas acuta), Common Teal (Anas crecca), Eurasian Hobby (Falco subbuteo), <b>Slavonian</b> <b>Grebe</b> (Podiceps auritus), Black-necked Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), Black-winged Stilt (Himantopus himantopus), Zitting Cisticola (Cisticola juncidis), Bearded Reedling (Panurus biarmicus)...|$|E
50|$|The lake is an {{important}} stop-over for many bird species, including tufted duck, common goldeneye, and common merganser; and, more rarely, <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe,</b> and smew. Breeding species attracted to the lake include Eurasian coot, great crested grebe, and pochard; additionally common tern is often seen by the lake and occasionally breeds here. Other protected species found by the lake include common snipe and lesser spotted woodpecker.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{range of the}} red-necked grebe overlaps {{with that of the}} <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe,</b> although the latter species tends to be displaced from sites suited to both. The red-necked grebe prefers an inland temperate climate, and is less successful near coasts and in subarctic and warm temperate zones. It is usually a lowland bird, breeding below 100 m, although has nested at up to 1800 m in Turkey.|$|E
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is known}} for its wintering wildfowl. Amongst the most recorded are tufted duck, goldeneye, goosander and common teal. Other, less common sightings included the lesser scaup, the ring-necked duck, the <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe,</b> the black-necked grebe, the long-tailed duck, the Leach's petrel and the European honey buzzard. Due to a nearby landfill site, the reservoir also plays host to a large gull population including yellow-legged gulls, Caspian gulls, Iceland gulls and Kumlien's gulls.|$|E
50|$|Bird {{species with}} an annual presences by the lake include: Great crested grebe, <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe,</b> black-headed gull, tufted duck, gadwall, {{northern}} shoveler, wigeon, Eurasian coot, common moorhen, common goldeneye, Ardea, greylag goose, Canada goose, barnacle goose, wood warbler, European pied flycatcher, thrush nightingale, Eurasian nuthatch, common treecreeper, European robin, hawfinch, willow warblers, whitethroat, common chaffinch, blue tit, European goldfinch, great spotted woodpecker, dunlin, greenshank, northern lapwing, ruff, and European green woodpecker. Less common are icterine warbler, marsh warbler, sedge warbler, Eurasian wren, and lesser spotted woodpecker.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{reported}} include Eurasian coot, great crested grebe, tufted duck, common moorhen, pochard, and <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe.</b> The dense vegetation {{surrounding the}} lake contains nightingales, blackcaps and marsh warblers hiding from sparrowhawks, goshawks, and tawny owls. The lake {{is also an}} important breeding ground for frogs, including common frog, moor frog, and common toad. The presence of great crested newt is threatened and all frog species are protected by law. Grass snake was observed in 1996. Surrounding buildings and deciduous forest forms a great habitat for bats such as northern bat, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's bat, and Nyctalus.|$|E
50|$|No {{inventory}} of aquatic plants has been made, but greater dodder {{has been documented}} around the Lunda Industrial Area. No rare species of bottom fauna were found during an inventory in 1999, the stream being quantitatively dominated by a few species. Noteworthy is the gastropod Valvata piscinalis found near the residential area Bällsta. The stream is, nonetheless, important for various birds, including black-headed gull, common gull, lesser black-backed gull, herring gull, and <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe</b> reported at Hjulsta Water Park. As stretches of the watercourse remain ice-free during winters, it attracts ducks and teal, which have both been spending winters here.|$|E
50|$|The only fish in {{the lake}} is crucian carp, {{probably}} introduced in the early 1980s. Attempts {{have been made to}} reduce the population with various results. In the mid-1970 a colony of black-headed gulls together with <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe,</b> mallard, little grebe, and gadwall. The black-headed gull is a key species, offering protection to other species, and has now abandoned the lake which is, however, still considered as of great importance to bird life with several species still breeding there. Several protected species of amphibians can be seen by the lake, including common frog, common toad, moor frog, and smooth newt.|$|E
5000|$|The horned grebe or <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podiceps auritus) is a {{relatively}} small waterbird in the family Podicipedidae. There are two known subspecies; (P. a. auritus), which breeds in Eurasia, and (P. a. cornutus), which breeds in North America. [...] In Eurasia, the subspecies is distributed over most of northern Europe and Asia, breeding from Greenland to western China. The North American subspecies spans most of Canada {{and some of the}} United States. Both subspecies appear physically similar and get their name from large patches of yellowish feathers, called “horns”, located behind the eyes that can raise and lower at will.|$|E
50|$|Carrick Roads and the Fal Estuary are favoured by ornithologists for birdwatching, {{especially}} the waders and waterbirds that visit in autumn and winter. The little egret and kingfisher {{can be seen}} all year while various passage waders pass through in spring, late summer and autumn. These include the whimbrel, the spotted redshank, the greenshank, the common sandpiper, the curlew sandpiper and the little stint. In the winter, the great northern diver and the black-throated diver can be seen, {{as well as the}} black-necked grebe, the red-necked grebe and the <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe,</b> the goldeneye and red-breasted merganser, and sometimes the long-tailed duck and the scoter.|$|E
5000|$|Avielochan {{is located}} in Strathspey in central, {{northern}} Scotland, within the Cairngorms National Park. The village is located south of Kinveachy and north of Granish. The settlement {{takes its name from}} the body of water Avie Lochan (meaning [...] "the small lake of Avie) archaically named Loch-na- mhoon, measuring about 90 yards long, and 50 across. Prior to the great floods in 1829, there was a floating island on the loch measuring about 30 yards across. It attracts ospreys during the spring and summer months and goldeneye, coot and <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe,</b> amongst others. Red squirrel, red deer, roe deer, black grouse and capercaillie inhabit the area.|$|E
5000|$|Islay {{is home to}} {{many species}} of {{wildlife}} and is especially known for its birds. Winter-visiting barnacle goose numbers have reached 35,000 in recent years {{with as many as}} 10,000 arriving in a single day. There are also up to 12,000 Greenland white-fronted geese, and smaller numbers of brent, pinkfooted and Canada geese are often found amongst these flocks. Other waterfowl include whooper and mute swans, eider duck, <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe,</b> goldeneye, long-tailed duck and wigeon. The elusive corncrake and sanderling, ringed plover and curlew sandpiper are amongst the summer visitors. Resident birds include red-billed chough, hen harrier, golden eagle, peregrine falcon, barn owl, raven, oystercatcher and guillemot. [...] The re-introduced white-tailed sea eagle is now seen regularly around the coasts. In all, about 105 species breed on the island each year and between 100 and 120 different species can be seen at any one time.|$|E
50|$|Red-listed western {{capercaillie}} and ptarmigan {{breed in}} Scotland and are absent {{elsewhere in the}} British Isles. The former became extinct in Scotland in 1785 but was successfully reintroduced from Swedish stock in 1837. There are significant populations of other Galliformes including blackcock and the famous red grouse. Common quail, grey partridge and pheasant are well-distributed, although the red-legged partridge is less so. A small colony of the introduced golden pheasant exists in the southwest.Among the waders, avocet, stone-curlew, little ringed plover and Kentish plover are absent, {{but most of the}} 100 or so pairs of dotterel in the UK spend their summers in Scotland as do all of the breeding whimbrel, greenshank and red-necked phalarope, (although the latter two species also breed in Ireland). In summer the shallow lochs of the machair lands in the Uists and Benbecula provide for a remarkable variety of waders and ducks including shoveler and eider. The rare <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe</b> and common scoter breed on a small number of lochs in Highland region. Goldeneye have colonised an area centred around the Cairngorms National Park since the 1970s, and about 100 pairs breed there. The majority of the roughly 25,000 whooper swans in the British Isles winter in Scotland and Ireland.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{have used a}} variety of study methods at {{different}} spatial and temporal scales to explore population processes and management of 2 bird species of conservation concern, common eider and <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe,</b> focusing particularly on the role of nest predation in declining populations. I have demonstrated the role of proximate and ultimate causes of nest loss in eider at 2 declining colonies and highlighted the negative effects of human disturbance on nesting success and the potential role of disturbance in decline at one of the colonies. Furthermore, using the stepwise approach of elucidating proximate and ultimate factors has indicated management actions that are highly likely to improve nesting success and may also {{play a significant role in}} halting the decline of the eider colonies. I have demonstrated the usefulness of combining investigation of focal species of conservation, <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe</b> and targeted invasive alien predator species, American mink in order to optimise management decisions when knowledge of both species is poor. I have further demonstrated the regional decline of <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe</b> at the northern range of its distribution. Finally, by investigating the level of mink hunting in Norway I have demonstrated that collaborative control programs that include volunteer mink hunters are best focused on hotspots of conservation concern. I view this thesis as an example of adaptive protocols for learning by doing. In contrast to common (mis) conceptions, I have demonstrated that this approach can be undertaken with relatively little funding and resource use and is simple in its design. Thus, conservation management in general, and game management particularly in Norway should be more willing to tackle management challenges using this adaptive protocol approach...|$|E
40|$|The fund of the Belgrade Natural History Museum's ornithological {{collection}} has especially great scientific, museological, cultural, and historical importance. The order Podicipediformes was recently chosen for inventory work {{the results of}} which are reported here. A total of 57 specimens from three Museum collections and over 20 localities through­out Serbia was inventoried. The most inventory units were recorded {{in the collection of}} mounted bird specimens (38), the least in the historical collection (eight). The study collection of birds contains 11 specimens. It was determined that most specimens in the Museum are great crested grebes (Podiceps cristatus). The Museum has the fewest specimens of rednecked grebes (Podiceps grisegena) and no specimens of <b>Slavonian</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podiceps auritus) at all. Podiceps nigricollis and Tachybaptus ruficollis are represented by an approximately equal number of specimens. The paper shows that the collection of grebes in the Belgrade Natural History Museum represents an especially important source of information about the taxon Podicipediformes. It can also be considered a valuable part of our cultural and natural heritage...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Slavonian</b> <b>Grebe</b> (Podiceps auritus) has its European {{northern}} range {{limit in}} northern Norway, {{and is a}} species of national conservation concern due to its small population size and unknown population trend. Long-term monitoring at the range limit suggests breeding site use is in decline. We used annual occupancy data from 104 breeding lakes monitored since 1991 in northern Norway to investigate correlates of change in occupancy. Persistence was 100 % until 1999, but thereafter decreased to 25 % (26 lakes with breeding pairs). A particularly steep decrease occurred between 2010 and 2012. Persistence increased {{with the number of}} pairs present in each lake in the initial monitoring year of 1991. The number of grebe pairs also decreased in the lakes that had continuous breeding persistence over the entire 22 -year monitoring period, suggesting that a large-scale factor caused the population decline. Over the last year of the monitoring series, lake altitude was negatively related to the probability of persistence, indicative that locally harsh climate played some role in breeding distribution. The temporal pattern of persistence was not related to mean winter temperature at the breeding sites; however, the decrease between 2010 and 2011 coincided with a late ice melt in 2010. Monitoring that includes a larger area of the species’ range is required to conclude whether the observed decline can indicate an overall decline in population size, or range fluctuations {{at the edge of the}} species’ range. However, investigating the processes that determine population range borders can give insights into important limiting factors pertinent to the conservation of species in the long term...|$|E
