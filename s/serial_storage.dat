40|$|The {{existing}} SCSI {{parallel bus}} {{has been widely}} used in supporting multimedia applications. However, it may not fully utilize the aggregate throughput from disks in supporting continuous media because of its unfair bus accesses. The emerging serial interface, <b>Serial</b> <b>Storage</b> Architecture (SSA), provides high data bandwidth, fair accesses, and fault tolerance.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{performance}} tradeoffs of fairness algorithms for ring networks with spatial bandwidth reuse, by using two measures: (i) the fairness cycle size as a complexity measure, and (ii) the Max-Min optimal fairness criterion as a throughput measure. The fairness cycle size {{is determined by}} the number of communication links involved in every instance of the fairness algorithm (several identical fairness algorithms can be executed concurrently on the same ring). The study compares three fairness algorithms with different cycle sizes: the Globalcycle algorithm (implemented in the <b>Serial</b> <b>Storage</b> Architecture - SSA) in which the cycle size is equal to the number N of links in the ring; the Variable-cycle algorithm in which its cycle size changes between 1 and N links; the Onecycle, where there is a fairness cycle on every link. It is shown how varying the cycle size affects the network performance with respect to the Max-Min optimal fairness criterion. The results show that for non-homogeneous traffic patterns, decreasing the fairness cycle size, while increasing the complexity, can significantly improve the performance with respect to the Max-Min optimal fairness criterion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In <b>serial</b> {{production}} systems, <b>storage</b> may {{be provided}} between processes to avoid interference {{due to lack}} of synchronization. In order to manufacture a product, a job is divided into individual tasks, typically manufacturing or assembly processes. These tasks are interdependent and should be coordinated. To reduce the interdependence between downstream and upstream operations and to maintain the output of the production line, it is common to introduce buffers between the operations. These buffers decouple operations and eliminate the interdependency unless the buffer is emptied when a shutdown occurs upstream. In this paper we study the buffered flows of matter in a flexible manufacturing system considering only two machines. We develop procedures to compute some steady-state performance measures, including the interference loss and some limiting distributions. We use the Markov processes theory to obtain our results.

40|$|Several studies {{explored}} {{associations between}} impairments in verbal working memory (WM) and numerical cognition, but with inconclusive findings. The present study explored verbal WM impairment {{in children with}} developmental dyscalculia, by adopting the critical distinction between WM for item information (the items to be retained) and WM for order information (the order of the items within a list). We hypothesized that especially WM for order should be related to impaired numerical abilities, given that recent studies suggest close interactions between the representation of order information in WM and ordinal numerical processing. We investigated item and order WM capacities as well as basic numerical processing abilities in 16 children with dyscalculia (age: 8 - 11 years) and 16 typically developing children matched on age, IQ and reading abilities. WM for order information was assessed via a serial order reconstruction task which maximized <b>serial</b> order <b>storage</b> requirements. WM for item information was assessed using a single monosyllabic nonword delayed repetition maximizing phonological item processing. We observed that the group with dyscalculia performed significantly slower {{than the control group}} in symbolic order and magnitude judgment task, while not being slowed on general measures of processing speed. Dyscalculic participants also performed significantly poorer and with less precision than controls in the order WM task, but not in the item WM task. These results highlight a specific impairment for WM for serial order in dyscalculia, and could reflect a more general serial order processing impairment for both WM and numerical domains.

Only the residual information is transmitted using the technique called as block based motion estimation and motion compensation [2]. MPEG 1 (Motion Picture Expert Group), MPEG 2, MPEG 4, H. 261, H. 263, H. 264 are the ancestors of H. 265. Work on the emerging “Advanced Video Coding” (AVC) standard now known as ITU-T(International Telecommunication Union) Recommendation H. 264 and as ISO 14496 (International Organization For Standards) (MPEG- 4) Part 10 has dominated the video coding standardization community.

40|$|Ring {{networks}} are enjoying renewed interest as Storage Area Networks (SANs), i. e., networks for interconnecting storage devices (e. g., disk, disk arrays and tape drives) and storage data clients. This paper addresses {{the problem of}} fairness in ring networks with spatial reuse operating under dynamic trafﬁc scenarios. To this end, in the ﬁrst part of the paper the Max-Min fairness deﬁnition is extended to dynamic trafﬁc scenarios and an algorithm for computing Max-Min fair rates in a dynamic environment is introduced. In {{the second part of}} the paper the extended Max-Min fairness deﬁnition is used as a measure to compare the performance in dynamic conditions of three fairness algorithms proposed for ring-based SANs. These algorithms are characterized by different fairness cycle sizes (number of links involved in each instance of the fairness algorithm), i. e., different complexity. The results show that the performance increases as the fairness cycle size decreases. In particular, the Global-cycle algorithm (implemented in the <b>Serial</b> <b>Storage</b> Architecture – SSA), whose cycle size is equal to the number N of links in the ring, exhibits the lowest performance, while the One-cycle algorithm, so called because of its cycle size equal to 1, has the best performance.

40|$|Magnetic tape {{has long}} been used to backup {{computer}} information, customarily during dedicated, low use, 'overnight windows' when tape backup programs could be run without interfering with user applications. Over time these windows have shrunk to near non-existence due to the globalization of business through its use of the Internet and the World Wide Web. While tape system speeds have accelerated and tape capacities have increased, they have not {{keep pace with the}} demand for shorter backup windows, quicker restoration requirements, and the rapidly escalating volume of disk drive data being backed up. At the same time, the cost of PC disk drives ("ATA" computer interface) has dropped to be competitive with tape, and disk-to-disk (D 2 D) backup has become popular, particularly using the new Serial ATA (SATA) PC drives. A D 2 D system can run at the full speed of disk, and can use the higher capacity of PC disk drives (up to 400 Gbytes today), because backup is primarily <b>serial</b> data <b>storage</b> not needing the high high random access speed of the enterprise storage systems being backed up (which get high random access speed by running many smaller capacity disks in parallel). The current interest in SATA D 2 D backup is of concern because these are PC drives sold with narrow profit margins that limit drive reliability. This paper addresses the fact that the reliability of SATA PC drives is inherently lower than enterprise-class drives (SCSI and Fiber Channel "SCSI/FC"). Methods are proposed for SATA storage system designers to achieve high system level reliability by requiring appropriate SATA drive reliability testing, by increased RAID redundancy, and by system management of drive failure warnings.

40|$|Abstract Background Recently many {{long-term}} prospective {{studies have}} involved <b>serial</b> collection and <b>storage</b> of blood or tissue specimens. This has spurred nested case-control studies that involve testing some specimens for various markers that might predict cancer. Until now {{there has been}} little guidance in statistical design and analysis of these studies. Methods To develop statistical guidelines, we considered the purpose, the types of biases, and the opportunities for extracting additional information. Results The following guidelines: (1) For the clearest interpretation, statistics should be based on false and true positive rates – not odds ratios or relative risks (2) To avoid overdiagnosis bias, cases should be diagnosed as a result of symptoms rather than on screening. (3) To minimize selection bias, the spectrum of control conditions should be the same in study and target screening populations. (4) To extract additional information, criteria for a positive test should be based on combinations of individual markers and changes in marker levels over time. (5) To avoid overfitting, the criteria for a positive marker combination developed in a training sample should be evaluated in a random test sample from the same study and, if possible, a validation sample from another study. (6) To identify biomarkers with true and false positive rates similar to mammography, the training, test, and validation samples should each include at least 110 randomly selected subjects without cancer and 70 subjects with cancer. Conclusion These guidelines ensure good practice in the design and analysis of nested case-control studies of early detection biomarkers. </p...|$|R
