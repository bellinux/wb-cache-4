50|$|ALU shift {{operations}} cause operand A (or B) {{to shift}} {{left or right}} (depending on the opcode) and <b>the</b> <b>shifted</b> operand appears at Y. Simple ALUs typically can <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> operand by only one bit position, whereas more complex ALUs employ barrel shifters {{that allow them to}} <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> operand by an arbitrary number of bits in one operation. In all single-bit <b>shift</b> operations, <b>the</b> bit <b>shifted</b> out of <b>the</b> operand appears on carry-out; the value of <b>the</b> bit <b>shifted</b> into <b>the</b> operand depends on <b>the</b> type of <b>shift.</b>|$|R
5|$|Her hip-hop fluency {{gave her}} an {{advantage}} in the pop-star arms race, helping her to become the presiding voice in an increasingly rap-dominated musical landscape. Her evolution, from rap-adjacent R star (appearing as early as 1998 in a Geto Boys video) to reluctant hip-hop shareholder to full-blown rapper, {{played a role in}} slowly <b>shifting</b> <b>the</b> sound of pop radio.|$|E

5|$|The routing of US223 {{was changed}} through Adrian in 1935, <b>shifting</b> <b>the</b> highway along {{different}} streets through town. Another change in 1942 through Adrian {{led to the}} creation of the first business loop through the city. This version of the business loop lasted until the main highway was moved a second time in 1956. With this subsequent move, the business loop designation was shifted to its current location.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and inactive states. The binding of FSH to <b>the</b> receptor <b>shifts</b> <b>the</b> equilibrium between active and inactive receptors. FSH and FSH-agonists <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> equilibrium in favor of active states; FSH antagonists <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> equilibrium in favor of inactive states. For a cell to respond to FSH, {{only a small percentage}} (~1%) of receptor sites need to be activated.|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} of a ball-and-spring-type detent on <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> sleeve and detents on <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> rail assists <b>the</b> driver in <b>shifting</b> quicker. <b>The</b> detent raises the force required to move <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> lever which prevents excess movement of the shifter by the driver, and reduces the chance of double bump. Tension between <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> sleeve and <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> rail also prevents the sleeve from vibrating while in gear.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shift</b> knob's {{principal}} function is the ergonomical interface between driver and the manual transmission stick <b>shift.</b> <b>The</b> stick <b>shift,</b> as <b>the</b> name implies, is often just a machined or cast aluminium or steel rod {{with or without}} threading <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> knob is fitted on its end.|$|R
5|$|The work {{begins with}} a sinfonia and then {{alternates}} choral movements and arias. There are no recitatives, no da capo repeats, {{and there is no}} chorale tune, unusually for Bach's cantatas. Bach makes extensive use of choral fugues and imitative polyphony, often <b>shifting</b> <b>the</b> tempo and character of the music within movements very quickly to accommodate a new musical idea with each successive phrase of text.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 2013, Beyoncé {{worked on}} the project in strict secrecy, sharing details of the album with a small circle of people and {{continually}} <b>shifting</b> <b>the</b> deadline, which was only finalized a week before its release.

5|$|Climatic shifts {{may affect}} tornadoes via teleconnections in <b>shifting</b> <b>the</b> jet stream {{and the larger}} weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces {{affecting}} larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although {{it is reasonable to}} suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.|$|E

5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide <b>shifting</b> <b>the</b> oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 the Sydney Theatre Company {{commissioned}} Enright {{to develop}} the original 45-minute play into a full-length production. Blackrock retained the original four characters but also added nine others. It also extended {{the length of the}} play, and was considered to be a more fictionalised version of Leigh's murder, though many viewers still considered it to be a factual account of the crime. The narrative and emphasis were reshaped for an adult audience outside of a specifically educational environment, also <b>shifting</b> <b>the</b> plays focus. While A Property of the Clan focused on the possible motives for rape, Blackrock was said to focus on the boys involved in the crime, portraying them as victims of the society they live in.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by <b>shifting</b> <b>the</b> lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Army leaders {{including}} General Eric Shinseki began <b>shifting</b> <b>the</b> Army force toward brigade centered operations. All separate brigades had been inactivated in the 1990s {{as part of}} the U.S. Army's drawdown following the end of the Cold War. These inactivations, along with subsequent reorganization of U.S. Army divisions, saw several divisional brigades stationed in bases that were far from the division's headquarters and support units. These brigades had difficulty operating without support from higher headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Since {{settlement}} it {{has repeatedly}} flooded, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Adelaide's western suburbs were especially {{prone to flooding}} due to their location on the river's alluvial fan. As development of Adelaide progressed the amount of rainfall required for flooding decreased and consequent damage increased. Increased stormwater runoff, modification of the river's banks and other changes all served to exacerbate the problem. Work done by various groups to minimise flooding was often counter productive {{with the creation of}} levees, moving and widening channels and other works simply <b>shifting</b> <b>the</b> flooding elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} of bovids {{has contributed}} in <b>shifting</b> <b>the</b> dependence {{of human beings}} from hunting and gathering to agriculture. The Bovidae include {{three of the five}} domesticated mammals whose use has spread outside their original ranges, namely cattle, sheep, and goats; all are from Eurasia, and are now found across the world. The other two species are the horse and pig. Other large bovids that have been domesticated but which remain within the ranges of their wild ancestors are the water buffalo (from the Indian water buffalo), domestic yak (from the wild yak), zebu (from the Indian aurochs), gayal (from the gaur) and Bali cattle (from the banteng).|$|E
50|$|If {{any of the}} {{components}} of aggregate demand (C + Ip + G + NX) rises at each level of income, for example because business becomes more optimistic about future profitability, that <b>shifts</b> <b>the</b> entire AD line upward.

25|$|It is {{believed}} that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and inactive biophysical states. The binding of ligands to <b>the</b> receptor may <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> equilibrium toward the active receptor states. Three types of ligands exist: Agonists are ligands that <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> equilibrium in favour of active states; inverse agonists are ligands that <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> equilibrium in favour of inactive states; and neutral antagonists are ligands that do not affect the equilibrium. It is not yet known how exactly the active and inactive states differ from each other.|$|R
