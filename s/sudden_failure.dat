[...] Maisie was somehow on the spot aware of an absence of disposition to crow; it had taken her but an extra minute to arrive at such a quick survey of the objects surrounding Mrs. Beale as showed that among them was no appurtenance of Sir Claude's.

60|$|As the consul held my wages, {{and refused}} to give me any money, I was {{compelled}} {{to get on board}} some vessel as soon as I could. Batavia was not a place for an American constitution, and I was glad to be off. I shipped, before the mast, in the Clyde, of Salem, a good little ship, with good living and good treatment. We sailed immediately, but not soon enough to escape the Batavia fever. Two of the crew died, about a week out, and were buried in the Straits of Banca. The day we lost sight of Java Head, it came on to blow fresh, and we had to take in the jib, and double-reef the topsails. A man of the name of Day went down on the bowsprit shrouds to clear the jib-sheets, when the ship made a heavy pitch, and washed him away. The second mate and myself got into the boat, and were lowered as soon as the ship was rounded-to. There was a very heavy sea on, but we succeeded in finding the poor fellow, who was swimming with great apparent strength. His face was towards the boat, and, as we came near, I rose, and threw the blade of my oar towards him, calling out to him to be of good cheer. At this instant, Day seemed to spring nearly his length out of water, and immediately sunk. What caused this extraordinary effort, and <b>sudden</b> <b>failure,</b> was never known. I have sometimes thought a shark must have struck him, though I saw neither blood nor fish. The man was hopelessly lost, and we returned to the ship, feeling as seamen always feel on such occasions.|$|E

6000|$|He told me late on Christmas eve, {{after our}} simple {{domestic}} revels had sunk {{to rest and}} we sat together by the fire, {{that he had been}} visited the night before in wakeful hours by the finest fancy for a really good thing that he had ever felt descend in the darkness. [...] "It's just the vision of a situation that contains, upon my honour, everything," [...] he said, [...] "and I wonder that I've never thought of it before." [...] He didn't describe it further, contrary to his common practice, and I only knew later, by Mrs. Limbert, that he had begun Derogation and that he was completely full of his subject. It was a subject however that he was not to live to treat. The work went on {{for a couple of months}} in happy mystery, without revelations even to his wife. He had not invited her to help him to get up his case--she had not taken the field with him as on his previous campaigns. We only knew he was at it again but that less even than ever had been said about the impression to be made on the market. I saw him in February and thought him sufficiently at ease. The great thing was that he was immensely interested and was pleased with the omens. I got a strange, stirring sense that he had not consulted the usual ones and indeed that he had floated away into a grand indifference, into a reckless consciousness of art. The voice of the market had suddenly grown faint and far: he had come back at the last, as people so often do, to one of the moods, the sincerities of his prime. Was he really with a blurred sense of the urgent doing something now only for himself? We wondered and waited--we felt that he was a little confused. What had happened, I was afterwards satisfied, was that he had quite forgotten whether he generally sold or not. He had merely waked up one morning again in the country of the blue and had stayed there with a good conscience and a great idea. He stayed till death knocked at the gate, for the pen dropped from his hand only at the moment when from <b>sudden</b> <b>failure</b> of the heart his eyes, as he sank back in his chair, closed for ever. Derogation is a splendid fragment; it evidently would have been one of his high successes. I am not prepared to say it would have waked up the libraries.|$|E

[...] "Well, I must say you take it amazingly!--all the more that to see you again this way is to feel that if, all along, there was a man whose {{delicacy}} and confidence and general attitude might have marked him for a particular consideration, you'd have been the man." [...] And they were more directly face to face again; with Newton smiling and smiling so appreciatively; making our friend in fact almost ask himself when before a man had ever grinned from ear to ear to the effect of its so becoming him. What he replied, however, was that Newton described in those flattering terms a client temptingly fatuous; after which, and the exchange of another protest or two in the interest of justice and decency, and another plea or two in that of the still finer contention that even the basest misdeeds had always somewhere or other, could one get at it, their propitiatory side, our hero found himself on his feet again, under the influence of a <b>sudden</b> <b>failure</b> of everything but horror--a horror determined by some turn of their talk and indeed by the very fact of the freedom of it. It was as if a far-borne sound of the hue and cry, a vision of his old friend hunted and at bay, had suddenly broken in--this other friend's, this irresistibly intelligent other companion's, practically vivid projection of that making the worst ugliness real. [...] "Oh, it's just making my wry face to somebody, and your letting me and caring and wanting to know: that," [...] Mark said, [...] "is what does me good; not any other hideous question. I mean I don't take any interest in my case--what one wonders about, you see, is what can be done for him. I mean, that is"--for he floundered a little, not knowing at last quite what he did mean, a great rush of mere memories, a great humming sound as of thick, thick echoes, rising now to an assault that he met with his face indeed contorted. If he didn't take care he should howl; so he more or less successfully took care--yet with his host vividly watching him while he shook the danger temporarily off. [...] "I don't mind--though it's rather that; my having felt this morning, after three dismal dumb bad days, that one's friends perhaps would be thinking of one. All I'm conscious of now--I give you my word--is that I'd like to see him." ...|$|E
