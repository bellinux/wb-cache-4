5|$|The first {{director}} approached to helm the production by Michael Wearing was Danny Boyle. Boyle was keen to direct all nine episodes, but Pattinson believed that one director {{taking charge of}} the entire serial would be too punishing a schedule for whomever was chosen. Boyle had recently completed work on the feature film Shallow Grave and wanted to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> film was received before committing to Our Friends in the North. When Shallow Grave {{proved to be a}} critical success, Boyle was able to enter pre-production on Trainspotting. He withdrew from Our Friends in the North. Sir Peter Hall was also briefly considered, but he too had other production commitments.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} script for [...] "Subway", Yoshimura wanted the Pembleton {{character}} to be confronted with his own mortality, a theme that had continued from the previous season in which the character suffered a stroke. Although Pembleton does not typically discuss his own feelings, Yoshimura {{wanted him to be}} placed in a situation in which he not only discussed death, but is also led by the unique circumstance of Lange's subway incident to confide his stroke experience to an almost complete stranger. From the beginning of the writing process, Yoshimura specifically wanted the Lange character to be mean and unpleasant, rather than the nice and innocent victim more typically portrayed in such television episodes: [...] "Tragedy can happen to jerky people too and I think it'd be much more interesting to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> kind of character's circumstances transcends the typical cliched TV kind of victim." ...|$|E

The {{couple have}} no {{children}} and Winter stated in an interview: [...] "I can <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> {{would be a}} wonderful rewarding thing, but I think there are enough people in the world" [...] and that [...] "It {{might have been more}} problematical if I had children with a career and all of it. I tour all the time. If I were to have children, I would want to be home all the time." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rob DenBlyker, one of {{the creators}} of the webcomic Cyanide and Happiness, parodied the {{commercial}} in a 2013 installment where a father, after re-enacting the commercial, admits to his son that he himself is on drugs.

Your ink was deep green; your light was green; {{you made me}} look at it long; and then I saw the same thing written on the skin of your arm in {{complementary}} colours." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of living history has {{enabled me to}} re-read my experience and {{to look into the}} problematic knot between law, equality and the feminine preference looked at in its ambiguous meaning, valuing and excluding.

2500|$|In the {{meantime}} Buick succeeded in repairing the 11 Platoon radio, {{and was able}} to re-establish communications with Company Headquarters, and with Stanley, who was again able to adjust the artillery by radio. Yet the Viet Cong succeeded in closing to within [...] of 11 Platoon's position, and much of the artillery was beginning to fall behind them. Although the fire was likely impacting the Viet Cong rear area and was probably causing considerable casualties there, the assault troops had deliberately closed with the Australians to negate its effect. Buick estimated 11 Platoon was being assaulted by at least two companies; down to the last of their ammunition and with just 10 of its 28 men still able to fight, he feared the platoon would soon be overrun and destroyed, and would be unlikely to survive more than the next 10 to 15 minutes. Confident the rest of D Company would be attempting to reach them, but unable to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> might occur, Buick requested artillery fire onto his own position despite the danger this entailed. Stanley refused, although after confirming 11 Platoon's precarious situation, he was able to walk the artillery in closer. Landing [...] to their front, the artillery detonated among a large concentration of Viet Cong troops, destroying an entire assault line as they formed up. Three US F-4 Phantoms arrived on station at 17:00 for an airstrike arranged by Battalion Headquarters.|$|E

She'd been very free with him up to that time; but when she found out he was a rich man's son she became as quiet and innocent as a kitten. I hate her; she's a deceitful snip." ...|$|R

His father Ed Ogilvy had been a small-time crook some time ago. He had been loyal to his employers, but was murdered {{in the process of}} a business negotiation. After his father's death, Ignatius worked his way to becoming one of the Penguin's top lieutenants and eventually his right hand man.
