5|$|Schubert's famous String Quintet {{was written}} in September 1828, {{together}} with the final versions of the sonatas. The slow movements of the quintet and the B-flat Sonata bear striking similarities in their main sections: both employ the same unique textural layout, in which two-three voices sing long notes in the middle register, accompanied by the contrasted, short pizzicato notes of the other voices, in the lower and upper registers; in both movements, the long notes over the relentless ostinato rhythm, convey an atmosphere of complete <b>stillness,</b> <b>of</b> arrest of all motion and time. String quintet textures also appear elsewhere, throughout the sonata trilogy.|$|E

With a few scant minutes remaining before the 22:00 deadline, a B-26 Night Intruder bearing the Liberty Squadron's yellow tail, opened its bomb bays and dropped the last load of explosives that detonated in North Korea.

40|$|This paper studies atmospheres <b>of</b> <b>stillness</b> in a contested urban {{public space}} {{known as the}} ‘Bearpit’. The purpose {{is to provide a}} nuanced account <b>of</b> <b>stillness</b> and its {{relationship}} to atmosphere. Drawing on an ethnographic examination of the Bearpit, the paper finds that the positive and beneficial aspects <b>of</b> <b>stillness</b> can be found in unexpected and unconventional places. However, there is no single, unifying experience <b>of</b> <b>stillness,</b> but rather a plurality of ‘stillings’. The paper highlights three forms <b>of</b> <b>stillness</b> distilled from study of the site – calmness, control and withdrawnness – and demonstrates how these modalities emerge from and contribute to the construction of atmospheres in the Bearpit. Moreover, these atmospheres have direct political consequences for those who take part in city life. The paper’s contribution is found in the advancement of non-anthropocentric understandings of atmosphere and the development <b>of</b> <b>stillness</b> as a way of understanding city life...|$|R
500|$|In 2009, {{art critic}} Tom Lubbock {{considered}} the painting [...] "one {{of the most}} striking" [...] chronophotography-inspired works, pointing to several features which create a comical effect: the [...] "abrupt close-up" [...] on a trivial subject—a [...] "twee prim sausage dog"—which {{might have been a}} single detail in an Impressionist street scene; the [...] juxtaposition of the word dynamism, [...] "with its connotations of heroism, of the mighty modern machine world" [...] against that subject; the cropping of the owner at the knee, giving a dog's view (and anticipating Tom and Jerry cartoons); and the apparently frenetic motion of the dog's limbs and tail coupled with the <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> its body, suggesting little forward progress. Lubbock describes Balla's motion effects as [...] "creating new sensations and new phenomena", and evoking the motion of shuffling cards and the embodiment of ghosts.|$|E
500|$|Let the Right One In was an {{international}} success. Critics lauded {{the performances of}} the young leads, often highlighting Leandersson for particular acclaim. According to Karen Durbin of Elle, she [...] "evokes Eli's radical apartness {{with an air of}} watchful caution and a contained <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> body that not only belies her childish appearance (...)", and [...] "In a performance devoid of sentimentality she perfectly captures the awful solitude of a creature who exists outside time". James Berardinelli also praised Leandersson for [...] "crafting an individual who is both mysterious and compelling", while Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "The youthful actors imbue even the most emotional and disturbing scenes with remarkable complexity. Leandersson is particularly impressive as the conflicted young vampire who wants nothing more than to be an ordinary girl again". Luke Y. Thompson of LA Weekly compared her performance favorably to that of Kirsten Dunst as the child vampire Claudia in Interview with the Vampire. He concluded that, while Dunst [...] "used to be the gold standard; in Leandersson, I think we have a new champion." [...] The Oregonian called Leandersson's performance [...] "incredible", and expressed doubt that any actress in the American remake could top it. While Swedish reviewers generally made positive comments about the two leads, Emma Engström of Göteborgs-Posten felt that Leandersson's character was lacking in depth.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{journalist}} Peter Bradshaw {{felt that}} Contagion blended well {{together as a}} film, although opined that Soderbergh was somewhat unsuccessful on channeling the fears, frights, and [...] "the massive sense of loss" [...] of [...] "ordinary people". To David Denby of The New Yorker, the [...] "brilliant" [...] film was [...] "serious, precise, frightening," [...] and [...] "emotionally enveloping". Despite applauding Soderbergh for [...] "hopscotching" [...] tidily [...] "between the intimate and international", The Atlantic Christopher Orr was disappointed with the film's detached and [...] "clinical" [...] disposition, which led him to conclude that Contagion should have gone with a more inflexible rationale, or a lesson [...] "beyond 'wash your hands often and hope you're lucky'." [...] "For all the craft that went into it, Contagion is ultimately beyond good or bad, beyond criticism. It just is," [...] professed The Atlantic writer. Described as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "spooky" [...] installment, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Soderbergh doesn't milk your tears as things fall apart, but a passion that can feel like cold rage is inscribed in his images {{of men and women}} isolated in the frame, in the blurred {{point of view of the}} dying and in the insistent <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> a visual style that seems like an exhortation to look." [...] In regards to the story, Salon columnist Andrew O'Hehir avouched that the [...] "crisp" [...] and succinct narrative matched up to the [...] "beautifully composed" [...] visuals of the film. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter proclaimed that Soderbergh and Burns effectively created anxiety in the [...] "shrewd" [...] and [...] "unsensationalistic" [...] film without becoming exaggerated, a sentiment echoed by Jeanette Catsolis of NPR, who insisted that the duo [...] "weave multiple characters into a narrative that's complex without being confusing, and intelligent without being baffling". Writing for The Village Voice, Karina Longworth thought that Contagion reflected the [...] "self-consciousness" [...] and [...] "experimentation" [...] of some of Soderbergh's previous efforts, such as the Ocean's trilogy and The Girlfriend Experience (2009).|$|E

Her Queen of the Fairies [...] outwardly so full of composure, betrayed in tantalising moments the character's repressed sensuality."

2500|$|Ranney enjoyed duck hunting, {{which is}} {{reflected}} {{in some of his}} paintings on that theme, which are noted for their solidly constructed, almost sculpture-like figures. His most popular and requested work is his 1850 painting On the Wing, which portrays a sportsman with dead game at his feet, about to shoot down his next target. Ranney produced at least four different versions of this print, the most recognized of which was reserved for the Butler Institute of American Art. It was published in the gift book Ornaments of Memory in 1856 and 1857. This version is set in a more windblown environment, noted for the contrast generated with the <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> the human figures within it. The portrayal of the outdoorsman in On the Wing contributed to the era's nationalistic imagery. Mark Thistelthwaite of the Butler Institute, describes this piece as: ...|$|E

[...] Thomas P. Roberts, who named Black Eagle Falls, gave this body of water its name in 1872. The United States Army Corps of Engineers referred to it by this name beginning at least as early as 1883, and as recently as 1910. The Montana Legislature has used the name, and the name was in popular use as early as 1891 and as late as 1917. Modern historians have referred to it as such, and it was in use by power industry publications as late as 1949.

2500|$|Kate (1844–1924) was {{the first}} of the Terry {{children}} to make the family name famous on the English stage, beginning her career as a small child. According to the academic Nina Auerbach, Kate may have been the most accomplished actor among her siblings, quickly gaining praise in the plays of Shakespeare, among others. Contemporary critics thought the same: The Manchester Guardian ended its report of her last performance before her retirement: [...] "In our unwilling acceptance of her farewell, we must now rest satisfied with the memory of the peerless beauty of her merry-hearted acting ... like the music of a bewitching melody piercing the <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> the night, and ending just when the ear longed for the next note." [...] She gave up acting when she married the businessman Arthur James Lewis (1824–1901) in 1867 when she was 23. She made only two later stage appearances, the first in 1898, in a small role supporting her daughter Mabel in a new play in the West End; the second was in 1906 at her sister Ellen's jubilee celebrations at Drury Lane. Of her four children, all daughters, only the youngest, Mabel, followed her into the theatrical profession. The two middle daughters were Janet and Lucy. Kate's eldest daughter, also named Kate, married Frank Gielgud; their four children included Val and John Gielgud.|$|E
2500|$|The troops' general careworn {{appearance}} was very noticeable; {{they were not}} actually ill but lacked proper sleep {{and the effects of}} this deprivation were intensified by the heat, dust, humidity, pressure effect, <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> the air, and mosquitoes which together with the cumulative effects of the hardships of the two previous years of campaigning caused a general depression.
