Using these decomposed vectors a sub-space which is relatively independent of speaker variations is derived. A method to optimally estimate the dimensionality of <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> independent sub-space is also presented. Original features can now be projected <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> independent sub-space to make them less sensitive to <b>speaker</b> variations.
