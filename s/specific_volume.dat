25|$|The evaporator, turbine, and {{condenser}} {{operate in}} partial vacuum ranging from 3% to 1% of atmospheric pressure.

25|$|The low {{pressure}} in the evaporator is maintained by a vacuum pump that also removes the dissolved non-condensable gases from the evaporator. The evaporator now contains a mixture of water and steam of very low vapor quality (steam content). The steam is separated from the water as saturated vapor.

25|$|The exact {{amount of}} raw {{materials}} is very important. Semolina dosing is done by two methods: volumetric feed (measurement by volume), and gravimetric feed (measurement by weight). In volumetric feed, a <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> of semolina is measured by variable speed screws or rotary air-lock valves. This method is not very accurate since the amount depends on {{the density of the}} semolina. In gravimetric feed, semolina is weighed by a variable speed transport system, which is equipped with a device measuring the flow. Although this method is more accurate, it is more expensive and needs to be isolated.|$|E
25|$|Since gas {{molecules}} {{can move}} freely within a container, their mass is normally characterized by density. Density {{is the amount}} of mass per unit volume of a substance, or the inverse of <b>specific</b> <b>volume.</b> For gases, the density can vary over a wide range because the particles are free to move closer together when constrained by pressure or volume. This variation of density is referred to as compressibility. Like pressure and temperature, density is a state variable of a gas and the change in density during any process is governed by the laws of thermodynamics. For a static gas, the density is the same throughout the entire container. Density is therefore a scalar quantity. It can be shown by kinetic theory that the density is inversely proportional {{to the size of the}} container in which a fixed mass of gas is confined. In this case of a fixed mass, the density decreases as the volume increases.|$|E

2500|$|When {{performing}} a thermodynamic analysis, it is typical {{to speak of}} intensive and extensive properties. Properties which depend {{on the amount of}} gas (either by mass or volume) are called extensive properties, while properties that do not depend on the amount of gas are called intensive properties. <b>Specific</b> <b>volume</b> is an example of an intensive property because it is the ratio of volume occupied by a unit of mass of a gas that is identical throughout a system at equilibrium. 1000 atoms a gas occupy the same space as any other 1000 atoms for any given temperature and pressure. This concept is easier to visualize for solids such as iron which are incompressible compared to gases. [...] Since a gas fills any container in which it is placed, volume is an extensive property.|$|E
2500|$|While {{illustrating}} a gas turbine's Brayton cycle, Figure 5.1 [...] includes example {{plots of}} [...] pressure-specific volume and temperature-entropy. These types of plots are fundamental to understanding centrifugal compressor performance at one operating point. Studying these two plots further {{we see that}} the pressure rises between the compressor inlet (station 1) and compressor exit (station 2). [...] At the same time, {{it is easy to see}} that the <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> decreases or similarly the density increases. Studying the temperature-entropy plot we see the temperature increase with increasing entropy (loss). If we assume dry air, and ideal gas equation of state and an isentropic process, we have enough information to define the pressure ratio and efficiency for this one point. Unfortunately, we are missing several other key pieces of information if we wish to apply the centrifugal compressor to another application.|$|E

2500|$|A solvent (from the Latin , [...] "loosen, untie, solve") is a {{substance}} that dissolves a solute (a chemically distinct liquid, solid or gas), resulting in a solution. A solvent is usually a liquid but {{can also be a}} solid, a gas, or a supercritical fluid. The quantity of solute that can dissolve in a <b>specific</b> <b>volume</b> of solvent varies with temperature. Common uses for organic solvents are in dry cleaning (e.g. tetrachloroethylene), as paint thinners (e.g. toluene, turpentine), as nail polish removers and glue solvents (acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate), in spot removers (e.g. hexane, petrol ether), in detergents (citrus terpenes) and in perfumes (ethanol). Water is a solvent for polar molecules and the most common solvent used by living things; all the ions and proteins in a cell are dissolved in water within a cell. Solvents find various applications in chemical, pharmaceutical, oil, and gas industries, including in chemical syntheses and purification processes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{thermodynamics}} so-called [...] "specific" [...] quantities are quantities {{per unit}} mass (kg) and are denoted by lower-case characters.

In a Joule–Thomson process the specific enthalpy h remains constant. To prove this, {{the first step}} is to compute the net work done when a mass m of the gas moves through the plug. This amount of gas has a volume of V1 = m v1 in the region at pressure P1 (region 1) and a volume V2 = m v2 when in the region at pressure P2 (region 2). Then in region 1, the [...] "flow work" [...] done on the amount of gas by the rest of the gas is: W1 = m P1v1. In region 2, the work done by the amount of gas on the rest of the gas is: W2 = m P2v2.

2500|$|Bernoulli's {{equation}} is sometimes valid for {{the flow of}} gases: provided {{that there is no}} transfer of kinetic or potential energy from the gas flow to the compression or expansion of the gas. [...] If both the gas pressure and volume change simultaneously, then work will be done on or by the gas. [...] In this case, Bernoulli's equation – in its incompressible flow form – cannot be assumed to be valid. [...] However, if the gas process is entirely isobaric, or isochoric, then no work is done on or by the gas, (so the simple energy balance is not upset). [...] According to the gas law, an isobaric or isochoric process is ordinarily the only way to ensure constant density in a gas. [...] Also the gas density will be proportional to the ratio of pressure and absolute temperature, however this ratio will vary upon compression or expansion, no matter what non-zero quantity of heat is added or removed. [...] The only exception is if the net heat transfer is zero, as in a complete thermodynamic cycle, or in an individual isentropic (frictionless adiabatic) process, and even then this reversible process must be reversed, to restore the gas to the original pressure and <b>specific</b> <b>volume,</b> and thus density. [...] Only then is the original, unmodified Bernoulli equation applicable. [...] In this case the equation can be used if the flow speed of the gas is sufficiently below the speed of sound, such that the variation in density of the gas (due to this effect) along each streamline can be ignored. [...] Adiabatic flow at less than Mach 0.3 is generally considered to be slow enough.|$|E
