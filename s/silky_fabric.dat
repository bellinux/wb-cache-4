Most pumice {{contains}} tubular microvesicles that can impart a <b>silky</b> or fibrous <b>fabric.</b> The elongation of the microvesicles occurs due to ductile elongation in the volcanic conduit or, {{in the case of}} pumiceous lavas, during flow. The other form of vesicles are subspherical to spherical and result from high vapor pressure during eruption.|$|R

5000|$|In X-Men: Evolution, Storm {{is portrayed}} as a teacher at Professor Xavier's Xavier Institute. In this version, she is the aunt of young X-Man Evan Daniels (codename Spyke) {{and a member of}} the staff at the Xavier Institute. Her fashion sense is usually purple colors and earth tones wearing either a skirt or <b>silky</b> <b>fabric.</b> She has a sister named Vivian, who does not exist in the comics. She is also the keeper of the X-Mansion's greenhouse, mostly because she is a terrific {{gardener}} and she needs no watering can, and has been consider as the [...] of Professor Xavier. In the episode [...] "African Storm", her past life is revealed. Storm is tormented by Houngan, an evil African shaman who wants to take over Africa. There is no evidence she was a thief in this adaption. Storm and the X-Men have to stop an enemy who knows every weakness of hers. The Houngan used mostly Storm's claustrophobia. During the end of Season 4 in [...] "Ascension (Part 1)", Apocalypse turns Storm into one of the four Horsemen. She gains both ability to produce even greater storms. She is later turned back at the end of the series. She was voiced by Canadian actress, Kirsten Williamson.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{types of}} Silnylon are produced. The common type is a quiet, <b>silky,</b> very {{slippery}} <b>fabric.</b> The variant known as [...] "crisp silnylon" [...] is lighter, but brittle, noisy, and tears easily. Someversions {{are made from}} the stronger type 66 nylon and are used for applications like parachutes and hot air balloons. Some use a blend of silicone and urethane which is done partly to reduce the air pollution during manufacture as it reduces the aromatic solvents used in the coating process.|$|R
5000|$|Soy fabrics {{are derived}} from the hulls of soybeans—a {{manufacturing}} byproduct. Soy fabrics can be blended (i.e. 30%) or made entirely out of soy fibers. Soy clothing is largely biodegradable, so it has a minimal impact on environment and landfills. Although not as durable as cotton or hemp fabrics, soy clothing has a soft, elastic feel. [...] Soy clothing {{is known as the}} vegetable cashmere for its light and <b>silky</b> sensation. Soy <b>fabrics</b> are moisture absorbent, anti-bacterial, and UV resistant. However, soy fabrics fell out of public knowledge during World War II, when rayon, nylon, and cotton sales rose sharply.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this design was to portray an edgy {{professional}} style while combining both <b>silky</b> flowing <b>fabrics</b> with stiff and structured ones. This ensemble is inspired by the couture avant garde fashion style that captures the innovation of new concepts and techniques. These can be described by using bulging shoulders, accentuated waistlines, three dimensional figures protruding from the garment, and many other techniques that push the boundaries of everyday attire. I have taken this style and altered it to make these types of garments easily wearable and socially acceptable. Process: Before the sketching process started, design-provoking images were collected and inspirational design elements gleaned. Since these types of pieces are usually off-kilter and unrealistic, I chose to bring to life a melodious version of the style. In order to incorporate the avant garde style into the outfit I used a firm fabric for the sleeves, chest and shoulder panels to add stiffness, dimension and uniqueness to this silhouette of blouse. The pants are meant to compliment the curvature of the woman’s lower back, buttocks, and thighs. To keep with the avant garde fashion, the waistband is a bit higher, which helps nip in the waist, and elongate the torso even more so. Techniques: While creating and constructing the pants and blouse, the flat patterning and draping methods were both used to create the fullness and accurately match up the pattern pieces.
