500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{many of the}} scenes in [...] "The Reporter" [...] were improvised by the actors.

[...] Ehrich liked the plot as he was bullied as a child, stating: [...] "Kids do it out of their own sadness or insecurity, but needless to say that doesn’t matter when you’re a victim of it - you feel so isolated and so alone.
