5|$|After {{showing the}} game at the Macworld Expo, Bungie was mobbed with {{interest}} and orders for the game. The game was not finished until December 14, 1994; Jones {{and a few other}} employees spent a day at a warehouse assembling boxes <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the orders could be filled before Christmas. The game was a critical and commercial success, and is regarded as a relatively unknown but important part of gaming history. It served as the Mac alternative to DOS PC-only games like Doom and System Shock. The game's volume of orders was unprecedented for the studio, who found that its old method of mail or phone orders could not scale to the demand and hired another company to handle {{the tens of thousands of}} orders. Marathon also brought Bungie attention from press outside the small Mac gaming market.|$|E
5|$|The classic view {{of water}} in cells is that about 5% of this water is {{strongly}} bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of solvation, while the majority has the same structure as pure water. This water of solvation is not active in osmosis and may have different solvent properties, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated. However, others argue {{that the effects of}} the high concentrations of macromolecules in cells extend throughout the cytosol and that water in cells behaves very differently from the water in dilute solutions. These ideas include the proposal that cells contain zones of low and high-density water, which could have widespread effects on the structures and functions of the other parts of the cell. However, the use of advanced nuclear magnetic resonance methods to directly measure the mobility {{of water in}} living cells contradicts this idea, as it suggests that 85% of cell water acts like that pure water, while the remainder is less mobile and probably bound to macromolecules.|$|E

25|$|Tinamous {{have been}} popular game birds {{for many years}} in South America and Central America, so much <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> species' numbers have dropped. The steppe birds are more popular to hunt because they can be flushed into flight, rather than the forest birds that run to cover and hide. In the late 19th and early 20th century hunting was {{responsible}} for mass killing within the family, with the elegant crested tinamou and spotted nothura popular targets. In 1921, Argentina urged the control of commercial hunting of several bird species, including tinamou.|$|E

The study used a MRI machine to scan how subjects reacted to images of people drinking.

25|$|Appearing {{before some}} {{administrative}} tribunals may feel like appearing in court, but the tribunal's procedure is relatively less formal {{than that of}} a court, and more importantly, the rules of evidence are not as strictly observed, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> evidence that would be inadmissible in a court hearing may be allowed in a tribunal hearing, if relevant to the proceeding. While relevant evidence is admissible, evidence which the adjudicator determines to have questionable reliability, or is otherwise questionable, is most likely to be afforded little or no weight.|$|E
25|$|The Road Warriors’ {{high impact}} power style and unique attire quickly got them noticed by fans and dreaded by opponents, so much <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> wrestlers would grab their bag {{and leave the}} arena when they saw they were {{scheduled}} to face the Road Warriors. In Georgia, the team quickly rose to the top despite being very young and without the traditional “paying dues” period just {{because they were so}} believable in their role as power monsters. They gained a reputation for being very stiff and not selling simply because they could and as a result most of their matches ended quickly. They won the NWA National Tag Team Championship upon their debut, a title they would win three more times while in Georgia.|$|E

25|$|There were 90 {{employees}} in the facility {{at the time of}} the fire, which began when a 25-foot (7.6 m) long deep fat fryer vat may have spontaneously ignited at around 8:30 AM. This cooker's temperature was controlled by thermostat and was maintained at a constant 375°F (190°C), which was variable by design to 15°F (8°C) either way. The fire spread rapidly, causing a panic <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> workers suffered trauma injuries during a rush to escape. Large quantities of smoke were produced by a combination of burning soybean oil and chicken, and melting roof insulation. The smoke was later found to be hydrocarbon-charged and had the potential to disable someone within a few breaths. Several gas lines embedded in the ceiling also caught fire and exploded.|$|E
25|$|Gaza strip In all 25 {{municipalities}} in the Gaza strip, water {{provision is}} the responsibility of the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU). However, the utility is still in the process of being set up and exercise its legal tasks. The intended procedure is that the municipalities receive technical assistance by the CMWU and gradually transfer their staff and assets to it. According to the World Bank, this model led to some improvements like faster repair of leakage and economies of scale. However, the plan is far from being fully implemented. The model experienced serious problems which are mainly caused by the unstable political conditions in the Gaza strip since 2008, including differences between municipalities governed by Hamas and Fatah, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> municipalities refused to transfer their assets and staff to CMWU.|$|E
25|$|Mayor John F. Hylan was an {{advocate}} of public operation of the subway, and wanted this goal to be set with a vengeance. He was fired from the BRT after working as a motorman for some time, {{and he wanted to}} avoid having to spend more money to recapture the IRT and BRT, so he tried to push the two operators out of business. To that end, Hylan had denied allocating money for the BRT by refusing to build new lines, refusing to raise fares (thereby putting the BRT in more debt), denied building permits <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> major building work lasted longer than planned, and even refusing to build a new subway yard for the BRT. The Malbone Street Wreck in 1918 contributed to the losses incurred by the two companies, which led to the bankruptcy of the BRT in 1918. The BRT, however, was reorganized into the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). The IRT was almost bankrupt, but managed to complete the line to Flushing by 1928. So, Hylan drew up plans for a third subway network, which should be built and operated in contrast to the existing subway lines, which were privately operated.|$|E

[...] He compared the arches in the arcade to those of two other churches in the vicinity, St Cwyfan's and St Morhaiarn's, and suggested they were both {{the work of the}} same architect. He also said that the doorway (as he described the arch in the west wall) was [...] "richly ornamented", and commented that it had been [...] "most judiciously uncovered" [...] during the 1840 repairs.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{publishing}} of the Modernisation Plan advocating the change-over to diesel traction, {{there was a}} proposal to construct a second batch of the Clan Class, which was accepted as Crewe Works Order Lot 242. This authorised {{the construction of a}} further batch of fifteen Clans that included modifications to the original design. [...] Originally scheduled for 1952 with frames constructed for 72010 Hengist, acute steel shortages meant that the order was continually rescheduled until the publication of the British Railways Modernisation Plan finally halted the project. The initial name allocations for the new batch would seem to suggest several operating the Kent coast trains, hauling the Golden Arrow and other expresses, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of this batch would have been allocated to the Southern Region.|$|E
