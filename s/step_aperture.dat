40|$|In {{the field}} of remote sensing, the recent {{increase}} in image sizes has drawn a significant attention on processing these files in a fault tolerant distributed architecture In this regard, Apache Hadoop architecture becomes an efficient MapReduce model. In the satellite image processing, large scale images put the limitation on the single computer analysis. Whereas, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) gives a remarkable solution to handle these files through its inherent data parallelism technique. This architecture is well suited for structured data, as the structured data can be equally distributed easily and access the relevant data. Images are considered as unstructured matrix data in Hadoop and the whole part of the data is relevant for any processing. It leads to a challenge to maintain the data locality with the equal data distribution.

40|$|Abstract. High {{resolution}} range profiling and imaging {{have been}} the principal methods by which more and more detailed target information can be collected by radar systems. The level of detail that can be established may then be used to attempt classification. However, this has typically been achieved using monostatic radar viewing targets from a single perspective. In this chapter methods for achieving very high resolutions will be reviewed. The techniques will include wide instantaneous bandwidths, <b>stepped</b> frequency and <b>aperture</b> synthesis. Examples showing the angular dependency of high range resolution profiles and two-dimensional imagery of real, full scale targets are presented.

40|$|Abstract—Phase unwrapping {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} <b>steps</b> in synthetic <b>aperture</b> radar (SAR) interferometry processing. With the rapid advancement of SAR technologies, the interferometric data sets from newly launched satellites are becoming larger and larger. When the computing resources required for unwrapping an input data set exceed computer hardware capabilities, phase unwrapping becomes even more problematic. In this paper, a new method is proposed in order to address the problem of unwrapping large data sets. The proposed method separates the unwrapping procedure into two stages. First, an approximate L 1 -norm phase unwrapping solution is efficiently obtained from a simplified minimum-cost flow network. Then, the blocks partitioned from the input data set are unwrapped by solving the corresponding independent network optimization problems directed by the approximate solution, either in parallel or in series. By then simply aligning the unwrapped blocks, a full-size unwrapped result is obtained. A significant advantage of the proposed method is that the globality of phase unwrapping solutions can be guaranteed. Using an interferogram with a size of 120 000 × 9274 pixels, the authors demonstrate that the proposed method is able to efficiently unwrap very large interferometric data sets using limited computing resources.

40|$|Phase unwrapping (PU) {{represents}} an important <b>step</b> in synthetic <b>aperture</b> radar interferometry (InSAR) and other interferometric applications. Among the different PU methods, {{the so called}} branch-cut approaches play an important role. In 1996 M. Costantini [Proceedings of the Fringe 96 Workshop ERS SAR Interferometry (European Space Agency, Munich, 1996), pp. 261 - 272] proposed to transform the problem of correctly placing branch cuts into a minimum cost flow (MCF) problem. The crucial point of this new approach is to generate cost functions that represent the a priori knowledge necessary for PU. Since cost functions are derived from measured data, they are random variables. This leads {{to the question of}} MCF solution stability: How much can the cost functions be varied without changing the cheapest flow that represents the correct branch cuts? This question is partially answered: The existence of a whole linear subspace in the space of cost functions is shown; this subspace contains all cost differences by which a cost function can be changed without changing the cost difference between any two flows that are discharging any residue configuration. These cost differences are called strictly stable cost differences. For quadrangular nonclosed networks (the most important type of MCF networks for interferometric purposes) a complete classification of strictly stable cost differences is presented. Further, the role of the well-known class of node potentials in the framework of strictly stable cost differences is investigated, and information on the vector-space structure representing the MCF environment is provided...|$|R

An {{automated}} {{and highly}} accurate system for “mapping ” 5 cm-diameter beam position monitors (BPMs) {{used in the}} Low Energy Demonstrator Accelerator (LEDA) at Los Alamos is described.

Lessons learned from this system will, in turn, be used on the next mappers that are currently being designed for 15 cm and 2. 5 cm BPMs. BACKGROUND We have implemented several BPM characterization systems for previous projects at Los Alamos. The first system we fielded was a basic “taut-wire ” fixture whereby a wire antenna was stretched through the BPM between two parallel plates mounted on micrometer-driven X-Y linear stages. The antenna was driven at the accelerating cavity frequency while the signals at the output ports were monitored with a power meter and manually recorded as the stages incrementally translated the antenna across the aperture. Some of the drawbacks to this system were: 1) A high chance for error in the manual positioning of the stages and data recording of the outputs of all four ports for each increment.

60|$|At the lapse of {{the space}} of time which we have noticed, a shrill whistle, like that with which a {{falconer}} calls his hawk, was heard to ring sharply through the vaulted chapel. It was a sound ill suited to the place, and reminded Sir Kenneth how necessary it was he should be upon his guard. He started from his knee, and laid his hand upon his poniard. A creaking sound, as of a screw or pulleys, succeeded, and a light streaming upwards, as from {{an opening in the}} floor, showed that a trap-door had been raised or depressed. In less than a minute a long, skinny arm, partly naked, partly clothed in a sleeve of red samite, arose out of the aperture, holding a lamp as high as it could stretch upwards, and the figure to which the arm belonged ascended step by step {{to the level of the}} chapel floor. The form and face of the being who thus presented himself were those of a frightful dwarf, with a large head, a cap fantastically adorned with three peacock feathers, a dress of red samite, the richness of which rendered his ugliness more conspicuous, distinguished by gold bracelets and armlets, and a white silk sash, in which he wore a gold-hilted dagger. This singular figure had in his left hand a kind of broom. So soon as he had <b>stepped</b> from the <b>aperture</b> through which he arose, he stood still, and, as if to show himself more distinctly, moved the lamp which he held slowly over his face and person, successively illuminating his wild and fantastic features, and his misshapen but nervous limbs. Though disproportioned in person, the dwarf was not so distorted as to argue any want of strength or activity. While Sir Kenneth gazed on this disagreeable object, the popular creed occurred to his remembrance concerning the gnomes or earthly spirits which make their abode in the caverns of the earth; and so much did this figure correspond with ideas he had formed of their appearance, that he looked on it with disgust, mingled not indeed with fear, but that sort of awe which the presence of a supernatural creature may infuse into the most steady bosom.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place, I remarked that {{all sorts of}} quadrupeds are just as much {{at home in the}} promenades of the town, as the {{inhabitants}} themselves, a fact that I make no doubt has some very proper connection with that principle of equal rights on which the institutions of the country are established. In the second place, I could not but see that their dwellings are constructed on the very minimum of base, propping each other, as emblematic of the mutual support obtained by the republican system, and seeking their development in height for the want of breadth; a singularity of customs that I did not hesitate at once to refer to a usage of living in trees, at an epoch not very remote. In the third place, I noted, instead of entering their dwellings near the ground like men, and indeed like most other unfledged animals, that they ascend by means of external <b>steps</b> to an <b>aperture</b> about half-way between the roof and the earth, where, having obtained admission, they go up or down within the building, as occasion requires. This usage, I made no question, was preserved from the period (and that, too, no distant one), when the savage condition of the country induced them to seek protection against the ravages of wild beasts, by having recourse to ladders, which were drawn up after the family into the top of the tree, as the sun sank beneath the horizon. These steps or ladders are generally of some white material, in order that they may, even now, be found in the dark, should the danger be urgent; although I do not know that Bivouac is a more disorderly or unsafe town than another, in the present day. But habits linger in the usages of a people, and are often found to exist as fashions, long after the motive of their origin has ceased and been forgotten. As a proof of this, many of the dwellings of Bivouac have still enormous iron chevaux-de-frise before the doors, and near the base of the stone-ladders; a practice unquestionably taken from the original, unsophisticated, domestic defences of this wary and enterprising race. Among a great many of these chevaux-de-frise, I remarked certain iron images, that resemble the kings of chess-men, and which I took, at first, to be symbols of the calculating qualities of the owners of the mansions--a species of republican heraldry--but which the brigadier told me, on inquiry, were no more than a fashion that had descended from the custom of having stuffed images before the doors, {{in the early days of}} the settlement, to frighten away the beasts at night, precisely as we station scarecrows in a corn-field. Two of these well-padded sentinels, with a stick stuck up in a fire-lock attitude, he assured me, had often been known to maintain a siege of a week, against a she-bear and a numerous family of hungry cubs, in the olden times; and, now that the danger was gone, he presumed the families which had caused these iron monuments to be erected, had done so to record some marvellous risks of this nature, from which their forefathers had escaped by means of so ingenious an expedient.|$|R
