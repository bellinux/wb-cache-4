40|$|The {{ring core}} method is a {{well-known}} technique for residual stress measuring. It consists of milling a circular ring around the point of interest and measuring the surface deformations of the core. The method is more sensitive than hole drilling, but its sensitivity decreases with depth to become null when ring depth is equal to {{one third of the}} diameter. To overcome this problem, in literature an incremental version of the technique has been proposed consisting of removing the core, re- installing the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>rosette</b> and re-performing the measurement. Although the idea is interesting, its practical implementation is quite difficult, in particular re-installing the rosette is almost impossible when depth becomes significant, thus the incremental measurement is never performed.

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} are {{a well-known}} technical problem because they {{add to the}} stress field induced by external loads, thus causing mechanical components to fail at a load level significantly lower than expected.

40|$|Residual {{state of}} stress in {{structural}} materials affect positively or negatively behaviour of component parts. The goal of this scope is not to deal with possible process of creating residual stresses neither about elimination of residual stress, but is focused how to determine magnitude of residual stress by hole-drilling method. We need to know magnitude and direction (angular orientation) of principal stresses to determine how residual {{state of stress}} affects behaviour of specimen. The most widely used modern technique for measuring residual stresses is hole-drilling strain-gage method. Hole-drilling method is in scope of this paper and is restricted only for measuring uniform residual stresses of steel specimens with finite dimensions. Structural, linear, elastic and isotropic material model is used with material properties = 0, 3 and E= 2, 1 [10]^ 5 MPa. For correct application of this method we need to determine calibration coefficients “a“ and “b“ first. These coefficients are used to determine magnitude and direction of residual stresses in specific depth and diameter of drilled hole for materials with finite dimensions. Geometry and shape of model is simply represented by block with planar faces. Note that numerical determination of calibration coefficients is useful only for one type of <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>rosette</b> RY 61 S. Main goals of this thesis are motivation and request to clearly report effectiveness, accuracy and applicability of calibration coefficients in relation to thickness of specimen, dimensions of drilled hole, condition of “through” or “blind” hole and number of drilled increments. High quality and accuracy of created numerical model is necessary too. Numerical simulation of residual stresses by MKP {{needs to be done}} to obtain requested results. All results are presented by 3 D, 2 D graphs and tables and compared with analytical results or results from other authors. Although is this publication focused on numerical modeling using FEM, hole-drilling method has many significant restrictions. The most substantial of them is influence of eccentricity of drilled hole, creation of stress concentration near drilled area and subsequent plastification, influence of geometrical inaccuracy of hole, etc. All these aspects have significant influence of determining calibration coefficients and can not be included into numerical simulation. These problems are closely discussed in background research. All obtained results should be helpful for practical use of calculated calibration coefficients to determine uniform residual stresses of specimens with various thickness and drilled hole. All these results are also applicable only for one type of <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>rosette,</b> which is RY 61 S...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Residual {{stresses}} are {{an integral}} part of the total stress acting on any component in service. It is important to determine and/or predict the magnitude, nature and direction of the residual stress to estimate the life of important engineering parts, particularly welded components. This work aims to introduce experimental models to predict residual stresses in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). These models specify the effect of laser welding input parameters on maximum residual stress and its direction. The process input variables considered in this study are laser power (1. 03 - 1. 368 kW), travel speed (26. 48 – 68. 52 cm/min) and focal point position (- 1 to 0 mm). Laser butt-welding of 304 stainless steel plates of 3 mm thick were investigated using a 1. 5 kW CW CO 2 Rofin laser as a welding source.

In this work, the shear modulus (G-modulus) and shear strength of this material were determined with the Iosipescu shear test and the Asymmetric-Four-Point-Bend shear test (AFPB test) at room temperature.

40|$|When {{the blind}} hole {{drilling}} method is used to evaluate high residual stresses in a metallic component, plastic relaxed strain can be produced in the hole region because of the stress concentration that causes the local stresses to reach yielding. By assuming a linear-elastic behaviour of the material, a significant error can result. The present paper analyses {{the phenomenon of the}} plasticity locally induced by the introduction of the hole and proposes a procedure to take into account its effects on the residual stress evaluation. The correcting procedure has been developed by elaborating a large database of elastic-plastic finite element analyses performed considering a wide range of material properties and testing parameters, including all the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>rosettes</b> commonly used. As plasticity induces non-linearity in the relationship between residual stress and relaxed strain, the superposition principle cannot be applied, so the correction is limited to uniform in-depth residual stress fields. However, four hole depths were considered and the related correcting procedures were provided. When variable through thickness residual stress is expected, and high residual stress is confined near the surface region, the correction procedure can be applied to an initial limited depth...|$|R
40|$|Open {{die forged}} 7050 {{aluminum}} alloy has residual stresses {{that can be}} measured by the hole-drilling method following standard ASTM E 837 - 01. Weber Metals (Paramount, CA) assumes that the stress is uniform throughout the thickness of an open die forged plate. Four different stress relieved 7050 aluminum samples were tested to confirm if the measurements by the hole-drilling method at {{the surface of a}} plate is indicative of the stress throughout. The different stress relief methods included: two water quenched samples at temperature ranges of 60 °- 90 °F and 120 °- 130 °F and two samples plastically deformed by forging at room temperature 1 % and 3 %. For accurate measurements, a <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>rosette,</b> CEA- 06 - 062 UL- 120, was applied to the samples and drilled with a RS- 200 Milling Guide by Micro-Measurements. The final three microstrain values at the depth of 0. 100 inches were tabulated by the P 3 Strain Indicator and Recorder. The strains were then converted into stresses following equations provided by the standard. Before drilling into samples, the method was calibrated with a plate that had a known low level of residual stress between 0 - 2 ksi. Testing confirmed the residual stress to be 0. 65 ksi. Each sample was tested and results confirmed the residual stress to be non-uniform through the cross-section of the forged plates. The two water quenched samples had residual stress in tension at the surface; the two plastically deformed samples had residual stress in compression at the surface. There were no trends for either type of sample for residual stress variation from the surface to the center. Overall, the 3 % plastically deformed sample would be the recommended residual stress reducing method before machining...|$|E
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} focused on the {{non-contact}} and efficient strain measurement using the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method, which employs the tracking of random speckle pattern for accurate measurement of displacements on a surface of an object undergoing deformation. Specifically, a more efficient DIC algorithm was successfully developed, implemented, and validated. This thesis consists of five parts related to the novel DIC algorithm: (a) the development and implementation, (b) the numerical verification, (c) the experimental validation, for tensile loading, by comparing to the deformation measurements using the strain gauge technique, (d) the investigation of a novel atomization process to reproducibly generate the speckle pattern for accurate tracking, and (e) the analysis of the error sources in the DIC measurements. Specifically, the DIC algorithm was used to exemplarily examine the mechanical properties of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) used in skeletal reconstruction. In the DIC algorithm, images of an object are captured as it deforms. Nonlinear optimization techniques are then used to correlate the speckle {{on the surface of the}} objects before and after the displacement. This optimization process includes a choice of suitable initial displacement values. The more accurate the estimation of these initial displacement values are, the more likely and the more efficient the convergence of the optimization process is. The thesis introduced a novel, fuzzy logics based processing technique, approximation of the initial values of the displacement for initializing iterative optimization, which more accurately and efficiently renders the displacements and deformations as results. The mathematical formulation of the novel algorithm was developed and then successfully implemented into MATLAB programming language. The algorithmic verification was performed using computer-generated images simulating rigid body displacements and uniform tensile deformations. Specifically, the rigid motion images simulated (1) displacements of 0. 1 - 1 pixel for the rigid body translation, (2) rotation angles of 0. 5 - 5 ̊ for rigid body rotation and (3) large tensile deformations of 5000 - 300000 µɛ, respectively. The verification processes showed that the accuracy of the novel DIC algorithm, for the simulated displacement types and levels above 99 %. The experimental validation was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the novel technique under realistic testing conditions. Normalized PMMA specimens, in accordance to ASTM F 3087, were produced, inspected and subjected to tensile loading until failure. The deformation of the specimen surface was measured using (a) the novel DIC, and (b) <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>rosette</b> techniques. The mean maximum force and ultimate strength of four specimens were 882. 2 ± 108. 3 N and 49. 3 ± 6. 2 MPa, respectively. The mean ultimate deformation from the gauge and DIC groups were 15746 ± 2567 µɛ and 19887 ± 3790 µɛ, respectively. These large deformations are common in polymeric materials, and the DIC technique has thus far not been investigated for large deformation. The relative mean error of the DIC measurement, in reference to those of the strain gauge technique, was found to be up to 26. 0 ± 7. 1 %. Accordingly, the mean Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of strain gauge measurement were 3. 78 ± 0. 07 GPa and 0. 374 ± 0. 02, and of the DIC measurements were 3. 16 ± 0. 61 GPa and 0. 373 ± 0. 08, respectively. The increasing difference of the DIC strain measurements relative to those of the strain gauge technique is likely related to the gradual distortion of the speckle pattern on the surface of the tensile specimen. Subsequently, a Correction Factor (CF) of 1. 27 was introduced to correct for the systematic error in the deformation measurements of the DIC group. The corrected ultimate deformation of the DIC measurements became 15712 ± 357 µɛ with the relative mean error of - 0. 5 ± 7. 1 %, if compared to those measurements of the strain gauge techniques. Correspondingly, the mean Young's Modulus and Poisson's ratio of the DIC and of the strain gauge measurements became 3. 8 ± 0. 4 GPa and 0. 368 ± 0. 025, respectively. Using an atomization process, paint speckles were reproducibly generated on the surface of an object. A factorial design of experiments was used to investigate the speckle pattern (grey value distribution and gradient) for the DIC measurement accuracy. Specifically, nine different speckle patterns were generated using the atomization process and tested for rigid body translation and rotation. The results showed the relative mean errors among the nine speckle patterns varied from 1. 1 ± 0. 3 % to - 6. 5 ± 3. 6 %. The preferred speckle pattern, which was characterized by a wide range of sharp speckle and of grey values, produced a mean error of 1. 1 ± 0. 3 %. The analysis of errors and relating sources in the DIC measurement was conducted. Three categories of sources including algorithmic sources, processing parameters sources (subset size, number of pixels computed) and physical environment sources (specimen uniformity, speckle pattern, self-heating effect of the CCD camera and lens distortion of the camera, non-linearity error in strain gauge circuit) were investigated and discussed. Finally, the solutions were provided in order to help reduce the systematic and random errors relating to the aforementioned three categories of sources for errors. In conclusion, a novel DIC algorithm for a more accurate approximation of the initial guess and accordingly for an efficient and accurate convergence of the optimization was successfully formulated, developed, implemented and verified for relatively large deformations. The experimental validation surprisingly showed a systematic error of the DIC measurements, if compared to the measurements of the strain gauge technique. The larger the deformation applied to the specimen, the larger the error gradually became. Therefore, the gradual distortion of the speckles on the surface of the object was likely the underlying cause of the error. The error was systematic and therefore corrected. The atomization process allowed generating reproducible speckles on the surface of an object. Using the DIC measurements, the mechanical behavior of polymers, undergoing large deformations, such as polymethyl methacrylate used in skeletal reconstruction can be investigated and, once understood, the knowledge gained can help develop more effective materials...|$|E

The current paper summarises the results of investigations on the magnitude and distribution of residual stress in these weld clad components, undertaken using different techniques including X-ray diffraction, and incremental centre hole drilling based on both <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>rosettes</b> and electronic speckle pattern interferometry. Results confirm the presence of tensile residual stress when cladding with Inconel 625 beyond the initial clad profile and compressive residual stress when cladding with 17 - 4 PH steel. The complementary nature of XRD and hole drilling techniques is highlighted with considerations regarding the weld clad profile and stress distribution with depth. Modelling of residual stress induced by weld cladding using a thermal transient analysis is presented. Simplification of the weld cladding process is shown to provide good correlation with experimentally measured residual stress. Complexities in modelling material behaviour and hence accurate prediction of residual stress are discussed. Chemical composition of the weld into the heat-affected zone and substrate is presented for both weld clad materials, highlighting the effects of alloying and diffusion on chemical composition.

However, from early studies to recent contributions most of the interest {{has been focused on}} the reduction of strength related to plasticity associated with moisture uptake, interfacial weakening, etc. Much less {{attention has been paid to}} variations of elastic constants, which influence both the stiffness of the joint and the distribution of stresses. The goal of this study was to measure the effects of a humid and warm environment on tensile strength, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of a two-component epoxy adhesive, Henkel Hysol 3425. The measurements have been carried out on bulk specimens of dogbone shape, instrumented with two-grid (axial/transverse) <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>rosettes</b> and tested in tension. The conditions of exposure, generated in a climatic cabinet, were 100 % relative humidity and 50 °C. To relate the exposure time to the moisture uptake, the weight of the specimens was monitored. It has been noticed that most of the water uptake occurs in the first week of exposure; however, at progressively slower rate, the phenomenon is noticeable almost until the fourth week and then saturation is achieved. Over the same period, the mechanical properties decay as moisture uptake continues; at the end, the loss in strength is about 75 % whilst for the elastic moduli the loss is approximately 20 %. No clear evidence is found about the Poisson's ratio, which exhibits a non-monotonic behaviour: stable in the early weeks, then increasing and decreasing of a few per cent.

Stainless steel bars {{measuring}} 3 -inch wide by 1 / 8 -inch thick were welded along all the corner edges, except the outer radius edges, where the bars were bolted to plates 1, 2, 13 and 14. The buttons were then knocked out. Nine <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>rosettes</b> were mounted on the model. Three rosettes were placed at various locations on along the bottom or inner radius side. Each rosette was centered in a gap between two absorber plates. The same pattern was duplicated on the opposite side.

The last rosette was placed on the bottom or inner radius of the model, in the first gap. The included graphs plot stress intensity versus load applied for each of the nine rosetts, and for all three load cases. The stress curves are linear in all cases, except for the rosettes mounted on the unwelded straps, where buckling did occur. The maximum stress occurring in the model was between plate 14 and the ground plate on the side near the inner radius. Maximum allowable bending stress for 304 stainless is 18000 psi. Maximum stress seen by the model in this test is 13, 554 psi, which represents a 25 % overload condition. Deflection curves are linear as well, and all three cases are nearly identical. Gap measurements taken before loading and at 5000 lbs, and 10000 lbs, showed no appreciable difference...|$|R
40|$|The {{correlation}} {{is presented}} of the static loads testing and {{finite element modeling}} for the fiberglass pedestal used on the Atmospheric Emission Photometric Imaging (AEPI) experiment. This payload is to be launched in the space shuttle {{as part of the}} ATLAS- 1 experiment. <b>Strain</b> <b>gauge</b> data from <b>rosettes</b> around the highly loaded base are compared to the same load case run for the Spacelab 1 testing done in 1981. Correlation of the model and test data was accomplished through comparison of the composite stress invariant using the expected flight loads for the ATLAS- 1 mission. Where appropriate, the Tsai-Wu failure criteria was used {{in the development of the}} key margins of safety. Margins of safety are all positive for the pedestal and are reported...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} welding {{residual}} stress (WRS) would {{be harmful to}} safety and intensity of pressure vessel. X-ray stress analyzer (XRSA) {{can be used to}} non-destructively quantitative analyze WRS. In this study, stress changes of constant stress beam in loading process were tested using <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> (SG), <b>strain</b> <b>rosette</b> (SR) and XRSA, and their test results were compared to analyze measurement errors of XRSA. It was found that the property of XRSA meets the experimental requirement. The machining stress in surface of welding test plate could be completely removed after 4 min electrolytic polishing under 1 A current and 100 % NaCl electrolyte. The WRS of welding test plate was tested by XRSA after machining stress completely removed, and its distribution along vertical welding seam direction corresponded with theory calculation. Furthermore, XRSA as a non-destructive method will be more used to study WRS of pressure vessel, so these results can provide scientific basis for the studying...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} fiber-optic <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> {{is capable}} of measuring strains in the approximate range of 0 to 50 microstrains with a resolution of 0. 1 microstrain. (To some extent, {{the resolution of the}} <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> can be tailored and may be extensible to 0. 01 microstrain.) The total cost of the hardware components of this <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> is less than $ 100 at 2006 prices. In comparison with prior <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> capable of measurement of such low <b>strains,</b> this <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> is more accurate, more economical, and more robust, and it operates at a higher update rate. <b>Strain</b> <b>gauges</b> like this one are useful mainly for measuring small strains (including those associated with vibrations) in such structures as rocket test stands, buildings, oilrigs, bridges, and dams. The technology was inspired by the need to measure very small strains on structures supporting liquid oxygen tanks, as a way to measure accurately mass of liquid oxygen during rocket engine testing. This improved fiber-optic <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> was developed to overcome some of the deficiencies of both traditional foil <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> and prior fiber-optic <b>strain</b> <b>gauges.</b> Traditional foil <b>strain</b> gages do not have adequate signal-to-noise ratios at such small <b>strains.</b> Fiber-optic <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> {{have been shown to be}} potentially useful for measuring such small strains, but heretofore, the use of fiberoptic <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> has been inhibited, variously, by complexity, cost, or low update rate...|$|R
