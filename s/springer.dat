5|$|In 2000, The Kennel Club {{registered}} 424 Welsh <b>Springer</b> Spaniels, {{compared with}} 12,599 English <b>Springer</b> Spaniels and 13,445 English Cocker Spaniels. Numbers remained steady, with 420 Welsh <b>Springer</b> Spaniels being registered in 2004, however numbers of English <b>Springer</b> Spaniels increased to 14,765 and English Cocker Spaniels to 16,608. Numbers remain {{closer to the}} American Cocker Spaniel which registered 610 in 2000, and 599 in 2004. The breed remains more popular than some other breeds of Spaniel, including the Clumber Spaniel, Field Spaniel, Sussex Spaniel and Irish Water Spaniel. Total registrations in the UK during 2016 fell to 299 qualifying it to be included on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 1992, Reagan was {{assaulted}} by an anti-nuclear protester during a luncheon speech while accepting an {{award from the}} National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas. The protester, 41-year old Richard Paul <b>Springer,</b> smashed a 2-foot-high (60cm) 30-pound (13.5kg) crystal statue of an eagle that the broadcasters had given the former president. Flying shards of glass hit Reagan, {{but he was not}} injured. Using media credentials, <b>Springer</b> intended to announce government plans for an underground nuclear weapons test in the Nevada desert the following day. <b>Springer</b> was the founder of an anti-nuclear group called the 100th Monkey. Following his arrest on assault charges, a Secret Service spokesman could not explain how <b>Springer</b> got past the federal agents who guarded Reagan's life at all times. Later, <b>Springer</b> pled guilty to reduced charges and said he hadn't meant to hurt Reagan through his actions. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor federal charge of interfering with the Secret Service, but other felony charges of assault and resisting officers were dropped.|$|E

5|$|The Norfolk Spaniel or Shropshire Spaniel is an extinct {{breed of}} dog {{since the early}} 20th century. It was {{originally}} thought to have originated {{from the work of}} one of the Dukes of Norfolk, but this theory was disproven after being in doubt during the later part of the 19th century. The term was used to designate <b>springer</b> type spaniels that were neither Sussex nor Clumber Spaniels, and attempts were made to use it to specify a breed that would later become known as the English <b>Springer</b> Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh <b>Springer</b> Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{and a member}} of the spaniel family. Thought to be {{comparable}} to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English <b>Springer</b> Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh <b>Springer</b> Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English <b>Springer</b> Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.|$|E
