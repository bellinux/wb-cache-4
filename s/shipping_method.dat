Needless to say, the BC Express did a brisk business that season, often grossing $12,000 on a single trip. She was the only sternwheeler to offer freight and passenger service to the general public, as the Operator and Conveyor were strictly used for hauling their own workers and supplies needed for rail construction.

5000|$|THG {{redefined the}} manner in which the PC Warez Scene worked when they entered the scene in 1989. Prior to THG, warez {{releases}} were haphazard, with multiple groups releasing the same title, usually after the title had been available in retail stores for weeks. Often games were released to BBSes without being cracked. THG changed this by releasing titles days before the software made it to retail chains such as Babbage's. They did this by establishing relationships with the major wholesale software distributors, and ordering games with overnight shipping. For those cases where overnight shipping wasn't enough, THG found people who lived near the software companies, who could go to the company, and buy the game the day it was released. This beat the overnight <b>shipping</b> <b>method</b> by 2 days in most cases. Also, an advantage that they possessed was that most other warez groups were run by teens, who attended school during the day. THG was run by professional men, who were available each day [...] "by 10:30" [...] when FedEx, or UPS delivered. The other groups had to [...] "wait until they got home" [...] in the afternoons. A decided advantage considering most [...] "cracks" [...] were done in less than an hour, and releases complete shortly thereafter.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of the Commonwealth of Virginia’s ban on direct wine {{shipments}} from out-of-state sellers on wine prices and variety available to consumers in the greater McLean, Virginia area. Our results indicate that Virginia’s direct shipment ban reduces the varieties of wine available to consumers and prevents consumers from purchasing some premium wines at lower prices online. Using a sample of 83 wines judged to be “highly popular ” in Wine and Spirits magazine’s annual restaurant poll, we find that 15 percent of wines available online were not available from retail wine stores within 10 miles of McLean during the month the data were collected. The fact that local wine stores may not carry certain wines may result, in part, from other Virginia regulations that affect the structure of the wholesale market. We also find that the lowest quoted online price offered significant cost savings over the lowest local retail price in our survey for many types of wine during the month the data were collected. The extent of any cost savings depends on the price per bottle, the quantity of wine ordered, and the <b>shipping</b> <b>method</b> chosen. For wines costing $ 20 /bottle or more, online purchase of a 12 -bottle case could save, on average, 13 percent if shipped via ground. Average savings of up to 21 percent are available on a 12 -bottle case of wines costing more than $ 40 /bottle, and purchasers of these wines can save money regardless of the <b>shipping</b> <b>method.</b> Such savings, however, are not consistent for all types of wine; for bottles costing less than $ 20, consumers would pay an additional 8 - 83 percent per bottle online. In addition, some individual wines priced below $ 40 were less expensive in local retail stores...|$|E
40|$|There {{are three}} main factors {{affecting}} {{the stability of}} a palletized load that is unitized by a stretch wrapping mechanism. These factors include the type of unitized load, wrapping configuration and <b>shipping</b> <b>method.</b> The wrapping configuration is determined {{on the basis of}} the type of unitized load and <b>shipping</b> <b>method.</b> For this study, the aforementioned components were referred to as the package, the product, and the distribution environment. These components come together to make up a stretch wrapping system. The package corresponds to the stretch wrap film that is packaging the unitized load and pallet. The product corresponds to the goods placed on the pallet to be packaged by the stretch wrapper. The distribution environment corresponds to the hazards that the packaged product will encounter in transit. This study was designed to observe and understand the interactions between each of the components of the stretch wrap system. Prior to stretch wrapping a pallet of product, the film is elongated or pre-stretched. The elastic nature of the stretch wrap forces the film to conform around the palletized load. It is hypothesized that the film force that the stretch wrap applies to the palletized load contributes to improved load containment. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the existence of a correlation between percentage pre-stretch to change in film force and load containment. For the study, a range of pre-stretched unitized loads were subjected to ISTA 3 E distribution testing. Simultaneously the film force was monitored during the period of distribution testing. Subsequent to distribution testing, the load dispersion was quantified. The data obtained from this test suggested that there is no correlation between percentage pre-stretch and change in film force or load containment. The study also compared three methods of calculating pre-stretch: the marking wheel procedure, tapeless measure, and film cut and weigh. It was found that the most consistent method was the marking wheel procedure, followed by the cut and weigh procedure, and the tapeless measure procedure...|$|E
