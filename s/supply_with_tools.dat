As part of the study by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) sponsored by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to investigate the development and/or prospects of biotechnology tools as applied to animal science research in Nigeria, a survey aimed at assessing biotechnology capacity of Nigeria for animal research was conducted between June and July 2004. The survey used a structured questionnaire, interviews and personal visits to some universities, polytechnics and national research institutions situated in strategic locations in Nigeria.

5000|$|The gunfight at Morenci was {{the bloodiest}} shootout in the town's history {{and when it}} was over Chacon was taken to jail and his gang members were either killed or in hiding. First Chacon was put in the Clifton Jail and then he was sent to Solomonville to face the court for the murder of Pablo Salcido. Judge Owen T. Rouse sentenced Chacon to hang on July 24, 1896, but his case was appealed on May 26, after the bandit pleaded innocent. Chacon claimed he would never kill his friend, who he had worked with years before as cowboys. For this, Chacon was moved to Tucson to await the Supreme Court's decision, but they affirmed the lower court's ruling and he was sent back to Solomonville to be hanged on June 18, 1897. However, on June 9, Chacon escaped from his jail cell once again. R. Michael Wilson says that the [...] "jails walls were ten inches of adobe with a double layer of two inch pine boards held {{together}} with five inch nails." [...] Wilson says that if Chacon dug his way through the walls it would have created a lot of noise so the guards were suspected of [...] "turning a deaf ear." [...] Author Jan Cleere contradicts this though and says that some fellow prisoners played guitars and sang to cover up the sounds. Marshall Trimble agrees with Cleere, but also says that a young Mexican woman distracted the jailer by seducing him. Either way, Chacon was free again and he fled back across the border into Sonora. Nobody ever discovered how Chacon was <b>supplied</b> <b>with</b> <b>tools</b> for his escapes, though, according to Cleere, visiting friends probably gave them to him one at a time. According to William MacLeod Raine, Chacon went to Mexico and enlisted in the Rurales, but, after a year and a half, he had a dispute with another soldier and returned to banditry.|$|R

60|$|It was, perhaps, {{about two}} in the morning when a man, very {{efficient}} at the trade which he was then following, knelt outside Lady Eustace's door, and, with a delicately-made saw, aided, probably, by some other equally well-finished tools, absolutely cut out that portion of the bedroom door on which the bolt was fastened. He must have known the spot exactly, for he did not doubt a moment as he commenced his work; and yet there was nothing on the exterior of the door to show where the bolt was placed. The bit was cut out without the slightest noise, and then, when the door was opened, was placed, just inside, upon the floor. The man then with perfectly noiseless step entered the room, knelt again,--just where poor Lizzie had knelt as she said her prayers,--so that he might the more easily raise the iron box without a struggle, and left the room with it in his arms without disturbing the lovely sleeper. He then descended the stairs, passed into the coffee-room at the bottom of them, and handed the box through an open window to a man who was crouching on the outside in the dark. He then followed the box, pulled down the window, {{put on a pair of}} boots which his friend had ready for him; and the two, after lingering a few moments in the shade of the dark wall, retreated with their prize round a corner. The night itself was almost pitch-dark, and very wet. It was as nearly black with darkness as a night can be. So far, the enterprising adventurers had been successful, and we will now leave them in their chosen retreat, engaged on the longer operation of forcing open the iron safe. For it had been arranged between them that the iron safe should be opened then and there.
