5|$|Malawi is {{a member}} of several {{international}} organisations including the Commonwealth, the UN and some of its child agencies, the IMF, the World Bank, the African Union and the World Health Organization.

5|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>Africa</b> {{consists}} of many cave sites, {{most of which}} show very punctuated starts and stops in stone tool technology. Research in <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> has been continuous and quite standardized, allowing for reliable comparisons between sites in the region. Much of the archaeological evidence for the origins of modern human behavior is traced back to sites in this region, including Blombos Cave, Howiesons Poort, Still Bay, and Pinnacle Point.|$|E
50|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>Africa’s</b> land {{is already}} over cropped and over-grazed {{as a result}} of Africa’s undistributed lands. With the {{combination}} of alien plants and the exhaustion of their lands, <b>Southern</b> <b>Africa’s</b> degraded land is beyond repair.Many countries use the method of irrigation as a way to prevent desertification and droughts. Unfortunately, only 4% of Sub-Saharan Africa is equipped for irrigation. With the decrease in rainfall, and the lack of irrigation, <b>Southern</b> <b>Africa’s</b> land and soil will soon become arid.|$|R

5|$|In 2014, Malawian {{scientists}} had the third-largest output in <b>Southern</b> <b>Africa,</b> {{in terms of}} articles catalogued in international journals. They published 322 articles in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index expanded) that year, almost triple the number in 2005 (116). Only South Africa (9,309) and the United Republic of Tanzania (770) published more in <b>Southern</b> <b>Africa.</b> Malawian scientists publish more in mainstream journals – relative to GDP – {{than any other country}} of a similar population size. This is impressive, even if the country's publication density remains modest, with just 19 publications per million inhabitants catalogued in international journals in 2014. The average for sub-Saharan Africa is 20 publications per million inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|In a {{different}} study, tissue and bone samples of 32 lion specimens in museums were used. Results indicated that lions form phylogeographic groups, one each in North Africa / Asia, West Africa, eastern Sahel, south-eastern Africa and south-western Africa.

5|$|African {{elephants}} {{were listed}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2008, with no independent {{assessment of the}} conservation status of the two forms. In 1979, Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0million. By 1989, the population {{was estimated to be}} 609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, 110,000 in eastern Africa, 204,000 in <b>southern</b> <b>Africa,</b> and 19,000 in western Africa. About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in Zambia, Mozambique and Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa. Conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0%. Due to the vast areas involved, assessing the total African elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork. The IUCN estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012.|$|E

Although this was originally set up as a syndicate with other members of his family (particularly his brothers William and John Molteno), he soon shared his discoveries and influenced many other shipping companies to install refrigeration chambers on their vessels. Nonetheless, in the ensuing decades it was his two youngest brothers, Edward and Harry Molteno, who eventually took over most of <b>southern</b> <b>Africa's</b> export fruit industry.|$|R

However, there is a low density of elands in Africa due to poaching and human settlement.|$|E
