5|$|A man, Cutter (Pablo Coffey), visits an {{open house}} viewing, where he is given a tour by the estate agent, and <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> an {{interest}} in the bedroom of a young girl. That night, the owners have returned home, and are settling down for the evening when their daughter, Patricia, begins screaming. Later, a security guard for the family's alarm company finds the bodies of the parents hacked to death on the first floor, but Patricia is nowhere to be seen.|$|E
5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} a sacramental rather than {{educational}} purpose. Such a large, lavish Gospel {{would have been}} left on the high altar {{of the church and}} removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass, with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text. It is significant that the Chronicles of Ulster state the book was stolen from the sacristy, where the vessels and other accoutrements of the Mass were stored, rather than from the monastic library. Its design <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> this purpose in mind; that is, the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text. Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above. The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page. In general, nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page: aesthetics were given priority over utility.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{the double}} burden is more evolved with the times {{concerning}} both sexes and their newfound roles. The role of a provider and caregiver is sometimes expected of women, but as more women enter the workforce, an 'independent' ideology <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> effect and forces some women to decide between a career and family. Some may choose strictly one or the other, others may choose to carry the burden of both lifestyles. Some [...] "modern men tend {{to believe in the}} principle of equal sharing of domestic labor, but fail to actually live up to that belief." [...] The constant tug of war regarding one's time and where it could, should but will be spent creates a new speed bump that is a little bit higher than the previous ones. Modern times illuminate the dilemma that many dual-income couples face when trying to reconcile unpaid domestic work and paid employment. The burden of encompassing both ideologies plays a toll on both sexes in today's societies.|$|E
500|$|The {{strain of}} {{this seems to}} have gotten to Phips {{in a way that}} so many {{previous}} seemingly insurmountable challenges had not. In January 1693, Phips was involved in an embarrassing and unseemly physical altercation with his subordinate captain in the royal navy, Richard Short. Their accusations against each other in letters to Whitehall follow the standard lines of the Tarpaulin vs. Gentleman. Short is called a drunk, corrupt, unwilling to withstand hardships or obey direct orders. His lieutenant captain is accused of cowardice. Phips, as usual, is accused of having only a carpenter's education, poor manners, disregarding standard procedure (reminiscent of the journal of Knepp). [...] Phips pick for a replacement captain, Dobbins, is accused of the same. Phips is also accused of corruption, which was a standard charge, and a standard problem for colonial leadership at this time, but Phips having traded silver for paper after the fiasco of Quebec, and building his own ship to chase pirates in Maine, <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the teeth out of this accusation.|$|E

500|$|In {{reaction}} to the opening musical number about Terri Schiavo, Schiavo's brother, Bobby Schindler, Jr., said, [...] "My family was astonished at the cruelty and bigotry towards our beloved sister, and all disabled people that we witnessed in this show. My first thought was how this attempt at satire must have been enormously difficult and painful for my mother." [...] He continued, [...] "The depiction of Terri in the Family Guy episode on March 21 is not only inaccurate, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the position that certain people are simply not worthy of receiving medical care because they are viewed as burdens {{on the health care}} system." [...] In addition, Schindler has also stated that he hopes to soon enlist the aid of other advocacy groups to protest the episode, [...] "and perhaps see some sponsors end support of the show." [...] Other pro-life activists, including Jill Stanek, wrote of the opening, [...] "Last night's episode of Family Guy opened with a truly shocking scene [...] This is the same television series that had an abortion episode canceled in August 2009. Creator Seth MacFarlane's goal is [...] get buzz by being offensive." ...|$|E
500|$|The solar Eye's {{volatile}} {{nature can}} make her difficult even for her master to control. In {{the myth of}} the [...] "Distant Goddess", a motif with several variants, the Eye goddess becomes upset with Ra and runs away from him. In some versions the provocation for her anger seems to be her replacement with a new eye after the search for Shu and Tefnut, but in others her rebellion <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place after the world is fully formed. Dimitri Meeks and Christine Favard-Meeks interpret these events as the Eye's reaction to being deceived by Ra after her slaughter of humanity, whereas Carolyn Graves-Brown sees it as a later elaboration of the myth related in the Book of the Heavenly Cow. With the solar Eye gone, Ra is vulnerable to his enemies and bereft of a large part of his power. The Eye's absence and Ra's weakened state may be a mythological reference to solar eclipses. Moreover, it may be part of a larger motif in Egyptian myth in which a god's Eye is lost and then restored with the help of another deity. This motif also applies to the Eye of Horus, which in the Osiris myth is torn out and must be returned or healed so that Horus may regain his strength.|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of The New York Times called Chopra the series' [...] "strongest human asset": [...] "She is {{immediately}} charismatic and commanding." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly called Quantico the best Shonda Rhimes drama that Rhimes never touched and wrote that [...] "Chopra's {{bound to be}} a breakout star." [...] Rob Lowman of the Los Angeles Daily News enjoyed the show and Chopra's performance, saying: [...] "Although a bit over-frenetic at times, the series <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> inspiration from a man-on-the run Hitchcock thriller. Only in Quantico's case it's a woman, and they have a charismatic star in Chopra. I was immediately struck by her dynamic screen presence. So far it’s one of the most-promising new shows, and Chopra is someone worth keeping an eye on." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter, in a lukewarm review, found its pilot [...] "just good enough to make you watch another." [...] Although TheWrap's Tim Grierson wrote that the show [...] "provides sexy fun", [...] "For a show about highly trained, incredibly intelligent agents, Quantico often succumbs to lame-brained plotting and a less-than-convincing portrayal of its specialized milieu. This new show's fluffy, which doesn’t fit so well with the darker, somber tones meant to be struck by the introduction of a cataclysmic terrorist attack." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone in 2000, Anthony DeCurtis {{praised the}} song for its musical {{demonstration}} of [...] "the sweet satisfactions of faith". On a triple album where [...] "nearly every song is excellent", AllMusic picks [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] {{as one of}} five standout tracks (or AMG track picks), with Richie Unterberger writing of its autumnal theme: [...] "It's the kind of song that fits the mood in November, when the trees are getting stripped bare of their leaves, the days are getting shorter and colder, {{and you have to}} resign yourself to knowing it's going to be tougher and tougher in those regards for months, also knowing that those hardships will pass away come springtime." [...] In his book on Harrison, subtitled A Spiritual Biography, Gary Tillery refers to the song as [...] "magisterial" [...] and a [...] "majestic title track" [...] that [...] "leaves even the shallowest listener contemplative". Michael Gallucci of Ultimate Classic Rock places [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] third on his list of Harrison's best solo songs (behind the two hit singles from All Things Must Pass, [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and [...] "What Is Life"), and comments: [...] "The album's title track takes on more poignancy after Harrison's death , but it's always been great." [...] Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham similarly describes the song as [...] "a heart-rending piece of significant prescience which <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on more poignancy with every passing year".|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{was one of}} Hollywood's most {{respected}} character actors; Hutchinson described him as [...] "one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars". Yet for Hutchinson, Steiger remained [...] "out of sympathy with Hollywood" [...] during his career, believing that accomplished actors often struggle to find challenging films as they got older. Steiger was an [...] "effusive talent" [...] according to Lucia Bozzola of The New York Times, and was particularly noted for his intense portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters. After On the Waterfront (1954), Steiger became somewhat typecast for playing tough characters and villains, and grew increasingly frustrated playing the [...] "Mafia heavy or a near-psychopath" [...] during the 1970s, roles which he could play menacingly, but provided little opportunity for him to showcase his talent. Gossip columnist Louella Parsons hailed him as [...] "the Screen's No.1 Bad Man", while the newspaper London Evening News referred to him as [...] "the man you would love to hate {{if you had the}} coverage". A 1960 publication by Dean Jennings of The Saturday Evening Post referred to Steiger as an [...] "angry, hot-tempered newcomer of prodigious acting talents, [...] works best only at emotional white heat", and remarked that he found it [...] "stimulating to carry theatrical fantasy into his private life". Pauline Kael found his performances so powerful that she believed he [...] "often <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over a picture even when he isn't in the lead". The journal Films and Filming, surveying his career in 1971, noted that his talent [...] "developed steadily through films good and bad", and that the secret of his success was that he stayed grounded, citing a 1956 interview where he said [...] "I pity the player who can't keep his feet on the ground. It's too easy to trade on success and forget that no performer can stand still." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Patient X" [...] the eighth most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show, citing, in particular the abuse of Dmitri. The article noted that [...] "If The X-Files has taught us anything, it’s that if a G-Man asks us if we know anything about anything and we foolishly say yes, our mouths and eyelids will be sewn shut {{and we will be}} brainwashed to kill on demand." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Patient X" [...] a B+, and wrote that the episode [...] "feels epic, in a way the mythology episodes do at their best". However, VanDerWerff noted that [...] "The problem with breaking the status quo on a TV series is that your audience is always going to know in the back of its head that the status quo isn’t really broken." [...] He reasoned that the audience never fully believed that [...] "Mulder could lose his belief in the all-consuming alien conspiracy" [...] or accept the idea that [...] "Scully could find herself dabbling with belief in [...]" [...] Despite these set-backs, however, he noted that [...] "Patient X" [...] was the episode where the series' mythology [...] "gets moving again, after chasing its own tail throughout much of season four and reaching a sort of climax in the opening episodes of season five." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two described the tone of [...] "Patient X" [...] as [...] "truly visceral", citing the faceless men incinerating people as well as the mutilation of the innocent Dmitri, who was [...] "at {{the wrong place at the}} wrong time". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised the episode for [...] "shift the goalposts" [...] and allowing Mulder and Scully to switch roles as the believer and skeptic. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's premise and writing. [...] "'Patient X' is a rare episode in that it actually advances The X-Files mythology, with the news of a vaccine to combat the black oil". However, she was critical of the episode's reliance on shock value, noting that the [...] "camera <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a perverse delight in death, pain, and mutilation, with the distressing effect of numbing the viewer to the horror." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gerhard von Rad, in his Old Testament Theology, <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{a middle}} view, {{explaining}} that the patriarch [...] "saga" [...] describes actual events subsequently interpreted by the community through its own experience.

2500|$|Various {{critics also}} found a theme of {{humanity}} within Uglies. Phillip Gough noted that Pretties and Specials (those who worked for Special Circumstances) are “posthuman” because of their operations.

The novel Uglies <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> no definite stance on it, though clearer points are shown in Pretties and Specials, the following books in the trilogy.|$|E
