5|$|In December 1999, President Fernando de la Rúa took office, seeking {{assistance}} from the IMF shortly thereafter. In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion <b>stand-by</b> <b>arrangement</b> with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, The de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to {{the complete loss of}} market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.|$|E

Successive IMF missions have criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items (in good years and bad), over-borrowing from the Central Bank, and slipping on the schedule for privatization and administrative reform. However, in September 2005 Gabon successfully concluded a 15-month <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Arrangement</b> with the IMF. Another 3-year <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Arrangement</b> with the IMF was approved in May 2007.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how exchange rate policies and IMF <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Arrangements</b> affect debt crises using econometrics and {{a comparison between}} Argentina and Brazil. It refines an existing diagram outlining crisis development to propose crisis prevention strategies. Flexible exchange rate policies reduce a country's probability of default by over 4 %, but <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Arrangements</b> increase it by an inconsequential percentage. Unlike Argentina, Brazil avoided a default via a freely-floating exchange rate system, fiscal deficit reduction, and a cooperative and coordinated relationship with the IMF. The results provide policymakers from developing countries with lessons to manage their countries' default risks more effectively...|$|R

50|$|The Republic of Uzbekistan proclaimed its {{independence}} on August 31, 1991 and {{was recognized by}} the United States on December 25, 1991. Uzbekistan has lagged behind other former Soviet states in the pace of its reforms. Both politically and economically, Uzbekistan continues to resemble its former Soviet self. Uzbekistan’s relatively isolated economic position has served to shelter it somewhat from the economic turmoil surrounding in the other NIS countries. In October 1996, the IMF announced a suspension of the <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Arrangement</b> pending the establishment of corrective measures “consistent with the growth and inflation targets of the Uzbek government.” It was only in 1999 and 2000 that the IMF has resumed talks with the Government of Uzbekistan to reinstate the <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Arrangement.</b> This assistance to Uzbekistan comes {{with a number of}} conditions {{on the part of the}} IMF, however, including that Uzbekistan make real progress towards liberalizing its currency exchange and show real progress on economic reform.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the Batlle {{government}} {{signed a}} three-year $1.1 billion <b>stand-by</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), committing {{the country to}} a substantial primary fiscal surplus, low inflation, considerable reductions in external debt, and several structural reforms designed to improve competitiveness and attract foreign investment. Uruguay terminated the agreement in 2006 following the early repayment of its debt but maintained {{a number of the}} policy commitments.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role played by <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Arrangements</b> (SBAs) in the {{resolution}} of financial crises in the 1990 s. It does so by examining these arrangements through a ceremony and ritual approach. This presentation is divided in three parts. The first one reviews the legal nature of SBA as a form of international law. The second analyses SBAs using a ceremony and ritual approach; and the last part review the case of Venezuela...|$|R
50|$|In general, these <b>stand-by</b> <b>arrangements</b> {{have each}} been {{available}} for use for terms of 1-2 years, each valued {{in the range of}} 150 - 2000 SDR (108 million - 1.5 billion USD). Additionally, the Uruguayan government has utilized 72% of funds made available between 2000 and 2006, the last arrangement expiring in December of 2006. As of May 2017, the Uruguayan government owes 380,000 SDR (274,502.88 USD) to the IMF, which represents less than 0.00001% of GDP, standing at 53.44 billion USD as of June 2017.|$|R
25|$|In addition, the IMF negotiates {{conditions}} on lending and loans under their policy of conditionality, {{which was established}} in the 1950s. Low-income countries can borrow on concessional terms, which means there is a period of time with no interest rates, through the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the Standby Credit Facility (SCF) and the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). Nonconcessional loans, which include interest rates, are provided mainly through <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Arrangements</b> (SBA), the Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), and the Extended Fund Facility. The IMF provides emergency assistance via the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to members facing urgent balance-of-payments needs.|$|R
50|$|This period {{coincided with}} the rise to power of General Manuel Noriega during which Panama became {{increasingly}} indebted, by 1986 owing SDR284m (US$360m) to the IMF alone, 278% of their quota. This led to the IMF imposing an adjustment program supported by an IMF <b>stand-by</b> <b>arrangement</b> in 1985-87 whilst the economy recovered somewhat. In 1985 Panama experienced economic recovery with 4.1-percent GDP growth. The corresponding figure for 1986 {{was estimated to be}} 2.8 percent.|$|E
50|$|The IMF <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (SBA) is an {{economic}} program of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) involving financial aid to a member state in need of financial assistance, normally arising from a financial crisis. In return for aid, the economic program stipulates needed reforms in the recipient country aimed at bringing it back on a path of financial stability and economic sustainability. The SBA is a sub-set of IMF and World Bank programs aimed at Structural adjustment.|$|E
50|$|A key {{condition}} of the <b>Stand-by</b> <b>Arrangement</b> has been closure of {{the gap between the}} official and parallel market exchange rates. The Inter Bank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) is closely tied to the official rate. Under IFEM, banks, oil companies, and the CBN can buy or sell their foreign exchange at government-influenced rates. Much of the informal economy, however, can only access foreign exchange through the parallel market. Companies can hold domiciliary accounts in private banks, and account holders have unfettered use of the funds.|$|E
50|$|In {{concert with}} these <b>stand-by</b> <b>arrangements,</b> the Uruguayan {{government}} has been relatively successful in its implementation of a “gradual anti-inflation strategy” started in the 1990s. Inflation has slowed to 9% in 2017, versus 140%. However, that is above the government's goal of 6%. In addition, Uruguay maintains high liquidity of assets. It is speculated by the IMF that economic downturn in neighboring Argentina and Brazil, {{as well as an}} economic slowdown in China, are contributing factors to Uruguay's slowed economic growth. Despite this, Uruguay's heavily utilization of IMF credit has been heavily correlated with it lasting stability in the South American region. Additionally, Uruguay has been able to keep pace or in some cases outperform the GDP growth rate of neighboring Brazil and Argentina.|$|R
50|$|After {{leaving the}} Fund in 1986, Boutros-Ghali was {{appointed}} as Economic Advisor to Egypt's Prime Minister {{and to the}} Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (1986-1993), where he took {{a prominent role in}} negotiating the 1987 and 1991 <b>stand-by</b> <b>arrangements</b> with the Fund and the debt rescheduling agreements with the Paris Club. The reform programs initiated then ushered a turnaround in the Egyptian economy and laid the groundwork for economic reforms that are being pursued to this day. Thereafter, Boutros-Ghali was appointed Minister of State for the Council of Ministers and Minister for International Cooperation (1993-1996), where he continued to be active in overseeing program relationship between Egypt and the Fund. He was subsequently named Minister of State for Economic Affairs (1996-1997). Thereafter he assumed the position of Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade (1997-2001), and later Minister of Foreign Trade (2001-2004).|$|R
5000|$|Rooth, in {{his first}} address to member {{countries}} as Managing Director of the IMF on 11 September 1951, stated that the Fund [...] "sought removal or modification of exchange restrictions and other discriminatory practices" [...] aimed at a freer flow {{of international trade and}} payments. Subsequently, general policy on use of IMF's resources was set forth. This initiated the IMF's policy of drawings in tranches. In 1952, in accordance with the Articles of Agreement, 5 years after the IMF began financial operations, annual consultations with members maintaining exchange restrictions under Article XIV were initiated. The IMF introduced a general framework for <b>Stand-by</b> <b>Arrangements,</b> and the criteria to be applied were standardized. Rooth's term as Managing Director of the IMF ended on 27 April 1956, but he accepted a request by the Executive Board to serve a further period ending on 3 October 1956.|$|R
5000|$|As of October 2012, the IMF has {{approved}} a two-year <b>stand-by</b> <b>arrangement</b> of 405.3 million euro for Bosnia. The IMF loan, approved on September 26, is designed to support Bosnia's economic programme {{for the next two}} years, ease the effects of the [...] "external environment and address domestic structural weaknesses". Bosnia's two autonomous entities will be using the cash from the loan but will not get the whole amount at once. The IMF has enabled an initial disbursement of 60.8 million euro, saying {{that the rest of the}} money will be spread out over two years, after successful quarterly reviews.|$|E
5000|$|IMF’s <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Arrangement</b> {{was created}} in June 1952 to provide {{financing}} to countries requiring help with balance of payments problems. The SBA has often been used by member countries and is the dominant lending instrument of the IMF, especially for emerging market countries. After a significant pause in such aid, the financial crisis that erupted in 2008 resulted in {{a large number of}} countries requiring such financial assistance from the IMF. The financing terms are normally more advantageous than private markets offer. In 2009, the IMF upgraded the SBA [...] "to be more flexible and responsive to members countries’ needs." [...] At the same time, the borrowing limits were doubled and more funds were made available up front. Generally, the [...] "conditions were streamlined and simplified." ...|$|E
5000|$|The UK's main {{concerns}} were the civilians {{caught in the}} conflict zone, humanitarian access and IDP needs. According to Waite Miliband had been [...] "disappointed" [...] that the Sri Lankan government did not allow Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt to join Miliband and Bernard Kouchner when they visited Sri Lanka in April 2009. The British parliamentary delegation which visited Sri Lanka in May 2009 found the conditions in the IDP camps to be [...] "not nearly {{as good as it}} should". Waite claimed India was “ambivalent” on the Sri Lanka issue and did not want [...] "undertake any heavy lifting" [...] because the issue was “too sensitive”. According to Waite the UK government had decided to support the US government in wanting the International Monetary Fund <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (loan) with Sri Lanka to be delayed.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to quantify the relationship between the global economic environment and <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Arrangements</b> (SBAs) with the IMF. The results suggest that oil prices, world interest rates, and the global business cycle are the most influential indicators that affect the number of SBAs being requested. In addition, the empirical model seems to have reasonable accuracy when predicting SBAs. Furthermore, when oil prices, interest rates, and the global business cycle are adversely shocked by one standard deviation, the conditional probability of an SBA nearly doubles, implying an increase from about 6 to 12 SBAs. More critically, the model suggests that even a steady deterioration of the global economic climate would imply increasingly harsher conditions for developing and emerging market countries, which may in turn increase the demand for IMF resources significantly.

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to the literature on the dynamics of change and continuity in the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) policy paradigm. The IMF embarked on a process of “streamlining conditionality” during the 2000 s, but many observers have argued that the IMF's policy paradigm from the 1990 s remains intact. This article examines whether the scope of the IMF's policy advice to borrowers during the Great Recession narrowed in comparison to its advice to borrowers during the heyday of the Washington consensus in the 1980 s and 1990 s. The article uses qualitative content analysis to establish the frequency of a series of policy dialogue indicators in four sample sets of countries requesting IMF <b>stand-by</b> <b>arrangements</b> over three decades. The evidence suggests that contemporary IMF policy advice to borrowers continues to stress the importance of fiscal consolidation, with reduced emphasis on promoting the structural economic reforms associated with the Washington consensus era...|$|R

Also, food and shelter security during a disaster response is achieved through better preparedness. The level of preparedness must include risk assessment, contingency planning, stockpiling of equipment and supplies, emergency services and <b>stand-by</b> <b>arrangements,</b> communications, information management and coordination arrangements between various agencies involved. Discussing these issues would contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the implications of the right to adequate food and shelter, which in complex humanitarian emergencies, is one of the key necessities of the affected population...|$|R

40|$|For {{five years}} after the debt crisis hit in 1982, the IMF’s {{strategy}} was to help countries adjust policies and obtain enough new financing so that they could stabilize and strengthen their economies and eventually be able to service their debts on normal market terms. Normal terms in that context meant the terms on which the debt had been contracted, regardless of changes in circumstances and without allowance for arrears unless authorized through an agreement with creditors. This “financing assurances ” policy came under increasing fire as time passed without a resolution of the crisis. The policy of requiring financing assurances was formalized by the Executive Board in April 1983. (For the full text of this and of the 1980 policy that it modified, see the Appendix to this chapter.) That policy stated that, as a condition for approving a credit arrangement, “the Executive Board would need sufficient safeguards to ensure that the Fund’s resources would be used to support a viable and financeable adjustment program. ” To that end, <b>stand-by</b> <b>arrangements</b> would include “review clauses [...] . linked, if necessary, to the satisfactory outcome o...|$|R
