5|$|Sabo {{then began}} redistributing {{ammunition}} to {{other members of}} the platoon, including stripping ammunition from wounded and dead comrades. As night fell the North Vietnamese refocused their efforts from wiping out the American force to harassing the helicopters that were carrying more than two dozen wounded soldiers. As that was occurring, the remaining platoon from Bravo Company broke through the North Vietnamese lines and relieved the other two platoons while the first medical helicopter arrived and loaded two wounded soldiers under heavy fire. Sabo again <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open and provided covering fire for the helicopter until his ammunition was exhausted. He received several serious wounds under heavy fire by the North Vietnamese while trying to reload. Although mortally wounded, Sabo crawled forward toward the enemy emplacement, pulled the pin of a grenade, and threw it at the last possible second toward an enemy bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy bunker at the cost of Sabo's life. In all, seven {{other members of the}} platoon were killed in this ambush and another 28 were wounded. The North Vietnamese forces lost 49.|$|E
500|$|According to Darryl Dawkins' autobiography, Bavetta was officiating an NBA game {{during the}} mid-1970s between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets with Earl Strom as his partner for that game. Bavetta {{overruled}} Strom on a crucial last-second personal foul call against the Nets, {{which would have}} been a victory for the 76ers. When the game ended and players were walking to their respective locker rooms, the door to the referees' locker room flew open and Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was allegedly ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom. Strom <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hallway and hollered after Bavetta, [...] "You'll take another one of my fucking calls again, right, you motherfucker?"

2500|$|When Narayanan {{returned}} to India in 1948, Laski {{gave him a}} letter of introduction to Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see {{that it was time for}} me to leave. So I said goodbye and as I left the room I handed over the letter from Laski, and <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E
