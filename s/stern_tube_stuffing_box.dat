5000|$|On a boat {{having an}} inboard motor that turns a shaft {{attached}} to an external propeller, the shaft passes though a <b>stuffing</b> <b>box,</b> also termed a 'stern gland' in this application. The <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> prevents sea water {{from entering the}} boat's hull. In many small fiberglass boats, for example, the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> is mounted inboard near the point the shaft exits the hull. The [...] "box" [...] is a cylindrical assembly, typically of bronze, comprising a sleeve threaded on one end to accept adjusting and locking nuts. A special purpose heavy-duty rubber hose attaches the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> to a <b>stern</b> <b>tube,</b> also called a shaft log, that projects inward from the hull. Marine-duty hose clamps secure the hose to the <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> and the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box.</b> A sound <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> installation is critical to safety because failure can admit a catastrophic volume of water into the boat.|$|R
50|$|A <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> of a {{sailboat}} {{will have a}} <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> that's slightly bigger than the prop shaft. It will also have packing nut threads or a gland nut. The packing is inside the gland nut and creates the seal. The shaft is wrapped by the packing {{and put in the}} gland nut. Through tightening it onto the <b>stern</b> <b>tube,</b> the packing is compressed, creating a seal against the shaft. Creating a proper plunger alignment is critical for correct flow and a long wear life. <b>Stuffing</b> <b>box</b> components are of stainless steel, brass or other application-specific materials.|$|R
50|$|An {{effective}} <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> {{and associated}} bearings were required. The <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> contains the propeller shaft where {{it passes through}} the hull structure. It should provide an unrestricted delivery of power by the propeller shaft. The combination of hull and <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> must avoid any flexing that will bend the shaft or cause uneven wear. The inboard end has a <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> that prevents water from entering the hull along the <b>tube.</b> Some early <b>stern</b> <b>tubes</b> were made of brass and operated as a water lubricated bearing along the entire length. In other instances a long bush of soft metal was fitted in the after end of the <b>stern</b> <b>tube.</b> The Great Eastern had this arrangement fail on her first transatlantic voyage, with very large amounts of uneven wear. The problem was solved with a lignum vitae water-lubricated bearing, patented in 1858. This became standard practice and is in use today.|$|R
40|$|The Hydro-Balanced <b>Stuffing</b> <b>Box</b> is a seal {{assembly}} for polished rod pumping installations commonly used in oil and gas pumping well installations to contain produced well fluids. The improved <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> was developed and patented by Harold H. Palmour of The Palmour Group of Livingston, TX. The <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> is designed to {{reduce the incidence of}} seal leakage and to utilize an environmentally safe fluid, so that if there is any leakage, environmental damage is reduced or eliminated. The unit was tested on two wells at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center. During the test period, the performance of the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> was measured by monitoring the pressure on the tubing and the inner chamber with a Barton Two-pen recorder. The amount of safe fluid consumed, fluid leakage {{at the top of the}} <b>stuffing</b> <b>box,</b> pressure supplied from the nitrogen bottle, ambient temperature, and polish rod temperature was recorded. The <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> is capable of providing a better seal between well fluids an d the environment than conventional <b>stuffing</b> <b>boxes.</b> It allows the polished rod to operate cooler and with lubrication, extending the life of the packing elements, and reducing the amount of attention required to prevent leakage...|$|R

The effect {{that the number of}} bearing segments and water supply grooves has on bearing load capacity is clarified. When there are few segments and the width is wide, the load capacity of <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearing becomes greater. If a relative inclination exists between the propeller shaft and <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearing, the pressure on the bearing stern edge will increase. In this paper, a quantitative evaluation of this pressure is also presented...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 57 In recent years, cooling {{requirements}} for mechanical seals {{have become a}} subject of controversial opinions. While the maximum limiting temperatures of mechanical seals are known and specified by seal manufacturers, the actual temperatures in the sealing cavity of the pump <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> during pump operation are not readily available. A conservative approach has been to provide extra cooling to the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box.</b> However, the availability of clean cooling water is often scarce in many installations, and therefore, knowledge of the thermal behavior of the sealing cavity region becomes important. A developed analytical method, which utilizes the finite element analysis (FEA) technique to determine the thermal behavior of the pump <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> in the sealing region is presented. A single-stage overhung hot water (590 ?F) boiler circulation pump was analyzed. The <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> of the pump described herein the paper was equipped with API plan 23. The developed method {{is not limited to}} a specific API <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> piping plan, but can be used for a variety of cooling/flushing <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> configurations, such as API Plan 2, or others. The values of the heat transfer coefficients used in the method were found iteratively, based on published correlations for natural convection (Nusselt number vs Garashof number) ...|$|R

50|$|Traditional {{sailboat}} transmissions {{consist of}} a simple horizontal output shaft extended rearward from the engine, through the stern via a <b>stuffing</b> <b>box.</b> The saildrive has several advantages over the traditional sailboat transmission: smaller horizontal size, no <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> to maintain, and the propeller is mounted horizontally instead of at a downward angle.|$|R
40|$|To {{respond to}} the recent {{increase}} in container transportation {{and the pursuit of}} higher economic efficiency of ocean transportation, container ships are getting bigger and have higher propulsive power. Due to the increased propulsive power and propeller thrust, the propeller weights and the propeller shaft forces of these ships have become larger than those of past ones. Also the risk of uneven contact and seizure of the <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearings is increasing. Therefore, the <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearing design has become very important. By considering not only propeller weights but also propeller shaft forces for the <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearing designs, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI) offers ships that are free from bearing problems. 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{technology}} {{provides a}} simple yet clever idea for preventing oil and saltwater polluting spills by sucker rod pumping oil wells, {{as well as}} prolonging {{the life of the}} <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> seals and pressure lubricating the polished rod. This objective is accomplished by introducing a non-polluting, food grade, high viscosity lubricant into the void space between two sets of seals in a typical <b>stuffing</b> <b>box.</b> This safe-fluid acts as a sacrificial fluid that will be the fluid that is exposed to the atmosphere when the primary seal in the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> leaks for any reason. In addition, the pressure on this sacrificial safe-fluid is maintained at the same pressure as the pressure on the produced fluid in the flow line at the pumping tee, thereby equalizing the pressure across the secondary seal in the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> that separates the safe-fluid from the produced fluid. The unique feature, of equalizing the pressure across the secondary seal, is accomplished by using a pressure transmitter which is monitoring the pressure in the flow line (which is the fluid under the secondary seal) and transmitting that pressure to the safe-fluid (which is the fluid above the secondary seal) thereby equalizing the pressure across this secondary seal. The primary seal will be sealing the safe-fluid and will be operating under optimum conditions, extending the life of this primary seal. The principle of the invention was proven by equipping eight oil wells with Field Retro-Fit Packages of Independent component parts to hydro-balance the existing <b>stuffing</b> <b>boxes...</b>|$|R

The synthesis of these practical and experimental results confirmed that nonlinear friction-induced vibration was due to a subtle balance of negative damping at lower speeds or viscous friction at higher speeds.
