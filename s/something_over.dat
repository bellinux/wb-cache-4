5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push <b>something</b> <b>over</b> the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
5|$|D'Erlon's men {{ascended the}} slope and {{advanced}} on the sunken road, Chemin d'Ohain, that ran from behind La Haye Sainte and continued east. It was lined {{on both sides}} by thick hedges, with Bylandt's brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On {{the right of the}} French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the 45e Régiment de Ligne and followed by the 25e Régiment de Ligne, somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the 21e and 45e regiments. Opposing them {{on the other side of}} the road was Pack's 9th Brigade consisting of three Scottish regiments: the Royal Scots, the 42nd Black Watch, the 92nd Gordons and the 44th Foot totaling <b>something</b> <b>over</b> 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.|$|E
25|$|She also {{suggests}} video games can have social benefits for children, for example, video games {{can provide a}} topic of discussion and <b>something</b> <b>over</b> which children can bond, and can help children make friends; playing video games can increase a child's self-esteem when they are struggling in one aspect of their life, but {{are able to do}} something correctly in a video game; and, children can also learn to take on leadership roles within a multi-player online game. Christopher Ferguson, a psychologist well known for his video game research, conducted a study in which results suggest that violent games reduce depression and hostile feelings in players through mood management.|$|E

25|$|First, Marius had to {{deal with}} the Teutones, who were in the {{province}} of Narbonensis marching toward the Alps. He refused to give them a battle where they wanted, and withdrew to Aquae Sextiae (a settlement founded by Gaius Sextius Calvinus in 124 BC), which blocked their path. The leading contingent of the Germanic warriors, the Ambrones, foolishly attacked the Roman position without waiting for reinforcements and 30,000 were killed. Marius then hid 3,000 troops in ambush, so when the main Germanic contingent finally attacked, the hidden Roman troops could fall on them from behind. In the ensuing defeat, the Teutones were completely annihilated, to the number of <b>something</b> <b>over</b> 100,000.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy {{may result}} from rape. The rate varies between {{settings}} and depends particularly {{on the extent to}} which non-barrier contraceptives are being used. A study of adolescents in Ethiopia found that among those who reported being raped, 17% became pregnant after the rape, a figure which is similar to the 15–18% reported by rape crisis centres in Mexico. A longitudinal study in the United States of over 4000 women followed for 3 years found that the national rape related pregnancy rate was 5.0% per rape among victims aged 12–45 years, producing over 32,000 pregnancies nationally among women from rape each year. Experience of coerced sex at an early age reduces a woman’s ability to see her sexuality as <b>something</b> <b>over</b> which she has control.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} was {{opened to the}} public on January 9, 1854. Hours were fixed at 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. For January no books were available, but visitors were welcome. On February 1, use of books began. The library was closed on Sundays and established holidays. It was a reference library: no books could be taken from the building for any purpose. Admission was free for all persons over 14 years of age. On opening day, the {{building was}} stocked with between 80,000 and 90,000 volumes, purchased {{at a cost of about}} $100,000. The section on American history was full as possible. In linguistics, particularly oriental, the library was unsurpassed by any in the United States. The natural sciences were also fully represented, comprising about 7,000 volumes. Cogswell had made his first trip abroad for purchase of books in the winter of 1848–1849, spending <b>something</b> <b>over</b> $20,000. The distracted political state of Europe at the time seemed to offer peculiar advantages for purchases at low rates. Before he sailed, Cogswell reported that during Astor's lifetime he had paid $2,500 for books.|$|E

500|$|The encyclical, however, did allow {{extrinsic}} {{interest to}} be charged, stating that [...] "legitimate reasons arise to demand <b>something</b> <b>over</b> {{and above the}} amount due on the contract" [...] as long as those reasons are [...] "not at all intrinsic to the contract." [...] The Holy Office would later expand upon these extrinsic justifications for interest in 1780 and 1784 to include [...] "compensation" [...] for the hazards and delays of repayment. The encyclical also did not prohibit profit from non-lending investment.|$|E
500|$|Nor did they, being [...] "decidedly stale", {{according}} to the Nottinghamshire Guardian, having [...] "been indulged in all manner of festivities", and without centre-forward Jimmy Logan, who had scored a hat-trick in the Cup Final. Small Heath were decisive victors by three goals to nil, Hallam's wing play drawing particular praise, as did Jenkyns' [...] "admirable captaincy". The attendance was <b>something</b> <b>over</b> 8,000, of whom 6,800 paid on the day, generating gate receipts of £200. Although the result was rather overshadowed by Aston Villa beating Burnley away from home to be confirmed as First Division champions, the Dart clearly appreciated how Small Heath [...] "in a blaze of glory before the largest crowd ever seen at Coventry Road, gave the English Cup holders a licking".|$|E
500|$|Speaking to The Times {{about the}} ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the {{collaborative}} writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: [...] "Everybody on the show thinks they can put in good jokes, despite the fact that Ben Elton and I think there are already quite a few good ones in there to start with. It does usually end up funnier, but it's time to do <b>something</b> <b>over</b> which I have more control." [...] Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that: [...] "They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script...sometimes we would just say to them [...] "if you stood up and tried to act this script out, you would find out things about it." [...] Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.|$|E
5000|$|Stantons {{favorite}} {{big league}} at-bat came on September 6, 2010, against Roy Oswalt in Philadelphia. Stanton {{thought he had}} struck out on a foul tip, but the catcher dropped the ball. On the next pitch, he hit a 435-foot home run. [...] "That (home run) I really liked, because thats what made me grow", Stanton said. [...] "I thought I struck out; I was a little flustered. You learn that when <b>somethings</b> <b>over</b> with, you move on. I did that pretty quick right there." ...|$|R

500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she felt much more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, you do a little <b>something</b> <b>over</b> here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' I raise my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E
500|$|The Abbasid army, {{following}} the reforms of al-Mu'tasim, was a {{smaller and more}} professional fighting force than the caliphal armies of the past. Although it proved effective militarily, it also posed a potential danger to {{the stability of the}} Abbasid regime: drawn from Turks and other peoples from the Caliphate's periphery and the lands beyond, it was alienated from the society of the Caliphate's heartlands, with the result that the soldiers were [...] "entirely reliant on the state not just for cash but for their very survival" [...] (Hugh Kennedy). As a result, any failure by the central government to provide their pay resulted in a military uprising and a political crisis, as had been repeatedly demonstrated during the Anarchy at Samarra. Consequently, ensuring the regular payment of the army became the prime task of the state. According to Hugh Kennedy, based on a treasury document from the time of al-Mu'tadid's accession, [...] "out of the total expenditure of 7915 dinars per day, some 5121 are entirely military, 1943 in areas (like riding animals and stables) which served both military and non-military and only 851 in areas like the bureaucracy and the harem which can be described as truly civilian (though even in this case, the bureaucrats’ main purpose seems to have been to arrange the payment of the army). It seems reasonable to conclude that <b>something</b> <b>over</b> 80 per cent of recorded government expenditure was devoted to maintaining the army." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1843 the Republic of Texas sent another force into New Mexico {{to retaliate}} for {{the capture of}} the Texan Santa Fe Expedition and Mexican attacks on Texas. This force, with <b>something</b> <b>over</b> 200 men, {{defeated}} a New Mexican advance party. Armijo, camped [...] away with 500 men, [...] "fled in terror" [...] on hearing the news. He then resigned his position as military commander and in the following year, the governorship, [...] "claiming ill health".|$|E

From beneath a false patch set into the left pocket of his shirt Bunker took a bit of red cloth. Solemnly he gave Ausmus part of it and put the rest back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Process {{morphology}} (dynamic morphology) describes and {{analyzes the}} dynamic continuum of plant form. According to this approach, structures {{do not have}} process(es), they are process(es). Thus, the structure/process dichotomy is overcome by [...] "an enlargement of our concept of 'structure' so as to include and recognize that in the living organism it {{is not merely a}} question of spatial structure with an 'activity' as <b>something</b> <b>over</b> or against it, but that the concrete organism is a spatio-temporal structure and that this spatio-temporal structure is the activity itself." ...|$|E

[...] About half of these were expelled from Lydda and Ramle on 12 through 14 July. Morris says that expulsion orders were given for both towns, the one for Ramle calling for [...] "sorting out of the inhabitants, and send the army-age males to a prisoner-of-war camp". [...] "The commanders involved understood that what was happening was an expulsion rather than a spontaneous exodus." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1882 Stearns built a {{house for}} the family {{at the corner of}} Washington Avenue and Fourth Street in Ludington at a cost of <b>something</b> <b>over</b> $6,000, a large sum for the time. In 1898 Stearns bought out the {{extensive}} lumber operation of Thomas R. Lyon and formed Stearns Salt & Lumber Company and Stearns Salt Block company. It soon became a large company in Ludington with [...] of lumber output annually and 300,000 barrels of salt yearly. He soon became one of the top businessmen in the state of Michigan. In 1893 he formed Flambeau Lumber Company in Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin, with Fred Herrick. In 1894 he started Stearns Lumber Company in Odanah, Wisconsin.|$|E
2500|$|By 1989, Wentworth Woodhouse {{was in a}} poor {{state of}} repair.

[...] The house was bought by locally born businessman Wensley Grosvenor Haydon-Baillie, who started a programme of restoration. However a business failure caused it to be repossessed by a Swiss bank and put back {{on the market in}} 1998. Clifford Newbold (July 1926 – April 2015), an architect from Highgate, bought it for <b>something</b> <b>over</b> £1.5million. Newbold progressed with a defined programme of renovation/restoration as evidenced in Country Life magazine dated 17 and 24 February 2010.

2500|$|The {{usage of}} saudade as a theme in Portuguese music {{goes back to}} the 16th century, the golden age of Portugal. Saudade, as well as love suffering, is a common theme in many villancicos and cantigas {{composed}} by Portuguese authors; for example: [...] "Lágrimas de Saudade" [...] (tears of saudade), which is an anonymous work from the Cancioneiro de Paris. Fado is a Portuguese music style, generally sung by a single person (the fadista) along with a Portuguese guitar. The most popular themes of fado are saudade, nostalgia, jealousy, and short stories of the typical city quarters. Fado and saudade are intertwined key ideas in Portuguese culture. The word fado comes from Latin fatum meaning [...] "fate" [...] or [...] "destiny". Fado is a musical cultural expression and recognition of this unassailable determinism which compels the resigned yearning of saudade, a bitter-sweet, existential yearning and hopefulness towards <b>something</b> <b>over</b> which one has no control.|$|E
