5|$|The DX {{structural}} motif is {{the fundamental}} building block of the DNA origami method, {{which is used to}} make larger two- and three-dimensional structures of arbitrary shape. Instead of using individual DX tiles, a single long scaffold strand is folded into the desired shape by a number of <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> strands. When assembled, the scaffold strand is continuous through the double-helical domains, while the staple strands participate in the Holliday junctions as crossover strands.|$|E
25|$|Combing {{straightens}} the fibres, isolates {{the long}} ones (tops) for spinning and discards the short ones (noil). There are {{various types of}} combing machines here, including the French comb, the Lister comb and the Holden comb. The Noble comb {{was the most popular}} as it would comb long, medium and fairly <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> wool, but the slivers needed special preparation in a punching machine beforehand.|$|E
25|$|The {{ginned cotton}} fibre, known as lint, is then {{compressed}} into bales which are about 1.5 m tall and weigh almost 220 kg. Only 33% {{of the crop}} is usable lint. Commercial cotton is priced by quality, and that broadly relates to {{the average length of}} the staple, and the variety of the plant. Longer staple cotton (2½ in to 1¼ in) is called Egyptian, medium staple (1¼ in to ¾ in) is called American upland and <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> (less than ¾ in) is called Indian.|$|E
50|$|A staple knocker {{is a tool}} {{resembling}} a screwdriver, used for removing staples and shredded material. It is called a knocker because a hammer {{can be used to}} hit the end of it and remove long lines of <b>shorter</b> <b>staples.</b>|$|R
50|$|Long draw is the {{spinning}} technique {{used to create}} woolen yarns. It is spun from carded rolags. It is generally spun from <b>shorter</b> <b>stapled</b> fibers. Long draw spun yarns are light, lofty, stretchy, soft, and full of air, thus they are good insulators, and make good knitting yarns.|$|R
50|$|Twist {{is needed}} in yarn to hold the fibres together, and is added in both the {{spinning}} and plying processes. The amount of twist varies on the fibre, thickness of yarn, preparation of fibre, manner of spinning, and the desired result. Fine wool and silk generally use more twist than coarse wool, <b>short</b> <b>staples</b> more than long, thin more than thick, and short drawn more than long drawn.|$|R
25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> wools. The slivers of wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of the comb circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to the comb circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in the comb circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|E
2500|$|Cotton became {{dominant}} in the lower South after 1800. [...] After {{the invention of the}} cotton gin, <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> cotton could be grown more widely. [...] This led to an explosion of cotton cultivation, especially in the frontier uplands of Georgia, Alabama {{and other parts of the}} Deep South, as well as riverfront areas of the Mississippi Delta. [...] Migrants poured into those areas in the early decades of the 19th century, when county population figures rose and fell as swells of people kept moving west. [...] The expansion of cotton cultivation required more slave labor, and the institution became even more deeply an integral part of the South's economy.|$|E

5000|$|Government-sponsored {{workshops}} {{target the}} tourist and [...] "official delegation gift" [...] markets, but the wools have <b>short</b> <b>staples</b> and make carpets {{that are more}} likely to shed fluff and become matted after cleaning. A popular design is the [...] "Potala" [...] rug, featuring a picture of the Potala Palace and intended to be hung on the wall. Carpet workships founded by foreigners use wool with longer staple lengths and high lanolin content, which make for a stronger content, but are much more expensive, and have not found much success. However, as an economic activity, Tibetan rug making provides valuable cash income for rural communities who weave in the winter months. Several overseas investors and NGOs are trying to encourage a revival of high quality local wool and natural dyes in Tibetan rug making.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop a one-third scale model of full-size (prototype) metal-plate-connected (MPC) wood truss joints using similitude theory. The prototype metal connector plates in MPC joints were modeled using thin galvanized sheet metal and <b>short</b> <b>staples.</b> Truss grade wood material was ripped to one-third scale dimensions to be used as the modeling material. Prototype tension splice joints were modeled with 48, one-quarter inch staples embedded in each model connection with each pair of prototype teeth approximated by a single staple tooth. Heel joints were modeled with 60, one-quarter inch staples embedded in each model heel joint connection. The remaining truss connections were developed from projections based on tension splice joint and heel joint designs. To provide verification of the model material properties, a modulus of elasticity (MOE) study was performed that compared prototype and one-third scale model boards. The results indicated that although the variation in MOE of the model was 11...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{measured the}} effects of type of supplementary feed, lambing time and number of off-spring reared on the wool grown by grazing ewes and weight of lambs at birth and weaning. Two groups of 95 winter-lambing ewes were compared: one group was fed a canola meal-based pellet for six weeks {{before the start of}} lambing and {{the first two weeks of}} lambing; the other was fed a similar amount of lupins over the same period. Feeding the canola meal pellets resulted in increased staple strength in the ewes that lambed during the first cycle, a later point of break in the wool but increased lamb mortality. The later lambing ewes had higher staple strength, broader fibre diameter and greater staple length. Lambs born later were heavier at birth but lighter at weaning. Ewes that reared one or two lambs produced less wool with <b>shorter</b> <b>staples</b> and lower clean wool yield than dry ewes. Ewes rearing two lambs had lower staple strengths than dry ewes or those rearing one lamb...|$|R

The treatments included single applications of 1 / 2 - and 1 -pint rates and multiple applications of 1 / 8 - and 1 / 4 -pint rates. Because of the exceptionally good growing season with lots of early heat units, both short- and long-staple plants set fruit early, which limited their vegetative growth naturally {{without the need for}} FIX. Yields were high with lint production over 1800 and 1400 pounds of lint for <b>short</b> and long <b>staple,</b> respectively. Plant mapping also was performed on each treatment...|$|R

40|$|Synthetic {{peptides}} {{derived from}} the heptad repeat (HR) of fusion (F) proteins {{can be used as}} dominant negative inhibitors to inhibit the fusion mechanism of class I viral F proteins. Here, we have performed a stapled-peptide scan across the HR 2 domain of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein with the aim to identify a minimal domain capable of disrupting the formation of the postfusion six-helix bundle required for viral cell entry. Constraining the peptides with a single staple was not sufficient to inhibit RSV infection. However, the insertion of double staples led to the identification of novel <b>short</b> <b>stapled</b> peptides that display nanomolar potency in HEp- 2 cells and are exceptionally robust to proteolytic degradation. By replacing each amino acid of the peptides by an alanine, we found that the substitution of residues 506 to 509, located in a patch of polar contacts between HR 2 and HR 1, severely affected inhibition. Finally, we show that intranasal delivery of the most potent peptide to BALB/c mice significantly decreased RSV infection in upper and lower respiratory tracts. The discovery of this minimal HR 2 sequence as a means for inhibition of RSV infection provides the basis for further medicinal chemistry efforts toward developing RSV fusion antivirals...|$|R
40|$|A four-by-four {{factorial}} experiment {{was performed on}} the Safford Agricultural Center to determine if CaZn, Foliar Triggrr or Soil Triggrr would cause increases in lint yields on <b>short</b> or long <b>staple</b> cotton. Four levels of PIX were used to see if there would be any interaction between PIX and the other materials. The results in 1989 showed that CaZn and the Trier products did not increase yields, the levels of PIX did not increase yields and there was no interaction between them. Very favorable weather conditions and good crop management kept plants from growing vegetative and prevented crop stress, thus reducing the opportunity for the plant growth regulators to increase yields.
