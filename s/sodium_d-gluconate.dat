40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [21073151, 21173177, 50731004, 21021002]The {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} reinforcing steel in simulated concrete pore solutions {{with and without}} corrosion inhibitors was studied by electrochemical techniques and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A combined inhibitive effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>D-gluconate,</b> Na 2 MoO 4 and thiourea on restraining the corrosion of reinforcing steel immersed in the solution was observed. This result showed {{that there was a}} synergetic effect among the three agents in corrosion prevention. After adding the compound inhibitor (750 mg. L- 1 <b>sodium</b> <b>D-gluconate,</b> 250 mg L- 1 Na 2 MoO 4, 500 mg. L- 1 thiourea) into the simulated concrete pore solution containing 3. 5 % (w) NaCl, the inhibition efficiency of the compound inhibitor was 94. 5 %. According to the Hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory, the compound inhibitor worked by forming a protective film on the steel surface...|$|E
40|$|The alkalinizing {{effect of}} citrate, acetate, propionate, gluconate, L and DL-lactate were {{compared}} in healthy neonatal calves. The calves were infused for a 3. 5 hour period with 150 mmol/L solutions of the sodium salts {{of the various}} bases. Blood pH, base excess, and metabolite concentrations were measured and the responses compared with sodium bicarbonate and <b>sodium</b> chloride infusion. <b>D-gluconate</b> and D-lactate had poor alkalinizing abilities and accumulated in blood during infusion suggesting that they are poorly metabolized by the calf. Acetate, L-lactate and propionate had alkalinizing effects similar to bicarbonate, although those of acetate had a slightly better alkalinizing effect than L-lactate. Acetate was more effectively metabolized because blood acetate concentrations were lower than L-lactate concentrations. There was a tendency for a small improvement in metabolism of acetate and lactate with age. Sodium citrate infusion produced signs of hypocalcemia, presumably because it removed ionized calcium from the circulation. D-gluconate, D-lactate and citrate are unsuitable for use as alkalinizing agents in intravenous fluids. Propionate, acetate and L-lactate are all good alkalinizing agents in healthy calves but {{will not be as}} effective in situations where tissue metabolism is impaired...|$|R
