Heather Nedohin held a slight lead over Margaretha Sigfridsson, who tried {{to win the game}} in the final end but fell short and tied the game. Jennifer Jones and Mirjam Ott played a back-and-forth game which saw Ott miss a double-takeout attempt for the win, {{allowing}} Jones to steal the point.

50|$|Another {{struggling}} Eastern Conference foe {{would find}} a point off of the Wizards when the Chicago Fire came calling on another rainy Kansas City Saturday night. The club followed their 2010 script perfectly as they outshot the Fire 18-8 (10-6 on net) while holding a commanding double digit corner kick advantage 11-1 but as {{in many of the}} earlier games the Wizards simply could not get the ball around Chicago goal keeper Andrew Dykstra who ended the match with eight saves. Julio Martínez put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute and former US International and Chicagoland native Brian McBride doubled the lead straight out of halftime. Davy Arnaud would have a goal called back and several KC shots hit woodwork before Kei Kamara pulled one back only two minutes after the lead was doubled. Much of the second half would be played in the Wizards final third but the equalizer wouldn't come until Kamara tapped in a deflected shot from Teal Bunbury in the 89th minute, despite increased pressure the homeside would not find a magical stoppage time winner and was forced to live with <b>splitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
50|$|This can be {{improved}} by noticing that a range tree on a set 2-dimensional points can be constructed in O(n log n) time.Let S be a set of n 2-dimensional points. If S contains only one point, return a leaf containing that point. Otherwise, construct the associated structure of S, a 1-dimensional range tree on the y-coordinates of the points in S. Let xm be the median x-coordinate of the points. Let SL be the set of points with x-coordinate {{less than or equal}} to xm and let SR be the set of points with x-coordinate greater than xm. Recursively construct vL, a 2-dimensional range tree on SL, and vR, a 2-dimensional range tree on SR. Create a vertex v with left-child vL and right-child vR.If we sort the points by their y-coordinates at the start of the algorithm, and maintain this ordering when <b>splitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> by their x-coordinate, we can construct the associated structures of each subtree in linear time.This reduces the time to construct a 2-dimensional range tree to O(n log n), which also reduces the time to construct a d-dimensional range tree to O(n logd−1n).|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the prediction accuracy of decision tree models is invariant under any strictly monotone transformation of the individual predictor variables. However, this statement may be false when predicting new observations with values that were not seen in the training-set and {{are close to the}} location of <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>point</b> of a tree rule. The sensitivity of the prediction error to <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>point</b> interpolation is high when <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>point</b> of <b>the</b> tree is estimated based on very few observations, reaching 9 % misclassification error when only 10 observations are used for constructing a split, and shrinking to 1 % when relying on 100 observations. This study compares the performance of alternative methods for split point interpolation and concludes that the best choice is taking the mid-point between <b>the</b> two closest <b>points</b> to <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>point</b> of <b>the</b> tree. Furthermore, if the (continuous) distribution of the predictor variable is known, then using its probability integral for transforming the variable ("quantile transformation") will reduce the model's interpolation error by up to about a half on average. Accordingly, this study provides guidelines for both developers and users of decision tree models (including bagging and random forest) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{first major}} {{difference}} with Aberrant {{is that in}} addition to normal attributes such as Dexterity, Manipulation and Wits, novas have what are called Mega-Attributes. Scores in such attributes may be added as dice every time a character makes a roll using the linked mundane attribute, but Mega-Attributes are much more powerful. Every success rolled using mega attribute dice count as 2 normal successes, and rolling a 10 counts as 3 successes. Alternatively, the scores in a Mega-Attribute may be used to reduce the difficulty on a one for one basis, though never below needing one success. The player can choose each turn which way to use his Mega-Attribute, and can even <b>split</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> between <b>the</b> two ways.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} insertion orders for incremental construction in computational geometry.

We present new insertion orders for Delaunay triangulations based on the concepts of adap-tive curves. More specifically, we explore orders that attempt to <b>split</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> set evenly in the recursive construction of the order. Further, we explore squarified orders that are orders that try to produce subproblems without any bias to one of the coordinate axes.

We perform an experimental evaluation of the orders for incrementally constructing Delau-nay triangulations.

In Glasgow between England and Scotland, the tournament was decided by two Stan Pearson goals which gave England the victory and their half of the trophy.

The geometric constraints on the motions of the robots lead to constraints on points that can be processed simultaneously.
