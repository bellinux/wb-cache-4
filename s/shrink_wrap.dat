Such efforts include installing sand filtration systems for the stores' wastewater. Recycling programs will be aimed at garment hangers, corrugated cardboard, electronics, shopping carts, <b>shrink</b> <b>wrap,</b> construction wastes, carpeting and ceiling tiles and roofing materials. All stores in Oklahoma will be partnered with Oklahoma Gas & Electric to exclusively use wind power for all Target stores {{in order to reduce}} greenhouse gas emissions. Stores nationwide use only LED and fluorescent lights and low-flow restrooms that reduce waste water by 30%. Some Target stores are installing roof gardens or green roofs, which absorb storm water and cut down on surface runoff, mitigate temperature fluctuations and provide habitats for birds. There are currently four green-roof Target stores in Chicago.|$|E

500|$|In July 2008, Apple Inc. {{filed suit}} against Psystar Corporation alleging Psystar sold Intel-based systems with Mac OS X pre-installed and that, in so doing, {{violated}} Apple's copyright and trademark rights and the software licensing terms of Apple's <b>shrink</b> <b>wrap</b> license. That license restricted the use of Mac OS X to Apple computers, and specifically prohibited customers from installing the operating system on non-Apple computers.The case brought the anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking facets of the DMCA into this licensing dispute, with Apple ultimately prevailing and awarded permanent injunctive relief, and the decision affirmed on appeal in 2011. Psystar's appeal asserted copyright misuse as a defense by arguing that Apple's license agreement was an unlawful attempt to extend copyright protection to products that are not copyrightable. The appeals court ruled that Psystar failed to demonstrate [...] "copyright misuse" [...] by Apple because Psystar must show either that the license agreement restricts creativity or that it restricts competition, and that Apple's license agreement does neither.|$|E

500|$|In the US and Canada, {{the cover}} {{did not have}} any logo, but in the European nations, they were sold with Madonna's name and album title on the cover. Heiden {{explained}} in an interview with Aperture magazine that they thought it would be [...] "cool" [...] to use a <b>shrink</b> <b>wrap</b> on the US covers, so that when one took it off, there would only be the photo of Madonna. For the European nations, Warner felt that the name was needed on the cover, as {{they did not want to}} take chance with Madonna's popularity there. The back sleeve and the booklet inside featured the song titles in Heiden's own handwriting. About cropping the image for the cassette and the vinyl versions, Heiden said: [...] "I think the image became more interesting cropped into a square—and at that time we always started with the album cover configuration. It was like she was floating—her clothing was not visible. She took on the appearance of a marble statue—Goddess like. In the vertical cropping you see her leather jacket and the wall, and it becomes more typical, editorial, earthly." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim calls Wallace {{to pitch}} for the CEO {{to invest in}} Athlead. Dwight puts the {{conversation}} on speaker phone, allowing him to hear Wallace first tell Jim his salary {{is going to be}} cut to reflect his part-time status, and then bluntly shoot down the idea of investing in Athlead. Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his professional integrity will not allow him to hire any of them, and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. Afraid they will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one. Being willing to do anything to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate, Jim agrees. However, when Jim announces the decision, Rolf immediately intuits that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat. Dwight's friends storm off to play paintball without him, later sending an e-mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message [...] "Glad you're not here". Clark gets the salesman job. Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her [...] "old deskmate", i.e. Jim. Pam briefly lifts Dwight's spirits by suggesting they [...] "haze the new guy", though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with <b>shrink</b> <b>wrap.</b> It is also hinted that Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the boom mike operator for the documentary crew, has developed a crush on Pam.|$|E

Stiff was known for such unusual promotional activity. As of 2009, a copy of this rare print which still had both stickers and the <b>shrink</b> <b>wrap</b> intact (slit-open or sealed) fetched £200-500, depending on condition.|$|E

[...] Dematerialization has been occurring in the U. S. steel industry where the peak in consumption occurred in 1973 on both an absolute and per capita basis.

Cumulative global GDP or wealth has grown {{in direct proportion to}} energy consumption since 1970, while Jevons paradox posits that efficiency improvement leads to increased energy consumption.

2500|$|Harvesting {{occurs when}} the average size of celery in a field is marketable; due to {{extremely}} uniform crop growth, fields are harvested only once. The petioles and leaves are removed and harvested; celery is packed by size and quality (determined by colour, shape, straightness and thickness of petiole, stalk and midrib length and absence of disease, cracks, splits, insect damage and rot). [...] During commercial harvesting, celery is packaged into cartons which contain between 36 and 48 stalks and weigh up to 60 pounds. Under optimal conditions, celery can be stored for up to seven weeks between [...] Inner stalks may continue growing if kept at temperatures above [...] [...] Shelf life can be extended by packaging celery in anti-fogging, micro-perforated <b>shrink</b> <b>wrap.</b> Freshly cut petioles of celery are prone to decay, which can be prevented or reduced {{through the use of}} sharp blades during processing, gentle handling, and proper sanitation.|$|E

2500|$|Copies {{that have}} never had the white cover pasted onto them, known as [...] "first state" [...] covers, are very rare and command the highest prices. Copies with the pasted-on cover intact above the butcher image are known as [...] "second state" [...] or [...] "pasteovers". Today, pasteover covers that have {{remained}} unpeeled are also becoming increasingly rare and valuable; these can be identified if Ringo's black V-neck shirt from the original cover can be seen through the paste-over {{to the right of}} the trunk lid (in alignment with the word [...] "Today" [...] from the album title). Covers that have had the Trunk cover removed to reveal the underlying butcher image are known as [...] "third state" [...] covers; these are now the most common (and least valuable, although their value varies depending on how well the cover is removed) as people continue to peel second state covers. The most valuable and highly prized first and second state Butcher Covers are those that were never opened and remain still sealed in their original <b>shrink</b> <b>wrap.</b> Since the first documented collector's sale of a mono Butcher cover LP in 1974, which fetched US$457.00, the value of first state mono versions has consistently appreciated, reaching $20,000 in 2006.|$|E
