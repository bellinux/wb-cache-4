5|$|A {{debate on}} whether the {{military}} photos {{should or should not}} be released to the public has taken place. Those supporting the release argued that the photos should be considered public records, that the photos are necessary to complete the journalistic record, and that the photos would prove bin Laden's death and therefore prevent conspiracy theories that bin Laden is still alive. Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American <b>sentiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, Major Robert Anderson, sent {{a request for}} provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists {{as an act of}} war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter, forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist <b>sentiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.|$|E
5|$|Yasui v. United States, 320 U.S. 115 (1943) was a United States Supreme Court case {{regarding}} {{the constitutionality of}} curfews used during World War II when they were applied to citizens of the United States. The case arose out of the implementation of Executive Order 9066 by the U.S. military to create zones of exclusion along the West Coast of the United States where Japanese-Americans were subjected to curfews and eventual removal to relocation centers. This Presidential order followed the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 that brought America into World War II and inflamed the existing anti-Japanese <b>sentiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{had wanted}} to {{organize}} the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this. Pierce was skeptical of the bill, knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North. Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless. It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator Salmon P. Chase and Massachusetts' Charles Sumner, who rallied public <b>sentiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North against the bill. Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase, moves towards Cuba annexation, {{and the influence of}} slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression. The result was a political firestorm that did great damage to Pierce's presidency.|$|E
5|$|Tension between {{whites and}} Chinese {{immigrants}} in the late 19th century American West was particularly high, especially in the decade preceding the violence. The massacre in Rock Springs was the violent outburst of years of anti-Chinese <b>sentiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, but not before thousands of immigrants came to the American West. Most Chinese immigrants to Wyoming Territory took jobs with the railroad at first, but many ended up employed in coal mines owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. As Chinese immigration increased, so did anti-Chinese sentiment from whites. The Knights of Labor, {{one of the foremost}} voices against Chinese immigrant labor, formed a chapter in Rock Springs in 1883, and most rioters were members of that organization. However, no direct connection was ever established linking the riot to the national Knights of Labor organization.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Proclamation of 1763 {{established}} First Nation treaty rights, {{created the}} Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia. St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769. To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration {{at a time}} that the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule. It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British <b>sentiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years prior to the American Revolution.|$|E

5|$|The uprisings were {{supposed}} to be simultaneous, but Học sent a last-minute order to Nhu to postpone action until February 15. The messenger was arrested by the French and Nhu was unaware of the change in schedule. Yen Bay was a military post comprising more than 600 troops in four companies of infantry. These were commanded by twenty French officers and non-commissioned officers. VNQDĐ members had been espousing revolutionary <b>sentiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area for several months and there was considerable tension in the town leading up to the planned mutiny. The nearby village of Sơn Dương in Phú Thọ was a hotbed of preparations, as many of the bombs used by the VNQDĐ were manufactured there. More than 100 bombs were made at the home of Nguyen Bac Dang, who also led the recruitment of villagers in his area. It was there that Nhu prepared a command post to coordinate what would be the centrepiece of the attack, the assaults against Yên Bái and Phú Thọ.|$|E
5|$|In early 1623, Prince Charles, now 22, and Buckingham {{decided to}} seize the {{initiative}} and travel to Spain incognito, to win the infanta directly, but the mission proved an ineffectual mistake. The infanta detested Charles, and the Spanish confronted them with terms that included the repeal of anti-Catholic legislation by Parliament. Though a treaty was signed, the prince and duke returned to England in October without the infanta and immediately renounced the treaty, much {{to the delight of}} the British people. Disillusioned by the visit to Spain, Charles and Buckingham now turned James's Spanish policy upon its head and called for a French match and a war against the Habsburg empire. To raise the necessary finance, they prevailed upon James to call another Parliament, which met in February 1624. For once, the outpouring of anti-Catholic <b>sentiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Commons was echoed in court, where control of policy was shifting from James to Charles and Buckingham, who pressured the king to declare war and engineered the impeachment of Lord Treasurer Lionel Cranfield, by now made Earl of Middlesex, when he opposed the plan on grounds of cost. The outcome of the Parliament of 1624 was ambiguous: James still refused to declare or fund a war, but Charles believed the Commons had committed themselves to finance a war against Spain, a stance that was to contribute to his problems with Parliament in his own reign.|$|E
5|$|Sherman moved {{north to}} Cleveland in 1853 and {{established}} a law office there with two partners. Events soon interrupted Sherman's {{plans for a new}} law firm, as the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854 inspired him (and many other anti-slavery Northerners) to take a more involved role in politics. That Act, the brainchild of Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, opened the two named territories to slavery, an implicit repeal of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Intended to quiet national agitation over slavery by shifting the decision to local settlers, Douglas's Act instead inflamed anti-slavery <b>sentiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North by allowing the possibility of slavery's expansion to territories held as free soil for three decades. Two months after the Act's passage, Sherman became a candidate for Ohio's 13th congressional district. A local convention nominated Sherman over two other candidates to represent what was then called the Opposition Party (later to become the Republican Party). The new party, a fusion of Free Soilers, Whigs, and anti-slavery Democrats, had many discordant elements, and some among the former group thought Sherman too conservative on the slavery question. Nevertheless, they supported him against the incumbent Democrat, William D. Lindsley. Democrats were defeated across Ohio that year, and Sherman was elected by 2,823 votes.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Canadian Confederation in 1867, {{the need}} for {{distinctive}} Canadian flags emerged. The first Canadian flag was that then used as {{the flag of the}} Governor General of Canada, a Union Flag with a shield in the centre bearing the quartered arms of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick surrounded by a wreath of maple leaves. In 1870 the Red Ensign, with the addition of the Canadian composite shield in the fly, began to be used unofficially on land and sea and was known as the Canadian Red Ensign. As new provinces joined the Confederation, their arms were added to the shield. In 1892, the British admiralty approved the use of the Red Ensign for Canadian use at sea. The composite shield was replaced with the coat of arms of Canada upon its grant in 1921 and, in 1924, an Order in Council approved its use for Canadian government buildings abroad. In 1925, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King established a committee to design a flag to be used at home, but it was dissolved before the final report could be delivered. Despite the failure of the committee to solve the issue, public <b>sentiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s was in favour of fixing the flag problem for Canada. New designs were proposed in 1927, 1931, and 1939.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, {{although}} the federalist paradigm envisages a supranational EU which perfectly melted nation {{states in a}} common European pot, Europeanization is a process involving co-existence, co-evolution, and contestation between member states’ domestic systems and the EU (Dyson and Goetz, 2003 : p. 13), and “it can include the transfer of policy from one European country to several other countries” (Radaelli, 2003 : p. 27). Therefore, it is highly possible that contestation prevails over other options in this process if a particular member state becomes a hegemonic core for policy transfer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EU. Especially, {{if one of the}} EU members gets ‘agenda setting power’, it is hardly likely that a Union with heterogeneous 28 members would achieve collective action (Olson, 2002). Thus, contrary to the constructivist assumption, the Europeanization might produce more inequality and national <b>sentiments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> integration process. As an example proving this argument, Germany has emerged as a hegemonic power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of the Eurozone crisis (Bulmer, 2014; Streeck, 2015), and this hegemonic position immediately triggered national <b>sentiments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean members (Hedlund and Aline Regina Alves, 2017).|$|R
