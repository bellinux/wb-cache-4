2500|$|His work Hypnosis and Suggestibility (1933) was a {{rigorous}} {{study of the}} phenomenon, using statistical and experimental analysis. Hull's studies demonstrated emphatically {{once and for all}} that hypnosis is not related to sleep ("hypnosis is not sleep, … it has no special relationship to sleep, and the whole concept of sleep when applied to hypnosis obscures the situation"). His research even goes as {{far as to say that}} hypnosis is the opposite of sleep, because he found that hypnosis gave responses linked to alertness rather than lethargy. [...] In Hull’s research, some of his subjects even felt that hypnotism made their sensitivity and alertness better. [...] In fact, many of Hull’s subjects in hypnotic states did believe that their senses had increased. They genuinely thought their senses were better, but this was never proven to be a significant result.

50|$|The SilEye-Alteino and Anomalous Long Term Effects in Astronauts' Central Nervous System (ALTEA) {{projects}} {{have investigated the}} phenomenon aboard the International Space Station, using helmets similar in nature {{to those in the}} ALFMED experiment. The SilEye project has also examined the phenomenon on Mir. The purpose of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> particle tracks entering the eyes of the astronauts when the astronaut said they observed a LF. In examining the particles, the researchers hoped to gain a deeper understanding of what particles might be causing the LF. Astronauts wore the SilEye detector over numerous sessions while on Mir. During those sessions, when they detected a LF, they pressed a button on a joystick. After each session, they recorded down their comments about the experience. Particle tracks that hit the eye during the time when the astronauts indicated that they detected a LF would have had to pass through silicon layers, which were built to detect protons and nuclei and distinguish between them.|$|E
