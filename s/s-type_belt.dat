40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{reservoirs}} for meteorites is probably the planet-crossing Aten, Apollo, and Amor asteroids. Comparing the spectral characteristics of these two populations {{with each other and}} with the spectra of the main belt asteroids would provide insight into the dynamical processes that deliver meteorites to Earth. One method for obtaining an overview of general relationships in a large spectral data set is the statistical technique of principal components analysis. This technique quantifies general spectral similarities and reprojects the data in a plot of major axes of variation where distance is a measure of relative similarity. A major caveat should be kept in mind, however, spectra are sensitive to particle size and viewing geometry effects, and near Earth asteroids (NEA's) are probably significantly different from main belt asteroids in both these factors. The analysis was restricted to the spectral range of ECAS filters and included 116 meteorite spectra from the Gaffey (1976) survey and 417 asteroids from the Zellner et. al. (1985) survey of which 13 are planet-crossers. Although thirteen asteroids are not much of a sample on which to base conclusions, a few inferences can be drawn from this exercise. First, the NEA spectral characteristics are, on average, more consistent with the spectra of meteorites than are the main belt asteroids. Second, the S-type NEA's tend to be spectrally more similar to the ordinary chondrite meteorites than the main <b>belt</b> <b>S-types.</b> This suggests that the planet-crossing S-types do not represent the spectral range of the main <b>belt</b> <b>S-type</b> population and that the planet-crossing S-types are on average more like the ordinary chondrites than the main <b>belt</b> <b>S-types.</b> Third, the only direct asteroidal ordinary chondrite analog, the Q-type asteroid, 1862 Apollo, plots well within the field of the ordinary chondrite meteorites and represents the most common meteorite fall type. Finally, it is interesting that the planet-crossing asteroids occupy similar PCA space with the general trend of the meteorites while most of the main belt objects are offset from the meteorites in statistical space...|$|R
40|$|Zircon Lu-Hf istopic {{data for}} {{representative}} plutons {{from the five}} granite suites of the New England Batholith indicates a signif-icant Late Proterozoic lower crustal input for all except one of the suites. Earlier published oxygen (O’Neil et al.) and recently pub-lished Li isotopic data (Bryant et al., 2004) {{support the view that}} the two Permo-Carboniferous suites (Bundarra and Hillgrove) are S-type but with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios that are lower than those of Lachlan Fold <b>Belt</b> <b>S-types</b> and that of the three Permo-Triassic metaluminous suites, one, the Clarence River, is an isotopically primitive I-type, one, the Moonbi, is a more evolved I-type and the third, the Uralla, has isotopic and mineralogical characteris-tics transitional between I-type and S-type. New 176 Hf/Hf 177 data from single zircon grains obtained using the methods and elegant correction procedures in Griffin et al. (2000) show that only the Clarence River suite has TDM model ages close to the emplacement ages. Zircon data for the other four suites suggests the crustal component underlying of the New Eng-land Batholith could be as old as Late Proterozoic. The data are consistent with the initiation of the Tasman Fold Belt System, o...|$|R
40|$|Metagranitic orthogneisses are {{abundant}} in the Central Iberian Zone (CIZ). This felsic magmatism has a highly peraluminous composition (A/CNK = 1. 07 - 1. 62) defining a typical S-type granite character, common in crustal thickening environments. The studied Spanish Central System (SCS) orthogneisses yield Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician U-Pb zircon ages (496 to 481 Ma), overlapping with the available literature data (mostly from 477 to 500 Ma). These orthogneisses are intrusive into metasedimentary sequences from the northern CIZ that have been recently dated at about 536 Ma. Late Ediacaran inherited zircons are common in the SCS orthogneisses (10 % to 75 % of the total zircon population). Most inheritance ranges from Neoproterozoic to Late Mesoproterozoic in age (0. 52 to 1. 25 Ga) and shows marked positive [U+ 0510]Hft values (>+ 5). This long period of Proterozoic juvenile input is only recognized in the metasedimentary rocks of the Schist-Greywacke Complex, outcropping in the southern CIZ. The proposed linkage between the southern CIZ metasediments (as sources) and the studied orthogneisses is reinforced by their similar Nd isotopic signatures (from - 2. 81 to - 4. 95) and the highly peraluminous character of the orthogneisses. The intrusion of this felsic magmatism within the northern CIZ, having been generated by melting of the more distal southern CIZ metasediments, together with their recycled crustal origin, suggests crustal thickening of the northern Gondwana margin {{during a period of}} flat subduction. The orthogneisses define a large linear <b>S-type</b> magmatic <b>belt</b> cropping out for over 650 km from central Spain to Galicia. The ~ 35 Ma delay between sedimentation and granite intrusion is a typical time interval for crustal thickening models. This thickening stage evolved toward a passive margin setting, allowing the deposition of the siliciclastic Ordovician series which covered the previous terranes. Minor Floian-aged tholeiitic magmatism, giving rise to scarce metabasite outcrops in the SCS, probably postdates thickening and marks this tectonic change in central Iberia. 24 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Although petrologic, {{chemical}} and isotopic studies of ordinary chondrites and meteorites in general have largely helped establish a chronology {{of the earliest}} events of planetesimal formation and their evolution, there are several questions that cannot be resolved via laboratory measurements and/or experiments only. Here we propose rationale for several new constraints on the formation and evolution of ordinary chondrite parent bodies (and by extension most planetesimals) from newly available spectral measurements and mineralogical analysis of main <b>belt</b> <b>S-type</b> asteroids (83 objects) and unequilibrated ordinary chondrite meteorites (53 samples). Based on the latter, we suggest spectral data {{may be used to}} distinguish whether an ordinary chondrite was formed near the surface or in the interior of its parent body. If these constraints are correct, the suggested implications include that: i) large groups of compositionally similar asteroids are a natural outcome of planetesimal formation and, consequently, meteorites within a given class can originate from multiple parent bodies; ii) the surfaces of large (up to ~ 200 km) S-type main-belt asteroids expose mostly the interiors of the primordial bodies, a likely consequence of impacts by small asteroids (D< 10 km) in the early solar system (Ciesla et al. 2013); iii) the duration of accretion of the H chondrite parent bodies was likely short (instantaneous or in less then ~ 10 ^ 5 yr but certainly not as long as 1 Myr); iv) LL-like bodies formed closer to the Sun than H-like bodies, a possible consequence of radial mixing and size sorting of chondrules in the protoplanetary disk prior to accretion.

40|$|The more mafic S-type granites of the Lachlan Fold Belt {{contain a}} {{distinctive}} assemblage of lithic inclusions of deep crustal origin. Two types predominate, the schistose enclaves and the microgranular enclaves. There {{is also a}} small proportion of fragments of local country rock. All the features of the schistose enclaves are consistent with an origin as lithic restite fragments from the source. Their ubiquity in the mafic S-type granites and absence from both felsic S-type granites and I-type granites, conform with such an origin. The argument that these enclaves are not in chemical equilibrium with the host granite because they do not complement its composition is not valid, since they represent less fertile parts of the source that had different compositions that, as a result, melted to a lesser extent. Models that derived these enclaves from regions of the crust above the zones of partial melting, so that they are not restites, are complex, unnecessary, do not conform with their ubiquity in the more mafic S-type granites, and are not consistent with their chemical compositions. The origin of the microgranular enclaves is controversial. In most S-type granites these enclaves have been recrystallized to a similar mineral assemblage to the host granite with a higher proportion of biotite. In a few places, such material is seen to be forming by recrystallization of material in the core of the enclave, which has the assemblage quartz + calcic plagioclase + orthopyroxene ± cordierite ± biotite with accessory ilmenite, sulfide and apatite. All of the microgranular enclave cores show pseudo-doleritic texture in which calcic plagioclase crystals (3 ̆e An 60) and orthopyroxene crystals project into or are enclosed by quartz. Large plagioclase crystals are zoned, with some core compositions as calcic as An 94. The low Na contents of the microgranular enclaves are not consistent with an igneous origin. We consider that these enclaves were derived by metamorphism of calcareous mudstones or argillaceous limestones. The pseudo-igneous textures result from the presence of a partial melt during metamorphism. An analysis of a calc-silicate lens of upper amphibolite grade from the Wilsons Group of Victoria Land, Antarctica is remarkably similar in composition to the microgranular enclaves from Lachlan Fold <b>Belt</b> <b>S-type</b> granites. We suggest that rocks equivalent to that Group, which is of appropriate age and general composition, were the source rocks for the S-type granites of the Lachlan Fold Belt...|$|R
40|$|The Peninsular Ranges {{batholith}} {{of southern}} California and Baja California, Mexico, is well {{recognized as a}} prime example of an I-type Cretaceous batholith. Often overlooked, however, is a volumetrically significant amount of pre-Cretaceous gneissic granite in the axial zone of the batholith New V-Pb zircon age data confirm that the metaluminous and peraluminous plutonic bodies were emplaced during the middle Jurassic. Also reported in this paper is a Jurassic V-Pb age for a metaluminous (I-type) tonalite-quartz diorite pluton that is spatially related to the peraluminous suites. This result suggests that other unrecognized Jurassic I-type plutons may also be present in the batholith. Within San Diego County, Todd and Shaw (1985) recognized and mapped two suites of strongly deformed gneissic granites and migmatites. One is peraluminous (Harper Creek suite) while the other is transitional between metaluminous and peraluminous (Cuyamaca Reservoir suite). These rocks bear a striking resemblance to deformed and, in places, migmatitic, peraluminous (S-type) examples from the Lachlan fold belt and New England batholith of eastern Australia. The gneissic granite suites are known to extend north along the axial zone of the Peninsular Ranges batholith and cover an area at least 45 kID wide by 150 kID long. To the south, rocks of similar type are known to extend into Baja California, Mexico, for at least 300 kID. Chemical and isotopic studies of these Jurassic suites confirm that they meet the criteria necessary to define them as S-type and transitional 1 - to S-type, respectively. However, unlike the majority of Lachlan fold S-type granites that are high level and often associated with their with their volcanic equivalents, the Peninsular Ranges batholith suites were emplaced at much deeper levels, possibly as much as 11 - 16 kID. The Harper Creek suite, of S-type gneissic granodiorite-tonalite plutons and associated Stephenson Peak migrnatitic schist and gneiss facies, is strongly peraluminous and contains biotite, cordierite, sillimanite, abundant graphite, and ilmenite. It has elevated δ¹⁸O up to + 20 per mil, initial ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratios (Sr₁) to 0. 713, a high aluminum saturation index, and Na₂O/K₂O ratios that overlap those of the Lachlan fold <b>belt</b> <b>S-type</b> grauites. The Cuyamaca Reservoir suite contains gneissic granodior itetonalite plutons, transitional between metaluminons and moderately peraluminous (I to S-type), containing reduced biotite, subaluminous amphibole, orthopyroxene, titanite and ilmenite. It has values of δ¹⁸O and Sr₁ greater than the Cretaceous I-type granites but less than the Harper Creek suite. Leucosome melt phase accumulation from the Julian Schist diatexites to produce a restite-rich magma is considered the most likely origin for the Harper Creek suite. For the Cuyamaca Reservoir suite, possible source components include young mantIe-derived magma, metaigneous and metasedimentary rocks formed in an arc environment, and evolved basinal fill metasedimentary rocks. The evolved metasedimentary component may be of Julian type. The Harper Creek and Cuyamaca Reservoir suites comprise deformed steepwalled, north-northwest-trending bodies up to 20 km long and with length-to-width ratios of 4 : 1. Textures range from strongly foliated to gneissic or mylonitic. Internal foliation that strikes parallel to the long dimension of the bodies and dips steeply to the east is defined by alignment of reflect magmatic feldspar and quartz grains and recrystalllzed aggregates of quartz and biotite. The concordance of magmatic and subsolidus foliations in the Jurassic plutons and the continuity of these structures with regionally developed metamorphic fabrics in their wallrocks indicate that magmatic foliation was overprinted by high-temperature, post-magmatic solid-state foliation. Foliation in the Harper Creek and Cuyamaca Reservoir suites is concordant with the axial planes of outcrop-scale isoclinal folds, and map patterns suggest that the plutons underwent regional-scale isoclinal folding. Their fabric probably formed during multiple episodes of synintrusive deformation that began at least by the Late Jurassic and culminated by the middle Cretaceous. 27 page(s...|$|R
