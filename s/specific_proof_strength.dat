The data were obtained by synchrotron diffraction strain scanning. Weld metal stresses (up to ∼ 7 mm {{either side of the}} centreline) are quite scattered and unreliable because of the large epitaxial grain size in the fusion zone. Peak magnitude of the transverse stresses varies between + 50 MPa (19 % of parent plate <b>proof</b> <b>strength)</b> at the HAZ boundary to − 150 MPa (57 % of PP <b>proof</b> <b>strength)</b> at the weld centreline. Equivalent values for longitudinal stresses are + 90 MPa (34 % of PP <b>proof</b> <b>strength)</b> some 22 mm from the weld centreline to − 120 MPa (45 % of PP <b>proof</b> <b>strength)</b> at the weld centreline. Plate-to-plate variation in the as-welded transverse and longitudinal residual stress values across the weld toe region is around 40 MPa.

Neurofuzzy modelling offers a transparent empirically based data-driven approach that can be combined with pre-processing of the data and initialising of the model structure based upon physical understanding. An iterative modelling approach is defined whereby data-driven empirical modelling approaches are first used to assess underlying data structures and are validated against physically based understanding, these then inform subsequent initialised neurofuzzy models and input data transformations to provide both optimal subset and feature representation...|$|R

40|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{development}} of a new modified 201 -type low nickel austenitic stainless steel is described in this paper. The alloy is intended for use as a structural alloy, and so requires a yield strength> 400 MPa as well as acceptable weldability and toughness. The low nickel content will give a lower material cost in comparison to more conventional austenitic grades, and the processing route is required to be similar to that of Type 304 to keep the processing cost low. The base alloy was designed using empirical methods developed for stainless steel, and the properties of the base alloy were verified using a range of small-scale melts.

The alloy compositions were selected to provide an attractive balance of tensile strength and elongation, without relying on complex post-processing and heat treatments - and are therefore suitable for complex cross section extrusions and free from quench distortion. The as-spray formed microstructures showed fine homogeneous, equiaxed grains with an average size of 10 - 15 μm. Firstly, a laboratory scale extrusion was carried out to extrude 30 mm diameter billets into 7. 5 mm diameter cross-section and to investigate the effects of temperature and ram speeds on microstructural development. The microstructure after extrusion at 400 °C was partially dynamically recrystallised with a ∼ 0. 5 area fraction of ∼ 1 μm grains and the remainder were unrecrystallised elongated grains. Electron backscatter diffraction showed a mixed + double fibre texture. After peak age hardening at 150 °C for 96 h, the Al- 6 Mg- 1. 6 Li- 0. 4 Zr alloy showed a 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>strength</b> of 495 MPa, a tensile strength of 553 MPa and elongation to failure of 8. 5 %; Al- 4 Mg- 1. 3 Li- 0. 4 Zr showed a 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>strength</b> of 392 MPa, a tensile strength of 476 MPa and an elongation of 10 %.

50|$|Ultimate tensile {{strength}} is the {{tensile stress at}} which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain. <b>Proof</b> <b>strength</b> is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated. If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener {{is said to be}} operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its <b>proof</b> <b>strength,</b> the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength.

40|$|A {{recent letter}} from us has {{indicated}} that the tensile <b>proof</b> <b>strength</b> of polycrystalline Ag micro-wires, with thicknesses {{in the range from}} 20 to 50. μm, depends strongly on the specimen size (t) and weakly on the grain size (d) when t/. d becomes smaller than about 3. In this work, we report further coupled effects of specimen size and grain size in the regime when their ratio is small. At a given grain size from 3 to 40. μm, the tensile elongation was found to decrease as the wire thickness decreases, and as the t/. d ratio gets smaller than about 3, the tensile elongation loses its dependence on the grain size. The work-hardening rate was found to scale approximately with the <b>proof</b> <b>strength,</b> and so they should be controlled by the same metallurgical factors. Transmission electron microscopy examination of the dislocation microstructures showed that in the regime where the grain size dominates strength and ductility, the dislocation density rises rapidly on deformation, but in the regime where the specimen thickness dominates strength and ductility, the dislocation density remains on the same order of magnitude as the undeformed state. The easy escape of dislocations from the specimen is thought to be the reason for the observed size effect of strength. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. postprin...|$|R

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming (SMF) of {{materials}} such as stainless steels {{there is a major}} problem with transfer and accumulation of sheet material to the metal forming tool surface. The problem is known as galling; a sort of severe adhesive wear, which results in severe scratching of produced parts. In this thesis, the overall aim was to gain knowledge of the influence of tool steel microstructure on galling initiation under sliding conditions. It was discovered that material transfer and tool steel damage caused by sheet material flow creating wear-induced galling initiation sites occurred in the early stage of galling. The galling resistance was higher for tool steels with higher matrix hardness due to better resistance to tool steel damage. Initial friction and critical contact pressure to galling was influenced by the strength of the sheet material. Material transfer happened at low pressures and the friction value was high in a case of sheet materials with lower <b>proof</b> <b>strength,</b> possibly due to the sheet contact against the tool steel matrix resulting in high adhesion and quicker tool damage. It was demonstrated that, in addition to hardness of the tool steel matrix and sheet material <b>proof</b> <b>strength,</b> tool steel microstructural features like size, shape, distribution and height of hard phases are important parameters influencing galling. Tool steels comprising homogeneously distributed, small and high hard phases better prevented the contact between sheet material and the tool steel matrix. Thus, a metal to metal contact with high friction was more efficiently avoided, which resulted in better tool performance. ...|$|R
