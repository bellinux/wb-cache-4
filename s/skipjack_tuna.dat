40|$|Bycatch {{taken by}} the tuna purse-seine fishery from the Indian Ocean pelagic {{ecosystem}} was estimated from data collected by scientific observers aboard Soviet purse seiners in the western Indian Ocean (WIO) during 1986 – 92. A total of 494 sets on free-swimming schools, whale-shark-associated schools, whale-associated schools, and log-associated schools were analyzed. More than 40 fish species and other marine animals were recorded. Among them only two species, yellow-fin and <b>skipjack</b> <b>tunas,</b> were target species. Average levels of bycatch were 0. 518 metric tons (t) per set, and 27. 1 t per 1000 t of target species. The total annual purse-seine catch of yellowfin and <b>skipjack</b> <b>tunas</b> by principal fishing nations in the WIO during 1985 – 94 was 118, 000 – 277, 000 t. Nonrecorded annual bycatch for this period was estimated at 944 – 2270 t of pelagic oceanic sharks, 720 – 1877 t of rainbow runners, 705 – 1836 t of dolphinfishes, 507 – 1322 t of triggerfishes, 113 – 294 t of wahoo, 104 – 251 t of billfishes, 53 – 112 t of mobulas and mantas, 35 – 89 t of mackerel scad, 9 – 24 t of barracudas, and 67 – 174 t of other fishes. In addition, turtle bycatch and whale mortalities may have occurred. Because the bycatches were not recorded by some purse-seine vessels, {{it was not possible}} to assess the full impact of the fisheries on the pelagic ecosystem of the Indian Ocean. The first step to solving this problem is for the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission to establish a pro-gram in which scientific observers are placed on board tuna purse-seine and longline vessels fishing in the WIO...|$|R

40|$|Anchored and {{drifting}} Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) are intensively used {{in tropical}} tuna fisheries. In both small-scale and industrial fisheries, skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) {{are the main}} targets. The increasing development of this fishing practice by industrial purse seiners has {{raised the question of}} the impact of FADs on tuna communities, as they might act as an ecological trap. This study investigated the feeding habits of <b>skipjack</b> and yellowfin <b>tuna</b> associated with anchored and drifting FADs in the western Indian Ocean. The diet of 352 tunas was analysed taking into account the type of FAD, ontogenetic variations, and the resources richness of the area. Poor-food and rich-food areas were defined according to the abundance of stomatopod Natosquilla investigatoris, the main prey of tunas, on the fishing sites. Diet composition was expressed through functional groups of prey. Significant dietary differences were found between both FAD types, as well as an effect of individual size. Around anchored FADs tuna preyed on diverse assemblages of coastal fish and crustacean larvae and juveniles, whereas a low diversity of epipelagic prey dominated the tuna diet associated with drifting FAD. Compared to anchored FADs, the frequency of empty stomachs was significantly higher and the stomach content mass significantly lower among skipjack and small yellowfin tunas caught around drifting FADs. This was magnified in poor-food areas, where drifting FADs often evolved, suggesting that these FADs could negatively impact the growth of skipjack and small yellowfin tuna. Larger yellowfin tuna exhibited differences in their dietary habits between anchored and drifting FADs, and between poor-food and rich-food areas. However, drifting FADs did not impact them as strongly as juveniles of yellowfin or <b>skipjack</b> <b>tunas.</b> Our study gives new highlights on possible detrimental effects of FAD on tunas, and this has to be considered in future sustainable management strategies of tuna fisheries...|$|R

Bigeye tunas are bycatch to <b>skipjack</b> <b>tunas</b> when tuna {{purse seine}} vessels set their nets on {{floating}} aggregator devices (FADs). Current approaches to managing bigeye {{in both the}} Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) and the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) entail permanently closed areas, such as the “correlito” in the EPO, temporary time-area closures such as shutting down fishing {{on the high seas}} in the WCPO, and closing the entire FAD fishery for extended periods of time (one or more months), such as in both the EPO and WCPO. Such effort management can reduce bigeye bycatch through reducing all FAD catches, but suffers from several inefficiencies: (1) fishing spills over to other modes of fishing, notably setting on dolphins or on free schools with subsequent impact upon biodiversity, notably bycatch, and creating ecological-biodiversity trade-offs; (2) with growing overcapacity, closed periods must become increasingly extended to reduce bigeye bycatch, lowering target catch and profits and even making some vessels unprofitable. By  not pricing bycatch at the margin, incentives are not created: (1) to efficiently reduce the proportion of bycatch in total catch as well as all catch; (2) change behavior throughout the supply chain and consumers as the internalized bycatch external cost is passed through the supply chain; (3) to generate dynamic incentives to induce or direct bycatch reducing technological change. Transferable bycatch credit systems and risk pools are proposed to reduce bycatch to incentivize real-time spatial management and induce directed, bycatch-reducing technological change...|$|R

Its goal is to evaluate the potential geographical heterogeneity of the skipjack population fished in the Indian Ocean. Significant latitudinal & longitudinal movements have been frequently observed; the geographical range of skipjack movements appears to be wide in scale, showing an average distance over 1000 miles between tagging & recovery positions. These distances are showing an increasing trend with time at liberty, and reaching average distances of 1400 miles after 2 years. Recovery data are also showing that skipjack movements are often very fast, for instance reaching average distances over 800 miles after only 1 month at liberty in the Tanzania tagging. Distances covered are the lowest for skipjack tagged in the Maldives and in Seychelles islands and much larger in the Tanzania and Seychelles tagging. these differences are discussed. Because of these fast and extensive movements of skipjack, {{it can be concluded}} that its population is highly mobile in the Indian Ocean, but that the mixing rates of individual skipjack that are fished in remote parts of the Indian Ocean are probably low or very low. Based on these results, it is proposed that skipjack indicators and future skipjack stock assessment should be stratified on at least 4 areas, and estimating the mixing rates of <b>skipjack</b> <b>tunas</b> fished in each of these areas...|$|R
