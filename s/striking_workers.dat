5|$|The Cripple Creek miners' {{strike of}} 1894 was a five-month strike by the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) in Cripple Creek, Colorado, USA. It {{resulted}} in {{a victory for the}} union and was followed in 1903 by the Colorado Labor Wars. It is notable for being the only time in United States history when a state militia was called out (May/June 1894) in support of <b>striking</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1921, a labour strike {{erupted in}} the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Madras. This strike was led by V. Kalyanasundara Mudaliar, {{a leader of the}} Indian National Congress. The strike lasted for over six months during which around 10,000 workers struck work. A {{crackdown}} was ordered. Eventually, two factions emerged; one group of workers desired to return to work while another wished to continue the strike. Violent riots broke out when <b>striking</b> <b>workers</b> prevented the others from returning to work. The riots began to assume communal colours as the workers who wished to continue the strike were mostly caste Hindus while those who desired to end it were largely untouchables or Dalits.|$|E
5|$|Ministers in the Madras {{government}} and ruling party members supported the strike. On 29 August 1921, the police opened fire and killed {{six of the}} workers on the spot. Top Justice Party leaders like O. Thanikachalam Chetti severely censured the police for the measures they adopted. The main reason was that the police was {{under the control of}} the governor and the government was looking for an opportunity to harass the executive. Another probable reason was that the <b>striking</b> <b>workers</b> had the caste sympathies of the Justice Party government whose ministers and chief whips were caste Hindus like themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{were killed}} in the strike: {{bystander}} Valentino Modestino fatally shot by a private guard on April 17 1913, and <b>striking</b> <b>worker</b> Vincenzo Madonna fatally shot by a strikebreaker on June 29.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>strike,</b> <b>workers</b> have {{achieved}} the following concessions from management: time on ordinary days was reduced to 10 hours and on Saturdays - to 9 with pay; at the plant was introduced paramedic position and ensured the reception of patients by a doctor twice a week was promised a revision of rates for piecework; for three days of the <b>strike</b> the <b>workers</b> were paid wages.|$|R
25|$|On 7 March 2012, the Port {{announced}} that all <b>striking</b> dock <b>workers</b> {{would be made}} redundant. This prompted a strong response from the <b>striking</b> port <b>workers,</b> the Maritime Union of New Zealand, and its global affiliates in the ITF, ILWU and Maritime Union of Australia.|$|R
5|$|On May 3, <b>striking</b> <b>workers</b> in Chicago met {{near the}} McCormick Harvesting Machine Company plant. Union molders {{at the plant}} had been locked out since early February and the {{predominantly}} Irish-American workers at McCormick had come under attack from Pinkerton guards during an earlier strike action in 1885. This event, along with the eight-hour militancy of McCormick workers, had gained the strikers some respect and notoriety around the city. By {{the time of the}} 1886 general strike, strikebreakers entering the McCormick plant were under protection from a garrison of 400 police officers. Although half of the replacement workers defected to the general strike on May 1, McCormick workers continued to harass strikebreakers as they crossed the picket lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} starts in pre-war Amiens, France. Stephen Wraysford visits and lives with René Azaire, his wife Isabelle and their children. Azaire teaches Stephen about the French textile industry. He {{witnesses}} a comfortable middle class life in Northern France alongside industrial worker unrest. Azaire and the significantly younger Isabelle express discontent with their marriage. This sparks Stephen's interest in Isabelle, {{with whom he}} soon falls in love. During one incident, Azaire, embarrassed that he and Isabelle cannot have another child, beats her in a jealous rage. Around the same time, Isabelle helps give food {{to the families of}} <b>striking</b> <b>workers,</b> stirring rumours that she is having an affair with one of the workers.|$|E
5|$|During the European {{food crisis}} of the 1840s, food prices rose sharply to around three times the pre-crisis prices, and the {{relatively}} low-paid bal maidens of Devon Great Consols demanded increased pay to cover food costs. While the mine owners initially met their demands, once the food price stabilised the pay rate was then reduced to previous levels causing around 200 bal maidens and boys to walkout. On their return to {{work the next day}} all the <b>striking</b> <b>workers</b> were summarily dismissed and either replaced with new workers, or re-hired at an even lower pay rate than before. Bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in the 19thcentury, but Cornwall's high unemployment meant the strikes were generally unsuccessful as workers could easily be replaced.|$|E

This prompted a strong response from the <b>striking</b> port <b>workers,</b> the Maritime Union of New Zealand, and its global affiliates in the ITF, ILWU and Maritime Union of Australia.The ITF's president, Paddy Crumlin, subsequently declared Ports of Auckland a port-of-convenience on 9 March.|$|R

5|$|Lenin {{hoped to}} cement {{connections}} between his Social-Democrats and Emancipation of Labour, {{a group of}} Russian Marxist émigrés based in Switzerland; he visited the country to meet group members Plekhanov and Pavel Axelrod. He proceeded to Paris to meet Marx's son-in-law Paul Lafargue and to research the Paris Commune of 1871, which he considered an early prototype for a proletarian government. Financed by his mother, he stayed in a Swiss health spa before travelling to Berlin, where he studied for six weeks at the Staatsbibliothek and met the Marxist activist Wilhelm Liebknecht. Returning to Russia with a stash of illegal revolutionary publications, he travelled to various cities distributing literature to <b>striking</b> <b>workers.</b> While involved in producing a news sheet, Rabochee delo ("Workers' Cause"), he was among 40 activists arrested in St. Petersburg and charged with sedition.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of World War II in Europe {{and the threat}} of the U.S. becoming involved generated new jobs in defense-related industries. After the U.S. became involved in the war in 1941, the city mobilized. Philadelphia consistently met war bond quotas and when the war ended in 1945, 183,850 residents were in the U.S. armed forces. With so many men serving in the military, there had been a labor shortage; businesses and industries hired women and workers from outside the city. In 1944 the Philadelphia Transportation Company promoted African Americans to positions as motormen and conductors (from which they had previously been excluded) on public transportation vehicles. Resentful, other PTC workers protested and began a strike that nearly immobilized the city. President Roosevelt sent troops to replace the <b>striking</b> <b>workers.</b> After a federal ultimatum, the workers returned after six days.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaders of}} the strike, {{including}} McMenamin and Carney, were charged in federal court under the SmithConnally Act; some thirty strikers were also indicted later. The federal grand jury was convened on August 9 and heard testimony for two months. However, the grand jury returned inconclusive findings; their report stated {{that most of the}} <b>striking</b> <b>workers</b> knew nothing about the strike at the start, and blamed a few instigators for escalating the situation, but did not detail the instigators' activities. The report was also critical of the PTC's response to the strike, characterizing it as inadequate and ineffective. The government dropped its charges against the defendants on March 12, 1945, with most of them pleading nolo contendere and receiving a fine of $100 each.|$|E

5|$|He {{hoped that}} {{connections}} could be cemented between his Social-Democrats and the Emancipation of Labour group; an organisation founded in Geneva, Switzerland by Georgi Plekhanov and other Russian Marxist emigres in 1883. Vladimir and E.I. Sponti {{were selected to}} travel to Switzerland to meet with Plekhanov, who was generally supportive but criticised the Social-Democrats for ignoring the bourgeoisie's role in the anti-Tsarist revolution. Traveling to Zurich, Vladimir befriended Pavel Axelrod, another member of Emancipation of Labour. Proceeding to Paris, France, Vladimir met Paul Lafargue and researched the Paris Commune of 1871, which he saw as an early prototype for a proletarian government. Financed by his mother, he stayed in a Swiss health spa before traveling to Berlin, Germany, where he studied for six weeks at the Staatsbibliothek and met Wilhelm Liebknecht. Returning to Russia with a stash of illegal revolutionary literature, he traveled to various cities, {{aware that he was}} being monitored by the police, and distributed literature to <b>striking</b> <b>workers</b> in Saint Petersburg. Involved in producing a news sheet, The Workers' Cause, he was among 40 activists arrested on the night before the first issue's publication and charged with sedition.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{was founded}} in 1920 by Helen Keller, Roger Baldwin, Crystal Eastman, Walter Nelles, Morris Ernst, Albert DeSilver, Arthur Garfield Hays, Jane Addams, Felix Frankfurter, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and its focus was on freedom of speech, {{primarily}} for anti-war protesters. During the 1920s, the ACLU expanded its scope to include protecting the free speech rights of artists and <b>striking</b> <b>workers,</b> {{and working with the}} National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to decrease racism and discrimination. During the 1930s, the ACLU started to engage in work combating police misconduct and supporting Native American rights. Many of the ACLU's cases involved the defense of Communist party members and Jehovah's Witnesses. In 1940, the ACLU leadership voted to exclude Communists from its leadership positions, a decision rescinded in 1968. During World War II, the ACLU defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to internment camps. During the Cold War, the ACLU headquarters was dominated by anti-Communists, but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.|$|E

50|$|In September and October 1917, {{there were}} mass strike {{actions by the}} Moscow and Petrograd workers, miners in Donbas, metalworkers in the Urals, oil workers in Baku, textile workers in the Central Industrial Region, and {{railroad}} workers on 44 railway lines. In these months alone, {{more than a million}} workers took part in <b>strikes.</b> <b>Workers</b> established control over production and distribution in many factories and plants in a social revolution.|$|R
50|$|The Biennio Rosso {{took place}} in a context of {{economic}} crisis {{at the end of the}} war, with high unemployment and political instability. It was characterized by mass <b>strikes,</b> <b>worker</b> manifestations as well as self-management experiments through land and factories occupations. Tension had been rising since the final years of the war. Some contemporary observers considered Italy to be on the brink of a revolution by the end of 1918.|$|R
5000|$|Whereas anarchism in Spain was {{previously}} disjointed and ephemeral, {{even the smallest}} of towns now had organizations and {{took part in the}} movement. Different parts of the CNT (unions, regions, etc.) were autonomous and yet inextricably linked. A <b>strike</b> by <b>workers</b> in one field would often lead to solidarity <b>strikes</b> by <b>workers</b> in an entire city. This way, general strikes often were not [...] "called", they simply happened organically.|$|R
