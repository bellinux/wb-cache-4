5000|$|Tempest is {{featured}} as {{the video game}} that Reggie (Catherine Mary Stewart) plays in the 1984 film Night of the Comet, and the game serves to introduce a <b>standing</b> <b>thread</b> throughout the movie. While at the movie theater that saves her from exposure to the comet, she becomes obsessed with knocking someone with the initials [...] "DMK" [...] off the high score list. Additionally, the identity of [...] "DMK" [...] is revealed at the film's conclusion when another survivor suddenly appears with the custom license plate of [...] "DMK".|$|E

40|$|Efficiency of bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) is {{generally}} {{limited by the}} performance of bioanode, resulted from the nature of microbial electron transfer and {{the character of the}} anode substrate. In the present study, a 3 D structured anode material is fabricated using a towel as precursor through high-temperature carbonization. The 3 D electrode is resulted from freely <b>standing</b> <b>threads,</b> twisted by fibers with diameter at micrometer scale, on a woven textile substrate. The open structure provides easy accesses for microbial to attach on the fiber surface. Furthermore, the prepared materials possess a high capacitive character which is beneficial for electron storage and contributes to the performance of bioanode. When tested in BESs, the prepared material achieves a current density of 0. 80 +/- 0. 06 mA cm(- 2), larger than conventional anodes, e. g. graphite felt (0. 55 +/- 0. 01 mA cm(- 2)), carbon cloth (0. 06 +/- 0. 01 mA cm(- 2)), and carbon mesh (0. 02 +/- 0. 00 mA cm(- 2)). The present study provides a novel 3 D anode substrate that can effectively promote the performance of BESs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{centrality}} of the researcher and their position {{in relation to the}} research setting has been subject to controversy and long <b>standing</b> debates <b>threaded</b> with the narratives of insider and outsider myths. Insiders are often charged with the tendency to present their group in an unrealistically favourable light, and their work is often considered to be overshadowed by the enclosed, self-contained world of common understanding. This paper draws upon data generated by six participants from a research project, which aimed to explore and represent the everyday experiences of working-class mothers and daughters residing on a peripheral social housing estate. The paper describes how I, as an indigenous researcher, employed visual methods of data production in order to suspend my preconceptions of familiar territory, and facilitate an understanding of the unique viewpoints of mothers and daughters on the margins of contemporary Britain. The paper focuses the usefulness of the approach for making the familiar strange when the researchers own experience mirrors that of their participants...|$|R
40|$|Two <b>standing</b> women {{spinning}} <b>thread,</b> titled on back, note {{in lower}} right corner. Gift from artist and Dr. Ludwig GlaeserLene Schneider-Kainer, (16 May, 1885, Vienna, Austria - 15 June, 1971, Cochabamba, Bolivia), was a Jewish-Austrian artist, {{daughter of the}} painter Sigmund Schneider. She studied art throughout Europe, and married Ludwig Kainer in 1910. Schneider-Kainer made her debut as an artist in 1917 with an exhibition at the Galerie Gurlitt, and through the 1920 s she became renowned as painter and illustrator. In 1926 Lene left Berlin after her divorce and for two years accompanied the poet Bernhard Kellermann on an extended odyssey retracing the steps of Marco Polo. She painted, photographed and sketched her impressions, and these contributions appeared regularly in the Berliner Tageblatt. Due {{to the rise of}} the Nazis she settled in Mallorca in 1932, and later Ibiza. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she left for New York. She continued to exhibit successfully around the world, and in 1954 she settled in Bolivia, where she assisted her son in establishing a textile factory. digitizedDigital imag...|$|R
