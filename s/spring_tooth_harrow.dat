Physical properties of soil such as bulk density, porosity, mean weight diameter and aggregate stability were determined before and after tillage.

Small sized aggregates (1 - 5 mm) were highly in tillage with combination of cultivator with <b>spring</b> <b>teeth</b> and rotary <b>harrow.</b> While the mean weight diameter, which shows the durability of aggregates to water, was 2. 83 mm before tillage, it was 3. 96 mm in tillage with DH, 1. 80 mm in tillage with FC and 2. 50 mm in tillage with combination equipment. Although the mean weight diameter in tillage with DH increased, decreased in tillage with FC. The best aggregate stability obtained from seedbed preparation by disc harrow.

For this reason, experimental trials were performed in Çayköy and Güzelpınar in Tokat-Kazova during 2008, 2009 and 2010. In this trials Gökçe cultivar of chickpea was used. Six different soil tillage methods were applied which were, mouldboard plough tillage in fall + cultivator in the <b>spring</b> + <b>tooth</b> <b>harrow</b> (Method A), mouldboard plough tillage in spring + cultivator + <b>tooth</b> <b>harrow</b> (Method B), rotary tiller in the spring (Method C), chisel in the spring + disc harrow and slider (Method D), strip tillage with router rotary hoe (Method E) and direct seeding (Method F).

40|$|A wheat {{stubble field}} (clay-loam, light alkali; light salty and poor of organic matter) was {{established}} to carry out an experiment at Gökhöyük Agricultural Institute, Turkey. Effects of three different tillage systems: conventional tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage on penetration resistance, emergence time, shooting degree and yield were investigated. Conventional tillage used a moldboard plough for primary tilling and a combined <b>spring</b> tine cultivator-spike <b>tooth</b> <b>harrow</b> for consecutive secondary tilling. Reduced tillage included only a cultivator-tooth harrow combination. No-tillage was accomplished by a direct (stubble) drill. Although the earliest emergence time (17 day) and the highest emergence degree (66. 5 %) were obtained, yield was the lowest in no-tillage system. The highest penetration resistance (53. 71 kg cm - 2) was measured in no-tillage system. Reduced and no tillage systems could be proposed for Gökhöyük region if alternative solutions is found to prevent soil compaction and reduce mechanical impedance in root growth zone.

Plant emergence and harvesting properties investigated were mean emergence dates, emerged rate index, percentage of emerged seedling, plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield. Soil moisture content, bulk density and penetration resistance varied from 24. 39 to 25. 42 %, and from 1. 24 to 1. 33 g/cm 3, and from 0. 58 to 1. 60 MPa, at 0 - 10 cm soil depth respectively; the same properties varied from 24. 65 to 25. 95 %, and from 1. 25 to 1. 34 g/cm 3, and from 0. 95 to 1. 60 MPa, at 10 - 20 cm soil depth respectively. For plant properties; mean emerged dates, emerged rate index, and percentage of emerged varied from 12. 80 to 12. 85 days, and from 0. 335 to 0. 346 seedling/m day, and from 86. 11 to 88. 61, respectively. Plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield varied from 244. 7 to 266. 2 cm, from 2. 88 to 3. 13 cm, from 7525. 89 to 7580. 80 kg/da, and from 1523. 36 to 1534. 35 kg/da, respectively.

40|$|Sixteen {{acres of}} corn were grown {{on the grounds}} of the Iowa Experiment Station in 1889. The {{principal}} part of it was produced from the best ears of our last year’s crop of Learning corn, and the remainder consisted of Arleus and early Mastodon corn. It was grown on a black heavy soil, which was too wet formerly in wet seasons, to produce paying crops of anything, except grass; but last year it was tile-drained thoroughly. The greater part of the field had been used for many years as a pasture and the remainder, (perhaps five acres) was a part of an old field which had been used for different kinds of crops. It was well plowed early in September, 1888. Last spring, we ran over it twice with a disc harrow and once with a reversible harrow and then plowed it about eight inches deep. Then we ran over it again with a disc harrow and a reversible harrow and also with a heavy farm roller. It was planted May 2 d and 3 d, with a two horse planter in rows three feet and eight inches apart. From two to three grains were planted in each of the hills, which were thirty inches apart in the rows; but the entire field was thinned afterwards to two stalks in each hill. The field was harrowed twice with a Thomas smoothing harrow after the com came up; when it was divided into four lots, each of which was cultivated four times afterwards and hoed once. The south lot was cultivated each time with the Tower cultivator. The lot next to it was cultivated each time with the Eagle- Claw cultivator. The next or third lot, was cultivated with the riding Pearl cultivator, and the remainder of the field each time with the Albion <b>Spring</b> <b>Tooth</b> cultivator. The work of the Tower cultivator was excellent where oat stubble had been plowed under; but where old weeds or corn stalks were near the surface of the ground, it did not work well. The work of the Eagle-Claw cultivator was better than could be done by the walking or riding plows which are used in every neighborhood; because it pulverizes the surface of the ground better and leaves it level. But the Albion 248 <b>Spring</b> <b>Tooth</b> cultivator excels all other kinds which we have used, on all kinds of ground and in every respect. When our crop of corn was husked and measured during the latter part of October, the yield of the entire field proved to be eighty bushels per acre of sound shelled corn. I find from the reports of the Secretary of the Iowa Board -of Agriculture, that the average yield of corn in Iowa for the years 1883 - 8 inclusive, was 31 and 312 / 3 bushels per acre. The highest average yield per acre for a single year, was considered remarkable, being 411 / 4 bushels.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how micro-osteoperforations (MOPs) affect tooth movements and bone characteristics, including bone turnover, bone density, and bone volume. Methods: A split-mouth design with 7 beagle dogs was used to evaluate bone surrounding maxillary second premolars that had been retracted for 7 weeks. The maxillary third premolars were extracted and, after 1 month of healing, 8 MOPs (1. 5 mm wide and 7 mm deep created with the PROPEL device) were placed without flaps around the experimental side maxillary second premolars. The maxillary second premolars were retracted bilaterally with 200 g nickel-titanium closed coil <b>springs.</b> <b>Tooth</b> movements were measured intraorally and radiographically. Microcomputed tomography analysis was used to evaluate the material density and bone volume fraction of bone adjacent to the moving teeth. Hematoxylin and eosin sections and fluorescent sections were used to examine the bone. Results: Overall tooth movements were slightly greater on the MOP side, but neither the intraoral tooth movement measurements nor radiographic tooth movement measurements showed statistically significant (p= 0. 866, p= 0. 528) differences. There also were no statistically significant differences in bone density (p= 0. 237) and bone volume fraction (p= 0. 398). Fluorescent image and histologic evaluations also showed no apparent differences near the tooth being moved. Bone healing was evident in and near the MOP sites, which had nearly, but not completely repaired by 7 weeks. Regions of acellular bone were evident extending approximately 0. 8 mm from the MOP sites. Conclusions: The extent of MOPs effects on tooth movements are limited. MOPs placed 3 mm away do not increase tooth movements and have little or no effect on bone adjacent to the tooth being moved...|$|R

The helices are 2 mm in diameter {{and the length of}} the arm is 6 mm. The article presents 2 case reports where the effictiveness and efficiency of "MK" spring have been highlighted...|$|R
