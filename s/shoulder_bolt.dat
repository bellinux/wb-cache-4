50|$|Another use of reamed holes is {{to receive}} a {{specialized}} bolt that has an unthreaded shoulder - also called a <b>shoulder</b> <b>bolt.</b> This type of bolt is commonly used to replace hot peened rivets during the seismic retrofit of structures.|$|E
40|$|The ITER {{diagnostics}} generic upper {{port plug}} (GUPP) is {{developed as a}} standardized design for all diagnostic upper port plugs, in which a variety of payloads can be mounted. Here, the remote handling compatibility analysis (RHCA) of the GUPP design is presented that was performed for the GUPP final design review. The analysis focuses mainly on the insertion and extraction procedure of the diagnostic shield module (DSM), a removable cassette that contains the diagnostic in-vessel components. It is foreseen that the DSM is a replaceable component – the procedure {{of which is to}} be performed inside the ITER hot cell facility (HCF), where the GUPP can be oriented in a vertical position. The DSM removal procedure in the HCF consists of removing locking pins, an M 30 sized <b>shoulder</b> <b>bolt</b> and two electrical straps {{through the use of a}} dexterous manipulator, after which the DSM is lifted out of the GUPP by an overhead crane. For optimum access to its internals, the DSM is mounted in a handling device. The insertion of a new or refurbished DSM follows the reverse procedure. The RHCA shows that the GUPP design requires a moderate amount of changes to become fully compatible with RH maintenance requirements...|$|E
50|$|Back then a CIDCO {{transaxle}} {{could be}} purchased, this stands for Corvair Improvement Distributing Company as owned by Bob Anderson. At {{one time he}} developed Corvair transaxles with many improvements, not only for Corvairs but the kit car industry as well. Bob improved the longevity of the differentials thru many modifications, re-manufacture and re-engineering, along with careful assembly. This included having reverse cut ring and pinion gears made for the Kelmark transaxle setup which ran in reverse. His setup was in great demand by the mid-engine Corvair enthusiasts. One of the trademarks of the CIDCO diff is the <b>shoulder</b> <b>bolted</b> steel plate cover {{on top of the}} differential in place of the tin cover.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} Jeep application, the {{ignition}} control module (ICM) {{is located in}} engine compartment. It consists of a solid-state ignition circuit, {{as well as an}} integrated ignition coil that can be removed and serviced separately. Electronic signals from the ECU to the ICM determine the amount of ignition timing or retard needed to meet engine power requirements. The ECU provides an input signal to the ICM. The ICM has outputs for a tach signal to the tachometer and a high voltage signal from the coil to the distributor. The crankshaft position sensor senses TDC (Top Dead Center) and BDC crankshaft positions, as well as engine rpm. This sensor is secured by special <b>shouldered</b> <b>bolts</b> to flywheel/drive plate housing and is not adjustable.|$|R
60|$|At this moment, {{and while}} Halbert was embarrassed with devising a {{suitable}} answer, a deer bounded across their path. In an instant the crossbow {{was at the}} youth's <b>shoulder,</b> the <b>bolt</b> whistled, and the deer, after giving one bound upright, dropt dead on the green sward.|$|R
30|$|Dynamisation of an {{external}} fixator {{is important in}} regenerate training and consolidation of an osteotomy or fracture. One reported downside {{of the most frequently}} used hexapod, the Taylor spatial frame (TSF), is the lack of ease of achieving this. Controlled frame dynamisation with the TSF is not achievable easily due to the limited two-ring construct and interosseous transfixion [24]. Unlocking individual, alternate or all struts lead to an uncontrolled loss of stability in one or more planes [24]. This can be ameliorated by the use of non-standard modified <b>shoulder</b> <b>bolts,</b> which permit some motion between strut and ring, whilst preserving the overall configuration and relative stability, but this has not been proven. The OSF appears to exceed the mechanical characteristics of the Ilizarov fixator in terms of rigidity and allows controlled and safe dynamisation for desirable regenerate training without the risk of excessive and unwanted deformation. This may prove of clinical importance and will need to be confirmed in clinical studies.|$|R
50|$|Metal Battler: Appear in episode 9. Powers include flight, {{underside}} energy beams in saucer mode, claw {{hands that}} can fire energy <b>bolts,</b> <b>shoulder</b> energy cannons, and an 8-tube torso machine gun.|$|R
60|$|Swift as {{thought the}} veteran archer raised his arblast to his <b>shoulder,</b> the {{whizzing}} <b>bolt</b> fled from the ringing string, {{and the next}} moment crashed quivering into the corselet of Plantagenet.|$|R
50|$|Bigada: Appears in episode 45. Powers include self bisecting, {{throwing}} {{stars on}} the <b>shoulders,</b> green tusk <b>bolts,</b> flight, a Chinese sword that fires lightning bolts, and spikes hidden in each bisected half. It {{is a combination of}} two colossal monsters fused together by Barao named Ondera and Shigidira.|$|R
5000|$|Jaguar {{first used}} the Dana 44 in an IRS in 1961 for the Jaguar E-type {{as well as}} other models. It was used through 1996 (Jaguar IRS Article). There are some {{differences}} in the Jaguar Dana 44, however. The differential (possibly the entire axle assembly) was made by Salisbury, a U.K. division of Dana Corporation. The ring gear in the Salisbury version uses slightly smaller mounting bolts and the pinion shaft is a different diameter than the common version. Naturally the cast housing is also unique to the IRS model. Standard 8.5" [...] Dana 44 ring and pinion gear can be used in the IRS model {{through the use of a}} special installation kit which includes special <b>shouldered</b> <b>bolts</b> to mount the standard ring gear to the IRS carrier and a special pinion bearing set to fit the standard pinion shaft to the IRS housing. Gear distributors with knowledge of the Jag IRS should be able to get the installation kit. US Dana 44 gears a slightly stronger than Jaguar gears, and Jaguar gears higher priced, but once the installation kit price is added to the lower US gear prices cost is about the same. If Jaguar makes the needed gear ratio there isn't much difference in strength. The consensus in the hot rodding community is that the Jaguar IRS is good for up to 500 hp from the factory. Most V-12 Jaguar and E-type six-cylinder models used limited slip versions, other models (mainly the XJS) used a standard differential stock with limited slip as an option.|$|R
60|$|Richard only lived {{two years}} after he came back. He was besieging a castle in Aquitaine, where there was some {{treasure}} that he thought was unlawfully kept from him, when he was struck in the <b>shoulder</b> by a <b>bolt</b> from a cross-bow, and the surgeons treated it so unskilfully {{that in a few}} days he died. The man who had shot the bolt was made prisoner, but the Lion-heart's last act was to command that no harm should be done to him. The soldiers, however, in their grief and rage for the king, did put him to death in a cruel manner.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 1895 {{differed}} from the Mauser Model 1893 {{with regards to the}} bolt face. The bolt face used in the Mauser Model 1893 was square whereas the Model 1895’s was cylindrical, {{this is due to the}} fact that the square face was unnecessary for reliable feeding. In addition, the Model 1895 had an auxiliary <b>shoulder</b> behind the <b>bolt</b> handle in order to provide additional locking in case of bolt failure. Another major modification regarding the Model 1895 to the Model 1893 was the magazine follower, the tail of which was rounded so that the bolt could be closed on an empty chamber ...|$|R
50|$|The MEL bore some {{mechanical}} similarities {{with the}} Ford FE, utilizing similar components {{such as the}} oiling system, bolt patterns, and valve stems; however, the MEL was a Lincoln-specific engine and was even larger in displacement capacity. The main bearings were 2.9 in (73,66 mm), while the rod bearings were huge at 2.6 in (66,04 mm). The connecting rod beam had a unique triangular shape with the <b>shoulders</b> for the <b>bolts</b> sitting low toward the cap mating surface (1/2 in.). There was one major difference between the MEL and FE engines besides their size and weight. The valves on MEL engines were arranged in alternating fashion (I-E-I-E-I-E-I-E) {{and not in the}} manner of the FE (E-I-E-I-I-E-I-E) where the I indicates an Intake valve and the E indicates an Exhaust valve.|$|R
50|$|The M1941 rifle {{used the}} energy from recoil {{to operate the}} rifle. As the bullet and {{propellant}} gases moved down the barrel, they imparted a force on the bolt head that was locked to the barrel. The barrel, together with the bolt, moved a short distance rearward until the bullet left the barrel and pressure in the bore had dropped to safe levels. The barrel then stopped against a <b>shoulder</b> allowing the <b>bolt</b> carrier to continue rearward under the momentum imparted by the initial recoil stage. The rotating bolt, which had eight locking lugs, would then lock the bolt. Following, a cam arrangement then rotated and unlocked the bolt to continue the operating cycle. One disadvantage of this design was {{its impact on the}} use of a bayonet, as the complex movements of the barrel would be subject to unacceptable stress when a bayonet thrust was used. The Johnson rifle utilized a unique 10-round rotary magazine and a two-piece stock, the weapon using the same 5 round stripper clips used by the M1903 Rifle.|$|R
5000|$|In the semi-final round, #1 of the year. LaShawn Merritt cruised to an easy {{win in the}} first, with Christophe Lemaitre second. The second semi saw Usain Bolt run 19.78, in {{the last}} few metres Andre De Grasse rushed up to <b>Bolt's</b> <b>shoulder,</b> the two friends looking at each other and {{laughing}} as they crossed the line. Bolt's time was his fastest the year and De Grasse set a new Canadian record of 19.80 seconds. As Bud Winter the sprint coach who influenced Glen Mills, Bolt's coach, would say; [...] "Relax and win." [...] Both the time qualifiers Adam Gemili and Ramil Guliyev both came from this fastest of the three semi final heats. #3 of the year, Ameer Webb was left behind. In the third semi, Alonso Edward and Churandy Martina qualified in 1st and 2nd place. World #2 in 2016 Justin Gatlin held the lead with 50 metres to go but started looking around did not keep up his speed sufficiently. He should have seen Alonso Edward as he pulled ahead of Gatlin and on the far outside, Churandy Martina closed fast to take the second qualifying position. Gatlin failed to reach the final. 2012 silver medallist and number #2 runner of all time, Yohan Blake finished sixth.|$|R
