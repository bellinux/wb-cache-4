60|$|At length Cytherea wandered alone {{into the}} conservatory. When in it, {{she thought she}} would run across to the hot-house in the outer garden, having in her heart a {{whimsical}} desire that she should also like to take a last look at the familiar flowers and luxuriant leaves collected there. <b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> a pair of overshoes, and thither she went. Not a soul was in or around the place. The gardener was making merry on Manston's and her account.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> her overshoes, {{wrapped a}} large tartan shawl around her, {{put on a}} man's felt hat, and ventured out along the causeways of the first yard. It was very dark. The wind was roaring in the great elms behind the outhouses. When {{she came to the}} second yard the {{darkness}} seemed deeper. She was unsure of her footing. She wished she had brought a lantern. Rain blew against her. Half she liked it, half she felt unwilling to battle.|$|E
6000|$|While Mrs. Aleshine held {{a pillow}} in her teeth as <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the pillow-case with both hands, Mrs. Lecks {{looked around the}} room with the air of an {{attentive}} hostess. [...] "I guess you'll be comfortable, Mr. Craig," [...] she said, [...] "and I advise you to sleep just as long as you can. We'll take the room {{on the other side of}} the hall; but I'm first goin' down to see if the kitchen fire is safe, and to fasten the doors." ...|$|E

5000|$|McCarthy's {{performance}} was praised by critics. Richard Roeper of The Chicago Sun Times called her [...] "as funny and as winning as {{anyone in the}} movies these days". Tom Russo of The Boston Globe credited the film's success to McCarthy, writing, [...] "part of what makes the action comedy such a loopy blast is the identity shifts <b>she</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> the audience." [...] Bill Goodykoontz of Arizona Republic called the film McCarthy's return to form, writing [...] "Finally, after the promise shown in Bridesmaids, but sold short since by weak scripts in films like Tammy and Identity Thief, Melissa McCarthy gets a movie vehicle worthy of her talents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{can go to}} the devil!' said he, {{and rang}} the bell for his bill. She stared at him with a {{surprise}} which had eclipsed her anger, while <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> her gloves with little sharp twitches. This was a new Frank Crosse to her. As long as a woman gets on very well with a man, she is apt, {{at the back of her}} soul, to suspect him of weakness. It is only when she differs from him that she can see the other side, and it always comes as a surprise. She liked him better than ever for the revelation.|$|E
60|$|So they seized Cap'n Bill {{and tied}} {{him into the}} frame so that he couldn't move a jot in any direction. Then they rolled the frame {{underneath}} the Great Knife and handed the Boolooroo the cord that released the blade. But while this was going on, Trot had crept up and fastened one end of her rope to the frame in which Cap'n Bill was confined. Then she stood back and watched the Boolooroo, and just as he pulled the cord, <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> her rope and dragged the frame on its rollers away, so that the Great Knife fell with a crash and sliced nothing but the air.|$|E
6000|$|Once, finding herself {{behind the}} others {{and out of sight}} in the cedars, she got off to walk awhile, leading the mustang. This would not do, however, because she fell too far in the rear. Mounting again, she rode on, {{beginning}} to feel that nothing mattered, that this trip {{would be the end of}} Carley Burch. How she hated that dreary, cold, flat land the road bisected without end. It felt as if she rode hours to cover a mile. In open stretches she saw the whole party straggling along, separated from one another, and each for himself. They certainly could not be enjoying themselves. Carley shut her eyes, clutched the pommel of the saddle, trying to support her weight. How could she endure another mile? Alas! there might be many miles. Suddenly a terrible shock seemed to rack her. But it was only that Spillbeans had once again taken to a trot. Frantically <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the bridle. He was not to be thwarted. Opening her eyes, she saw a cabin far ahead which probably was the destination for the night. Carley knew she would never reach it, yet she clung on desperately. What she dreaded was the return of that stablike pain in her side. It came, and life seemed something abject and monstrous. She rode stiff legged, with her hands propping her stiffly above the pommel, but the stabbing pain went right on, and in deeper. When the mustang halted his trot beside the other horses Carley was in the last extremity. Yet as Glenn came to her, offering a hand, she still hid her agony. Then Flo called out gayly: [...] "Carley, you've done twenty-five miles on as rotten a day as I remember. Shore we all hand it to you. And I'm confessing I didn't think you'd ever stay the ride out. Spillbeans is the meanest nag we've got and he has the hardest gait." ...|$|E
6000|$|SHE [white with apprehension] It's Teddy: I {{hear him}} tapping the new barometer. He can't have {{anything}} serious {{on his mind}} or he wouldn't do that. Perhaps Georgina hasn't said anything. [She steals back to the hearth]. Try and look {{as if there was}} nothing the matter. Give me my gloves, quick. [He hands them to her. <b>She</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> one hastily and begins buttoning it with ostentatious unconcern]. Go further away from me, quick.

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> up <b>on</b> {{a plateau}} {{to look at}} her battery. She noted the edge of a brake-band peeping beyond the drum, in a ragged line of fabric and copper wire.

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 May 2002, Sapunova was driving along a road about 32 km {{southwest}} of Moscow, with her 4-year-old daughter and 55-year-old mother Yelena as passengers, when she spotted a sign near the roadside bearing a slogan variously translated as [...] "Death to Yids", or [...] "Death to the Kikes". The sign had in fact been there {{for at least a}} day, but no-one had taken it down. Tatyana was greatly offended by it, stopped her car, and got out to take the sign down. However, it was booby-trapped, and when <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the sign, it set off a bomb, resulting in severe wounds to her legs, hands, and face. She was left with burns and lost sight in one eye.|$|E
5000|$|Jane Stevenson {{from the}} Toronto Sun praised Cyrus' performance, writing, [...] "Cyrus seemed dead serious about having some very {{colorful}} fun for two hours. She opened her show sliding down a giant pink tongue extended from her gaping mouth on an enormous video screen that showed her pretty face {{in all its}} blue-eyed, blond-cropped hair glory... It was a real spectacle." [...] Shawn Conner from USA Today wrote that Cyrus' performance proved that [...] "the {{time has come to}} move the conversation ... beyond the notorious move <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> Robin Thicke at last year's MTV Video Music Awards"; he spoke favorably of the on-screen visuals seen alongside Cyrus and appreciated that she did not lip sync along pre-recorded tracks. Conner also opined that [...] "Cyrus has the charisma and maybe the smarts to be the post-Madonna Madonna", and added that she appeared to be [...] "approachable, on- and off-stage, in a way that Madonna never did." [...] However, in a more mixed review, François Marchand from The Vancouver Sun provided a more negative review; he suggested that Cyrus was [...] "a pop artist in a shiny, attention-grabbing wrapper", and that the performance was neither [...] "the evolution of pop, female empowerment, or mindless fun", but rather [...] "capitalism at work". Sam Lansky writing for TIME magazine praised the singer's performance in Brooklyn calling her one of the [...] "most dynamic performers of her generation." [...] Adam Graham from The Detroit News gave a positive review of the performance in Auburn, writing the show [...] "is like a blast of confetti to the face, a dizzying, non-stop party that leaves you reeling and questioning what you just saw." ...|$|E
