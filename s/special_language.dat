40|$|The {{following}} {{article is}} an attempt to polemize with some stereotypes about translating of <b>special</b> <b>languages.</b> One of such stereotypes is that the translator should have an excellent knowledge of two languages and of the field which the text concerns.

The author shows it on examples from the German and the Polish language witch have been found in the German-Polish Dictionary of Science and Technology edited by M. Sokołowska, A. Bender and K. Żak, and in the German-Polish Dictionary of Sanitary Engineering edited by E. Krzemińska-Niemiec...|$|R

2500|$|For locals, {{another aspect}} of the kingship was also the analogy of [...] "The Lord of the Land" [...] or [...] "He who Rules the Earth" [...] (Phra Chao Phaendin). According to the court etiquette, a <b>special</b> <b>language,</b> Rachasap ( [...] , [...] "Royal Language"), was used to {{communicate}} with or about royalty. In Ayutthaya, the king was said to grant control over land to his subjects, from nobles to commoners, according to the Sakna or Sakdina system [...] codified by King Borommatrailokkanat (1448–88). The Sakdina system was similar to, but not the same as feudalism, under which the monarch does not own the land. While there is no concrete evidence that this land management system constituted a formal palace economy, the French François-Timoléon de Choisy, who came to Ayutthaya in 1685, wrote, [...] "the king has absolute power. He is truly the god of the Siamese: no-one dares to utter his name." [...] Another 17th-century writer, the Dutchman Jan van Vliet, remarked that the King of Siam was [...] "honoured and worshipped by his subjects second to god." [...] Laws and orders were issued by the king. For sometimes the king himself was also the highest judge who judged and punished important criminals such as traitors or rebels.|$|E

Note farther, {{that quite}} {{one of the}} deadliest and most diabolic powers of evil words, or, rightly so called, blasphemy, has been {{developed}} in modern days in the effect of sometimes quite innocently meant and enjoyed 'slang.' There {{are two kinds of}} slang, in the essence of it: one 'Thieves' Latin'--the <b>special</b> <b>language</b> of rascals, used for concealment; the other, one might perhaps best call Louts' Latin!--the lowering or insulting words invented by vile persons to bring good things, in their own estimates, to their own level, or beneath it. The really worst power of this kind of blasphemy is in its often making it impossible to use plain words without a degrading or ludicrous attached sense:--thus I could not end my translation of this epitaph, as the old Latinist could, with the exactly accurate image [...] "to the proud, a file"--because of the abuse of the word in lower English, retaining, however, quite shrewdly, the thirteenth-century idea. But the exact force of the symbol here is in its allusion to jewellers' work, filing down facets. A proud man is often also a precious one: and may be made brighter in surface, and the purity of his inner self shown, by good filing.|$|E

40|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{processes}} of metaphor creation and the uses of metaphor provide valuable insights into the language(s) of science. In particular, they can throw light on theory changes or ‘paradigm shifts’ in physical sciences. Metaphor {{is central to the}} construction of science and its discourse, but research on <b>special</b> <b>languages</b> has mainly focused on its role in term formation. As a consequence, metaphorical meaning making and understanding in the language(s) of science have been somewhat neglected. This paper first reviews contributions to the study of metaphor which can be relevant to the inquiry into the nature and understanding of metaphorical meaning in science, then proposes a framework for analysis of metaphorical processes in the language of physics, and finally provides some examples from the domain of particle physics. The aim is to create a new forum for debate on the nature of metaphorical processes in science and its implications for research into <b>special</b> <b>languages,</b> their terminology and their translation...|$|R
