40|$|AbstractEqualizing bias (EqB) is a {{systematic}} inaccuracy which arises when authorship credit is divided equally among coauthors {{who have not}} contributed equally. As the number of coauthors increases, the diminishing amount of credit allocated to each additional coauthor is increasingly composed of equalizing bias such that when {{the total number of}} coauthors exceeds 12, the credit score of most coauthors is composed mostly of EqB. In general, EqB reverses the byline hierarchy and skews bibliometric assessments by underestimating the contribution of primary authors, i. e. those adversely affected by negative EqB, and overestimating the contribution of <b>secondary</b> <b>authors,</b> those benefitting from positive EqB. The positive and negative effects of EqB are balanced and sum to zero, but are not symmetrical. The lack of symmetry exacerbates the relative effects of EqB, and explains why primary authors are increasingly outnumbered by <b>secondary</b> <b>authors</b> as the number of coauthors increases. Specifically, for a paper with 50 coauthors, the benefit of positive EqB goes to 39 <b>secondary</b> <b>authors</b> while the burden of negative EqB befalls 11 primary authors. Relative to harmonic estimates of their actual contribution, the EqB of the 50 coauthors ranged from 350 %. Senior authorship, when it occurs, is conventionally indicated by a corresponding last author and recognized as being on a par with a first author. If senior authorship is not recognized, then the credit lost by an unrecognized senior author is distributed among the other coauthors as part of their EqB. The powerful distortional effect of EqB is compounded in bibliometric indices and performance rankings derived from biased equal credit. Equalizing bias must therefore be corrected at the source by ensuring accurate accreditation of all coauthors prior to the calculation of aggregate publication metrics...|$|R

Relevant publications by <b>secondary</b> <b>authors</b> Gordon Allport, Kurt Lewin and John Rickman are {{compared with those of}} the primary authors concerning the themes of worldmindedness, ethnic prejudice, and aggressive nationalism. This study focuses on the immediate post-World-War-Two era, (1945 - 1950) when a concern for social and educational reforms characterized many social science efforts. ^ Published and unpublished {{writings of}} the primary authors and related UNESCO proceedings are analyzed and interpreted. Contributions of the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>authors</b> to the UNESCO 2 ̆ 2 Tensions That Cause Wars 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Toward World Understanding 2 ̆ 2 conferences are specifically examined as are relevant contributions from the International Preparatory Commission. The latter, which occurred nearly contemporaneously with these 1948 UNESCO conferences, laid the foundation for the World Federation for Mental Health. The methodology of hermeneutics is employed to examine the themes of education for worldmindedness (now more commonly known as 2 ̆ 2 global education 2 ̆ 2). Potential applications of their worldmindedness perspectives are identified. ^ This study makes several contributions to the literature on global education. First, its analysis of two successful international interdisciplinary conferences concerning worldmindedness and tensions that cause wars provides recommendations for similar future endeavors. Second, conceptual commonalities among these authors have deepened the understanding and interpretation of psychological and educational factors that can encourage or diminish the development of worldmindedness. Third, examination of the perspectives of these authors provides practical contributions for the theory and practice of counseling psychology generally and cross-cultural counseling specifically. ...|$|R

50|$|As {{part of the}} {{freshman}} science curriculum, every Webb student learns the basics of the geological time, evolution, and other processes that shape our planet. In advanced paleontology electives, Honors Advanced Study in Paleontology and Honors Museum Research, students acquire the scientific background necessary to work with fossils, as they learn how museums procure, curate, exhibit, and identify fossils. Also, they are given mini research projects, which involve the review of relevant scientific literature, as well as analysis and interpretation of paleontological data. In the Honors Advanced Museum Research course (for juniors and seniors), students work on a project {{under the supervision of}} Museum Director Dr. Lofgren or Augustyn Family Curator of Paleontology Dr. Farke. Student research projects result in significant contributions to knowledge and are usually published in regional or internationals scientific journals.

40|$|Authorship {{credit for}} multi-authored {{scientific}} publications is routinely allocated either by issuing full publication credit repeatedly to all coauthors, or by dividing one credit equally among all coauthors. The ensuing inflationary and equalizing biases distort derived bibliometric measures of merit by systematically benefiting <b>secondary</b> <b>authors</b> {{at the expense}} of primary authors. Here I show how harmonic counting, which allocates credit according to authorship rank and the number of coauthors, provides simultaneous source-level correction for both biases as well as accommodating further decoding of byline information. I also demonstrate large and erratic effects of counting bias on the original h-index, and show how the harmonic version of the h-index provides unbiased bibliometric ranking of scientific merit while retaining the original’s essential simplicity, transparency and intended fairness. Harmonic decoding of byline information resolves the conundrum of authorship credit allocation by providing a simple recipe for source-level correction of inflationary and equalizing bias. Harmonic counting could also offer unrivalled accuracy in automated assessments of scientific productivity, impact and achievement...|$|R

5000|$|The court {{noted that}} the fourth factor {{was not to be}} given the {{greatest}} weight, but to be taken equally with the other three in a determination of fair use. [...] The analysis for market effect does not look to whether the secondary work detracts from market of the copyrighted work, but rather does it substitute the market of the original (the nature of copyright as a monopoly on publication does not permit a substitution). The court held that the differences in form between The SAT and Seinfeld and the lack of transformative purpose made the book a derivative work in a derivative market. Because the SAT was the only Seinfeld trivia book in existence, it completely substituted this derivative market for the show. The court further reasoned that even though Castle Rock did not intend to enter the trivia book market, the existence of The SAT effectively usurped its right to do so. If the derivative market was one that the copyright holder would generally develop or license, a <b>secondary</b> <b>author</b> would be barred from entering it. On the other hand, if the market was one generally protected by fair use, such as criticism, parody, or academic scholarship, the copyright holder could not enter those markets and attempt to preclude secondary authors from entering.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design {{system for the}} construction and development of timber structures that use 3 D metal-printed nodes. It explains how, {{through the use of}} an open-ended design system, small-scale structures are generated from basic geometric inputs. Embedded structural analysis produces load scenarios for the node connections, which are topologically optimized and 3 D printed from metal. Such rapid manufacturing promises high levels of geometric flexibility, which can be customized to various geometric and loading scenarios. Both topological optimization for structure and other optimization processes directly related to the manufacturing process allow for material and weight reductions of up to 60 per cent. It is intended that the nodes can be produced in areas of such high-tech production and shipped using existing distribution networks to remote areas where they are to be combined with standardized and widely available timber, thus reducing transportation costs and overall embodied energy. The centralized production of high-tech parts and the incorporated performance analysis and optimization opens up the automated design setup to multiple <b>secondary</b> <b>authors</b> for implementation in various, possibly remote or rural, areas and communities...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Manual {{searches}} are supplemental {{approaches to}} database searches to identify additional primary studies for systematic reviews. The authors {{argue that these}} manual approaches, in particular hand-searching and perusing reference lists, are often considered the same yet lead to different outcomes. Methods: We conducted a PubMed search for systematic reviews in the top 10 dermatology journals (January 2006 –January 2016). After screening, the final sample comprised 292 reviews. Statements related to manual searches were extracted from each review and categorized by the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>authors.</b> Each statement was categorized as either ‘‘Search of Reference List,’’ ‘‘Hand Search,’’ ‘‘Both,’’ or ‘‘Unclear. ’’ Results: Of the 292 systematic reviews included in our sample, 143 reviews (48. 97 %) did not report a hand-search or scan of reference lists. One-hundred thirty-six reviews (46. 58 %) reported searches of reference lists, while 4 reviews (1. 37 %) reported systematic hand-searches. Three reviews (1. 03 %) reported use of both hand-searches and scanning reference lists. Six reviews (2. 05 %) were classified as unclear due to vague wording. Conclusions: Authors of systematic reviews published in dermatology journals in our study sample scanned reference lists more frequently than they conducted hand-searches, possibly contributing to biased search outcomes. We encourage systematic reviewers to routinely practice hand-searching {{in order to minimize}} bias...|$|R
