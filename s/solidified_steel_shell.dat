40|$|A {{model for}} the {{formation}} of oscillation marks in continuous casting of steel will be derived and evalu-ated numerically. Liquid steel is injected through a submerged nozzle into an intensively cooled mould. At the wall the steel solidifies and the solidified shell is withdrawn vertically. Flux powder is added at the top of liquid steel. It melts (slag) and thus it serves as a lubricant for the passage of the steel shell through the mould. In order to prevent sticking of the steel onto the mould it oscillates vertically leaving oscillation marks {{on the surface of the}} <b>solidified</b> <b>steel</b> <b>shell.</b> In the present study the interaction of the steel melt, the <b>solidified</b> <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and the slag will be inves-tigated. On the basis of thin layer approximations for the slag flow and heat transfer through the steel shell, slag and mould, respectively, and dominating surface tension at the interface liquid steel/liquid slag a mathematical model will be derived, solved numerically and compared with data reported in the literature. The flow problem for the slag flow is closely related to the well known coating problem...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMold fluxes play an {{important}} role in the steel continuous casting process. Mainly, they must prove adequate lubrication between the <b>solidified</b> <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and the copper mold. Thus, the knowledge of mold flux viscosity with the temperature is a relevant property for industry applications in order to prevent operation problems and product defects. On the other hand, for environmental reasons, the replacement of fluorine by non-pollutants compounds, is one of the objectives in the design of new compositions for these slags. In this paper, the viscosity is calculated in the range: 1250 - 1400 ¼C applying two models based on their chemical composition and another one using the differential thermal analysis technique. The results obtained with this model showed a good correlation with respect to other traditional models using the chemical composition of the mold flux to estimate the viscosity. The aim is to observe the effect of different oxides on the viscosity of mold fluxes. One of the mold powders was designed with a chemical composition similar to a commercial one (containing 10 wt% of fluorine), while the others powders were fluorine-free (containing boron and lithium). It should be noted that a fluorine-free powder with a viscosity similar to the powder with fluorine was produced replacing 10 wt% fluorine by 4 wt% Li 2 O and 6 wt% B 2 O 3...|$|E
40|$|Mold powders {{are mainly}} formed of such oxides as SiO 2, CaO, Al 2 O 3, Na 2 O along with F − and C. One {{of the main}} con-stitutional composes of mold powders is F−, which is {{utilized}} in chemical composition of mold powders due to its fea-tures of controlling viscosity and producing desired lubrication between <b>solidified</b> <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and mold. However, the emission of F − through such compositions as HF (g) causes health and environmental problems. The purpose {{of this research is}} to decrease, and subsequently substitute, F − in chemical composition of a lubricating high speed powder, which is used in continuous casting of steel industry. A combination of Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2 compositions to substitute F − in chemical composition of a fluorine-free mold powder was used to meet the purpose of this research. In addition, nine powder samples (A-I) with laboratory scale were prepared. In order to evaluate the samples ’ viscosity behavior, groove viscometer test and image analysis software was used and to evaluate the crystalline behavior of samples C and G, XRD and SEM analyses were conducted. The results of these analyses demonstrated that the fluorine-free sample, due to its viscosity resemblance in comparison with molten reference powder and through creation of such crystalline phases as Perovskite (CaTiO 3) and Fayalite (Fe 2 SiO 4), will result in viscosity control of the mold powder and therefore optimizing continuous casting conditions. Finally, it is possible to derive that this sample may be an appropriate substitution for the reference powder being utilized in steel continuous casting industry...|$|E

The steady-state temperature distribution in the mold is calculated in three-dimensions, and then used to calibrate and validate a simpler one-dimensional model of mold heat transfer. The results are applied to explain the effect of mold wear on the measured mold temperatures and heat fluxes. Investigation of the mechanical behavior of the solidifying shell has identified the geometry of the funnel has little influence on the thermal behavior of the solidifying shell, but induces a bending effect in the shell that is absent in conventional parallel-face molds. This bending effect is shown to increase the likelihood of crack formation in the “inside curve” region of the funnel, due to increased tensile stress on the solidification front. This mechanical effect can be mitigated by using a shallow and wide funnel with no inner flat region. Naturally, this finding needs to be balanced with the original purpose of the funnel, to allow room for the submerged entry nozzle, and with other crack mechanisms in order to find the optimal funnel-shape design...|$|R
40|$|Continuous casting {{technology}} {{has been one of}} the main technologies that has adequately driven the production costs of alloys down. An understanding of the solidification behavior of metallurgical slags (e. g. continuous casting mold slags) is the basis for optimization of continuous casting as the solidification behavior of mold slag significantly influences the lubrication between the <b>solidified</b> <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and the copper mold, and the thermal resistance at the interface between mold flux film and mold, therefore further controlling the heat transfer in continuous casting practice. The behavior of oxide dissolution in metallurgical slags is at least related with three applications, i. e. metal cleanliness, refractory degradation and slag formation in metallurgical processes. Therefore, providing fundamental information related to the solidification and dissolution characteristics of metallurgical slags has become essential. In order to avoid and reduce time-consuming and expensive experiments at high temperatures, numerical simulation is increasingly used. It offers complementary insights in experimental results and contributes to the determination of the fundamental phenomena at the root of the observed behavior. In this work, the phase-field method coupled with the FACTSage Toxide thermodynamic database is adopted to investigate all the factors affecting the solidification and dissolution behavior of metallurgical slags, such as temperature and composition. Isothermal crystallization of hexagonal Wollastonite in ternary CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 melts was simulated using quantitative phase-field modelling. Simulation results show a transition from flat to dendritic growth of CaSiO 3, where the formation of dendritic Wollastonite is favorable at a lower Al 2 O 3 content, a lower temperature and a stronger anisotropy in interfacial energy. Simulations also show that the dendrite tip velocity firstly increases until it reaches a maximum value and then decreases slowly when further decreasing the temperature. The results show that the effect of anisotropy strength in solid-liquid interfacial energy on the tip velocity is less important for crystals with hexagonal symmetry than for crystals with cubic symmetry. Moreover, in the present work, a modified analytical Kurz, Giovanola, and Trivedi (KGT) model considering the effects of solute interactions on diffusion and the dendrite tip velocity has been adopted by replacing the main diagonal diffusion coefficients by the eigenvalues of the full diffusion matrix. Validation of the modified model was performed by comparing the phase-field results with the modified KGT model, showing a good quantitative agreement. Furthermore, the crystallization behavior of CaSiO 3 was comprehensively investigated using in-situ confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) for different CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 melts and over a wide range of temperatures. It was observed that the undercooling required for dendritic growth increases with decreasing Al 2 O 3 content (for the same basicity) and increasing basicity (for the same Al 2 O 3 content). With increasing temperature, the growth rate first increases and then decreases. The experimental results are consistent with the simulation results, which further validates the applied phase-field approach. A phase-field model has also been implemented to study the dissolution behavior of alumina (Al 2 O 3) in CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 slags. The simulations allowed evaluating the influence of temperature and composition on the diffusion paths and dissolution rates for the dissolution of Al 2 O 3 solid particles into CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 slags. The results obtained in the simulations are consistent with experimental observations and the predictions from an analytical dissolution model. The phase field simulations show that the dissolution rate of Al 2 O 3 increases with temperature. Increasing CaO/SiO 2 at a fixed Al 2 O 3 content or decreasing Al 2 O 3 content at a fixed CaO/SiO 2 ratio also results in a higher dissolution rate of Al 2 O 3. The results are further interpreted based on thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} of stress generation in casting processes is a difficult, complex subject {{that is now}} receiving increased attention. This paper reviews the basic equations, solution methods and important phenomena associated with casting processes that require special numerical treatment. Stress modeling begins with a coupled, transient heat transfer analysis, including solidification, shrinkage-dependent interfacial heat transfer, and fluid flow effects. Further complicating phenomena include phase transformations, temperature, stress and structure-dependent plastic-creep, interaction between the casting and the mold, hydrostatic pressure from the liquid, the effects of fluid flow, and crack formation.

The stress model includes the temperature and composition-dependent effects of phase transformation on both the thermal linear expansion / contraction behavior, creep behavior, and pseudo-strain due to flow in the liquid.

Results are compared for 0. 044 %C and 0. 1 %C steels and for both cooling conditions.

40|$|Mold slag {{friction}} and fracture may cause heat transfer variations in continuous casting, {{which leads to}} <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> temperature and stress variations, resulting in surface cracks. Analytical transient models of liquid slag flow and solid slag stress have been coupled with a finite-difference model of heat transfer in the mold, gap and <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> to predict transient shear stress, friction, slip and fracture of the slag layers. The models are validated by comparing with numerical models and plant measurements of mold friction. Using reported slag fracture strength and TTT diagrams, the models are applied to study the effect of casting speed and mold powder viscosity properties on slag layer behavior between the oscillating mold wall and the <b>solidifying</b> <b>steel</b> <b>shell.</b> The study finds that liquid slag lubrication would produce negligible stresses. Lower mold slag consumption rate leads to high solid {{friction and}} results in solid slag layer fracture and movement below a critical value.

40|$|The {{entrapment}} of inclusions, bubbles, slag, {{and other}} particles into <b>solidified</b> <b>steel</b> products is a critically-important quality concern. During continuous casting, particles may enter the mold with the steel {{flowing through the}} submerged nozzle. In addition, mold slag may be entrained from the top surface. A computational model has been developed to simulate the transport and entrapment of particles from both of these sources. The model first computes transient turbulent flow in the mold region using Large Eddy Simulation (LES), with the sub-grid-scale (SGS) k model. Next, the transport and capture of over 30, 000 particles are simulated using a Lagrangian approach to track the trajectories. A new criterion was developed to model particle pushing and capture by a dendritic interface and was incorporated into the particle transport model. Particles smaller than the primary dendrite arm spacing are entrapped if they enter the boundary layer region and touch the <b>solidifying</b> <b>steel</b> <b>shell.</b> Larger particles are entrapped only if they remain stable while the shell grows around them. The new criterion models this by considering a balance of ten different forces which act on a particle in the boundary layer region, including the bulk hydrodynamic forces (lift, pressure gradient, stress gradient, Basset, and added mass forces), transverse drag force, (caused by fluid flow across the dendrite interface), gravity (buoyancy) force, and the forces acting at the interface (Van der Waals interfacial force, lubrication drag force, and surface energy gradient force).

40|$|Abstract—Surface quality {{problems}} in continuous cast steel are greatly aected by heat transfer across the interfacial layers {{in the gap}} between the <b>solidifying</b> <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and the mold. An experimental appar-atus has been constructed to measure temperatures in the steel, mold flux layers, and copper under con-ditions approximating those in continuous casting. The flux solidified in multiple layers similar to those observed from continuous casting molds and contained many gas bubbles. Flux conductivities average about 1. 0 W/m K and appear to evolve with time. Contact resistances at both interfaces are significant and average about 0. 0015 m 2 K/W. Flux crystallization appears to be the only significant eect of flux composition. The one glassy flux tested had much greater thermal conductivities, presumably due to radiation transport. Temperature and gap thickness had a negligible eect on the properties. These properties depend on the model used to extract them. They are being implemented into a mathematical model to simulate heat transfer in the mold, interface, and solidifying shell of a continuous slab-casting machine. # 2000 Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.
