30|$|Using {{dissecting}} scissors, each thallus {{was carefully}} {{removed from the}} stipe. Assuming that each water-filled thallus was roughly columnar in shape, we measured thallus volume using the formula V = πr 2 h, where h was the length and r was the width at the widest point on the thallus. The thin seawater-filled sac was held vertically and {{the tip of the}} thallus was cut with a <b>scissor.</b> <b>To</b> measure seawater volume, the internal water was withdrawn using a calibrated 5  cc wide mouth syringe. The content of the syringe was transferred into a watch glass and examined for fauna under a binocular stereo microscope (Olympus 10 X). Most specimens were identified as close to their taxonomic level as possible using available taxonomic keys (Light and Carlton 2007) and their abundance noted. 10 min were spent observing interactions (if any) between the colonizers for each thallus. Other recognizable intra-thallus components (e.g., phytoplankton, detritus, molt remnants, etc.) were also noted for documenting additional ecological associations.|$|E
40|$|Synapse {{crossbar}} is {{an elementary}} structure in Neuromorphic Computing Systems (NCS). However, the limited size of crossbars and heavy routing congestion impedes the NCS implementations of big neural networks. In this paper, we propose a two-step framework (namely, group <b>scissor)</b> <b>to</b> scale NCS designs to big neural networks. The {{first step is}} rank clipping, which integrates low-rank approximation into the training to reduce total crossbar area. The second step is group connection deletion, which structurally prunes connections to reduce routing congestion between crossbars. Tested on convolutional neural networks of LeNet on MNIST database and ConvNet on CIFAR- 10 database, our experiments show significant reduction of crossbar area and routing area in NCS designs. Without accuracy loss, rank clipping reduces total crossbar area to 13. 62 % and 51. 81 % in the NCS designs of LeNet and ConvNet, respectively. Following rank clipping, group connection deletion further reduces the routing area of LeNet and ConvNet to 8. 1 % and 52. 06 %, respectively. Comment: Accepted in DAC 201...|$|E

40|$|Current {{research}} has focused on visual feedback for the development of virtual surgery. However, {{little is known about the}} haptic feedback required for realistic simulation. The forces necessary for the cutting of anatomical tissues were investigated for three surgical scissors: the Mayo dissection scissor, the Metzenbaum dissection scissor and the Iris scissor. Several experiments were completed in conjunction with a surgical doctor to acquire force data for analysis. This work aimed to establish the force-position relationship, find any invariant properties for tissues or scissors, and determine the frequency components present in the force signal as well as the significance of the cutting rate. General trends in the data were discovered, and necessary improvements to the experimental method for the determination of more exact quantitative measures were identified. In general, both the measurable force magnitude and "texture" differences contribute to the difference in tactile perception between a blank run and a tissue cutting run. This is a low frequency texture, as 99 % of the frequency components of the signal are below 5 Hz. The force measurements were determined to be independent of the cutting speed for the Mayo and Metzenbaum scissor runs, whereas results for the Iris scissors were inconclusive. The scissor sensitivity while cutting the tissue longitudinally or transversally appears to be a function of both the tissue and the <b>scissor.</b> <b>To</b> further determine the tactile feedback required for simulation, future experiments should account for the "user grip", tissue thickness, tissue moisture content, hand orientation, and innate scissor dynamics. A database of the collected force and position data has been created on the Internet (Site:[URL] This data allows current force feedback devices, such as the Freedom- 7, to determine the feasibility of realistic haptic simulation...|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} pseudorotation {{occurs when the}} two axial ligands close {{like a pair of}} {{scissors}} pushing their way in between two of the equatorial groups which <b>scissor</b> out <b>to</b> accommodate them. Both the axial and equatorial constituents move at the same rate of increasing the angle between the other axial or equatorial constituent. This forms a square based pyramid where the base is the four interchanging ligands and the tip is the pivot ligand, which has not moved. The two originally equatorial ligands then open out until they are 180 degrees apart, becoming axial groups perpendicular to where the axial groups were before the pseudorotation. This requires about 3.6 kcal/mol in PF5.|$|R
