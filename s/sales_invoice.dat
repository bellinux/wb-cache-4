A single chrome bar connected quad headlights (which became a familiar Chevrolet trademark with its concurrent light duty pickup trucks) with a revised front grille, now cast in ABS plastic, and a slotted bumper held the parking lights. Taillight lenses were {{larger and more}} vertical, flowing into the quarter panels. Front vent windows (hardtop and convertibles only) began to fade away now that Astro Ventilation (first introduced on the 1966 Buick Riviera which was used a year earlier on the Camaro and Caprice) was sending outside air into several Chevelle models. The Chevelle lineup slimmed down to Nomad, 300 Deluxe/Greenbrier, Malibu/Concours, and Concours Estate series, and the base 300 series was history. [...] No longer a series of its own, the SS 396 turned into a $347.60 option package for any two-door model.

[...] Fewer SS396-optioned 300 Deluxe coupes and sport coupes were built than their Malibu counterparts and they are solid gold for collectors. The Super Sport option included a 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 beneath a double-domed hood, along with a black-out grille displaying an SS emblem and a black rear panel.

During the 1969 model year a police package (RPO B07) was available on the Chevelle 300 Deluxe 4-door sedan where some were optioned with the RPO L35 (396) motor along with a boxed frame (also shared with fleet orders e.g. taxicabs and rental cars); at the time the police option was reintroduced since the 1964/65 model years (at the time midsize squads came with economy powertrain usually {{in the case of the}} Chevelle a third generation Chevrolet inline six.

" Using data from New Orleans newspapers, we find that most sales advertisements include information about the slave's skill or occupation. A comparison of the advertisement with the corresponding invoice shows that the slave's occupation was often omitted from the <b>sales</b> <b>invoice.</b> Because the slave's market price should reflect all relevant information available at the time of sale, the informational value of the slave's advertised occupation can be estimated using regression analysis. Interestingly, we find that the qualitative description of the slave's skill level affected his market price more than his advertised occupation. For example, an "excellent" cook commanded a premium price whereas a "plain" or "tolerable" cook did not.

This CASE/ERP's main modules, which based on ERP theory. The thesis specifies every module's actual business requirements, business data flow, database structure, and main function design. CASE/ERP is a software package for the enterprise's management. It includes almost every aspects of the enterprise. The main modules of CASE/ERP are purchase, inventory, sale, distribution, transportation, general ledger, financial table, accounts receivable, account payable, budget, fixed assets, salary, cost, production data, master production scheduling, material requirements planning, capacity requirements planning, workshop control, just in time production, human resource, facilities, quality control, business forecast and policy decision etc. CASE/ERP is essentially different from the single module development software. Its modules are highly integrates, one module's data can be shared with another. High integration bring more difficulties to the software design and implementation. The modules of CASE/ERP are related with database. We design the databases according to the principle of 'one thing one database'. We describe almost every attributes of an entity in one database. Then along with the business process flow, we design the correlation functions (using by different department) to update some attributes of the entity. The system design of CASE/ERP has three main lines, they are purchase-sale-inventory, manufacture and finance. The business within each main line is relatively tight connection. And we establish relationships between main lines by common database. The module providing the data, writes the information into the common databases. The module using the data, reads the information from the common databases. The thesis introduces the design and implementation process of CASE/ERP's material, manufacture, sales, financing, and cost. The content of each chapter and the relationship between them are specified as follows: The material system of CASE/ERP includes such contents as purchase requirement, purchase order, goods receiving, and the inventory business. The main function of this system includes collecting the requirements of material from the material requirements and inventory reordering planning; referring to the vendor's status and the material's purchase lot policy and lead time to make purchase orders; checking and accepting purchase material; registering warehouse account; distributing material in warehouse, recording each inventory operation information such as material in, out, moving, and taking stock. The manufacture system of CASE/ERP includes such contents as production data, MPS (master production scheduling), MRP (material requirements planning), CRP (capacity requirements planning), workshop control and JIT (just in time production) etc. The main functions of this system are: recording production data, such as product structure, working center and manufacture routing etc.; working out master production scheduling according to the customer order and sales forecast; calculating the need quantity and need time of the material for manufacture, working out the material requirements planning; comparing the working load and the capability of working center in a period of time, working out the capacity requirements planning; arranging the production mission of workshop and production line. The sales system of CASE/ERP deals with sales planning, sales order, goods delivering, and <b>sales</b> <b>invoice.</b> Sales order is the center of the sales business. The main functions of this system are: referring to the yearly production planning to work out the products sales planning; recording the customers' orders; making out the shipment sheet, recording the actual shipment information; making out the <b>sales</b> <b>invoice</b> and notifying the financial department to settle the account receivable. The financing system of CASE/ERP includes such contents as general ledger, cash control, financial table, accounts payable, account receivable, etc. The financing system controls all the enterprise's economical activities, account the enterprise's current assets and fixed assets and liabilities and owner's equity. The main functions of this system are: applying for reimbursement; checking the account of cash in bank; defining and printing financial table; settling the account payable for purchase goods; settling the account receivable for sale products. The cost system of CASE/ERP includes such contents as standard cost calculate, actual cost calculate, cost planning. The cost system distributes the direct materials and the direct labor and manufacturing expenses to the products, and calculates the actuarial cost for each product. Cost system compares the actuarial cost with the planning cost and the standard cost. Through the comparison, we can analyze whether the actuarial cost structure is right, and find the right way to reduce production costs. CASE/ERP conforms to the method provided by software engineering during the development process. By reason of the limit of pages, the thesis only specifies main module's design and implementation process, and only describes some main database structures and main programs flow charts. At present, CASE/ERP has already been successfully used in some large enterprises. It brings many benefits for enterprise's management...|$|E

The problem also experienced by Sinar Jaya Iron Shop that specializes in the sale. To overcome these problems, the authors designed a control system sales and purchases that have been computerized, where the system using Microsoft Visual Basic 6. 0 and uses Microsoft Access 2003 database and Seagate Crystal Report 8. 5 for report generation and run on Microsoft Windows 98 operating system or a higher version of Windows. With this system, manually inputted data will be processed by the database management system better. With the computerized system, the Sinar Jaya Iron Stores will gain some convenience gained from the system include minimizing the error in terms of inventory control, sales and purchase transactions. Systems also provide ease in viewing the merchandise inventory, printing <b>sales</b> <b>invoices,</b> card making supplies of goods, and report the movement of goods...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{standard}} theoretical model of tax enforcement by {{allowing for the}} cross- matching of transactions {{in addition to the}} auditing of taxpayers. For the Value Added Tax (VAT) the matching of purchase and <b>sales</b> <b>invoices</b> is an important enforcement technique. The paper examines the impact such enforcement on the revenue effectiveness and efficiency consequences of the VAT. Transactions matching is shown to have very different effects from auditing: Even when auditing alone is unable to induce non-zero taxpayer reports, and regardless of the expected success rate in auditing of the tax administration, sufficiently intensive cross- matching can induce truthful reporting. On the other hand, matching leads to distorted purchase and sales transactions. It can also distort input use and output decisions even if auditing alone has no adverse effects. In the model, conditions under which the VAT leaves input prices undistorted are found and the content of the often made claim, that a VAT is self-enforcing, is explored. The ability of the tax administration to enforce compliance with the VAT is shown {{to be sensitive to the}} knowledge that the tax administration has about the production technology. ...|$|R
5000|$|Tables are data {{containers}} {{that exist}} in the underlying relational database. In the majority of cases there is a 1-to-1 relationship between the definition of a table in the ABAP Dictionary and the definition of that same table in the database (same name, same columns). These tables are known as [...] "transparent". There are two types of non-transparent tables: [...] "pooled" [...] tables exist as independent entities in the ABAP Dictionary but they are grouped together in large physical tables ("pools") at the database level. Pooled tables are often small tables holding for example configuration data. [...] "Clustered" [...] tables are physically grouped in [...] "clusters" [...] based on their primary keys; for instance, assume that a clustered table H contains [...] "header" [...] data about <b>sales</b> <b>invoices,</b> whereas another clustered table D holds the invoice line items. Each row of H would then be physically grouped with the related rows from D inside a [...] "cluster table" [...] in the database. This type of clustering, which is designed to improve performance, also exists as native functionality in some, though not all, relational database systems.|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} in theoretical part explaining the term CRM, its history, development and modern trends. It describes company procedures and various CRM functions. It also discusses the theoretical benefits of CRM and its implementation in the company. The practical part introduces a real company, analyzes its business processes {{with a focus}} on their flaws and their subsequent optimization. It processes questionnaires filled out by the departments of <b>sales</b> and <b>invoicing</b> and interviews with the heads of these departments. Based on the acquired knowledge, recommendations for the introduction of CRM are made...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the history}} of {{unfulfilled}} predictions {{in the field of}} computers and information processing, it is with considerable trepidation that one must approach a forecast such as that in the title. The consolation, perhaps, is that there is little chance that I will personally be taken to task for the inevitable errors and misjudgments that will appear below. Another consolation is that it may well be easier to make such forecasts now, with 50 years experience behind us, that it must have been when LEO – Lyons Electronic Office 1 - was first created. In 1947, the authors of the first report for J. Lyons on possible business uses of electronic computers gave three examples of potential future applications – <b>sales</b> <b>invoicing,</b> letter writing, and payroll preparation (Thompson 1998). The fact that they could not foresee on- line real- time processing is not surprising given that the enabling technologies did not yet exist. It is sufficiently impressive that they saw as far ahead as they did; the ability to foresee word processing (“letter writing”) a good 20 years ahead of its time was no mean feat. We face the same problem in attempting to forecast 50 years ahead in that we can hardly guess at the technologies that may then be available. At best, we can extrapolate from current developments. The advent of biological computers, for example, could completely change th...|$|R
