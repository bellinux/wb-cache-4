5|$|Much as {{they had}} in {{previous}} stages, race leader Denis Menchov {{and the man in}} second place Danilo Di Luca stayed right with one another all through the climb, as Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov with attacks, but was unable to. Pellizotti, who had also been holding their wheels, took the opportunity with the two of them taking energy out of each other, to come clear and move into third position on the road. Basso, who was up the road, dutifully <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> waited for his better-placed teammate and paced him to a small gap over Menchov and Di Luca before cracking. It was enough to ensure Pellizotti second on the stage, to keep him third in the overall classification. Di Luca managed to outsprint Menchov to the line and claim 8 bonus seconds to narrow his deficit to 18 seconds, but with only a flat stage and an individual time trial remaining the superior time trialist Menchov had the advantage.|$|E
5|$|The next match pitted the Undertaker against Kamala, who was {{accompanied}} by his manager, Harvey Wippleman, and his handler, Kim Chee. Kamala attacked before the match but the Undertaker blocked the attack and punched Kamala repeatedly before performing a chop from the top rope on his opponent. The Undertaker attempted the same move again, but Wippleman knocked the Undertaker off the rope. Kamala knocked the Undertaker outside the ring, where the Undertaker attacked Wippleman and Kim Chee. Back inside the ring, the Undertaker gained the advantage by executing a chokeslam and a clothesline. When the Undertaker attempted his signature move, the Tombstone Piledriver, Kim Chee ran into the ring and hit the Undertaker with a pith helmet. As a result, Kamala was disqualified and the Undertaker won the match. Kamala kept on attacking and hit Undertaker {{with a series of}} splashes and seemingly left his opponent unconscious. When the Undertaker suddenly <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> looked directly at the Ugandan Giant, Kamala, Whippleman and Kim Chee panicked and fled ringside with The Undertaker and Paul Bearer slowly walking in pursuit.|$|E

25|$|The {{two were}} quickly {{joined by a}} {{counter-attack}} from Axel Merckx and Sandy Casar; Boogerd and Lefevre <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> allowed those two to join them. Casar struck a dog on the road when he and Frederick Willems were chasing Boogerd and Lefevre, {{and both of them}} went down. Casar got up quickly, but Willems was slower and wound up being absorbed by the peloton. The crash resulted in Casar tearing his gear and having to ride with a nasty wound on his exposed buttocks, since dropping off to change and have the wound treated would cost him his position. Later, the race doctor's car made it up to the leading group to tend to Casar's hip and right elbow, as well as a bee sting sustained by Boogerd.|$|E
500|$|The first {{breakaway}} of the {{day came}} from Jonathan Hivert (...) [...] He attacked alone and took both the mountains points and the victory at the first intermediate sprint. Despite at one point having a lead of nearly four minutes, he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> was caught by the peloton. Michael Matthews (...) , in eighth place after the prologue, took {{second place in the}} intermediate sprint to win two bonus seconds, moving him to ten seconds behind Kwiatkowski, while John Degenkolb (...) took a second for finishing third.|$|E
500|$|An early {{breakaway}} {{was formed}} of Jef Van Meirhaeghe (...) (the {{leader of the}} combativity award and in the breakaway for the fourth consecutive stage), his teammate Gijs Van Hoecke, Stijn Vandenbergh (...) and points classification leader Andrea Guardini (...) [...] Guardini and Van Meirhaeghe contested the intermediate sprint after , taking points for their respective classifications, then <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> were caught by the peloton. Vandenbergh and Van Hoecke were allowed to build a lead of nearly 15 minutes, before the peloton increased its speed. The breakaway was caught with less than [...] to go.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} the recording, McCartney {{was eager to}} gauge {{the reaction of the}} band's contemporaries. On 2 May, he played the song to Bob Dylan at the latter's hotel suite in London; as the track started, Dylan said dismissively: [...] "Oh, I get it. You don't want to be cute anymore." [...] According to Marianne Faithfull, who was also present, Dylan then walked out of the room. McCartney recalled that when the Beatles played the song to members of the Rolling Stones and the Who, they [...] "visibly <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> were interested", whereas Cilla Black [...] "just laughed".|$|E
500|$|An early {{breakaway}} {{formed at}} , involving Yukiya Arashiro (...) , Stijn Devolder (...) and Alessandro Vanotti (...) [...] They were caught, however, on the climb at Montelparo, as [...] increased the pace in the peloton. Their team leader, Alberto Contador, {{was one of}} the riders to set the pace on behalf of Peter Sagan. On this climb, several of the race's main sprinters were unable to stay with the peloton. These included Mark Cavendish (...) and Luka Mezgec (...) [...] The breakaway's advantage had been reduced to 1' 30" [...] and, soon after the summit of the climb, Devolvder <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> was caught. Arashiro and Vanotti were caught soon after, with [...] still to race.|$|E
500|$|Wolstencroft {{stated that}} after {{watching}} the episode with his friends, they both commended and criticised his work: [...] "I got some angry phone calls from my friends the next day saying 'how could you, but well done, but how could you, {{but she was so}} nice, but how could you, but well done'." [...] Oyelowo also responded to the controversy, believing that it came from a result of Faulkner's male fans. Comedian Charlie Brooker however, commended the scene, as well as the series in general, stating in his Guardian column: [...] "The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> blinked in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation." [...] In a January 2010 poll, fans of the show voted Helen's death as the [...] "most shocking death scene" [...] in the series, drawing 49% of the votes.|$|E

500|$|The day's {{breakaway}} took a {{long time}} to form. Various riders attacked, but the peloton brought back all the moves for the first [...] of racing. Eventually a five-rider breakaway was allowed to form, composed of Steve Cummings (MTN-Qhubeka), Peter Velits (BMC), Kristijan Đurasek (Lampre-Merida), Niki Terpstra (Etixx-Quick Step), and Cyril Gautier (Europcar), and they were soon joined by Miguel Ángel Rubiano (Colombia). The six riders gained a lead of over four minutes, but it was already being brought back by the peloton by the time they reached the Alto de Baeza, where Gautier was the first rider to the summit. Giant-Alpecin (on behalf of Dumoulin) and Movistar controlled the pace at the front of the peloton. With [...] remaining, as the roads began to go uphill, the lead was under a minute. Cummings attacked with [...] to the end of the stage and built a lead: with [...] to the finish line his lead was 48 seconds. Terpstra was the only rider from the breakaway to chase him; the other riders <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> were caught by the peloton.|$|E
500|$|... {{continued}} to work to soften up the field. Przemysław Niemiec was the first, and with only [...] left, Damiano Cunego was the last, as their leader Michele Scarponi figured to need to take not only the blue jersey but time in hand over race leader Cadel Evans should he hope to win the race overall, since Evans is the stronger time trialist. On the final ascent, Scarponi and Vincenzo Nibali both got clear of the lead group of overall favorites, but both strangely <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> stopped riding hard, eying one another, after a turn in the road. This allowed Evans and the other top contenders to catch them. With [...] to go, Evans hit the front himself, and never gave up first position, holding on for the stage victory. He confirmed after the stage {{that he had come}} in simply hoping to retain the race lead, or at least limit any major losses, but when the opportunity to increase that lead presented itself, he took full advantage.|$|E
500|$|Having caught Kern and Feillu on the road, {{the group}} lost {{ground to the}} peloton and with Wiggins later joining up with the group, Evans' efforts were in vain; with the group now back {{together}} as a whole, their efforts {{went back to the}} original break. Kern was part of another six-rider wave that went clear on the descent from the Col de Richemond, with the highest-placed rider being ninth-placed Luis León Sánchez of [...] [...] took up station {{on the front of the}} main field, not allowing Sánchez to gain too much ground. The gap peaked out at around the 30-second mark and with nobody looking to help Sánchez with the pace-making in the group, they <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> allowed to be reabsorbed into the peloton. 's Arthur Vichot attacked out of the lead group with around [...] to go, and soloed away from his breakaway companions to take the victory by 26 seconds from the rest of the group. The peloton crossed the line around one minute down on Vichot, with Wiggins maintaining his 38-second overall lead as he was part of that group.|$|E

500|$|The {{first series}} {{attracted}} controversy for its second episode, which saw {{the demise of}} a main character after her hand and head were forced into a deep fryer. The scene attracted over 250 complaints, 154 {{of them to the}} television watchdog, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002. Following the complaints, the BBC admitted that the scene [...] "clearly disturbed" [...] several viewers, but defended it as it was showing the audience [...] "the kind of threat which might be faced by agents engaged in the fight against terrorism." [...] The Broadcasting Standards Commission stated the scene was shocking, but [...] "in the context was acceptable and important for the later narrative". However the watchdog still criticised the BBC for failing to warn viewers of the violence to come in the scene. The controversy sparked a response from comedian Charlie Brooker in his Guardian column, stating: [...] "The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> blinked in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation." ...|$|E

Regarding this method of treatment, Cavett is quoted as saying, [...] "In my case, ECT was miraculous.

2500|$|In 2002, rugby {{commentator}} Bill McLaren named David Campese on {{the wing}} in his greatest ever World XV, citing him as his favourite player.

Sometimes it didn't work, {{but he was always}} willing to try. Andy Irvine was similar, but Campese was the one. He carried the commentary along with the play." [...] In the tribute book David Campese McLaren wrote that, [...] "He and Mike Gibson of Ireland are the most complete footballers I have ever seen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Just as he {{had done}} the {{previous}} day, Martin Kohler of [...] made it into the race's primary breakaway of the day, and was joined again by a rider from the UniSA-Australia team, with Will Clarke – fresh from a late-stage attack the previous day – joining Kohler out front. Clarke and Kohler remained together for just over , with Clarke taking maximum points in the categorised climb at Lenswood, while Kohler twice bested Clarke at the intermediate sprints during the early running, and with the bonus seconds, it allowed him to move into the virtual lead of the race, as he was only four seconds behind race leader André Greipel (...) overnight. The pair extended their advantage over the peloton to eleven minutes, before Kohler <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> elected to return to the main field.|$|E
2500|$|As {{most of the}} {{customers}} tried to hide beneath tables and service booths, Huberty turned his attention toward six women and children huddled together. He first shot and killed 19-year-old María Colmenero-Silva with a single gunshot to the chest, then fatally shot 9-year-old Claudia Perez in the stomach, cheek, thigh, hip, leg, chest, back, armpit, and head with his Uzi. He then wounded Perez's 15-year-old sister Imelda once in the chest with the same weapon, and fired upon 11-year-old Aurora Peña with the shotgun. Peña—initially wounded in the leg—had been shielded by her pregnant aunt, 18-year-old Jackie Reyes. Huberty shot Reyes 48 times with the Uzi.

2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years, and {{lived to be}} 147 years old. When Jacob's death drew near, he called his son Joseph {{and asked him to}} put his hand under Jacob's thigh and swear not to bury him in Egypt, but to bury him with his father and grandfather. Joseph agreed, but Jacob insisted that he swear to, and so he did, and Jacob bowed. Later, when one told Joseph that his father was sick, Joseph took his sons Manasseh and Ephraim to see him. Jacob <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> told Joseph that God {{appeared}} to him at Luz, blessed him, and told him that God would multiply his descendants and give them that land forever. Jacob adopted Joseph's sons as his own and granted them inheritance with his own sons. Jacob recalled how when he came from Paddan, Rachel died on the way, and he buried her on the way to Ephrath, near Bethlehem. Jacob saw Joseph's sons and asked who they were, and Joseph told him that they were the sons whom God had given him in Egypt, so Jacob asked Joseph to bring them near so that he might bless them.
