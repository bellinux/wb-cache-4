5|$|The {{simplest}} classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is {{the most}} widely accepted form of air mass classification. Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its moisture properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for tropical, P for polar, A for Arctic or Antarctic, M for monsoon, E for equatorial, and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate {{the stability of the}} atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w. While air mass identification was originally used in weather forecasting during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish <b>synoptic</b> <b>climatologies</b> based on this idea in 1973.|$|R

30|$|WHI {{is located}} on the summit of Whistler Mountain {{in a part of the}} Coast Mountain Range {{approximately}} 100  km north of Vancouver. The station was established in 2002 to measure aerosols and trace gases in the lower troposphere and is operated by Environment and Climate Canada (Macdonald et al. 2011). In this region, <b>synoptic</b> scale <b>climatology</b> is controlled by the Aleutian Low and the Pacific High. In winter, the zonal flow is generally stronger, and the Aleutian Low causes a more southwesterly flow over British Columbia. In summer, the intensified Pacific High causes more a northwesterly flow over the south coast of British Columbia (Klock and Mullock 2001). PBL influence was found to occur mostly during spring and summer and less frequently in late autumn and winter (Gallagher et al. 2011, 2012). Biogenic processes characterized during the Whistler Aerosol and Cloud Study 2010 (WACS 2010), which was a large measurement campaign with a focus on aerosols and clouds, have also been shown to be important at the station during late spring and summer (e.g., Ahlm et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2012; Pierce et al. 2012; Wainwright et al. 2012; Wong et al. 2011).|$|R

The August 1955 precipitation pattern corresponds very closely with patterns of effective moisture from proxy data, showing widespread aridity and some stronger monsoonal activity in the Southwest. The analogue suggests that the amplified subtropical ridge is a very important feature of 6 ka palaeoclimate, with the circulation pattern differing from that in the early Holocene, implying interactions between both Milankov-itch and sub-Milankovitch forcing factors.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Many meteorologists {{rely heavily}} on their {{experience}} of past weather events to supplement their forecasting tools, such as using past experience to help decide between conflicting numerical weather prediction models. Experiential knowledge is an important piece of forecasting, however it is highly subjective and variable from one forecaster to another. In efforts to replace this experiential knowledge with a more objective record, this thesis explains how a <b>synoptic</b> map-pattern <b>climatology</b> was created and {{how it could be}} used as a contribution to weather forecasting methods. Creating the map-pattern climatology was a two step process: first atmospheric flow patterns at the 500 -millibar level for the selected region were categorized by type; and second surface level weather data were correlated with the map-types found. The atmospheric flow patterns over the Pacific Northwest region were found using a correlation-based method. Each day during the winter months of December, January, and February for the past 58 years was categorized by map-type. This resulted in 5, 235 days that were classified into 20 distinct map-type groups. Once the map-types were found, temperature, precipitation, and snowfall data from stations throughout Oregon and Washington were then correlated to the map-type data. The weather data were calculated for three spatial scales: an average of Oregon and Washington combined; average by Oregon climate zone; and for a single city. It was found that each map-type is associated with a unique weather environment at the surface. As an additional study, the distribution of map-types during El Niño and La Niña years was studied in combination with the surface weather data. It was found that El Niño and La Niña years have quite different map-type distributions compared to normal years, and the weather resulting at the surface was also far from average. Once completed, this Pacific Northwest climatology provided a record of the most common flow patterns and resulting weather at the surface. If distributed in a format in which current atmospheric flow data could be compared to historical map-type data, this <b>synoptic</b> map-pattern <b>climatology</b> {{could be used as a}} forecasting tool. In order for this information to replace the previously relied upon experiential knowledge, it would be necessary to know the forecast day’s projected map-type along with the historical surface weather data associated with that map-type. If distributed in this way, weather forecasters would have easy access to what has happened historically with any given map-type, thus replacing their variable and subjective experiential knowledge with an objective and accurate record...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{recently}} developed a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm {{able to generate}} {{thousands of years of}} synthetic wind speed values. In this study, however, two points have not received adequate attention: the presence of underlying periodic deterministic components embedded into the time series of the velocity and the generation of time series having exactly the desired marginal distribution. In principle, both these issues may have relevant consequences on the distribution of extreme values. This paper investigates and discusses the presence of underlying deterministic components in the wind records, develops a refined simulation algorithm for non-Gaussian colored wind speed stationary processes, and finally inspects how much these advances affect the analysis of extreme values.

To this end, the data {{related to the}} daily minimum temperature of a 50 -year period (1961 – 2010) were gathered from 451 <b>synoptic</b> and <b>climatology</b> stations. Then, the instances in which the temperature was below 0 °C {{for at least two}} consecutive days and this phenomenon covered at least 50 % of the entirety of Iran were selected.

The results showed that the Siberian high pressure plays {{a significant role in the}} occurrence of pervasive frosts in Iran. In some other cases, the northeast–southwest direction of this pattern leads to its combination with the East Europe high pressure, causing widespread frosts in Iran. Furthermore, the interaction between counter clockwise currents in this system and the clockwise currents in the Azores high pressure tongue directs cold weather from northern parts of Europe toward Iran. The formation of blocking systems leads to the stagnation of cold weather over Iran, a phenomenon that results in significant reduction of temperature and severe frosts in these areas.

An analysis based on biserial correlation configurations between 500 hPa vorticity and precipitation takes into account anomalous vorticity gradients including curvature and shear effects to describe some mechanisms favoring the occurrence of rainfall. It is shown that anomalies in the curvature of synoptic systems are largely causing precipitation. Daily precipitation at Córdoba, Argentina is used as an example to illustrate the results.

40|$|Climate {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as an important driver of phytoplankton dynamics. In Chesapeake Bay, climate variability is manifest as differences in timing and magnitude of freshwater flow. Interannual differences of freshwater flow influence phytoplankton through effects on light and nutrient distributions. Understanding how climate forces temporal and spatial patterns of phytoplankton biomass (Chla) and primary productivity (PP) is an important area of research as we attempt to predict {{effects of climate change}} and nutrient enrichment on estuarine ecosystems. This Dissertation describes climate forcing of Chla and PP using a <b>synoptic</b> <b>climatology</b> to quantify climate variability and ocean color remote sensing to assess phytoplankton variability. I developed a <b>synoptic</b> <b>climatology</b> using surface sea-level pressure data for the eastern United States to characterize regional climate because large-scale climate indices are not strongly expressed in this region. The long time series (1989 - 2004) of remotely sensed ocean color measurements provided high spatial and temporal resolution that allowed me to resolve interannual differences of Chla and PP. I show that the frequency-of-occurrence of synoptic-scale weather patterns during winter explained 54 % of the variance in spring freshwater flow to Chesapeake Bay through interannual differences in precipitation and water storage in the basin as snow and ice. Winter weather patterns were also linked to interannual variability of several characteristics of the spring phytoplankton bloom (timing, position, magnitude) through their effects on precipitation and freshwater flow. Multiple linear regression models of winter weather pattern frequencies on regional Chla explained between 23 - 89 % of the variance of the time series. Climate variability in winter-spring also influenced summer and annual integral production through nutrient loading associated with the spring freshet, explaining between 43 - 62 % of the variance of integral production. Finally, I quantified the effects of Hurricane Isabel on Chesapeake Bay phytoplankton dynamics and showed that event-scale climate perturbations can have significant impacts on ecosystem dynamics as well as seasonal and regional carbon cycling. Together these analyses highlight the importance of climate forcing of Chla and PP in Chesapeake Bay and support predictive models that explain significant amounts of the variance of these important ecosystem properties...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The Late Spring Secondary Precipitation Maximum in the Interior Pacific Northwest {{results from}} a complex system of climatic controls. The Secondary Maximum is most {{strongly}} developed over the high plateau of Oregon immediately {{in the lee of}} the Cascade Mountains. Local topographic organization exerts strong control over the magnitude and timing of the secondary maximum in the inter-montane region. There is a detectable poleward shift of the precipitation maximum in the interior Northwest from April to June. A <b>synoptic</b> precipitation <b>climatology</b> was developed for the Pacific Northwest for the months of February to July. Surface and 500 millibar circulation maps indicate reorganization of atmospheric flow from strongly zonal flow in midwinter to more highly meridional flow in May and June. Precipitation producing synoptic disturbances manifest a decided evolution from those dominated by warm advection in winter to those dominated by strong, cool advection in May and June. Spokane radiosonde data indicate that increased destabilization of the atmosphere accompanied by increased precipitable moisture is primarily responsible for the increase in average rainfall in May and June. The Secondary Precipitation Maximum is characterized by an increase in precipitation intensity, but is not accompanied by an increase in precipitation frequency. A case history of an early and late spring precipitation producing synoptic sequence is presented. Seasonal changes in precipitation intensity west and east of the Cascades must be related to corresponding changes in the sensible and latent heat budget of the region. Average monthly equivalent potential temperature data indicate pronounced reorganization of the surface temperature field west and east of the Cascades during the period of February to July.

40|$|Water is {{the main}} {{constraint}} for production of agricultural crops. The temporal and spatial variations in water requirement for agriculture products are limiting factors {{in the study of}} optimum use of water resources in regional planning and management. However, due to unfavorable distribution and density of meteorological stations, {{it is not possible to}} monitor the regional variations precisely. Therefore, there is a need to estimate the evapotranspiration of crops at places where meteorological data are not available and then extend the findings from points of measurements to regional scale. Geostatistical methods are among those methods that can be used for estimation of evapotranspiration at regional scale. The present study attempts to investigate different geostatistical methods for temporal and spatial estimation of water requirements for wheat crop in different periods. The study employs the data provided by 16 <b>synoptic</b> and <b>climatology</b> meteorological stations in Hamadan province in Iran. Evapotranspiration for each month and for the growth period were determined using Penman-Mantis and Torrent-White methods for different water periods based on Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Among the available geostatistical methods, three methods: Kriging Method, Cokriging Method, and inverse weighted distance were selected, and analyzed, using GS+ software. Analysis and selection of the suitable geostatistical method were performed based on two measures, namely Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Bias Error (MBE). The findings suggest that, in general, during the drought period, Kriging method is the proper one for estimating water requirements for the six months: January, February, April, May, August, and December. However, weighted moving average is a better estimation method for the months March, June, September, and October. In addition, Kriging is the best method for July. In normal conditions, Kriging is suitable for April, August, December, October, and March while weighted moving average is a better method for other months. Furthermore, based on growth period scale, for normal and wet periods in both irrigated and rain-fed farming, Kriging method is suitable, while in drought condition, Kriging is suitable for irrigated farming and weighted moving average should be used for rain-fed farming...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The present {{contribution}} proposes {{an approach}} for {{the preparation of}} the meteorological input needed by hy-drological models to forecast the surface runoff in medium-sized river catchments (50 - 1000 km 2). Rather than using Limited Area Models (LAMs) to achieve a high-resolution representation of atmospheric processes, we propose to recon-struct precipitation fields at a local scale from the statistical elaboration of forecasts from a General Circulation Model (GCM, approx. resolution 20 km). The calibration of statistical methods requires the availability of a training set of his-toric precipitation measurements and weather analyses. With the aim of maximizing the predictive skill of the procedure, the training set can be made homogeneous by selecting a subset of similar days through an analogue search procedure: different approaches developed within <b>synoptic</b> <b>climatology</b> or borrowed from statistical data analysis can be used to the purpose.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 77 - 84. A {{technique}} {{employing the}} classification {{capabilities of the}} Kohonen self-organising map (SOM) is introduced {{into the body of}} computer-based techniques available to <b>synoptic</b> <b>climatology.</b> The SOM is one of many types of artificial neural networks (ANN) and is capable of unsupervised learning or non-linear classification. Components of the SOM are introduced and an application is then illustrated using observed daily sea level pressure (SLP) from the Australian Southern Hemisphere data set. To put the technique in the context of global climate change studies, a further example using simulated SLP from the GENESIS version 1. 02 General Circulation Model (GCM) is illustrated, with the emphasis on the ability of the technique to highlight differences in seasonality between data sets. The SOM is found to be a robust technique for deducing the modes of variability of map patterns within a circulation data set, allowing variability to be expressed in terms of inter and intra-annual variability. The SOM is also found to be useful for comparing circulation data sets and finds particular application in the context of global climate change studies...|$|E
40|$|Freezing rain {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{hazardous}} and costly types of weather phenomena. The central Piedmont of North Carolina is a preferred region for freezing rain due to interactions between the atmosphere and the local topography as well as its proximity to nearby moisture sources. While previous studies have described the <b>synoptic</b> <b>climatology</b> of freezing rain in central North Carolina, much uncertainty remains as to the evolution and characteristics of the large-scale airflow and patterns of moisture transport associated with freezing rain. Atmospheric soundings and backward trajectory analysis using the NOAA HYSPLIT model were used to calculate various thermodynamic fields for air parcels connected with a sample of freezing rain events in the central Piedmont of North Carolina. This study reveals for the first time empirical evidence that sensible and latent heat fluxes off the Atlantic Ocean play an important role in the airflow characteristics and moisture budgets associated with freezing rain production over central North Carolina. This may have important implications in the forecasting of freezing rain, especially if Atlantic sea-surface temperatures continue to increase under current climate change scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: As the {{statistical}} time series {{are in short}} period and the meteorological station are not distributed well in mountainous area determining of climatic criteria are complex. Therefore, in recent years interpolation methods for establishment of continuous climatic data have been considered. Continuous daily maximum temperature data are a key factor for climate-crop modeling which is fundamental for water resources management, drought, and optimal use from climatic potentials of different regions. The main objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate different interpolation methods for estimation of regional maximum temperature in the Isfahan province. Materials and Methods: Isfahan province has about 937, 105 square kilometers, between 30 degree and 43 minutes to 34 degree and 27 minutes North latitude equator line and 49 degree and 36 minutes to 55 degree and 31 minutes east longitude Greenwich. It is located in the center of Iran and it's western part extend to eastern footage of the Zagros mountain range. It should be mentioned that elevation range of meteorological stations are between 845 to 2490 in the study area. This study was done using daily maximum temperature data of 1992 and 2007 years of <b>synoptic</b> and <b>climatology</b> stations of I. R. of Iran meteorological organization (IRIMO). In order to interpolate temperature data, two years including 1992 and 2007 with different number of meteorological stations have been selected the temperature data of thirty meteorological stations (17 synoptic and 13 climatologically stations) for 1992 year and fifty four meteorological stations (31 synoptic and 23 climatologically stations) for 2007 year were used from Isfahan province and neighboring provinces. In order to regionalize the point data of daily maximum temperature, the interpolation methods, including inverse distance weighted (IDW), Kriging, Co-Kriging, Kriging-Regression, multiple regression and Spline were used. Therefore, for this allocated data (24 days for each year and 2 days for each month) were used for different interpolation methods. Using difference measures viz. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Correlation Coefficient (r), the performance and accuracy of each model were tested to select the best method. Results and Discussion: The assessment of normalizing condition of data was done using Kolmogrov-Smirnov test at ninety five percent (95...|$|R
40|$|A <b>synoptic</b> scale {{transport}} <b>climatology</b> during {{days with}} {{high and low}} ozone concentrations was established for "ve summers from 1991 to 1995 over eastern North America. The airmass transport patterns were estimated from source impact regions derived from forward airmass histories. Daily maximum ozone concentrations were used to de"ne locally and regionally high- (90 th percentile) and low- (10 th percentile) ozone days. Examination of transport during locally high-ozone days revealed that there is poor transport in {{the central part of}} the domain, i. e. from Tennessee to northern Indiana, and in the South from Texas to South Carolina due to stagnating or recirculating air masses. However, high ozone concentrations over the western and northern sections of the domain occurred during strong and persistent southerly and westerly winds, respectively. In addition, on average, high ozone concentration surrounding {{the central part of the}} domain were associated with transport from this region. These results support the notion that ozone exceedances in the central and Southeastern US are predominately ‘homegrownawhile the western and northern section of the domain are also in#uenced by regional transport. In contrast, on low-ozone days, the transport was predominantly from outside (e. g., Canada and the Gulf of Mexico) into the Eastern US. The transport conditions during regionally high-ozone days were characterized by slow meandering transport over Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia, with a strong clockwise transport around this region of stagnation.

40|$|Our {{long-term}} {{goal is to}} implement the feature-oriented regional modeling methodology for the Monterey Bay (MB) forecasting system in retrospective and real-time operations using (i) the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and (ii) the Harvard Ocean prediction System (HOPS). Three specific objectives were pursued to achieve our {{long-term goal}}: (i) to develop a <b>synoptic</b> high-resolution regional <b>climatology</b> for Monterey Bay and the California Current System (CCS), (ii) to implement the feature-oriented regional modeling system (FORMS) capabilities in the West Coast ROMS and HOPS modeling efforts for synoptic nowcast, forecast and 3 D-VARS and ESSE-based assimilation in the Monterey Bay region, and (iii) to apply this methodology in real time within the nested ROMS and HOPS modeling efforts [...] Significant {{progress has been made}} in three aspects. The elements of the circulation template for both the upwelling and relaxed phases of the Monterey Bay regional circulation have been identified. A major difficulty in this region has been quantifying the variability of water masses and their inter-relationship with the CCS. The effort to develop the regional climatology clearly pointed out the lack of data in many regions of the coastal as well as offshore regions. We have started a major effort in gathering data sets for the whole region: 20 - 50 N, 140 - 110 W. This regional climatology will be made available to the community at large. The feature models for the upwelling fronts and coasta...|$|R
