With the proposed monitor and <b>scaling</b> <b>control</b> algorithms, OCSO calculates the optimal number of VMs to provision and performs the modification by requesting to add/remove VMs at the best scaling timing. In order to do so, OCSO PaaS optimization disables the applications’ native automatic scaling functions and modifies the environments by requesting service environment updates with API requests on-the-fly. In case of only one VM {{is presented in the}} environment, OCSO would continue to scale in by downsizing the single VM, provided that the workload continued to drop. Consequently, OCSO achieves PaaS service resource utilization efficiency since the effective <b>scaling</b> <b>controls</b> would save considerable VM hours while managing varied workloads.|$|R

50|$|The {{inchworm}} motor {{is commonly}} used in scanning tunneling microscopes (STM's). An STM requires nanometer <b>scale</b> <b>control</b> of its scanning tip near the material it is observing. This control {{can be accomplished by}} connecting the scanning tip to the shaft of the inchworm motor. The inchworm motor, in turn, allows control in a direction normal to the plane of the observed material's surface. Movement across the surface is commonly referred to as movement in the x-y plane, whereas movement normal to the surface is commonly referred to as movement in the z-direction. Movement of the scanning tip by the inchworm motor is either manually controlled or automatically controlled by connecting the motor to a feedback system.|$|E

50|$|In 1943, Giglioli {{found out}} about DDT through a chance meeting with three British scientists. This was the {{insecticide}} the allies were using to protect their troops from malaria. After initial test, a large <b>scale</b> <b>control</b> programme was started on the sugar estates in 1946, and countrywide in 1947. Spraying the inside of houses with DDT was so effective that by 1951, the coastal areas were free of malaria. It was more difficult inland, where the A. darlingi mosquito lived in the forest. To tackle this problem, a salt treated with anti-malaria drug chloroquine was distributed to populations in those remote areas in 1961. By the mid 1960s most cases of malaria were wiped out. This resulted in fewer deaths of women of child-bearing age, and as a result, the population grew rapidly.|$|E

50|$|Between 2010-2014 Dr. Szócska {{served a}} full electoral term as the Minister of State for Health of the Hungarian Government. Further to {{managing}} sustainability {{of health services}} in the challenging times of the world economic crisis, an evidence-based reform portfolio supported by a participatory, consultative change framework was implemented. He initiated {{and contributed to the}} introduction and implementation of a demanding set of public health regulations including full ban on smoking in all closed public places, the decrease of trans-fatty acids content of foodstuffs, introduction of HPV vaccination for adolescent girls, and the introduction of public health product tax (PHPT) on food and beverages with added salt and sugar content. PHPT proved to be an innovative tool to influence consumer and industry behaviour simultaneously, and generated invaluable resources during the deepest times of economic crisis. People consumed less added sugar and salt and companies improved their food production formulas. Revenues from PHPT were used to increase the salaries of nurses and doctors to slow down health workers’ emigration.

40|$|We have {{recently}} proposed a scale-adaptive algo-rithm for reliable edge detection and blur estimation [4]. The algorithm produces a contour code which con-sists of estimates of position, brightness, contrast and blur for each edge {{point in the}} image. Here we address two questions: 1. Can scale adaptation be used to achieve precise localization of blurred edges? 2. How much of the perceptual content of an image is carried by the 1 -D contour code? We report an ecient al-gorithm for subpixel localization, and show that local <b>scale</b> <b>control</b> allows excellent precision even for highly blurred edges. We further show how local <b>scale</b> <b>control</b> can quantitatively account for human visual acuity of blurred edge stimuli. To {{address the question of}} per-ceptual content, we report an algorithm for inverting the contour code to reconstruct an estimate of the orig-inal image. While reconstruction based on edge bright-ness and contrast alone introduces signicant artifact, restitution of the local blur signal is shown to produce perceptually accurate reconstructions. ...|$|E
40|$|Some {{oil field}} scales have the {{potential}} to contain regulated levels of naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM). It is estimated that between 300, 000 and 1, 000, 000 tons of NORM scale are produced each year. The most common NORM containing scale is BaSO 4, or barite. Research at the Brine Chemistry Consortium have studied the causes of barite scale formation and control techniques. Recent research have shown that NORM scale formation can be adversely affected by the presence of gas hydrate inhibitors, e. g., methanol or glycols. Chemical threshold scale inhibitors have proven to be most efficient to inhibit barite scale formation in production systems. A semi-empirical mathematical model has been developed to predict inhibitor efficiency for barium sulfate <b>scale</b> <b>control</b> in industrial processes.

40|$|The {{growing concern}} about the {{possible}} {{effects of climate change}} on flood frequency regime is leading Authorities to review previously proposed reference procedures for design-flood estimation, such as national flood frequency models. Our study focuses on Triveneto, a broad geographical region in North-eastern Italy. A reference procedure for design flood estimation in Triveneto is available from the Italian NCR research project "VA. PI. ", which considered Triveneto as a single homogeneous region and developed a regional model using annual maximum series (AMS) of peak discharges that were collected up to the 1980 s by the former Italian Hydrometeorological Service. We consider a very detailed AMS database that we recently compiled for 76 catchments located in Triveneto. All 76 study catchments are characterized in terms of several geomorphologic and climatic descriptors. The objective of our study is threefold: (1)  to inspect climatic and <b>scale</b> <b>controls</b> on flood frequency regime; (2)  to verify the possible presence of changes in flood frequency regime by looking at changes in time of regional L-moments of annual maximum floods; (3)  to develop an updated reference procedure for design flood estimation in Triveneto by using a focused-pooling approach (i. e. Region of Influence, RoI). Our study leads to the following conclusions: (1)  climatic and <b>scale</b> <b>controls</b> on flood frequency regime in Triveneto are similar to the controls that were recently found in Europe; (2)  a single year characterized by extreme floods can have a remarkable influence on regional flood frequency models and analyses for detecting possible changes in flood frequency regime; (3)  no significant change was detected in the flood frequency regime, yet an update of the existing reference procedure for design flood estimation is highly recommended and we propose the RoI approach for properly representing climate and <b>scale</b> <b>controls</b> on flood frequency in Triveneto, which cannot be regarded as a single homogeneous region...|$|R
