40|$|We use micro {{data for}} England and Wales {{to examine the}} effects of class size on the {{decision}} to <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> in full time schooling at 16 and on wages later in life. We find that class size has a sizeable and significant effect on the decision to <b>stay</b> <b>on.</b> This finding is very robust. Wage equations show the effect of <b>staying</b> <b>on</b> is significantly positive for wages. Combining this with the effect of class size <b>on</b> the <b>staying</b> <b>on</b> decision, reveals that class size significantly affects future wages. Reduced form models lead to much less accurate and insignificant estimates. Copyright Royal Economic Society 2003...|$|R
