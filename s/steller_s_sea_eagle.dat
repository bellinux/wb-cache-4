40|$|Habitat-use by Steller 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sea</b> <b>eagle</b> Haliaeetus pelagicus, {{categorized}} as Vulnerable on the 2002 IUCN Red List, was studied using satellite-tracking. This migratory species breeds in eastern Russia and mostly overwinters in Hokkaido, Japan, {{and the southern}} Kuzíl islands. Locations of eagles were classified as being river, sea, lake, or other habitat. In autumn, eagles mainly used river habitats, probably because {{of the availability of}} abundant post-spawn dead salmon. In winter about one third of eagles continued to be located on rivers, with others on sea coasts and lake sides. During the spring migration and breeding season habitat use by adult eagles probably reflected the variety of habitats in which breeding occurs. At that time, sub-adult eagles were located mainly on the sea coast, probably in places where food supply was sufficient and there were few territorial eagles. In Hokkaido 35...|$|R

50|$|The {{relationships}} of Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>eagle</b> {{are not completely}} resolved. mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data tentatively suggest that this species's ancestors diverged early in the colonization of the Holarctic by <b>sea</b> <b>eagles.</b> This is strongly supported by biogeography and by morphological traits such as the yellow eyes, beak, and talons shared with the other northern <b>sea</b> <b>eagles,</b> the white-tailed and bald eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla and H. leucocephalus). It is unique among all <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> in having a yellow bill even in juvenile birds, and possessing 14, not 12, rectrices.|$|R

40|$|The {{population}} {{density of the}} white-tailed <b>sea</b> <b>eagle</b> Haliaeetus albicilla is very low in many countries. In last twenty years, the <b>sea</b> <b>eagle</b> population in South Bohemia was restored by strict protection subsidized by reintroduction.

Until this time <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> had used former breeding places only for wintering, probably coming from the Baltic. The South Bohemian <b>sea</b> <b>eagle</b> population is very unique: it exists in a densely man-occupied landscape, mainly in areas with very intensive carp breeding in artificial fishponds and was partly artficially (help to wintering birds and reintroduction of some individuals) restored.

5|$|The white-bellied <b>sea</b> <b>eagle</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, although John Latham had made notes on the species in 1781, from a specimen obtained in February 1780 at Princes Island off the westernmost cape of Java during Captain Cook's last voyage. Its specific name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek leuko- 'white', and gaster 'belly'. Its closest relative is the little-known Sanford's <b>sea</b> <b>eagle</b> of the Solomon Islands. These form a superspecies, and as is usual in other <b>sea</b> <b>eagle</b> superspecies, one (the white-bellied <b>sea</b> <b>eagle)</b> has a white head, as opposed to the other species' dark head. The bill and eyes are dark, and the talons are dark yellow as in all Southern Hemisphere <b>sea</b> <b>eagles.</b> Both these species have at least some dark colouration in their tails, though this may not always be clearly visible in the white-bellied <b>sea</b> <b>eagle.</b> The nucleotide sequences of the cytochrome b gene of the two <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> were among those analysed in a 1996 study. Although they differ greatly in appearance and ecology, their genetic divergence of 0.3% indicates that the ancestors of the two forms might have diverged as recently as 150,000 years ago. The study authors conclude that although the genetic divergence is more consistent with subspecies, the distinctness in appearance and behaviour warrants the two being retained as separate species. Mitochondrial sequence of the cytochrome b locus differs very slightly from that of Sanford's <b>sea</b> <b>eagle</b> suggesting a relatively recent divergence after New Guinea-based white-bellied <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> colonised the Solomon Islands.|$|R
