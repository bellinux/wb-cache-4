5000|$|A <b>smart</b> <b>shop</b> (or smartshop) is {{a retail}} {{establishment}} {{that specializes in}} the sales of psychoactive substances, usually including psychedelics, as well as related literature and paraphernalia.

As of 1 December 2008, magic mushrooms are under stricter control in the Netherlands. Those new controls are quite controversial, because the list of banned mushrooms also contains species that have no psychoactive substances. Magic Mushroom spore prints and grow boxes are still available over the counter in the Netherlands.

The data was collected through survey questionnaires using a purposive sample of 313 Croatian and Italian respondents. To this end, we applied statistical methodologies such as binary logistic regression, factor analysis, and analysis of variance. We found that, compared with Croatians, Italian respondents have a more positive attitude toward using <b>smart</b> <b>shopping</b> carts, regardless of age or gender. Moreover, we found that consumers are influenced by two major factors: functional and convenience. Consumers who purchase for functionality reasons will have preferences associated with faster product selection and speeding up the purchasing process without fearing that they lack the necessary expertise. If functionality has the tendency to increase, respondents will not lack ICT knowledge when purchasing with the smart cart...|$|R

In the Netherlands, there is relatively little formal regulation of the <b>smart</b> <b>shop</b> industry, but the natural concentration of expertise about a relatively exotic range of products in combination with the realization that closer public scrutiny and regulation are always lurking in the background have caused the smart shops to organize into an industry association that, among other things, promotes the spread of information about its wares.|$|E

Few store owners were keen to open a franchise seeing a good response to a <b>smart</b> <b>shop</b> but lack enough space, so, it may not pass muster as a Friendly Mart franchise.

Thus, Friendly Mart Saral Sahyog Kirana Store came into being in October 2007. Then, a whole sequence of setting up stores in the villages’ one after the other started.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{emergence}} {{of a range of}} new technologies like auto-identification devices, active tags, and smart items has impacted profoundly on business software solutions such as supply chain management, logistics, and in-ventory control. Integration of automatic data acquisition with enterprise appli-cations as well as potential to provide real-time analytic functionality is opening new avenues for business process automation. In this paper, we propose a novel application of these technologies in a retailing environment leading to the vi-sion of a <b>smart</b> <b>shop</b> floor. We firstly present the infrastructure for the <b>smart</b> <b>shop</b> floor. We then demonstrate how the proposed infrastructure is feasible and conducive to real-time acquisition of buyer behaviour data through three se-lected queries. Complete algorithmic solutions to each query are presented to provide proof of concept, and further deliberations on analytic potential of the proposed infrastructure are also provided.

40|$|Although {{interest}} in <b>smart</b> <b>shopping</b> carts is increasing, both retailers and consumer groups {{have concerns about}} how real-time spending feedback will influence shopping behavior. Building on budgeting and spending theories, the authors conduct three lab and grocery store experiments that robustly show that real-time spending feedback has a diverging impact on spending depending on whether a person is budget constrained ("budget" shoppers) or not ("nonbudget" shoppers). Real-time spending feedback stimulates budget shoppers to spend more (by buying more national brands). In contrast, this feedback leads nonbudget shoppers to spend less (by replacing national brands with store brands). Furthermore, <b>smart</b> <b>shopping</b> carts increase repatronage intentions for budget shoppers while keeping them stable for nonbudget shoppers. These findings underscore fundamental unexplored differences between budget and nonbudget shoppers. Moreover, they have key implications for both brick-and-mortar and online retailers as well as app developers...|$|R
