40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to study the}} immunoprotective effect of <b>seabuckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> and glucomannan against T- 2 toxin-induced immunodepression in 15 -day-old chicks. T- 2 toxin was produced in the laboratory by growing Fusarium sporotrichioides MTCC 2081 on wheat. T- 2 toxin was fed to birds at 1 [*]ppm level of the diet. The powdered <b>seabuckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> were added at 400 and 800 [*]ppm levels, and glucomannan added at 1 [*]g/kg of feed. All the treatments were continued up to 28 days. The immunoprotective effects of seabuckthorn and glucomannan were assessed by evaluating humoral immune reaction against NCD vaccine (haemagglutination test and immunoglobulin estimation), serum immunoglobulin levels, phagocytic index, and DTH reaction against DNFB between day 25 and day 28 of experiment. There was significant (P <. 05) decrease in non-specific immunity in T- 2 toxin-treated group as evidenced by a reduction in phagocytic index, DTH reaction, HI titer, and total serum Ig compared to the healthy control group. A significant increase (P <. 05) in HI titer and total serum Ig was seen in seabuckthorn and glucomannan fed group. A significant (P <. 05) increase in DTH reaction and non-specific immune response was seen in seabuckthorn and glucomannan fed birds. The {{present investigation}} revealed that the seabuckthorn alone protected the immunosuppressant action of T- 2 toxin, but seabuckthorn and glucomannan in combination provided an additive protection against T- 2 toxicity...|$|E

The <b>Seabuckthorn</b> <b>berry,</b> {{popularly known as}} the ‘Wonder berry’, has a unique composition of vitamins, minerals, nutrients and essential fatty acids, typically only found separately in other sources. In order to create sustainable livelihoods and empowerment {{for women in the}} region, Ecosphere has developed a range of products from this berry that grows naturally in the Himalayas, taking in-depth measures to preserve its nutritive properties. The propagation of Seabuckthorn also benefits this cold desert region ecologically, given its soil-binding and nitrogen-fixing nature.|$|R
40|$|Seabuckthorn is a spinescent, {{deciduous}} and dioecious berry-producing shrub, {{with a high}} economical {{and ecological}} potential. It is frequently used as a pioneer species in anthropic and eroded soils due to its low pedoclimatic demands, strong rooting system and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. <b>Seabuckthorn</b> <b>berries,</b> leaves and bark have a high content of nutritive and active substances which promote this species for use in both food and medical industries. One of the most requested therapeutical {{products on the market}} is the seabuckthorn oil, extracted from both pulp and seeds. Two important parameters in analyzing seabuckthorn oil quality are fatty acids and tocopherols. In Transylvania region most of seabuckthorn orchards are established with local, low productive and less uniform planting material, randomly collected from wild flora. In order to assess the opportunity of introducing new seabuckthorn varieties in Transylvania, a selection process was initiated. In this context, five elites were selected from wild populations in the Danube Delta, using biometrical criteria. They were later compared to a representative individual from a local population and to a number of homologated cultivars, with respect to morphology and some lipophilic components (oil content, fatty acids and tocopherols). For both pulp and seeds, total lipids were extracted using a modified Folch method. Fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography using flame ionization detection. Tocopherols were analysed using a Shimadzu VP Series liquid chromatograph with a fluorescence detector FR- 10 AXL...|$|E
