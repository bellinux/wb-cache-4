40|$|We {{present a}} <b>semi-automatic</b> {{approach}} to <b>exchange</b> the clothes {{of an actor}} for arbitrary virtual garments in conventional monocular video footage as a post-process. We reconstruct the actorâ€™s body shape and motion from the input video using a parameterized body model. The reconstructed dynamic 3 D geometry of the actor serves as an animated mannequin for simulating the virtual garment. It also aids in scene illumination estimation, necessary to realistically light the virtual garment. An image-based warping technique ensures realistic compositing of the rendered virtual garment and the origi-nal video. We present results for eight real-world video sequences featuring complex test cases to evaluate performance for different types of motion, camera settings, and illumination conditions...|$|R
