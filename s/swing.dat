5|$|Though jazz {{had long}} since {{achieved}} some limited popularity, it was Louis Armstrong who {{became one of the}} first popular stars and a major force in the development of jazz, along with his friend pianist Earl Hines. Armstrong, Hines, and their colleagues were improvisers, capable of creating numerous variations on a single melody. Armstrong also popularized scat singing, an improvisational vocal technique in which nonsensical syllables (vocables) are sung. Armstrong and Hines were influential in the rise of a kind of pop big band jazz called <b>swing.</b> <b>Swing</b> is characterized by a strong rhythm section, usually consisting of double bass and drums, medium to fast tempo, and rhythmic devices like the swung note, which is common to most jazz. <b>Swing</b> is primarily a fusion of 1930s jazz fused with elements of the blues and Tin Pan Alley. <b>Swing</b> used bigger bands than other kinds of jazz, leading to bandleaders tightly arranging the material which discouraged improvisation, previously an integral part of jazz. <b>Swing</b> became a major part of African American dance, and came to be accompanied by a popular dance called the <b>swing</b> dance.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{his career}} as a fast-medium <b>swing</b> and seam bowler, Pathan broke into the {{national}} team soon after turning 19, and evoked comparisons with Pakistan's Wasim Akram with his promising performances and prodigious <b>swing.</b> In early 2006, Pathan became the only bowler to take a Test hat-trick in the first over of the match (vs Pakistan at Karachi). However, the productive run did not last and after the start of 2006, Pathan began to steadily lose pace and <b>swing,</b> and his wicket-taking dwindled. Although Pathan's batting continued to be productive, he was not regarded as a specialist and was dropped from the team in both Tests and ODIs by the end of 2006, and by 2007 was no longer in the squad until return in 2007 World Twenty20.|$|E

5|$|From mid-1993 (while he {{was still}} an amateur) until 2004, Woods worked almost {{exclusively}} with leading <b>swing</b> coach Butch Harmon. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods' full <b>swing,</b> achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better kinesiology. The changes began to pay off in 1999. From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by Hank Haney, who worked on flattening his <b>swing</b> plane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly. Haney resigned in May 2010 {{and was replaced by}} Sean Foley.|$|E
5|$|Having first {{established}} {{themselves in}} the West Coast third wave ska scene, the Daddies ultimately broke into the musical mainstream with their 1997 <b>swing</b> compilation Zoot Suit Riot. Released {{at the onset of}} the late 1990s <b>swing</b> revival, Zoot Suit Riot sold over two million copies in the United States while its eponymous single became a radio hit, launching the Daddies to the forefront of the neo-swing movement. By the end of the decade, however, the Daddies' mainstream popularity declined with that of the <b>swing</b> revival's, and the resulting commercial failure of their ska-flavored follow-up Soul Caddy led to an abrupt hiatus in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 a {{research}} team including Alena Grabowski, Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow-up study of single amputees with running blades {{which was published}} in Biology Letters. Each of six amputees' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg. The team measured leg <b>swing</b> times and force applied to the running surface on a high-speed treadmill at the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital, and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics. They found no difference in leg <b>swing</b> times at different speeds, and recorded leg <b>swing</b> times similar to that of non-disabled sprinters. They also found that single running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent. Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in running speed, the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters' top speed. Grabowski also found that amputees typically increased their leg <b>swing</b> times to compensate for the lack of force.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a fuzzy logic controller for a knee-FES-ergometer for stroke patient’s knee <b>swinging</b> exercise. The knee-FES-ergometer is introduced as a hybrid exercise for a long repetitive knee <b>swinging</b> exercise for stroke patient through the application of a knee <b>swinging</b> ergometer and functional electrical stimulation. The specially designed ergometer is used to reduce the required electrical stimulation and hence avoids early muscle fatigue. A knee <b>swinging</b> ergometer model, humanoid model and a stimulated quadriceps muscle model are developed to simulate the FES-assisted knee <b>swinging</b> exercise. A fuzzy logic controller is then designed to control the repetitive knee <b>swinging.</b> Simulation results verifying the knee <b>swinging</b> trajectories and the reduced electrical stimulation required are presented and discussed...|$|R

5|$|With the {{breakthrough}} of third wave ska into the American mainstream by late 1996, the Daddies seemed poised for commercial success, landing {{a spot on}} a well-publicized national tour with popular ska bands Reel Big Fish and Let's Go Bowling. Although the band were mainly playing ska shows at the time, they soon began drawing a sizable following for their <b>swing</b> material when the coincident success of the film Swingers and its featured band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy started drawing public and media attention towards the formerly underground <b>swing</b> revival movement. When fans regularly began approaching the band's merchandise table asking which of their albums contained the most <b>swing,</b> the Daddies realized they lacked an album fully representing their <b>swing</b> side, prompting the band's manager to convince them to compile all of their <b>swing</b> songs onto one CD until {{they could afford to}} make a new album, using their available finances to record several bonus tracks for inclusion. The result, , became an unexpectedly popular item as the band went on tour, reportedly selling as many as 4,000 copies a week through their Northwest distributors.|$|E

5|$|Current Electoral College rules {{effectively}} force {{candidates to}} focus disproportionately {{on a small}} percentage of pivotal <b>swing</b> states, while sidelining the rest. A study by FairVote reported that the 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states received very little attention. The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no TV advertising. This means that <b>swing</b> state issues receive more attention, while issues important to other states are largely ignored.|$|E
5|$|Current Electoral College rules tend to {{decrease}} voter turnout in states without close races. Voters living outside the <b>swing</b> {{states have a}} greater certainty of which candidate is likely to win their state. This knowledge of the probable outcome decreases their incentive to vote. A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that 2004 voter turnout in competitive <b>swing</b> states grew by 6.3% from the previous presidential election, compared to an increase of only 3.8% in noncompetitive states. A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64.4% in the 10 closest battleground states and only 47.6% {{in the rest of}} the country—a 17% gap.|$|E
5|$|Five bridges {{have been}} {{constructed}} across the Indian River Inlet. The first was a creosote timber trestle bridge built in 1934; its timbers deteriorated quickly in the maritime environment prevailing at the inlet. It {{was replaced by a}} concrete-and-steel <b>swing</b> bridge, the first to be named for Cullen, construction of which began in 1938. This <b>swing</b> bridge, which included a 4-foot (1.2-meter) pedestrian walkway and cost $165,900, opened with a dedication ceremony on May 28, 1940, but collapsed on February 10, 1948, succumbing to a combination of a very high tide combined with an easterly wind and ice flows deeply scouring the inlet bottom under its piers; a pickup truck on the bridge {{at the time of the}} collapse fell into the inlet, killing three men who drowned inside the truck. Another concrete-and-steel <b>swing</b> bridge completed in 1952, the second to be named for Cullen, also became structurally unsound due to ice flow and was closed in 1962 due to storm damage.|$|E

40|$|Practice <b>swings</b> are {{commonly}} employed among golfers, presumably {{based on the}} tacit assumption that they share common psychomotor processes with real swings; however, {{this has not been}} verified by empirical research. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether practice <b>swings</b> shared equivalent levels of control to real golf <b>swings,</b> when attempting the same target behavior. Three PGA Professional golf coaches and six amateurs (mean handicap = 2. 7, SD = 2. 2) each executed 20 <b>swings</b> under two quasirandom conditions; 10 real <b>swings</b> when striking a ball and 10 practice <b>swings</b> without. Underpinned by the theoretical suggestions of the UnControlled Manifold (UCM) approach (Scholz & Schöner, 1999), motor control was assessed using intraindividual movement variability. Results showed the level of equivalence to be inconsistent on both an inter and intraindividual basis. Coaches should, therefore, recognize that practice <b>swings</b> do not share the same effect for every golfer. Optimal coaching needs to consider individual responses before committing to specific training designs if counterproductive training is to be avoided...|$|R

On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can <b>swing</b> up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a <b>swing</b> from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
