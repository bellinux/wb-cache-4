The interpretation of time measurements of water pressure in the collapsed zone highlights (i) an evolution of flows with deformation that induces a damaging of the rock properties and (ii) the necessity to connect hydrogeological conditions and geological background in a dynamical system to analyse the pore pressure in the fractured collapsed zon...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{occurrence}} of denitrifying soil bacteria in a bioretention system located in Singapore and containing a <b>saturated</b> anoxic <b>zone</b> intended to facilitate denitrification. Soil samples were collected from six depths within the rain garden, four of which were within the <b>saturated</b> anoxic <b>zone.</b> These samples were analyzed using endpoint PCR, targeting total bacterial 16 S rRNA or a denitrification gene (nosZ) {{in order to determine}} presence or absence of denitrifying bacteria. Three dilutions were used to produce semiquantitative results for the abundance of denitrifying bacteria in a sample relative to samples from other depths. The highest numbers of nosZ amplicons per gram of soil were observed in the deeper levels of the <b>saturated</b> anoxic <b>zone</b> as well as within the root zone of the rain garden. Subsurface water samples from the <b>saturated</b> anoxic <b>zone</b> were also analyzed for oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, and nitrogen and phosphorus species. Concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were below the detection limit for most samples, indicating consumption by denitrifying bacteria and high rates of removal for long detention times.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{approach}} to refining an existing conceptual model {{was developed for}} a site with carbon tetrachloride present in both the vadose and <b>saturated</b> <b>zones.</b> The conceptual model was refined to consider the likely presence and extent of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL). Because the carbon tetrachloride was disposed as a mixture, the team modeled its {{physical and chemical properties}} over time, resulting in predicted differences in fate and transport as compared to the pure chemical. Another complication was disposal of large quantities of aqueous fluids. These factors were critical to the refinement of the conceptual model. The team categorized the subsurface into seven sub-domains, based upon differences in geology and hydrology. Each sub-domain was described in terms of its geometry, contaminant transport including migration and accumulation, uncertainties, and response to remediation and time. Field validation of the revised conceptual model was proposed through additional site characterization. Recommendations for model validation included a phased approach, beginning with non-invasive technologies and evolving to invasive technologies. An integrated set of innovative and traditional technologies were recommended to investigate only those sub-domains within both the vadose and <b>saturated</b> <b>zones</b> likely to contain DNAPL today to obtain new knowledge to validate or further refine the conceptual model...|$|R

A weak {{solution of the}} system contains an extra term, an additional price imposed on the <b>saturated</b> <b>zones.</b> We show that this price corresponds to the pressure field from the models of incompressible Euler's equations à la Brenier. By this observation we manage to obtain a minimal regularity, which allows to write optimality conditions {{at the level of}} single agent trajectories and to define a weak notion of Nash equilibrium for our model...|$|R
5000|$|In hydrogeology, {{groundwater}} flow {{is defined as}} the [...] "...part of streamflow that has infiltrated the ground, has entered the phreatic zone, and has been discharged into a stream channel, via springs or seepage water." [...] It is governed by the {{groundwater flow}} equation.Groundwater is water that is found underground in cracks and spaces in the soil, sand and rocks. An area where water fills these spaces is called a phreatic zone or <b>saturated</b> <b>zone.</b> Groundwater is stored in and moves slowly through the layers of soil, sand and rocks called aquifers. The rate of groundwater flow depends on the permeability (the size of the spaces in the soil or rocks and how well the spaces are connected) and the hydraulic head (water pressure).|$|E
50|$|Because {{atmospheric}} radon concentrations {{are very}} low, radon-rich water {{exposed to air}} continually loses radon by volatilization. Hence, ground water generally has higher concentrations of 222Rn than surface water, because the radon is continuously produced by radioactive decay of 226Ra present in rocks. Likewise, the <b>saturated</b> <b>zone</b> of a soil frequently has a higher radon content than the unsaturated zone because of diffusional losses to the atmosphere. As a below-ground source of water, some springs—including hot springs—contain significant amounts of radon. The towns of Boulder, Montana; Misasa; Bad Kreuznach, Germany; and the country of Japan have radium-rich springs which emit radon. To be classified as a radon mineral water, radon concentration must be above a minimum of 2 nCi/L (74 Bq/L). The activity of radon mineral water reaches 2,000 Bq/L in Merano and 4,000 Bq/L {{in the village of}} Lurisia (Ligurian Alps, Italy).|$|E
50|$|Bioslurping {{combines}} {{elements of}} bioventing and vacuum-enhanced pumping of free-product that is lighter than water (light non-aqueous phase liquid or LNAPL) to recover free-product from the groundwater and soil, and to bioremediate soils. The bioslurper system uses a “slurp” tube that extends into the free-product layer. Much like a straw {{in a glass}} draws liquid, the pump draws liquid (including free-product) and soil gas up the tube in the same process stream. Pumping lifts LNAPLs, such as oil, {{off the top of}} the water table and from the capillary fringe (i.e., an area just above the <b>saturated</b> <b>zone,</b> where water is held in place by capillary forces). The LNAPL is brought to the surface, where it is separated from water and air. The biological processes in the term “bioslurping” refer to aerobic biological degradation of the hydrocarbons when air is introduced into the unsaturated zone.|$|E

40|$|In 1983, {{high-level}} {{radioactive waste}} repository performance requirements related to groundwater travel time were defined by NRC subsystem regulation 10 CFR 60. 113. Although DOE is not presently attempting to demonstrate compliance with that regulation, understanding of the prevalence of fast paths in the groundwater flow system remains a critical element of any safety analyses for a potential repository system at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Therefore, this analysis was performed to allow comparison of fast-path flow against the criteria {{set forth in the}} regulation. Models developed to describe the conditions for initiation, propagation, and sustainability of rapid groundwater movement in both the unsaturated and <b>saturated</b> <b>zones</b> will form part of the technical basis for total- system analyses to assess site viability and site licensability. One of the most significant findings is that the fastest travel times in both unsaturated and <b>saturated</b> <b>zones</b> are in the southern portion of the potential repository, so it is recommended that site characterization studies concentrate on this area. Results support the assumptions regarding the importance of an appropriate conceptual model of groundwater flow and the incorporation of heterogeneous material properties into the analyses. Groundwater travel times are sensitive to variation/uncertainty in hydrologic parameters and in infiltration flux at upper boundary of the problem domain. Simulated travel times are also sensitive to poorly constrained parameters of the interaction between flow in fractures and in the matrix...|$|R
