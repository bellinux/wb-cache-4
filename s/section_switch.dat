40|$|Integrated optic {{waveguide}} circuits with a {{phase bias}} and modulator {{on the same}} chip were designed, fabricated, and tested {{for use in a}} fiber-optic rotation sensor (gyro) under development. Single mode fiber-optic pigtails were permanently coupled to the four ports of the chip. The switch format was based on coherent coupling between waveguides formed in Z-cut LiNbO 3. The control of the coupling was achieved by electro-optically varying the phase propagation constants of each guide. Fiber-to-chip interfacing required the development of appropriate fixturing and manipulation techniques to achieve the close tolerance needed for high coupling efficiency between a fiber with an approximately 5 micron m core and a channel guide with a roughly 2 micron m by 5 micron m cross <b>section.</b> <b>Switch</b> and chip performance at 0. 85 micron m is discussed as well as potential improvements related to insertion loss reduction, switching voltages, and suppression of Li 2 O out-diffusion...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we propose}} a multi-impedance changes {{localization}} method of on-voltage underground power cable using the wavelet transform based time-frequency domain reflectometry (WTFDR). To localize the impedance change in on-voltage power cable, the TFDR {{is the most}} suitable among reflectometries because the inductive coupler is used to inject the reference signal to the live cable. At this time, the actual on-voltage power cable has multi-impedance changes such as the automatic <b>section</b> <b>switches</b> and the auto load transfer switches. However, when the multi-impedance changes are generated in the close range, the conventional TFDR has the cross term interference problem because of the nonlinear characteristics of the Wigner-Ville distribution. To solve the problem, the wavelet transform (WT) is used because it has the linearity. That is, using WTFDR, the cross term interference is not generated in multi-impedance changes due to the linearity of the WT. To confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method, the actua...|$|R

5000|$|The New York Connecting Railroad was {{electrified}} around 1927 as {{an extension}} of the New Haven's system. The NYCR system encompassed 20 route miles (32 km) of track, and was electrified, like the New Haven, using overhead catenary at 11 kV, 25 Hz. The system received power from the New Haven Cos Cob Power Station and Consolidated Edison 201st generating station via the West Farms substation. Additional power was supplied from a 5 MW, 7 kVA, 11 kV, three-phase to single-phase converter installed at East New York. This unit was also operated in synchronous condenser mode for reactive power support. (See Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system.)Like the New Haven, the NYCR traction power was distributed using the 2 x 11 kV autotransformer topology. Two wires, the feeder and the catenary (often called the trolley wire), carried voltage of 11 kV to ground, but of opposite phase such that the feeder and catenary were 22 kV phase-to-phase. Six autotransformer stations, spaced an average of 3.8 miles apart along the line, converted power. Each station contained oil circuit breakers for both feeder and trolley buses, bus <b>sectioning</b> <b>switches,</b> and one [...] 3 MVA outdoor autotransformer.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – A {{new type}} of high {{precision}} electromagnetic suspension (EMS) which can support heavy tray along long stroke rail is proposed in this paper. Compared with the conventional EMS, the suggested moving-core typed EMS has the levitation electromagnets (EMs) on the fixed rail. This scheme has high load capability caused by iron-core and enables simple tray structure. Also {{it does not have}} precision degradation caused by heat generation from EMs, which is a drawback of conventional EMS. With these merits, the proposed EMS can be an optimal contactless linear bearing in next generation flat panel display (FPD) manufacturing process if the ability of long stroke movement is proved. So a special <b>Section</b> <b>Switching</b> Algorithm (SSA) is derived from the resultant force and moment equations of the levitated tray which enables long stroke movement of the tray. In order to verify the feasibility of the suggested SSA, a simple test-setup of the EMS with 2 Section-changes is made up and servo-controlled in the simulation and experiment. The simulation shows the perfect changeover the EMs, and the experiment shows overall control performance of under ± 40 μm gap deviations. These results reveal that the newly suggested contactless linear bearing can simultaneously achieve high load capability and precision gap control as well as long stroke...|$|R
40|$|This work {{introduces}} a scalable filtering algorithm for multi-agent traffic estimation. Large-scale networks are spatially partitioned into overlapping road sections. The traffic dynamics of each section {{is given by}} the switching mode model (SMM) using a conservation principle, and the traffic state in each section is estimated by a local agent. In the proposed filter, a consensus term is applied to promote inter-agent agreement on overlapping sections. The new filter, termed a (spatially) distributed local Kalman consensus filter (DLKCF), is shown to maintain globally asymptotically stable (GAS) mean error dynamics when all <b>sections</b> <b>switch</b> among observable modes. When a section is unobservable, we show that the mean estimate of each state variable in the section is ultimately bounded, {{which is achieved by}} exploring the interaction between the properties of the traffic model and the measurement feedback of the filter. Based on the above results, the boundedness of the mean estimation error of the DLKCF under switching sequences with observable and unobservable modes is established to address the overall performance of the filter. Numerical experiments show the ability of the DLKCF to promote consensus, increase estimation accuracy compared to a local filter, and reduce the computational load compared to a centralized approach...|$|R
