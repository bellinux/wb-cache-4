5|$|The {{original}} station {{building was}} designed by Paul Due, who used the same architectural plan for four other mountain stations on the line. The snow tunnel has caught fire five times. The fires in 1948, 1953 and 2008 only caused minor damage to the tunnel itself. The 1960 fire burned-down the tunnel, the station building {{and most of the}} <b>station</b> <b>area.</b> The last fire, in 2011, had a Class 73 train caught in the tunnel; both it and the tunnel were damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the harsh}} winter conditions, the <b>station</b> <b>area</b> was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels {{to keep the}} snow off the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line. In 1948, {{the western part of the}} snow tunnel caught fire, and although it spread to the station building, it was quickly put out by the staff. In 1953, there was again a fire in the tunnel.|$|E
40|$|Redevelopments of Chinese inner-­?city <b>station</b> <b>areas</b> {{introduced}} {{both new}} transport infrastructures (high speed railway, urban mass transit system, etc.) {{and real estate}} projects to station vicinities during the past decades. However, existing <b>station</b> <b>areas</b> are isolated {{from the rest of}} the city, and seldom urban activities take place in station surroundings. This paper aims at exploring mechanisms behind the emergence of “urban isolation”. To this end, four relevant topics are discussed, namely urbanization in China, travel model shift in and between big cities, railway station operation and planning philosophy of inner?city <b>station</b> <b>areas.</b> Examining above aspects in some China’s big cities, especially in two typical <b>station</b> <b>areas,</b> Beijing West and Tianjin <b>station</b> <b>areas,</b> this paper examines why Chinese inner?city <b>station</b> <b>areas</b> have gained an increasing role as transport nodes but have paradoxically become isolated enclaves in city centers.

Emergency rations were supplemented by food bought from the inhabitants. The 20th Indian Brigade along with the VIIIXX RHA Brigade and 1st Battalion British West Indies Regiment were ordered to march to Amman, leaving the 39th Royal Fusiliers at Suweileh {{to take over the}} defence of Es Salt.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments (SCCOG) began a {{study of}} how to improve the Regional Intermodal Transportation Center (RITC), {{including}} Union Station. The study analyzed problems with the RITC – including poor pedestrian connections, minimal bus facilities, {{and a lack of}} food vendors – and considered but rejected a move to a Fort Trumbull site. The proposed alternative released in 2010, which would cost around $20 million, would relocate Water Street slightly to the west. The bus terminal would be expanded, with a new building adding onto the existing former baggage office. A pedestrian bridge was to be constructed connecting the Water Street Garage, the main <b>station</b> <b>area,</b> the northbound Amtrak platform, and the ferry terminal – a design that served station passengers as well as the ferries. Other pedestrian improvements were to include wayfinding signs, pedestrian-scale lighting, and expanded sidewalks.|$|E

5|$|The only track {{left after}} the {{demolishing}} {{was a short}} section at Lier Station, which remained until the station closed in 1973. The old Lier Station has been preserved. The section between Reenskaug, located a few hundred meters (yards) from Lier Station, to Landfald has become the suburban street Lijevegen. From Landfall to Egge, the right-of-way is an overgrown path. From Egge to Muggerud, the right-of-way is used as the street Banevegen. In 1993, the right-of-way from Muggerud to Rønningen was rebuilt as a hiking and riding path. The branch towards Tronstad Bruk has been converted to a street, {{although most of the}} right-of-way north of Rønning has disappeared, as it has been reclaimed as agricultural land, particularly north of Sylling. The <b>station</b> <b>area</b> at Svangstand in intact, with the station building looking just like it did in 1904. Other station buildings have been converted to homes or commercial buildings.|$|E
5|$|The sad elephant, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} the elephant in the room, is a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space <b>Station</b> <b>area</b> of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant {{for a short period}} of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from Jet Set Willy as once believed.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} located in the {{residential}} area of Mortensrud, in Søndre Nordstrand. Mortensrud is an open station without any barriers and free access from the bus stops. The <b>station</b> <b>area</b> is one storey below from the surrounding area. It has step-free access, and at the same level as the buses. Only the western portion of the two side platforms is in use, where direct connection can be made with buses. The station is located adjacent to the shopping center at Mortensrud. The station is designed by Arkitektskap. It is built in concrete, covered in red brick, steel, natural rock and wood, that will allow lianas to grow on them. The roofover the western platform is curved, and made of wood and glass. There is an underground parking lot in two levels.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1879 as a halt on the Smaalens Line, {{now known as}} the western branch of the Østfold Line. The station {{building}} was designed by the Norwegian architect Peter Andreas Blix in the same Swiss cottage style as the stations Ås and Såner. In the 1950s, the station was frequently used by weekend guests from Oslo that visited the nearby conurbation Hvitsten for having a bath. A few years after the section of the Østfold Line between Ski and Moss Station was upgraded to double tracks, Vestby Station received a major renovation. A regulation plan for the <b>station</b> <b>area</b> was published in May 2010, which involved increasing the number of car parking places.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, Seeadler was recalled to Tsingtau to be prepared for any possible hostilities involving Germany. During this period, Cormoran was replaced by Condor; the two cruisers were joined by Seeadlers old consort from East Africa, the survey vessel Möwe. In early 1905, Seeadler conducted goodwill visits to the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), before returning to Tsingtau in April. On 28 June, with the Russo-Japanese War winding down following the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima, Seeadler was detached from the East Asia Squadron, permitting her return to the South Seas Station. While en route to her <b>station</b> <b>area,</b> Seeadler received an order to return to Africa during a stop at Ponape on 20 August. Her presence was necessary there to help put down a major uprising, the Maji Maji Rebellion, that had broken out in July. Seeadler ran aground twice, at Labuan and Singapore, on her way to East Africa, but neither incident resulted in damage to the ship. She arrived in Dar es Salaam on 1 October.|$|E
5|$|From 1999 onwards, other railway {{companies}} received concessions for {{the northern}} railway lines of the Netherlands. NoordNed, a joint venture of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen and Arriva, provided the railway services to and from Winschoten between 2000 and 2005. The Ihrhove–Nieuweschans railway was closed for major renovations in the years 2000–2002. Arriva bought all shares of NoordNed in 2003, and rebranded the services as Arriva in 2005. In 2013–2015, the station building was restored to its state of 1904 {{as part of a}} larger project to improve the quality and functionality of the <b>station</b> <b>area.</b> Between December 2015 and October 2016, the Ihrhove–Nieuweschans railway was closed entirely after a railway bridge near Weener was destroyed in a collision with the ship Emsmoon. Until the bridge is replaced in 2021, Arriva is providing a rail replacement bus service between Weener and Leer. In 2016–2017, the roofed bus station was demolished and the bus area was modernized.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the wars, tragedy struck Gifu once again. On September 12, 1976, Typhoon 17 (Super Typhoon Fran) struck the city, killing five people and affecting over 40,000 families. Gifu recovered, however, through the establishment of various local industries. The city's growth reached such a point that it was designated a core city by the national government in 1996. As its fashion industry has declined, however, {{the city has been}} looking towards manufacturing to revive the economy. A recent construction boom, much of which has occurred around JR Gifu Station, has improved the city's economy. Both public construction projects (<b>station</b> <b>area</b> renovations and elevated walkways) and private efforts are revitalizing the city of Gifu. Gifu City Tower 43 is an example of cooperation between the public and private sectors, with part of the building belonging to the city and the remainder privately owned. Gifu expanded its size in 2006 by merging with the neighboring town of Yanaizu (from Hashima District) during the great Heisei merger.|$|E
5|$|The Sinsen Line {{was among}} those {{proposed}} for closure in 2002 when the tram company attempted to save money by transferring the traffic to buses. A city grant of 25 million Norwegian krone (NOK) saved the line along with several others. The metro station was {{for many years in}} bad need of rehabilitation, with dim lighting at the platforms, grimy walls, and broken roof tiles leaving piping and wiring exposed. Architect Reiulf Ramstad, {{who was in charge of}} the renewal project, compared the station to the scenery of a horror movie. The 2006 renovation involved making the station brighter lit, and a new entrance was built which attempted to make the station more visible from outside. Upgrading of the station included letting parts of sculpture exhibitions by the Norwegian Sculpturer Society be placed inside the <b>station</b> <b>area.</b> From 20 August 2006, Carl Berners plass also started serving the Ring Line of the metro. The line branches off from the Grorud Line north of Carl Berners plass, and the station thereby became the transfer station between the Ring Line and the Grorud Line. From 2008, the square itself was rebuilt to become more pedestrian-friendly.|$|E
5|$|Like {{with many}} large {{cities in the}} United States, Denver’s CBD and the {{adjacent}} neighborhoods were blighted {{with the presence of}} many open parking lots in the 1970s and 80’s. Recent focus to redevelop these open lots and increase density/activity in the city’s core have been hugely successful as many of these lots are today being turned into large residential, retail and commercial developments. This is especially true around the newly redeveloped and highly popular Union <b>Station</b> <b>area</b> in Denver’s LoDo (Lower Downtown) neighborhood. What used to be open land, parking lots, warehouses and rail yards as recently as {{the turn of the century}} is now several city blocks of new residential and commercial buildings as well as a new RTD underground bus terminal, rail platforms/pavilions and a park. There are also improved pedestrian friendly connections to the RiNo (River North), Five Points, Auraria and Highland neighborhoods from the new development. Historic Union Station itself has been fully renovated and turned back into a travel and activity hub. It now includes the Denver Amtrak station, a new boutique hotel and several restaurants, bars & shops all centered on the large Great Hall inside and a public plaza outside along Wynkoop Street. Starting in April 2016 the University of Colorado A-Line commuter train began service directly connecting Union Station and downtown Denver to Denver International Airport and the airport's new 500+ room Westin Hotel & conference center.|$|E

40|$|In 2006, {{the city}} of Denver {{completed}} a major phase of the T-REX project that included expanding a Light Rail Transit (LRT) system, building 13 stations along the corridors of Interstates 25 and 225. The expansion brought mixed concerns about whether locating the system alongside interstate freeways would produce transit-oriented developments (TOD), or if it intended to have stations that serve multiple purposes, some functioning as destinations and others serving as feeder stations to generate ridership for the system. This prompted a study to (1) create a typology of <b>station</b> <b>areas</b> and determine what type of <b>station</b> <b>areas</b> are located near an interstate freeway and (2) to quantify what aspects of <b>station</b> <b>areas</b> promote ridership within the system, again with a particular focus on those stations adjacent to freeways. We identified numerous geographic variables considered to impact ridership such as land use, socio-economic population features, the street network, and features of LRT stations. We then used factor and cluster analysis on street network and land use data to create typologies of <b>station</b> <b>areas</b> based on these criteria. Of specific interest was whether stations located adjacent to interstate freeways had a unique built environment. We then used multiple regression analysis to estimate potential ridership relating to the built environment {{as well as the}} socio-economic and rail station characteristics as independent variables for each station. The overall results provided evidence that <b>station</b> <b>areas</b> near interstate freeways presented a built environment that could limit their ability to transition into a TOD compatible neighborhood...|$|R
40|$|In July 2008, {{system of}} partial {{payments}} on motorways was aborted {{and for most}} of the traffic replaced by a vignette system. Vignettes are bought in advance and are valid {{for a longer period of}} time. The switch of system caused major changes on traffic – traffic increased on motorways and decreased on some lower order state roads (for which payment is not demanded). The biggest change is seen in toll <b>station</b> <b>areas.</b> Increased traffic on motorways caused shorter distances among vehicles and more interplays, which demands higher concentration of a driver. On the other hand, increased traffic on motorways loosened traffic on lower order state roads, especially on those which were used before as a bypass of toll <b>station</b> <b>areas</b> (with intention of avoiding paying toll). The vignette system does not require stopping at toll station for vehicles lighter than 3, 5 tone. It means higher flow and less traffic jams in toll <b>station</b> <b>areas.</b> But at the same time, it makes integrating trucks back to lane even more effortful. The increase of traffic in toll <b>station</b> <b>areas</b> and changes related to it are demonstrated in this thesis. In order of making those demonstrations, I interpreted information about:  car accidents (number, type, cause, classification),  traffic flow reorganisation in toll <b>station</b> <b>areas,</b>  changes of traffic structure. Information about traffic is collected from automatic traffic counters and car accidents are summarized after information collected by Police.
