"In {{consideration}} of the promise made by the gentlemen whose names are subscribed to preserve my silence with reference to an accusation which {{has been made in}} regard to my conduct at baccarat on the nights of Monday and Tuesday the 8th and 9th at Tranby Croft, I will on my part <b>solemnly</b> <b>undertake</b> never to play cards again as long as I live." [...] (Signed) W. Gordon-Cumming ...|$|E
5000|$|Article 103 is {{analogous}} to the League of Nations Covenant Article 20, which held that [...] "The Members of the League severally agree that this Covenant is accepted as abrogating all obligations or understandings inter se which are inconsistent with the terms thereof, and <b>solemnly</b> <b>undertake</b> that they will not hereafter enter into any engagements inconsistent with the terms thereof." [...] The intent of both articles was to establish a [...] "super-treaty" [...] {{in much the same way}} that the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution establishes the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. This interpretation has been affirmed by the World Court.|$|E
60|$|This annoyed the Club, whose curiosity {{had been}} whetted. Three members, {{acting in the}} {{interests}} of the whole, <b>solemnly</b> <b>undertook</b> to believe whatever he might tell them. But Jack Herring's feelings had been wounded.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{we came to}} the {{question}} of bearers. The end of it was that after some hesitation Bausi II, because of his great affection for us, promised to provide us with these upon our <b>solemnly</b> <b>undertaking</b> to dismiss them at the borders of the desert, [...] "so that they might escape our doom," [...] as he remarked cheerfully.|$|R
5000|$|Marcel Pagnol then {{produces}} {{the hypothesis that}} the King, through Louvois, proposed a deal to the prisoner: [...] "the King would spare his life, provided that he <b>solemnly</b> <b>undertook</b> to remain silent forever; but {{in the interest of the}} State, His Majesty was obliged to deprive him of his freedom." [...] Marcel Pagnol feels, however, that any direct meeting with Louis XIV was [...] "very improbable".|$|R
60|$|It {{would be}} hard to say how the story of the tailor leaked out, and became at last public and notorious. It had been agreed among all the lawyers that it should be kept secret,--but it may perhaps have been from some one {{attached}} to them that it was first told abroad. No doubt all Norton and Flick knew it, and all Goffe and Goffe. Mr. Mainsail and his clerk, Mr. Hardy and his clerk, Serjeant Bluestone and his clerk, all knew it; but they had all promised secrecy. The clerk of the Solicitor-General was of course beyond suspicion. The two Miss Bluestones had known the story, but they had <b>solemnly</b> <b>undertaken</b> to be silent as the grave. Mrs. Bluestone was a lady with most intimately confidential friends,--but she was sworn to secrecy. It might have come from Sarah, the lady's-maid, whom the Countess had unfortunately attached to her daughter when the first gleam of prosperity had come upon them.|$|R
60|$|It is now 50 {{years since}} Queen Victoria, my beloved mother, and my August Predecessor {{on the throne}} of these realms, for divers weighty reasons, with the advice and consent of Parliament, took upon herself the {{government}} of the territories theretofore administered by the East India Company. I deem this a fitting anniversary on which to greet the Princes and Peoples of India, in commemoration of the exalted task then <b>solemnly</b> <b>undertaken.</b> Half a century is but a brief span in your long annals, yet this half century that ends to-day will stand amid the floods of your historic ages, a far-shining landmark. The proclamation of the direct supremacy of the Crown sealed the unity of Indian Government and opened a new era. The journey was arduous, and the advance may have sometimes seemed slow; but the incorporation of many strangely diversified communities, and of some three hundred millions of the human race, under British guidance and control has proceeded steadfastly and without pause. We survey our labours of the past half century with clear gaze and good conscience.|$|R
5000|$|Bratachari {{purports to}} present a {{complete}} synthesis of life, an integrated system of culture consisting of a complete philosophy of life, coupled with and expressed through a simple scheme of practical training and discipline for the building up of the inner life and character {{as well as the}} body, or in other words, for the simultaneous and harmonious cultivation of the body and soul of man. [...] "Brata" [...] signifies a solemn or sacred purpose, ideal or objective which is pursued as a joyous rhythmic ritual simultaneously through an integrated use of thought, word, and physical movement, and is also used to signify the combined joyous integrated ritual itself. [...] "Chari" [...] denotes one who pursues a purpose, ideal or objective. According to the Bratachari, the whole of life should be regarded as a Brata and should be pursued as a complete whole and as an integrated ritual, inspired by a noble purpose which is at once spiritual and practical. The single Brata or solemn purpose and ritual of life is divided into five bratas representing a five-fold path in the complete realisation of life which, however, must be pursued simultaneously and not in separate compartments. The five bratas are: Knowledge, Labour, Truth, Unity and Joy. The name Bratachari thus denotes one who has <b>solemnly</b> <b>undertaken</b> the duty of buildingt up his or her life through the systematic and integrated pursuit to the five bratas. Therefore, the ultimate goal of a Bratachari is the attainment of the ideal of the complete man by attaining perfection in self-development in all spheres of life- physical, mental, moral and social; or in other words, the attainment of the ideal of a perfect citizen of the world. At the same time, it is an essential principle of the Bratachari teaching that before one can be a complete citizen of the world, one must, be a complete citizen of a particular regional unit. The movement seeks to create in each country a nationwide discipline of common citizenship among persons of both sexes, of all castes and creeds and of all ages, by developing a high character, physical fitness in ideal and practice, the pursuit of constructive work, an observance of the dignity of labour and a joyous community spirit through common participation in national dances and songs as well as community dances and community songs.|$|R
