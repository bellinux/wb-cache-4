40|$|The {{implementation}} {{and development of}} managed aquifer recharge (MAR) have been limited by the clogging attributed to physical, chemical, and biological reactions. In application field of MAR, physical clogging is usually the dominant type. Although numerous studies on the physical clogging mechanism during MAR are available, studies on the more detailed suspended clogging types and its prediction methods still remain few. In this study, a series of column experiments were inducted to show the process of <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> clogging process. The <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> clogging was divided into three types of surface clogging, inner clogging and mixed clogging based on the different clogging characteristics. Surface clogging indicates that the <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> are intercepted by the medium surface when <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> grain diameter is larger than pore diameter of infiltration medium. Inner clogging indicates that the <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> particles could transport through the infiltration medium. Mixed clogging refers to the comprehensive performance of surface clogging and inner clogging. Each <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> clogging type has the different clogging position, different changing laws of hydraulic conductivity and different deposition profile of <b>suspended</b> <b>solids.</b> Based on the experiment data, the ratio of effective medium pore diameter (Dp) and median grain size of <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> (d 50) was proposed as the judgment index for <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> clogging types. Surface clogging occurred while Dp/d 50 was less than 5. 5, inner clogging occurred while Dp/d 50 was greater than 180, and mixed clogging occurred while Dp/d 50 was between 5. 5 and 180. In order to improve the judgment accuracy and applicability, Bayesian method, which considered more ratios of medium pore diameter (Dp) and different level of grain diameter of <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> (di), were developed to predict the potential <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> types...|$|R

5000|$|Removal of <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> is {{generally}} achieved {{through the use}} of sedimentation and/or water filters (usually at a municipal level). By eliminating most of the <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> in a water supply, the significant water is usually rendered close to drinking quality.

These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Suspended</b> <b>solids,</b> turbidity and discharge data for thirty-seven reservoir releases, three major periods of dam overspill, and 20 unregulated tributary flood events, on seven different river systems, are analysed {{in order to examine}} <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> transport dynamics within regulated rivers and to assess the effectiveness of reservoir releases material. Within Great Britain, two sudden releases of water to the in removing within-channel accumulations of out of every five major reservoirs cause regulated river. Reservoir releases also provide, with their fixed and constant discharges, a unique opportunity to undertake field experiments investigating the importance of channel <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> sources, <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> supply limitation, the nature of the <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> load on turbidity and flow routing within upland boulder bed channels. The reservoir release <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> loads relate to sediment source depletion and changing sources along the channel. Close to the· dam, suspended loads are usually small with fine organic matter dominating the seston, which. scanning electron microscopy revealed to be predominantly autochthonous organic matter, with algal fragments derived from extensive and ·rapid periphyton growth within the regulated rivers. Downstream, minerogenic particles dominate the seston. This represents the flushing of channel bed accumulations derived from· unregulated tributaries. Seasonal variation {{in the nature of the}} <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> loads is also revealed. The quantity of material transported relates to the relationship between reservoir release or dam overspill frequency and that of unregulated tributary flood events. Marked hysteresis between <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> transport and discharge was characteristic on all the regulated rivers. In addition, hysteresis in the relationship between turbidity and <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> concentrations was also apparent, this relating to spatial and temporal changes in seston composition. Finally, the results obtained allow not only the nature of <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> transport within regulated rivers to be described and the effectiveness of reservoir releases for flushing in-channel accumulations of material to be ascertained but also the formulation of management guidelines and recommendations. These guidelines relate to effective environmental management of regulated river habitats in rivers experiencing reservoir releases...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Watershed Management, 2011 The City of Arcata, California has {{identified}} bacteria, nutrients and <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> as pollutants {{of concern in}} the city???s waterways. Suburban areas are known sources of fecal contamination, nutrients and <b>suspended</b> <b>solids.</b> Suburban areas {{increase the amount of}} impervious surfaces in watersheds causing peak flow and volume of storm water runoff to significantly increase. As runoff and overland flow increase so does the ability of water to entrain and carry a higher pollutant load. Wetlands have been increasingly used and found effective in reducing many of the water quality concerns associated with suburban runoff. Arcata has four wetlands located on three streams receiving suburban storm water through storm water infrastructure. Two of the wetlands are depressional and two are free water surface. Each stream was sampled during the 2010 -????? 2011 hydrologic year upstream and downstream of the wetlands during both storm and base flow events to determine reduction of total <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> (TSS), organic <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> (OSS), inorganic <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> (ISS), fecal coliforms, turbidity, and phosphorous. Of the metrics tested only <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> showed significant reductions. The highest mean TSS, ISS, OSS and fecal coliform concentrations came from Campbell Creek, which had the highest percent impervious surfaces (23 %) comprised primarily of suburban housing. <b>Suspended</b> <b>solids</b> were about 22 % organic by weight during storm and base flows making organic matter {{a significant portion of the}} suspended load...|$|R
50|$|There are few {{limitations}} of this evaporator that makes it not applicable for all range of industrial processes. The evaporator needs to be operated {{within the range of}} 26-100 °C and is able to remove water in a range of 450-16,000 kg/h. In order to provide the proper rising/falling characteristics, most evaporators are quite tall and can only be installed in a space that is 4 m high. The <b>suspended</b> <b>solid</b> in the liquid feed need to be low and can pass through 50 mesh screen.|$|E
50|$|Filtrate is {{the waste}} {{that has been}} {{discharge}} in vacuum ceramic filters through the waste stream. During cake washing, a wash liquid is sprayed on the cake solids to remove impurities or additional filtrate. The filtrate goes into filtrate tank and is drained through a discharge system. However, the filtrate is recyclable and has low <b>suspended</b> <b>solid</b> content. Thus, it can be recycled through the system without further treatment. Filtrate is used to flush the disc during back flow washing to clean the micro-porous structure and remove any residual cake.|$|E
50|$|The peeler {{centrifuge}} is {{a device}} that performs by rotating filtration basket in an axis. A centrifuge follows {{on the principle of}} centrifugal force to separate solids from liquids by density difference. High rotation speed provides high centrifugal force that allows the <b>suspended</b> <b>solid</b> in feed to settle on the inner surface of basket. There are three kinds of centrifuge, horizontal, vertical peeler centrifuge and siphon peeler centrifuge. These classes of instrument apply to various areas such as fertilisers, pharmaceutical, plastics and food including artificial sweetener and modified starch.|$|E

5000|$|Boilers {{operating}} at pressures less than [...] may use unsoftened feedwater {{with the addition}} of sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide to maintain alkaline conditions to precipitate calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide and magnesium silicate. Hard water treated this way causes a fairly high concentration of <b>suspended</b> <b>solid</b> particles within the boiler to serve as precipitation nuclei preventing later deposition of calcium sulfate scale. Natural organic materials like starches, tannins and lignins may be added to control crystal growth and disperse precipitates. [...] The soft sludge of precipitates and organic materials accumulates in quiescent portions of the boiler to be removed during bottom blowdown.|$|E
50|$|Backflow {{means the}} {{undesirable}} reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or <b>suspended</b> <b>solid</b> into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer {{is designed to}} keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.|$|E

The base facilitated transport by ship, where the amphorae were packed upright {{or on their}} sides {{in as many as}} five staggered layers. If upright, the bases probably were held by some sort of rack, and ropes passed through their handles to prevent shifting or toppling during rough seas. Heather and reeds might be used as packing around the vases. Racks could be used in kitchens and shops. The base also concentrated deposits from liquids with <b>suspended</b> <b>solid</b> particles, such as olive oil and wines.|$|E
50|$|Pre-treatment of {{the feed}} water {{is used to}} reduce the <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> and {{bacterial}} content of the feed-water.

5000|$|Primary {{treatment}} of sewage is removal of floating and settleable solids through sedimentation.

40|$|The Upper Carson River in Nevada {{has been}} listed as an {{impaired}} water body for turbidity and total <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> (TSS).
