5|$|The United States is {{the only}} {{advanced}} economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation {{and is one of}} just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia. While federal law currently does not require <b>sick</b> <b>leave,</b> it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations. 74% of full-time American workers get paid <b>sick</b> <b>leave,</b> according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits. In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway.

40|$|Background: In Chile, {{the number}} of <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> due to mental health {{problems}} has systematically increased in recent years. Aim: To perform an analysis of <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> due to mental problems managed by the Fondo Nacional de Salud (FONASA) during 2008. Material and Methods: Analysis of all <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> awarded during 2008 for mental or behavioral problems, that were managed at FONASA. A negative binomial regression, was performed to predict the effects of different variables on the total duration of <b>sick</b> <b>leaves.</b> Results: A total of 546, 477 <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> were awarded to 198, 752 individuals (2. 27 per subject). The mean duration of each leave was 15. 6 days. Summing all leaves, the lapse off work was 98 ± 96 days (median 65 days). Women had longer leaves than men. The type of medical leave, occupation, working for private or public institutions, economic activity and diagnosis {{were significantly associated with}} duration of time off work. Conclusions: <b>Sick</b> <b>leaves</b> for mental problems are prolonged and related to gender and socioeconomic variables...|$|R

40|$|Background: Psychiatric {{and mood}} {{disorders}} may hamper {{the efficiency of}} workers and cause absenteeism. Material and Methods: Revision of <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> related to schizophrenia, bipolar diseases, anxiety, depression and adaptive disorders that were granted in Spain in the period January- December 2011. The mean number of days off work for each disease and the costs per each labor day lost were calculated. Results: The total number of labor days lost for schizophrenia, bipolar diseases and mood disorders were 72, 831; 899, 107 and 3, 666, 055 days, respectively. The mean duration of <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> for the same diagnoses were 84; 100 and 64 days/year respectively. The total indirect costs of <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> for psychiatric diseases during 2011 were &# 8364; 100 million approximately, corresponding to 4 % of costs for all diseases. Conclusions: The high costs of absenteeism derived from psychiatric diseases should prompt measures to promote a better adaptation to work environments of people suffering these ailments...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{increase}} in expenses {{of the health}} care system caused by <b>sick</b> <b>leaves,</b> especially those granted to mothers with children of less than one year of age with severe diseases, is a topic of concern. Aim: To describe the rates of <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> granted to mothers with children of less than one year of age with severe diseases from 2004 to 2008. Material and Methods: Analysis of databases containing information about <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> coming from Chilean public and private health care subsystems. Leaves granted to mothers with sick children of less than one year were specifically analyzed in terms of days off work and the amount of monetary benefits. Results: A sustained increase, ranging from 20 to 120 % in the number of <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> motivated by diseases of children of less than one year, was observed. Thirty four percent of maternity leaves concentrate immediately after finishing the legal period (24 weeks after birth) and almost 60 % of them occured within the first 6 months after birth. The most frequent diagnoses that motivated the higher number of leaves were gas-troesophageal reflux and bronchitis. Conclusions: There is probably a bad use of the benefit in a percentage of leaves. The benefit is also regressive since it favors mostly mothers of a better socioeconomic condition. The law that will extend the postnatal maternity leave will solve in part these problems...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the workplace on the socioeconomic gradient of sickness absence. DESIGN: Comparison of the relation between socioeconomic status and employee sickness absence in three different towns. SETTINGS: The towns of Raisio, Valkeakoski, and Nokia in Finland. They are equal in size and regional social deprivation indices, located in the neighbourhood of a larger city, and produce the same services to the inhabitants. SUBJECTS: All permanent local government employees from Raisio (n = 887), Valkeakoski (n = 972), and Nokia (n = 934) on the employer's registers during 1991 to 1993. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of short (1 - 3 days) and long (> 3 days) spells of sickness absence, irrespective of cause, and separately for infection, musculoskeletal disorder, and trauma. RESULTS: In blue collar male and female workers, compared with the same sex higher grade white collar workers, the age adjusted numbers of long <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> were 4. 9 (95 % CI 4. 2, 5. 8) and 2. 8 (2. 6, 3. 1) times higher, respectively. The risk varied significantly between the towns, in men in relation to long <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> irrespective of cause and resulting from musculoskeletal disorders, and in women in relation to long leaves resulting from infection. The numbers of long <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> were 3. 9 (95 % CI 2. 8, 5. 4) times higher in blue collar male workers than in higher grade white collar male workers in Raisio, 4. 9 (95 % CI 3. 8, 6. 3) times higher in Valkeakoski, and 5. 8 (95 % CI 4. 5, 7. 5) times higher in Nokia. Sickness absence of blue collar employees differed most between the towns. The rates of long <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> in blue collar men were 1. 46 times greater (95 % CI 1. 25, 1. 72) in Valkeakoski and 1. 85 times greater (95 % CI 1. 58, 2. 16) in Nokia than in Raisio. In men, {{no significant differences were found}} between the towns as regards the numbers of long <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> of higher grade white collar male workers. The socioeconomic gradients differed more between the towns in men who had worked for four years or more in the same employment than in men who had worked for shorter periods. No consistent health gradients of socioeconomic status were evident for short <b>sick</b> <b>leaves</b> among either sex. CONCLUSIONS: In men and to a lesser extent in women, the workplace is significantly associated with health inequalities as reflected by medically certified sickness absence and the corresponding socioeconomic gradients of health...|$|R

5|$|Due to poor intelligence, the British {{were told}} to expect only limited {{resistance}} from German reserve forces.

Frederick Browning's intelligence officer—Major Brian Urquhart—obtained information from the 21st Army Group in Belgium and Dutch resistance that German armour was present around Arnhem.
