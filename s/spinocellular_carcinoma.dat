40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the palatine tonsils of patients with chronic tonsillitis and <b>spinocellular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> to determine the presence of nano-sized particles. Tonsil samples from adult patients with chronic tonsillitis and <b>spinocellular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the palatine tonsil were dried and analyzed using a scanning electron microscope with the X-ray microprobe of an energy-dispersive spectroscope. Demographic data and smoking histories were obtained. The principal metals found in almost all tissues analyzed were iron, chromium, nickel, aluminum, zinc, and copper. No significant difference in elemental composition {{was found between the}} group of patients with chronic tonsillitis and the group with <b>spinocellular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the palatine tonsil. Likewise, no significant difference was found between the group of smokers and the group of nonsmokers. The presence of various micro- and nano-sized metallic particles in human tonsils was confirmed. These particles may potentially cause an inflammatory response as well as neoplastic changes in human palatine tonsils similar to those occurring in the lungs. Further and more detailed studies addressing this issue, including studies designed to determine the chemical form of the metals detected, studies devoted to quantitative analysis, biokinetics, and to the degradation and elimination of nanoparticles are needed for a more detailed prediction of the relation between the diagnosis and the presence of specific metal nanoparticles in tonsillar tissue.

40|$|The {{prognosis}} for maxillary malignancies with posterior extension to the pterygo-maxillary and infratemporal fossae {{is worse than}} for those with anterior-inferior extrinsication. Maxillectomy using only an anterior approach does not enable enblock, radical resection of such tumors. Many different approaches to the infratemporal fossae have been described in the literature. The authors use a double infratemporal and transfacial approach. Between 1990 and 1998 this approach was used on 65 patients with malignant maxillary tumors. There was one post-operative death due to myocardial infarction. There were only 9 cases of temporal infection, and all were resolved. There were no cases of necrosis of either the temporal muscle or the revascularized flaps. The cases included the following tumors: <b>spinocellular</b> and anaplastic <b>carcinoma</b> (21 cases); adenoid-cystic carcinoma (16); adenocarcinoma (4); sarcoma (18); other malignant tumors (6). There were 29 primary tumors while the remaining 36 were recurrences from prior treatment. Using the UICC-AICC 1987 - 92 staging system there were 22 cases of T 3 and 43 T 4. Using the 1997 system there were 35 T 3 s and 30 T 4 s. Resection was radical in 54 cases while in the remaining 11 there were micro or macroscopic limitations at the rhinopharyngeal level and/or at the orbit apex. The NED survival percentages were: T 3 59. 2 %; T 4 28 % (using the 1987 - 92 system) while they were T 3 45. 7 % and T 4 26. 7 % (using the 1997 system). In the 41 patients with <b>carcinoma</b> (<b>spinocellular,</b> anaplastic, adeno and adenoid-cystic) the NED survival percentages were: T 3 54. 5 %; T 4 23. 4 % (using the 1987 - 92 system) while they were T 3 45 % and T 4 19 % (using the 1997 system). The NED survival percentage was 41. 4 % for primary tumors and 36. 1 % for recurrences. These results lead one to conclude that this surgical technique permits good results with T 3 -T 4 maxillary malignancies. The {{prognosis for}} recurrences is worse than for primary tumors and the prognosis for sarcoma is better than for carcinoma. The UICC-AICC staging systems are valid for prognostic purposes. The current analyses indicate that the 1987 - 92 system is slightly more suitable than the 1997 system. In fact, there were 13 patients which the 1987 - 92 system had classified as T 4 and which the 1997 system had reclassified as T 3. In all these cases the prognosis was more {{similar to that of}} T 4 than T 3...|$|R

40|$|Background The 21 st century {{opened with}} a {{revolution}} due to nanotechnology as special emerging technology. We have heard about nanobiotechnology, nanomedicine, nanomaterials, nanoparticles, etc. Applications of nanotechnologies {{in the field of}} medicine are growing rapidly. Areas such as disease diagnosis, drug delivery and molecular imaging are being investigated intensively. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify nano-sized particles in human tonsils tissues as an entering filter of air breathed. Methods Three main groups of tonsil samples were chosen for evaluation of the fine-particles presence. First group of samples were randomly selected tonsils of children undergoing “cold” tonsillectomy, second group tonsil samples of dead born children, and third group were tonsils with histologically proved <b>spinocellular</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> Dehydrated tissue samples were analyzed using scanning electron microscope with X-ray microanalysis (SEMEDX), which enabled analysis of particles morphology and elemental composition. Results Presence of various nanostructured metallic agglomerates in all groups assessed was confirmed. Dominant metals found almost in all tissues analyzed were iron and zinc. Differences were found between groups of various age, lifestyle, living environment affected by industrial processes and last but not least diagnose. Conclusion(s) The study allowed to ascertain that environmental pollution may strongly affect human health. Through SEM-EDX analysis it was possible to verify character and composition of particles, unintentionally released into the environment by industrial processes and road traffic, which were present in pathological tissues...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Expressive {{percent of}} {{patients}} with oral and oral pharynx carcinomas presents with overexpression of protein p 53 induced by tobacco, alcohol and radiotherapy. Objective: To describe the p 53 expression {{in areas of the}} normal mucosa adjacent to the tumor and in mouth and pharynx carcinomas. Method: Prospective study with clinical follow-up of one year of 24 patients with oral and oral pharynx <b>spinocellular</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> We performed biopsies in the neoplasm and areas of the normal mucosa adjacent to the tumor, before and 9 months following radiotherapy and an immunohistochemical study of p 53 expression. Results: Before radiotherapy, there was a change to the p 53 expression in 20 out of the 24 biopsies made in the neoplasm and in 14 in those of normal mucosa adjacent to the tumor. Eleven patients died 1 year before clinical follow-up. From the 2 initial patients with increase of p 53 after radiotherapy it remained increased in 7 in the neoplasm region and in 6 in the normal mucosa regions. We noticed association of p 53 with smoking and tumor stage (p < 5 %), but not with the degree of cellular differentiation and alcoholism. Conclusion: The increase to the p 53 expression was viewed both in the neoplasm region and in the normal mucosa in most patients with oral and oral pharynx carcinoma before and after radiotherapy. There was a statistically significant correlation of the p 53 expression with smoking and neoplasm stage...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies with}} {{infliximab}} indicate the therapeutic potential of tumour necrosis factor alpha blockade in spondyloarthropathy (SpA). Because defective host defence is {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis of SpA, the potential side effects of this treatment due to impact on the antimicrobial defence are a major concern. OBJECTIVE: To report systematically the adverse events seen in a large cohort of patients with SpA treated with infliximab, with special attention to bacterial infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 107 patients with SpA were treated with infliximab {{for a total of}} 191. 5 patient years. All serious and/or treatment related adverse events were reported. RESULTS: Eight severe infections occurred, including two reactivations of tuberculosis and three retropharyngeal abscesses, and six minor infections with clear bacterial focus. One patient developed a <b>spinocellular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the skin. No cases of demyelinating disease or lupus-like syndrome were seen. Two patients had an infusion reaction, which, however, did not relapse during the next infusion. Finally, three patients with ankylosing spondylitis developed palmoplantar pustulosis. All patients recovered completely with adequate treatment, and infliximab treatment had to be stopped in only five patients with severe infections. CONCLUSIONS: Although the global safety of infliximab in SpA is good compared with previous reports in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, the occurrence of infections such as tuberculosis and retropharyngeal abscesses highlights the importance of careful screening and follow up. Focal nasopharyngeal infections and infection related symptoms, possibly induced by streptococci, occurred frequently, suggesting an impairment of specific host defence mechanisms in Sp...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{transplant}} {{recipients are}} {{at higher risk}} of certain tumors such as lymphomas and skin cancers and than the general and dialysis populations. We retrospectively studied the prevalence of tumors in adult renal transplant recipients in four Tunisian centers of transplantation in Tunis, Monsatir and Sfax from January 1986 to January 2005. The study included 36 patients; 19 men and 17 women {{with a mean age}} of 34. 6 years (range from 18 - 54 years). The mean time since dialysis to transplantation was 43 months (6 - 131 months). Maintenance therapy was based on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in 86 &#x 0025; of cases, on antimetabolites and corticosteroids in 100 &#x 0025; of cases. Anti-thymoglobulin was administered in a mean course of 12. 4 days in 78 &#x 0025; of the patients. Acute rejection occurred in 25 cases and was treated with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies on 40 &#x 0025; of cases. Incidence of cancer among our population was 7 &#x 0025; and occurred after a mean period of 54 months of transplantation (range from 4 - 160 months). Eighty three percent of the tumors were solid, and the rest were in the skin. Kaposi sarcoma formed 41. 6 &#x 0025; and non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma 27. 7 &#x 0025; of the solid tumors, while <b>spinocellular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> formed 83 &#x 0025; and basocellular carcinoma 17 &#x 0025; of the skin tumors. Switching CNI to sirolimus in 8. 3 &#x 0025; cases was associated with a favorable outcome. Mortality was the outcome in 33. 3 &#x 0025; of the patients with cancer, while partial or complete regression of cancers was observed in 55. 5 &#x 0025; cases after decreasing the doses of the immunosuppressive medications. We conclude that post renal transplant cancer is mainly characterized by the predominance of Kaposi sarcoma favored by solar exposure and rigorously induced and maintained immunosuppression.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar casos confirmados de câncer de pulmão, revisando suas variáveis epidemiológicas, clínicas, estadiamento e tratamento. MÉTODOS: Foram estudados 263 casos provenientes do Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Federal do Paraná e do Hospital Erasto Gaertner, instituições responsáveis por parcela significativa do atendimento a pacientes na cidade de Curitiba (PR). Realizou-se um estudo retrospectivo através de preenchimento de questionário e os dados obtidos foram analisados de forma descritiva, utilizando-se o {{software}} EPI-INFO. RESULTADOS: Houve predomínio de pacientes do sexo masculino (76 %), sendo que a maioria dos pacientes era fumante ou ex-fumante por ocasião do diagnóstico (90 %). Não havia referência a doença pulmonar prévia em 87 % dos casos. Tosse (142 casos) e dor torácica (92 casos) foram os sintomas iniciais mais freqüentes. O câncer de pulmão tipo não pequenas células foi encontrado em 87 % dos pacientes e o tipo histológico mais freqüente foi o carcinoma espinocelular, representando 49 % dos casos. O tabagismo foi considerado o fator predisponente mais importante. CONCLUSÃO: As características evolutivas do câncer de pulmão, como a inespecificidade dos sintomas iniciais e o tempo e evolução do tumor, somadas à ausência de programas de rastreamento efetivos, constituem os principais fatores que contribuem para a não detecção da neoplasia pulmonar de forma precoce, o que torna difícil o tratamento e dificulta o aumento da sobrevida. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate confirmed {{cases of}} lung cancer, reviewing epidemiological variables, clinical variables, staging and treatment. METHODS: The cases of 263 patients were studied. All {{of the patients}} had been treated at the Universidade Federal do Paraná (Federal University of Paraná) Hospital de Clínicas or at the Hospital Erasto Gaertner, two institutions that, together, serve {{a significant portion of}} the patients seeking treatment in the city of Curitiba, located in the state of Paraná. This was a retrospective study, involving the administration of questionnaires. The descriptive analysis of the data obtained was performed using the Epi-Info program. RESULTS: There was a predominance of male patients (76 %). At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients (90 %) were smokers or former smokers. In 87 % of the cases, there was no history of lung disease. The most common initial symptoms were cough (142 cases) and chest pain (92 cases). Non-small cell lung cancer was found in 87 % of the patients, and the most common histological type was <b>spinocellular</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> which was found in 49 % of all of the patients. Smoking was found to be the most significant predisposing factor. CONCLUSION: The characteristics of lung cancer progression, such as the nonspecificity of the initial symptoms, the duration of tumor growth and the course of the tumor, together with the lack of tracking programs, are the principal factors that hinder the early detection of lung cancer, making it difficult to treat lung cancer patients and to increase their survival...|$|E
