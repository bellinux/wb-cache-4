5000|$|Herbal viagra is a {{name that}} can be given to any herbal product advertised as {{treating}} erectile dysfunction.

5000|$|Viagra was {{the first}} PDE5 {{inhibitor}} on the market. Originally created {{as a treatment for}} high blood pressure in 1989, it was found to have a secondary use as an effective PDE5 inhibitor, enabling men who use it to gain stronger erections after arousal. The FDA approved Viagra on March 27, 1998. [...] Viagra contains <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate</b> packaged as a pill. Discovered by Pfizer, sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum in the penis. This means that, when sildenafil is present in the organism, normal sexual stimulation leads to increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, which leads to better erections. Without sexual stimulation and no activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection.|$|E

5000|$|The therapies {{available}} to manage PPHN include the high frequency ventilation, surfactant instillation, inhaled nitric oxide, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. These expensive and/or invasive modalities are unavailable {{in the developing}} countries where the frequency and mortality of PPHN {{is likely to be}} much higher due to higher incidence of asphyxia and sepsis. In developing countries, the medical facilities are usually supplied with outdated equipment that was initially donated. [...] "For people in developing countries, basic medical supplies are luxuries that are simply not available or not affordable. Doctors and nurses must constantly make do - washing and reusing [...] "disposable" [...] gloves and syringes, or substituting inappropriate materials such as fishing line or sewing thread for suture- or patients must go without needed care. In many countries patients must bring their own supplies, even acquire their own medicines, before treatment can be given." [...] The limitations made it necessary to search for cheaper therapies, assuring quick effectiveness and stabilization of the patient going through a very high-risk situation. The treatments are chosen on the basis of low cost, low-tech, wide availability, and safety in the hands of non-professionals. Therefore, oral <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate,</b> has been the alternative way of therapy. The cost comparison shows that sildenafil is lower in cost than iNO and more readily available. There is improvement in oxygenation when oral sildenifal is administered according to the studies found in the Official Journal of the American Academy of Pediatric. The positive research results for varies studies indicates that oral sildenifal is a feasible source to improve oxygenation and survival in critical ill infants with PPHN secondary to parenchymal lung disease in centers without access to high-frequency ventilation, iNO, or ECMO.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Sildenafil</b> <b>citrate</b> may {{increase}} endometrial thickness and {{affect the outcome}} of frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the effect of <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate</b> on ultrasonographic endometrial thickness and pattern and to investigate the estrogen level on the day of progesterone administration, the implantation rate and chemical pregnancy rate in frozen embryo transfer cycles. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 80 patients who had an antecedent of poor endometrial response and frozen embryos. 40 patients were given estradiol by a step up method with menstruation to prepare the endometrium, and the other 40 were given <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate</b> tablets (50 mg) daily in addition to the above treatment protocol from the first day of the cycle until the day progesterone was started. This was discontinued 48 - 72 hours prior to the embryo transfer. Results: The endometrial thickness was significantly higher in the <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate</b> group (p< 0. 0001), the triple line patterns of the endometrium were significantly higher in the <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate</b> group (p< 0. 0001), while the intermediate patterns of the endometrium were not significantly different in the two groups. The echogen patterns of the endometrium were significantly higher in control group (p< 0. 0001). Finally, implantation rate and the chemical pregnancy rates were higher in the <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate</b> group but not significantly. Conclusion: As our study shows, the oral use of <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate</b> is a good way to improve the endometrial receptivity. We recommend the routine use of oral <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate</b> in patients with a previous failure of assisted reproduction technology cycles due to poor endometrial thickness...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sildenafil</b> <b>citrate</b> {{is a drug}} {{commonly}} used to manage erectile dysfunction.

It is a highly selective inhibitor of cyclic guanine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase type 5. In late March through mid-November 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a report on 130 confirmed deaths among men (mean age, 64 years) who received prescriptions for <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate,</b> a period during which > 6 million outpatient prescriptions (representing about 50 million tablets) were dispensed. The US FDA recently reported that significant cardiovascular events, including sudden cardiac death, have occurred in men with erectile dysfunction who were taking <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate.</b> These reports have raised concerns that <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate</b> may {{increase the risk of}} cardiovascular events, particularly fatal arrhythmias, in patients with cardiovascular disease. In the past few years, the cardiac electrophysiological effects of <b>sildenafil</b> <b>citrate</b> have been investigated extensively in both animal and clinical studies.
