5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 <b>stories</b> <b>were</b> produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. The best of these <b>stories</b> <b>were</b> published in Dutch as well, just like it was done with the later Bessys, but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E

The story is told {{through the eyes of}} Vaan, an orphan who wishes to be a sky pirate, and the cadre of other characters he encounters throughout the adventure. The visuals of the characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida, while their <b>stories</b> <b>were</b> created by Yasumi Matsuno. The characters were designed to look and behave unlike any that had existed in the Final Fantasy series. Their <b>stories</b> <b>were</b> written to create a script where neither side was truly right or wrong, but instead just had different opinions and interpretations of the events occurring in the game.|$|E

50|$|There are {{conflicting}} views amongst Muslims as {{to whether}} reading and writing fictional <b>stories</b> <b>is</b> or is not halal (permissible) within Islam. In fiqh, although not outright considered haram (impermissible), “abandoning busying oneself with <b>stories</b> <b>is</b> preferable” and fiction <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> seen as a frivolous way for a Muslim to use their time. Another interpretation <b>is</b> that fictional <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> permissible and even encouraged for purposes of dawah, to help people to learn about Islam, {{as long as the}} author has made clear that the <b>story</b> <b>is</b> not true. As well, the writing should be in the style of Islamic fiction.|$|R

This is because Branham's autobiographical <b>stories</b> <b>were</b> often embellished, and sometimes contradictory.

Robert Holmes was assigned the opening four-part story and Philip Martin the second four-part story. The final six episodes were to be broken up into three two-part stories.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stories</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} {{property of}} particular clans.

Certain <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> however essentially felt to be in the public domain, such as many of the humorous tales in the Raven cycle. The artistic representation of characters or situations from <b>stories</b> that <b>are</b> known property of certain clans is an infringement on the clan's property rights to that story.|$|R

50|$|Naim Kattan wrote Cities of Birth, a {{short story}} about place. The <b>story</b> <b>is</b> {{a celebration of the}} cities that have enriched Kattan’s life.

The <b>story</b> <b>is</b> about Paris, Berlin, Montreal and Istanbul. However, the essence of the <b>story</b> <b>is</b> about the experiences Kattan had in each place and his Jewish heritage.|$|R
