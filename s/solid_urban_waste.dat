40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> {{management}} (USWM) {{problems facing}} {{cities in the}} developed and developing world are well documented; however, progress in tackling them is very slow in the latter. There are still many communities, neighbourhoods, and local markets where garbage is not collected for a considerable length of time. Many of the affected houses are situated in poor neighbourhoods on the edges and core areas of cities. In order to secure the future of urban environments {{in the developing world}} from continuous or perpetual decay, it is important to study the role of social capital in <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management. Toward this end, a case study research was carried out in Ibadan, Nigeria. For the purpose of the study, social capital was defined as the attributes of social organization, such as trust, cultural norms and social networks by which communities facilitate action. Emerging research suggests that social capital might have an important role to play in effective community-based <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management initiatives. Empirical evidence suggests that communities {{with a high level of}} social capital are in better shape to organize a community-based <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management project, if the other factors remain supportive. This dissertation seeks to place the concept of social capital in the practice of <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management, especially at the community level as well as on a wider philosophical and policy levels. The intention here is to advance the understanding of social capital both in relation to its nature as a quality of community life and in terms of its significance as an instrument in the hands of the agents of change. Therefore, this research examines the degree to which social capital and community-based organizations are important in the overall functioning of <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management at the community level in Ibadan, Nigeria. The main objective of the research was to explore the role of social capital in community-based <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management and to understand why people participate in voluntary associations for the provision of common goods in Ibadan, Nigeria. This objective is pursued in three specific dimensions: (i) to understand and document the feature of the current solid waste management system in Ibadan; (ii) to explore the extent to which social capital affects community-based <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management success; (iii) to identify other elements that could facilitate successful <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management at the community and institutional levels. 	This study adopts both quantitative and qualitative approaches using multiple data gathering techniques (e. g.) semi-structured face-to-face interviews, direct field observation, focus group, and information sections; conversations with community leaders, key informants, government officials and waste generators to gather different but relevant information and data. The secondary data includes data on waste management from Oyo State Solid Waste Management Authority (OSSWMA) and valuation data from the office of Sustainable Ibadan Project (SIP). The quantitative section of the research encompasses 66 core questions on Social Capital via Integrated Questionnaire. The structured questionnaire measures various elements of social capital using four proxies. The data set covered 7 communities and 385 households and the basic unit of analysis was the neighbourhood. Major findings from the study include: (i) No evidence suggesting that homogeneity is a virtue for collective action in <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management at the community level nor is there evidence suggesting that homogeneity increases civic engagement in the communities studied. (ii) Empirical evidence suggests that to a great extent, social capital can influence the success of community-based <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management initiatives. However, social networks among private and professional associations, the density and diversity of social network differ within and between communities. (iii) Empirical field observation results show that social capital had positive influence on the success of community-based <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management in Bodija, Ayeye, and communities. (iv) The study results indicate that the residents of Agbowo, NTC Road, Foko, and Sasa communities failed to establish community-based USWM initiatives for a range of reasons. Some of the reasons include the paucity of face-to-face interactions among households; resident’s cultural and behavioural differences, lack of charismatic leadership and lack of cooperation among community members. (v) The study results and direct field observations also suggest that there is high-level of social capital among individuals involved in <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management at the community level in the city of Ibadan. (vi) Field information/observations from Ayeye, Bodija, and Alesinloye communities reveal that social networks and interpersonal relationships were constructed along the line of local identity among the residents. (vii) Empirical findings suggest that the presence of a network of ties based on acquaintances, business partnerships, religious groups, and people from the same region, living in the same community, serve as a foundation for building social relations. The study concluded that Putnam’s generalization and conceptualization of social capital is not completely or equally applicable to different social and political environments. Therefore, it needs to be contextualized according to local problems in order to obtain the gains. The research also reveals that social capital alone is not enough to form community-based <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management projects in Ibadan, Nigeria.

However, uncertain land tenure means that farmers have little incentive to ensure the safe disposal of dangerous elements in solid waste. Current plans would eliminate this recycling practice and promote largescale composting, but the cost for farmers will be too high, leaving them with an incentive to make their own illicit arrangements for acquiring waste material. Furthermore, small enterprises and associations that have come to play a complementary and innovative role in waste management would be forced out. The key challenges for policy are to build on economic and institutional reality and to regard urban waste not as a dangerous nuisance but as a source of nutrients for agriculture.

40|$|The adoption, {{in these}} last years, of {{specialised}} equipment or complex processing architectures developed to separate solid waste materials, resulting from the selective collection of <b>solid</b> <b>urban</b> <b>waste</b> (equipment or manufactured goods dismantling {{at the end of}} their life cycle) requires more and more control systems able to “qualify” the products during the processing. Such a goal, when implemented “on-line”, is usually realised in two steps. The attributes (physical, chemical, morphological, morphometrical, textural, etc.) of the materials resulting from processing are detected and numerically modelled. The resulting feature vector is then “handled” by a software architecture performing the required recognition/classification procedure and defining the quality of the investigated products. “Feed-back” or “feed-forward” control strategies can be then applied to improve equipment or processing architectures performances. In this paper are analysed and described the problems encountered and the results achieved when statistical adaptive classifiers or a neural net based architectures are adopted to define an “artificial intelligence software unit” able to perform the recognition of several solid waste materials, at industrial recycling processing plant level, starting from their preliminary optical recognition...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} worldwide {{demand for}} resources, {{the shortage of}} raw materials and new EU directives {{form the basis for}} Urban Mining, the core concept of which comprises obtaining recyclable materials from <b>solid</b> <b>urban</b> <b>waste</b> and residual production materials. Up to now, secondary raw materials have only been insufficiently exploited as defined within the context of recycling management. Established material life cycles concentrate primarily on materials such as scrap glass or scrap paper that are available as mono-fractions. Mixed waste streams often containing highly valuable materials remain by and large excluded from any such considerations. In order to enhance the use of secondary raw materials, robust logistics systems which meet the high quality and supply demands of their customers as well as an increased integration of waste disposal companies into the supply chain structures of manufacturing companies are essential. The TraCy project supports this approach by developing economically feasible models for closing materials cycles which are not found at all today, or at least not in sufficient quantities. The aim of this is the paradigm shift "From supply chain management to supply cycle management"...|$|E

40|$|In this work, an {{analysis}} of the generation, composition and management of the <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> in Mexico and its relation to greenhouse gas emissions is described; as well a case study in More-los, a state in the central region of the country. Data were collected from the scientific literature and existing data bases at state and national levels. In addition, the emissions of greenhouse gas were calculated for a period of 14 years, using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology. The municipal solid waste data collected from 1998 to 2012 reveal an increa-se in the amount of waste generated in Mexico and in Morelos (38 % and 43 %, respectively), which have been influenced by the urbanization process and the population increase. According to the official data, the composition of the <b>urban</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> in Mexico, is mostly organic matter (50 %), represented by food and garden residues, as well as paper and cardboard (near to 14 %). While in Morelos, the percentages of generation for these materials are 44 % and 9 %, respectively. The management of the <b>urban</b> <b>waste</b> mainly consists of house collection, principally in metropolita...|$|R
