25|$|The five-quarter Humanities {{sequence}} {{forms the}} cornerstone of Revelle's academic requirements. The sequence requires <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> and respond to humanistic philosophy and literature. The first two courses, usually taken by first-year students, focus on intensive writing instruction while covering literature and history from the Hebrew Bible, ancient Greece, ancient Rome, the Bible, and the Middle Ages. The following three courses cover the remainder of Western civilization, from Renaissance literature to modern socialist and nationalist movements. Since 2007, Revelle students have also {{had the option of}} taking Humanities 3 in Italy through the Revelle in Rome program.|$|E

The present notes are intended as {{no more than}} a gateway to the larger theory. They review just the most elementary part of the theory (bearing on Kolmogorov- and ML-randomness). We hope that the simple arguments presented here will encourage the enterprising <b>student</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> richer treatments of the subject available elsewhere, notably, in Downey and Hirschfeldt (2010).

These advancements have opened new opportunities {{in which we}} can integrate the social networking site with the learning process of students and lecturers. This research is based on the descriptive object and explanatory object, for the main purpose of exploring a new area of research. The research will employ the use of <b>student</b> experiences <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the impact of social networking site on their educational experience and student life. Therefore, the main objectives of the research are 1) <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the relationship between social networking and learning outcome; 2) <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the relationship between social networking and <b>Student</b> Learning; 3) <b>To</b> <b>examine</b> the relationship between social networking and <b>Student</b> Engagement; 4) <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the relationship between Student Learning and learning outcome; and 5) <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the relationship between Student Engagement and learning outcome...|$|R

The {{line of demarcation}} between these two fields is not firmly established in the Middle Ages. Gallo explains that [...] "both of these liberal arts taught composition and taught the <b>student</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the diction, figurative language, and meters of the curriculum authors who were to serve as models for imitation. However it was rhetoric and not grammar that was concerned with Invention of subject matter and with disposition or organization of the work" [...] as well as memory and delivery (72).|$|R

50|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{students}} were awarded the Dartington Diploma of Music in Education before transferring to Rolle College in Exmouth {{to complete a}} Certificate in Education. Some students later added a Batchelor of Education to their qualifications. In later years, all BA students embarked on a Contextual Enquiry Project in their third year of study. This was an investigative project and required the <b>student</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> {{his or her work}} in a broader social context. The practice was an example of the College's roots in Dartington School and the alternative education movement which developed from the ideas of Rudolf Steiner from the early twentieth century onwards. Jai Northover was also an acclaimed student of this fine institution.|$|R
50|$|JiTT {{assignments}} and classroom activities {{are designed to}} motivate the <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> their present knowledge {{and get ready to}} modify such knowledge, add to it and then apply the newly constructed knowledge.

In this way JiTT is supportive of the three main factors identified by Alexander Astin as contributing to success in college: student-student interaction, student-faculty interaction and time on task.|$|E

No project was a failure if the experiment failed because failure opened the way to other findings. If the student learned something about himself and his choices than he had succeeded.|$|E

30|$|Approaches to {{assessing}} students’ {{understanding of}} the engineering design process (EDP) are varied in research and practice. Many of the methods are qualitative in nature. For example, several researchers have used interviews with both <b>students</b> and teachers <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> a broad-range of perspectives of the EDP, including understanding of design practices, as well as variants of approaches and perspectives of design. Alemdar et al. (2017 a, 2017 b) applied <b>student</b> interviews <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>student</b> understandings of the design process, perspectives of the collaborative design experience, and recognition of engineering connections to other content areas.
