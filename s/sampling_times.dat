40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [73]- 75) Instead {{of using}} the trial-and-error approach, this thesis proposes a systematic procedure of a fuzzy controller design. In this procedure, a symmetric decision table is decided by the sliding mode approach first Then, two scaling factors, Kj and K 2, are adjusted {{with the aid of}} the phase plane portraits. Since the problem which always comes with the sliding mode control is the control discontinuity, or the chattering, a more precise symmetric decision table is used in this paper to smooth out the chattering in a thin boundary layer neighboring the switching surface. The simulation results indicate that the suggested design procedure improves the stability of a system with nonlinearity or with disturbance. In digital control systems, a proper <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> is essential to the desired <b>time</b> response. A <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> too small or a <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> too big will affect the system seriously. A proper range of the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> for a fuzzy control system can be chosen. In the sliding-mode-aided fuzzy control system design, a proper <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> is deeply related to the scaling factor, K 2. In addition to introducing the relation between the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> and K 2, this paper offers a method to choose the values of the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> and K 2 which is easily implemented and also makes the system stable.

In this note we show that, for any <b>sampling</b> <b>time,</b> diagonal Padé approximations of any order preserve quadratic Lyapunov functions for LTI systems and switched linear systems. Also, for a certain type of switching system where a quadratic Lyapunov function does not necessarily exist, yet the system is stable, we show that certain even ordered diagonal Padé transformations also preserve stability regardless of the <b>sampling</b> <b>time.</b> Other Padé approximations also preserve stability provided the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> is less than a readily computable upper bound. ...|$|R
30|$|Depending on the {{processing}} speed, {{the processing}} phase can partially or completely happen {{in parallel with}} the <b>sampling</b> phase.

The sensing efficiency is then defined as the ratio of the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> and the summation of the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> and the processing time. During the processing <b>time,</b> the <b>sampling</b> of the wireless medium is put onto hold, which means that the sensing engine is ‘blind’.

Ideally, the blind time should be reduced to zero, meaning 100 % sensing efficiency to achieve seamless detection.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first problem}} {{is the extent to}} which the sample may be {{representative}} of the water source of interest. Many water sources vary with time and with location. The measurement of interest may vary seasonally or from day to night or in response to some activity of man or natural populations of aquatic plants and animals. The measurement of interest may vary with distances from the water boundary with overlying atmosphere and underlying or confining soil. The sampler must determine if a single time and location meets the needs of the investigation, or if the water use of interest can be satisfactorily assessed by averaged values with time and location, or if critical maxima and minima require individual measurements over a range of times, locations or events. The sample collection procedure must assure correct weighting of individual <b>sampling</b> <b>times</b> and locations where averaging is appropriate. Where critical maximum or minimum values exist, statistical methods must be applied to observed variation to determine an adequate number of samples to assess probability of exceeding those critical values.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new analysis technique for fluorescence fluctuation data. Time-integrated fluorescence cumulant analysis (TIFCA) extracts information from the cumulants of the integrated fluorescence intensity. TIFCA builds on our earlier FCA theory, but in contrast to FCA or photon counting histogram (PCH) analysis is valid for arbitrary <b>sampling</b> <b>times.</b> The motivation for long <b>sampling</b> <b>times</b> lies in {{the improvement of the}} signal/noise ratio of the data. Because FCA and PCH theory are not valid in this regime, we first derive a theoretical model of cumulant functions for arbitrary <b>sampling</b> <b>times.</b> TIFCA is the first exact theory that describes the effects of sampling time on fluorescence fluctuation experiments. We calculate factorial cumulants of the photon counts for various <b>sampling</b> <b>times</b> by rebinning of the original data. Fits of the data to models determine the brightness, the occupation number, and the diffusion time of each species. To provide the tools for a rigorous error analysis of TIFCA, expressions for the variance of cumulants are developed and tested. We demonstrate that over a limited range rebinning reduces the relative error of higher order cumulants, and therefore improves the signal/noise ratio. The first four cumulant functions are explicitly calculated and are applied to simple dye systems to test the validity of TIFCA and demonstrate its ability to resolve species...|$|E
40|$|This thesis will {{consider}} methods associated with irregularly spaced sampling of a real-valued continuous time stationary process. The problem of Monte Carlo simulation {{as well as}} parametric estimation under irregularly spaced <b>sampling</b> <b>times</b> will be discussed. For the simulation problem, the {{focus will be on}} the spectral simulation method. A novel algorithm has been proposed for the determination of the spectral simulation scheme, which is optimal in the sense of achieving required accuracy with minimal computational costs. The problem of parametric estimation under irregularly spaced <b>sampling</b> <b>times</b> will also be discussed. We will adapt the framework stochastic <b>sampling</b> <b>times,</b> in which the irregularity of the <b>sampling</b> <b>times</b> is modeled through a renewal point process over the real line. By constructing a second order discrete time stationary process from sampling, a parametric estimation method based on the well-known Whittle log-likelihood function will be proposed. Asymptotic consistency of the resulting estimator will be proved by borrowing existing results from literature of renewal theory. Moreover the performance issue of this proposed estimation procedure will be investigated further. It will be shown that by calculating the spectral density of the sampled discrete time process through a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) approximation, the Whittle log-likelihood function can indeed be evaluated relatively efficiently. This estimation method, however, will induce information loss, which will be shown {{to be related to the}} unique properties of the renewal kernel function. Although a accurate analysis of the renewal kernel function is not easy, it is still possible to provide some insights on the determining factors of the information loss through asymptotic calculations...|$|E
