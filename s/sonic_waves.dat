25|$|Its {{abilities}} and overall appearance varied greatly during the classic series. The name implies that it operates {{through the use}} of sound waves to exert physical forces on objects remotely. During the Second Doctor's tenure, it functioned much as its name implied—using <b>sonic</b> <b>waves</b> to dismantle equipment or to bypass locks. In addition, it was used as a welding torch in Episode Five of The Dominators. In the audio commentary for The Sea Devils, Michael Briant claims to have suggested it as a one-off gadget in 1968.|$|E
25|$|During the Third Doctor's tenure, {{producer}} Barry Letts {{was adamant}} that the device {{not become a}} cure-all for the series, and limited its use to avoid writers becoming over-reliant on it. During this time, the device underwent significant design changes. In The Sea Devils, the Doctor used it to detonate landmines; Michael E. Briant explains that this was feasible, stating that the <b>sonic</b> <b>waves</b> shook the mines. In The Three Doctors the sonic screwdriver is almost unrecognisable, being a unique, one-use prop with a plastic red spherical head. In the DVD commentary, Letts himself remarks on {{the thickness of the}} prop {{and the fact that it}} belies the idea that it was the regular one, prompting Katy Manning to question whether it was indeed a sonic screwdriver. This was due to the serial being produced out of transmission order: the original sonic screwdriver prop went missing during the recording of Carnival of Monsters, requiring a new prop to be built for the rest of the season; The Three Doctors was recorded after Carnival, but set before it, so the screwdriver could be seen to revert to its previous appearance for one story after The Three Doctors before receiving a more permanent redesign thereafter.|$|E
500|$|A mutant {{capable of}} {{emitting}} incredibly strong ultrasonic screams, sonic blasts, sonic bursts, and <b>sonic</b> <b>waves</b> used {{in various ways}} including {{as a means of}} flight. Jones auditioned without knowing what X-Men character he was up for, saying he auditioned because it was a superhero that fit his biotype: [...] "I've got red hair and freckles, I'm not gonna be Batman, Robin or Spider-Man". The actor also stated that the script defined the character more than the comics, as Banshee went through various reinventions in print. Given Banshee gets involved with MacTaggert in the comics, Jones also tried to [...] "look at her just a little bit differently, you know, when I can." [...] As Jones suffers from acrophobia, using the rig that was to depict Banshee's flight required much preparation time with the stunt team.|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} on the testing of concrete elasticity {{has been done in}} order to measure concrete compressive strength using a non destructive test based on <b>sonic</b> <b>wave</b> velocity. An equipment that was used for this research was a <b>Sonic</b> <b>Wave</b> Analyzer (SOWAN). In this research, concrete samples were formed in cylindrical shape with 15 cm diameter and 30 cm length. The compressive strengths of this concrete were 19, 23, and 25 (⁄). After that the time delay of <b>sonic</b> <b>wave</b> was measured. The research results showed that primary and secondary <b>sonic</b> <b>wave</b> velocity, elasticity, and compressive strenght were = 3525 m/s, = 1950 m/s, 23240 x N/, and 24 x (⁄) respectively. Based on the data, it was concluded that this non destructive test based on <b>sonic</b> <b>wave</b> velocity can be used to measure the concrete compressive strength, because the values obtained were comparable to the values obtained using the Universal Testing Machine (UTM) which is a destructive test...|$|R

50|$|Alternatively, at Mach numbers {{increasing}} {{towards the}} speed of sound and beyond, wave drag dominates design concerns. As the aircraft displaces the air, a <b>sonic</b> <b>wave</b> is generated. Sweeping the wings away from the nose of the aircraft can keep the wings aft of the <b>sonic</b> <b>wave,</b> greatly reducing drag. Unfortunately, for a given wing design, increasing sweep decreases the aspect ratio. At high speeds, both subsonic and supersonic, an oblique wing would be pivoted at up to 60 degrees to the aircraft's fuselage for better high-speed performance. The studies showed these angles would decrease aerodynamic drag, permitting increased speed and longer range with the same fuel expenditure.|$|R

40|$|Measurements of <b>sonic</b> <b>wave</b> {{velocity}} and of porosity {{have been carried}} out on the Campanian so-called "craie blanche" (white chalk) of the Mons Basin. They have been made on cores collected perpendicular to normal fault planes, at different distances, between 0 (fault plane) and 30 cm. The applications of the continuity index, deduced from the sonic velocity, to these measurements allow us to estimate the amount of microcracking. A new evaluation of the used coefficients, after the physical characteristics of the intact material, has been necessary. The systematic comparison of the values of both {{velocity and}} porosity highlight the matrix transformations (decreasing of porosity by calcitic cementation) in a narrow band of about 10 cm {{on both sides of the}} fault planes. Depending on the stratigraphic level, the porosity of the intact chalk ranges between 40 and 44 % and the <b>sonic</b> <b>wave</b> velocity between 2300 and 2600 m/s. Close to the fault planes, the porosity is about 30 to 35 % and the <b>sonic</b> <b>wave</b> velocity about 2700 to 2900 m/s. Along the fault planes, the rock material has an anisotropic behaviour, due to both vertical tectonic microcracking and calcitic barriers resulting from cementation.
