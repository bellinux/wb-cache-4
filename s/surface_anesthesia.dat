40|$|The {{electrical}} impedance {{of a part}} of brain approximately 1 -mm dimensions was measured with a four-electrode, very low current method in 61 male rats. The testing frequency was usually only 1000 Hz, and only the magnitude of impedance was measured. Impedance increased in paradoxical sleep in 42 of the 61 sites and decreased at three sites in the pons. The greatest changes were in subiculum and presubiculum with changes usually more than 10 % and up to 25 - 30 %. Intermediate changes of 2 - 10 % were found in parasubiculum and entorhinal cortex. Most other changes were less than 4 %, {{and there is a}} suggestion of greater changes in the pretectal area. All sites with changes greater than 4 % were within 1 mm of a pial or ependymal <b>surface.</b> During <b>anesthesia</b> with pentobarbital in 23 rats impedance increased in two, eight showed no change, and 13 decreased. During unrestrained spontaneous activity in a small familiar cage the impedance usually became either more variable or decreased generally to a maximum of 1 - 10 %, or both, but at a single site the response was not always the same. No tests beyond simple observation were used, and with this limited basis no clearer relation of impedance to behavior than simply to motor activity was apparent. In a change from quiet arousal to slow-wave sleep, or vice versa, there were no impedance changes. But at all sites activity usually had an effect. This was particularly marked in entorhinal cortex [...] parasubiculum and brain stem. Almost no other impedance changes were seen than of these three types. Impedance changes in brain are thus widespread and occur frequently in the usual behavior of rats. These results generally corroborate and expand the results of the Adey-Kado group with a different method with some advantages...|$|R

40|$|Background: Anesthetic agents alter microcirculation, {{influencing}} tissue oxygenation {{and delivery}} of vital substrates. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging is a widespread technique {{in the field of}} microvascular research that can evaluate noninvasively and in real time the effects of environmental conditions, physical manipulations, diseases and treatments on peripheral perfusion. This study aims to evaluate laser Doppler perfusion imaging as a means to detect changes in skin microcirculation induced by some popular anesthetic agents in a murine model. Twenty-four age- and gender-matched healthy CD 1 mice were examined by laser Doppler perfusion imaging. The skin microcirculatory response was measured at the level of plantar <b>surfaces</b> during isoflurane <b>anesthesia</b> with or without subsequent dexmedetomidine or acepromazine. At the end of the procedure, dexmedetomidine was reversed by atipamezole administration. Results: In all mice, skin blood flow under isoflurane anesthesia did not show significant differences over time (P = 0. 1). The serial perfusion pattern and values following acepromazine or dexmedetomidine administration differed significantly (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: We standardized a reliable laser Doppler perfusion imaging protocol to non-invasively assess changes in skin microcirculation induced by anesthesia in mice, considering the advantages and drawbacks of this technique and its translational value.

40|$|Abstract. Lidocaine, as an {{anesthetic}} substance, {{is often}} used for <b>surface</b> and spinal <b>anesthesia.</b> However, {{studies have shown that}} lidocaine may induce transient neurological symptoms and cauda equina syndrome. In the present study the effects of the ginsenoside Rg 1 (Rg 1) on lidocaine-induced apop-tosis were assessed in Jurkat cells using flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). The data showed that incubation with Rg 1 provides protection against lidocaine-induced apoptosis in cultured Jurkat cells. In order to investigate the effect of Rg 1 on the apoptosis pathway, caspase 3 gene expression was determined. The results suggested that the protective effect of Rg 1 on lidocaine-induced apoptosis is mediated by altering the level of B-cell lymphoma- 2 (BCL- 2) family proteins and downregulating caspase- 3 expression. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that incubation with Rg 1 provides protection against lidocaine-induced apoptosis in cultured Jurkat cells. In addition, the study demonstrated that Rg 1 is a notable antiapoptotic molecule that is capable of blocking the caspase-dependent signaling cascade in Jurkat cells, and that the protective effect of Rg 1 on lidocaine-induced apoptosis is mediated by altering levels of BCL- 2 family proteins and down-regulating caspase- 3 expression. The present study provides the basis for understanding and evaluating the effect of Rg 1 in the in vivo treatment of lidocaine-induced transient neurological symptoms and cauda equina syndrome by lidocaine...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that arousal pathways in the brain play important roles in emergence from general anesthesia, the roles of monoaminergic arousal circuits are unclear. In this study, the authors tested the hypothesis that methylphenidate (an inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters) induces emergence from isoflurane general anesthesia. Methods: Using adult rats, the authors tested the effect of intravenous methylphenidate on time to emergence from isoflurane general anesthesia. They then performed experiments to test separately for methylphenidate-induced changes in arousal and changes in minute ventilation. A dose–response study was performed to test for methylphenidate-induced restoration of righting during continuous isoflurane general <b>anesthesia.</b> <b>Surface</b> electroencephalogram recordings were performed to observe neurophysiological changes. Plethysmography recordings and arterial blood gas analysis were performed to assess methylphenidate-induced changes in respiratory function. Intravenous droperidol was administered to test for inhibition of methylphenidate's actions. Results: Methylphenidate decreased median time to emergence from 280 to 91 s. The median difference in time to emergence without methylphenidate compared with administration of methylphenidate was 200 [155 – 331] s (median, [95 % CI]). During continuous inhalation of isoflurane, methylphenidate induced return of righting in a dose-dependent manner, induced a shift in electroencephalogram power from delta (less than 4 Hz) to theta (4 – 8 Hz), and induced an increase in minute ventilation. Administration of intravenous droperidol (0. 5 mg/kg) before intravenous methylphenidate (5 mg/kg) largely inhibited methylphenidate-induced emergence behavior, electroencephalogram changes, and changes in minute ventilation. Conclusions: Methylphenidate actively induces emergence from isoflurane general anesthesia by increasing arousal and respiratory drive, possibly through activation of dopaminergic and adrenergic arousal circuits. The authors' findings suggest that methylphenidate may be useful clinically as an agent to reverse general anesthetic-induced unconsciousness and respiratory depression {{at the end of}} surgery.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} prostaglandins are {{involved}} in endothelium-dependent vasodilatory responses of the skin microcirculation. METHODS: Twenty-three young male volunteers were studied on 2 different days 1 - 3 weeks apart. On each experimental day the forearm skin blood flow response to iontophoretically applied acetylcholine (Ach, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator) was determined with laser Doppler imaging following the intravenous administration of either the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor lysine acetylsalicylate (L-AS), 900 mg, or the oral intake of indomethacin, 75 mg. Acetylcholine was iontophoresed both in presence and in absence of <b>surface</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> In some subjects, the effects of L-AS on skin reactive hyperemia were also assessed. RESULTS: Acute cyclo-oxygenase inhibition with either drug influenced neither the skin blood flow response to 4 different doses of Ach (0. 28, 1. 4, 7, and 14 mC/cm 2) nor reactive hyperemia. The peak vasodilatory response to Ach was significantly increased by skin anesthesia, {{regardless of whether the}} subjects received the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor or not. For example, the mean response (+/-SD) to the largest dose of Ach (tested in 6 subjects, expressed in perfusion units) were as follows: in absence of anesthesia: L-AS 339 +/- 105, placebo 344 +/- 68; with anesthesia: L-AS 453 +/- 76, placebo 452 +/- 65 (p <. 01 for effect of anesthesia).

40|$|Endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{might be}} an important and early event in the pathogenesis of major cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the evaluation of endothelial function in humans may be of great clinical relevance. Usual methods for that purpose are either invasive and/or technically demanding. In the dermal microcirculation, endothelial function may be assessed noninvasively from the laser Doppler measurement of increases in blood flow after either the transdermal application of acetylcholine by iontophoresis, or the release of transient arterial occlusion (reactive hyperemia). An endothelium-independent response may be provided by the iontophoresis of sodium nitroprusside. This approach is notable for technical simplicity, but of uncertain reproducibility. Sixteen young, healthy, nonsmoking males were examined in the fasting state. Changes in skin blood flow were measured with a laser Doppler imager during the iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside, as well as during reactive hyperemia, on two different days, at each of two different sites on the volar face of the forearm. Nonspecific effects related to the stimulation of terminal nerve fibers by the iontophoretic current were suppressed by prior <b>surface</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> The iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside induced a seven- to eightfold increase in dermal blood flow. The corresponding figure for peak reactive hyperemia was approximately fourfold. The mean coefficients of variation of responses recorded on different days, on the same site, in the same individual were &lt; 10 % for iontophoresis of acetylcholine and for peak reactive hyperemia, and between 10 and 20 % for iontophoresis of sodium nitroprusside. This day-to-day variation was significantly smaller than the site-to-site variation (p &lt; 0. 01 for all three responses). Endothelium-dependent and -independent responses of dermal blood flow evaluated with laser Doppler imaging are highly reproducible from day to day, at least in healthy nonsmoking young male subjects, and provided some simple precautions are observed, foremost among which is the strict standardization of the recording site. These observations may have implications for the testing of endothelial function in clinical studies...|$|E
