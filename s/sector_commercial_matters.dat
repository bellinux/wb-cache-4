40|$|Who are <b>commercial</b> <b>sector</b> customers, {{and how do}} {{they make}} {{decisions}} about energy consumption and energy efficiency investment? The energy policy field has not done a thorough job of describing energy consumption in the <b>commercial</b> <b>sector.</b> First, the discussion of the <b>commercial</b> <b>sector</b> itself is dominated by discussion of large businesses/buildings. Second, discussion of this portion of the <b>commercial</b> <b>sector</b> s consumption behavior is driven primarily by theory, with very little field data collected on the way <b>commercial</b> <b>sector</b> decision-makers describe their own options, choices, and reasons for taking action. These limitations artificially constrain energy policy options. This paper reviews the extant literature on <b>commercial</b> <b>sector</b> energy consumption behavior and identifies gaps in our knowledge. In particular, it argues that the primary energy policy model of <b>commercial</b> <b>sector</b> energy consumption is a top-down model that uses macro-level investment data to make conclusions about commercial behavior. Missing from the discussion is a model of consumption behavior that builds up to a theoretical framework informed by the micro-level data provided by commercial decision-makers themselves. Such a bottom-up model could enhance the effectiveness of <b>commercial</b> <b>sector</b> energy policy. In particular, translation of some behavioral models from the residential <b>sector</b> to the <b>commercial</b> <b>sector</b> may offer new opportunities for policies to change commercial energy consumption behavior. Utility bill consumption feedback is considered as one example of a policy option that may be applicable to both the residential and small <b>commercial</b> <b>sector...</b>|$|R
