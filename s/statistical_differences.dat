Some Polish scholars claim that they developed from a Vlach/Romanian migration in the 14th and 15th centuries. There is also a view that they are refugees from Rus {{who moved to the}} Western side of the Carpathian Mountains in the 14th century to escape the Mongol invasion.

40|$|Background. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the function of the foot undergoing the procedure of percutaneous Achilles tenotomy (PAT) in case of clubfoot management in terms of gait analysis. Methods. Nineteen patients with unilateral clubfeet were retrospectively reviewed from our database from July 2012 to June 2016. The result in all the cases was rated as excellent according to the scale of International Clubfoot Study Group (ICSG). The affected sides were taken as Group CF and the contralateral sides as Group CL. Three-dimensional gait analysis was applied for the functional evaluation of the involved foot. Results. <b>Statistical</b> <b>difference</b> was found in physical parameters of passive ankle dorsiflexion and plantar-flexion. No <b>statistical</b> <b>difference</b> was found in temporal-spatial parameters. There was <b>statistical</b> <b>difference</b> in kinematic parameters of total ankle rotation, ankle range of motion, and internal foot progression angle and in kinetic parameters of peak ankle power. No <b>statistical</b> <b>difference</b> was found in other kinematic and kinetic parameters. Conclusions. It is demonstrated that the procedure of PAT is safe and efficient for correcting the equinus deformity in case of clubfoot management and preserving the main function of Achilles tendon at the minimum of four-year follow-up...|$|R
