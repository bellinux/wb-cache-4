25|$|A {{tradition}} emerged of marking important graves, particularly ecclesiastical ones. <b>Such</b> <b>markers</b> included slabs that laid flat {{over the}} grave, and large crosses that stood upright, {{a number of}} which still survive in place. Surviving marker stones have shown {{that a number of}} regional styles existed. In Eastern England, a Scandinavian artistic influence is apparent on many of them.|$|E
25|$|Markers of {{occupational}} stress, which include morphological {{changes to the}} skeleton and dentition as well as joint changes at specific locations have also been widely used to infer specific (rather than general) activities. <b>Such</b> <b>markers</b> are often based on single cases described in clinical literature {{in the late nineteenth}} century. One such marker {{has been found to be}} a reliable indicator of lifestyle: the external auditory exostosis also called surfer's ear, which is a small bony protuberance in the ear canal which occurs in those working in proximity to cold water.|$|E
500|$|Wolves {{defend their}} territories from other packs through a {{combination}} of scent marking, direct attacks and howling (see Communication). Scent marking is used for territorial advertisement, and involves urination, defecation and ground scratching. Scent marks are generally left every [...] throughout the territory on regular travelways and junctions. <b>Such</b> <b>markers</b> can last for 2–3 weeks, and are typically placed near rocks, boulders, trees, or the skeletons of large animals. Territorial fights are among the principal causes of wolf mortality, with one study concluding that 14–65% of wolf deaths in Minnesota and the Denali National Park and Preserve were due to predation by other wolves.|$|E

500|$|In Britain, these tombs were {{typically}} located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the surrounding landscape, perhaps {{at the junction}} between different territories. Archaeologist Caroline Malone noted that the tombs would have served {{as one of a}} variety of markers in the landscape that conveyed information on [...] "territory, political allegiance, ownership, and ancestors." [...] Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb-shrines served as territorial markers between different tribal groups, although others have argued that <b>such</b> <b>markers</b> would be of little use to a nomadic herding society.

Many archaeologists have suggested that the construction of such monuments reflects an attempt to stamp control and ownership over the land, thus representing a change in mindset brought about by Neolithicisation. Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.|$|E

2500|$|Marker {{assisted}} selection or marker aided selection (MAS) is {{an indirect}} selection process where a trait {{of interest is}} selected based on a marker (morphological, biochemical or DNA/RNA variation) linked to a trait of interest (e.g. productivity, disease resistance, stress tolerance, and quality), {{rather than on the}} trait itself.

40|$|A pathway for marking of polymer chains with radical spin traps during {{pulsed laser}} {{polymerization}} in free radical polymerization is presented. By introducing a so-called marker that forms a non-propagating radical at (or shortly after) {{the incidence of}} a laser pulse, a polymer subdistribution is generated by specifically terminating propagating radicals via combination with <b>such</b> a <b>marker</b> radical. The generated polymer subdistribution can subsequently be imaged by modern softionization mass spectrometry.

30|$|Today, {{application}} and release of genetic engineered bacteria {{directly in the}} environment is not accepted by the public, and governmental regulations are contradictory for use of such microorganisms in enhancing crop yield.

2500|$|The name Israel first {{appears in}} the stele of the Egyptian pharaoh Merneptah c. 1209 BC, [...] "Israel is laid waste and his seed is not." [...] This [...] "Israel" [...] was a {{cultural}} and probably political entity of the central highlands, well enough established to be perceived by the Egyptians as a possible challenge to their hegemony, but an ethnic group rather than an organized state. Ancestors of the Israelites may have included Semites who occupied Canaan and the Sea Peoples. According to modern archaeologists, sometime during Iron Age I a population began to identify itself as 'Israelite', differentiating itself from the Canaanites through <b>such</b> <b>markers</b> as the prohibition of intermarriage, an emphasis on family history and genealogy, and religion.|$|E
2500|$|Paintball marker: {{also known}} as a [...] "paintball gun", this is the primary piece of equipment, used to mark the {{opposing}} player with paintballs. The paintball gun must have a loader or [...] "hopper" [...] or magazines attached to feed paint into the marker, and will be either spring-fed, gravity-fed (where balls drop into the loading chamber), or electronically force-fed. Modern markers require a compressed-air tank or CO2 tank. In contrast, very early bolt-action paintball markers used disposable silver capsules (12-gram CO2 cartridges) normally seen in pellet guns. In the mid to late 1980s, marker mechanics improved to include constant air pressure and semi-automatic operation. Further improvements included increased rates of fire; carbon dioxide (CO2) tanks from 3.5 [...] to 40 ounces, and compressed-air or nitrogen tanks in a variety of sizes and pressure capacities up to 5000 PSI. The use of unstable CO2 causes damage to the low-pressure pneumatic components inside electronic markers, therefore the more stable compressed air is preferred by owners of <b>such</b> <b>markers.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In some languages, evidential markers {{also serve}} other purposes, such as {{indicating}} the speaker's attitude to, or belief in, the statement. Usually a direct evidential marker {{may serve to}} indicate that the speaker is certain about the event stated. Using an indirect evidential <b>marker,</b> <b>such</b> as one for hearsay or reported information, may indicate that the speaker is uncertain about the statement, or doesn't want to take responsibility for its truth. A [...] "hearsay" [...] evidential may then have the undertone of [...] "that's what they say; whether or not it's true is nothing I can take responsibility for". [...] In other languages, this is not the case. Therefore one should distinguish between <b>such</b> evidential <b>markers</b> that only mark source of knowledge, and <b>such</b> evidential <b>markers</b> that serve other functions, such as marking epistemic modality.|$|R

50|$|Normal aging, {{although}} {{not responsible for}} causing memory disorders, {{is associated with a}} decline in cognitive and neural systems including memory (long-term and working memory). Many factors such as genetics and neural degeneration have a part in causing memory disorders. In order to diagnose Alzheimer's disease and dementia early, researchers are trying to find biological markers that can predict these diseases in younger adults. One <b>such</b> <b>marker</b> is a beta-amyloid deposit which is a protein that deposits on the brain as we age. Although 20-33% of healthy elderly adults have these deposits, they are increased in elderly with diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and dementia.|$|R
