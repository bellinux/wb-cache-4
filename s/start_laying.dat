25|$|When {{conditions}} are favorable for swarming, the queen will <b>start</b> <b>laying</b> eggs in queen cups. A virgin queen will develop from a fertilized egg. The young queen larva develops differently {{because it is}} more heavily fed royal jelly, a protein-rich secretion from glands on the heads of young workers. If not for being heavily fed royal jelly, the queen larva would have developed into a regular worker bee. All bee larvae are fed some royal jelly for the first few days after hatching but only queen larvae are fed on it exclusively. As a result of the difference in diet, the queen will develop into a sexually mature female, unlike the worker bees.|$|E

2500|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in {{clusters}} of 3–150 on leaves or fruit. A single female might lay hundreds of eggs. [...] Adults {{produced by the}} overwintering larval generation emerge during October and November. These give rise to the first summer generation, in which final instar larvae mature between January and mid February. Second generation larvae reach maturity during March and April, and the adults from this generation provide third generation eggs. Normally, the rate of larval development is slowed considerably during the winter, particularly when temperatures approach freezing; thus the majority of larvae over-winter in the prolonged early juvenile phases of the second third, and fourth instars. During this period they normally feed on herbaceous plants. Re-invasion of apple trees takes place during October–December, when moths of the third generation <b>start</b> <b>laying</b> eggs again on apple leaves.|$|E
