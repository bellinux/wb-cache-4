Buried PVC pipes in both water and sanitary sewer applications that are [...] in diameter and larger are typically joined by means of a gasket-sealed joint. [...] The most common type of gasket utilized in North America is a metal reinforced elastomer, commonly referred to as a Rieber <b>sealing</b> <b>system.</b> Its light weight, low cost, and low maintenance make it attractive. [...] However, it must be carefully installed and bedded to ensure longitudinal cracking and overbelling does not occur. [...] Additionally, PVC pipes can be fused together using various solvent cements, or heat-fused (butt-fusion process, similar to joining HDPE pipe), creating permanent joints that are virtually impervious to leakage.|$|E

2500|$|From Spring 2007 {{a series}} of changes {{were made to the}} Defender, most of which were {{implemented}} to meet emissions and safety legislation. The biggest change was to the drivetrain. The Td5 engine was replaced by an engine from Ford's DuraTorq line (AKA the Puma engine), built in their factory in Dagenham, making the Td5 the last Land Rover engine to be built in-house at Solihull. The engine chosen was from the ZSD family, being a version of the 2.4-litre four-cylinder unit also used in the highly successful Ford Transit. The engine's lubrication and <b>sealing</b> <b>system</b> was adapted for use in wet, dusty conditions and to maintain lubrication at extreme angles in off-road use. The power level remains the same at , but with a lower power peak speed for towing and better acceleration. Torque output rose from [...] to [...] due to the fitting of a variable-geometry turbocharger. This produces a wider spread of torque than the Td5, from 1500rpm to 2000rpm. The engine is mated to a new six-speed gearbox. First gear is lower than the previous gearbox for better low-speed control, whilst the higher sixth gear is intended to reduce noise and fuel consumption at high speeds.|$|E

40|$|LectureFor years, {{labyrinth}} shaft-end seals {{have been}} used for centrifugal compressors handling air and nonhazardous gases, and for low suction pressure compressors in hydrocarbon service. To prevent gas leakage from the hydrocarbon machines, either injection of inert gas or jet ejector systems have been applied with the seals. The ejectors were normally arranged to exhaust back to the compressor suction. Early application of labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> were generally on compressors with suction pressures in the 0 - 8 psig range, and the <b>seal</b> <b>system</b> operation was generally satisfactory. Many of the older machines have been uprated to higher suction pressures. The labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> have been applied to newer compressors with suction pressures as high as 15 psig. Many of the systems do not perform satisfactorily, and operators complain of leakage of hydrocarbons and contamination of the lube oil. This {{may be the result of}} noncritical-flow ejectors operating with critical pressure ratios. Labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> can be designed to perform satisfactorily with the higher compressor suction pressures, but these systems often require critical-flow ejectors. Despite their relatively low initial cost, the economics of labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> for high compressor suction pressures may not compare favorably with oil-type <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> because of the energy required to recycle motive gas...|$|R
