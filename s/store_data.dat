5|$|Lionhead Studios used Michael Bratman's belief–desire–intention {{model to}} {{simulate}} creatures' learning {{and decision making}} processes. A creature forms an intention by combining desires, opinions, and beliefs. Beliefs are attributed to lists that <b>store</b> <b>data</b> about various world objects. Desires are goals the creature wants to fulfill, expressed as simplified perceptrons. Opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision trees. For each desire, the creature selects the belief with the best opinion, thus forming an intention or goal.|$|E
5|$|The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database uses a {{flat file}} {{plaintext}} format to represent and <b>store</b> <b>data</b> which is typically {{referred to as}} EMBL-Bank format. EMBL-Bank format uses a different syntax to the records in DDBJ and GenBank, though each format uses certain standardised nomenclature, such as taxonomies {{as defined by the}} NCBI Taxon database. Each line of an EMBL-format file beings with a two-letter code, such as AC to label the accession number and KW for a list of keywords relevant to the record; each record ends with //.|$|E
5|$|Bioinformatics {{involves}} {{the development of}} techniques to <b>store,</b> <b>data</b> mine, search and manipulate biological data, including DNA nucleic acid sequence data. These have led to widely applied advances in computer science, especially string searching algorithms, machine learning, and database theory. String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides. The DNA sequence may be aligned with other DNA sequences to identify homologous sequences and locate the specific mutations that make them distinct. These techniques, especially multiple sequence alignment, are used in studying phylogenetic relationships and protein function. Data sets representing entire genomes' worth of DNA sequences, such as those produced by the Human Genome Project, are difficult to use without the annotations that identify the locations of genes and regulatory elements on each chromosome. Regions of DNA sequence that have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be identified by gene finding algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular gene products and their possible functions in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally. Entire genomes may also be compared, which can {{shed light on the}} evolutionary history of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary events.|$|E

30|$|Semiconductor {{memory is}} an {{indispensable}} component and backbone of all modern electronic devices. All recognizable computing platforms ranging from hand-held devices to large super-computer storage systems {{are used for}} <b>storing</b> <b>data,</b> either temporarily or permanently, as per their requirement [1]. Based on <b>storing</b> <b>data</b> volatility, memories are basically classified into two categories, (i) volatile memory and (ii) nonvolatile memory. In a volatile memory, the <b>stored</b> <b>data</b> is lost immediately after the power is turned off whereas nonvolatile memory (NVM) is capable to retain the <b>stored</b> <b>data</b> {{for a long time}} even after the power is off. Demands on NVMs are increasing extensively, due to the huge popularity of consumer electronics and portable gadgets, such as smart phone, memory card, and USB storage devices, where NVM is one of the basic component [2 – 5].|$|R
30|$|Several {{researches}} {{have addressed}} the issue of ensuring confidentiality and privacy of cloud data without compromising the user functionality. Here, confidentiality refers to the secrecy of the <b>stored</b> <b>data</b> so that only the client can read the contents of the <b>stored</b> <b>data.</b> To solve the problem of confidentiality, data encryption schemes can come in handy to provide the users with some control over the secrecy of their <b>stored</b> <b>data.</b> This has been adopted by many recent researches which allow users to encrypt their data before outsourcing to the cloud [4 – 9]. However, standard encryption schemes will dampen users’ searching ability over the <b>stored</b> <b>data,</b> since after encryption a user simply cannot use a plaintext keyword to perform a search anymore and therefore cannot retrieve the contents in an efficient way.|$|R
