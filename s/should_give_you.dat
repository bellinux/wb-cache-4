500|$|Doggett has {{had five}} {{abortion}}s. After having her fifth abortion, {{which takes place}} at an abortion clinic in Fishersville, Virginia, the nurse remarks [...] "we <b>should</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a punch card, get the sixth one free." [...] Doggett is so offended by this joke that she shoots the nurse with a shotgun. She agrees to have a Christian lawyer as it was {{likely to lead to}} a lighter sentence and her legal bills being paid for. Since she shot an abortion nurse, she became a 'hero' of the pro-life movement. Doggett regularly receives cards praising her for her claims of defending the unborn as well as generous cash donations to her commissary account by fans & supporters. Although her Christian faith was initially fake, at some point Doggett did become a Christian; this was confirmed by Manning in an interview. Manning describes Doggett's faith as [...] "a hybrid of Christianity, Baptism, Presbyterian".|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mirror {{described}} {{the program as}} [...] "far too funny". A review in The Daily Mirror was positive, commenting, [...] "If {{you want to see}} a brilliant spoof about Tom Cruise's faith in Scientology and his relationship with Katie Holmes, look no further than C4's Star Stories." [...] She commented, [...] "It's so absurd, even Tom will laugh." [...] The Advertiser described Star Stories as [...] "a surprisingly funny sendup of movie stars and pop groups", and noted of the episode's title, [...] "This week's episode is titled Being Tom Cruise [...] - How Scientology isn't in Any Way Mental, which <b>should</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> some idea of the vein of humour mined." [...] The Sunday Times observed, [...] "Just when you thought you might go a week without seeing a mention of brand Beckham, here is a documentary on their best friends, brand Tom Cruise, as recorded by the least reverential writers and least convincing lookalikes on the planet. Scientologists might prefer something on the Sci-fi channel." [...] Victoria Segal, Sally Kinnes and Sarah Dempster of The Sunday Times highlighted the episode in their [...] "Critics' Choice" [...] column. They commented that the show's producers [...] " [...] their own account of his career, his love life and his religion: It's all about aliens. Comedy so broad it barely fits on the screen, it is hard not to be amused". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun highlighted the program as his [...] "Top Choice". Adams commented, [...] "This ruthless but spot-on parody re-enacts Cruise's life and career through Hollywood gossip, rumour and exaggeration (his father is a midget, Katie Holmes a robot, Nicole Kidman a beer-swilling bogan), but is an antidote to every interview he's ever done." [...] Writing for The Newcastle Herald, Anita Beaumont commented, [...] "This is really silly stuff, but it is amusing enough to enliven a fairly dull night of TV." [...] The Sunday Mirror wrote that the program [...] "was as subtle as a sledge hammer". Simon Hoggart of The Spectator called the program [...] "a magnificently over-the-top anti-celebrity festival".|$|E
