5|$|In 2016, {{an article}} written by Diana C. Mutz compares the {{politics}} of Harry Potter to the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign. She states that 3 themes throughout the books are widely predominant '1) the value of tolerance and respect for difference; 2) opposition to violence and punitiveness; and 3) the dangers of authoritarianism.' <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> these themes are also present {{in the presidential election}} and it may {{play a significant role in}} how Americans have responded to the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) confides in Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{that she}} is {{intending}} to stay in Tallahassee. Ryan interprets this as an invitation {{to hook up with}} her, so he attempts to seduce her by taking her to the empty kitchen to help her make a waffle. They hide under a table when the chefs return. After Ryan compliments Erin, <b>she</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> they could become roommates in Florida and possibly start dating in six months if things go well between them. Not wanting that long timeline, he resorts to saying he loves Kelly.|$|E
5|$|Alison Young {{argues that}} Jackson entrenched section 2(1) of the Parliament Act 1911 by {{requiring}} {{that it only}} be overturned by adopting a specific manner and form (approval of the bill changing the 1911 Act by the House of Lords). <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Lord Steyn and Baroness Hale would explain this result using a self-embracing view of sovereignty – that Parliament {{as a whole is}} sovereign and can therefore to bind later parliaments. The passing of the 1911 Act was from this perspective a redefinition of Parliament that binds the courts. However, she notes that Lord Hope, Lord Nicholls and Lord Carswell provide an alternative explanation for the decision: that the 1911 Act modified the rule of recognition defining valid legal documents. Under this view, the 1911 Parliament did not bind future Parliaments simply by passing the Parliament Act 1911, but by the legislation being recognised, in political fact, as valid; the courts were therefore altering the legal rule of recognition accordingly. This perspective allows the orthodox continuing view of parliamentary sovereignty (that every new parliament is sovereign) to be held while still explaining why future parliaments cannot modify section 2(1) of the 1911 Act.|$|E

5|$|Sharmishtha Gooptu {{discusses}} {{the idea that}} the idyllic village life portrayed in Pather Panchali represents authentic Bengali village life, which disappeared during the upheavals of Partition in 1947. <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the film seeks to connect an idealised, pre-partition past with the actual present of partitioned Bengal, and that it uses prototypes of rural Bengal to construct an image of the ideal village. In contrast to this idealism, Mitali Pati and Suranjan Ganguly point out how Ray used eye-level shots, natural lighting, long takes and other techniques to achieve realism. Mainak Biswas has written that Pather Panchali comes very close to the concept of Italian neorealism, as it has several passages with no dramatic development, even though the usual realities of life, such as the changing of seasons or the passing of a day, are concretely filmed.|$|E
5|$|At Chuck's hotel, Chuck saves Blair while Raina stops her father. With {{the police}} arriving, Chuck offers Blair a limo ride, and a homesick Raina breaks up with Nate, {{intending}} {{to return to}} Chicago. Chuck proposes avoiding the Constance party by going to a bar mitzvah {{in a similar fashion}} to Death Takes a Holiday, which Blair accepts. Chuck and Blair have sex while Prince Louis (Hugo Becker) waits for Blair at Constance. While looking for Charlie at the loft, Vanessa spots Dan's novel and reads it. Dan calls her and is upset that she has been reading the novel, which <b>she</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> he publish despite the possible backlash. Realizing that he no longer cares about writing, Vanessa steals the novel after Dan angrily dismisses her. Serena stops Charlie from jumping off a window and Charlie expresses her envy towards Serena, aspiring to be like her until Serena admits her personal flaws to Charlie, who comforts her. Dan and Nate find Charlie and Serena and return to the party. Charlie makes a suspicious call to her mother and piques Georgina's interest, who gives her her number. Blair finds herself in a dilemma as her feelings for Chuck have resurfaced, arriving at the party to inform Louis of her decision but Chuck interrupts her, informing him that he has their blessing. Blair confronts Chuck for making a decision for her, but the two eventually settle their issues, and he lets her go.|$|E
5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> while he had thought that he was traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion.|$|E

25|$|Robin Queen {{argues that}} {{analyses}} {{have been too}} simplistic. <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> a uniquely lesbian language is constructed through the combination of sometimes-conflicting stylistic tropes: stereotypical women's language (e.g. hypercorrect grammar), stereotypical nonstandard forms associated with the (male) working class (e.g. contractions), stereotypical gay male lexical items, and stereotypical lesbian language (e.g. flat intonation, cursing).|$|E
25|$|Rebus {{interviews}} Eddie Ringan, the Elvis enthusiast {{who owns}} the restaurant, and Pat Calder, Eddie's gay (and business) partner, but they prove to be of little help. Brian's girlfriend, Nell Stapleton, tells Rebus that Brian had a 'Black Book', a small notebook in which he kept interesting snippets of information. <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Brian was attacked because of something in it. She also feels guilty, since she had argued with Brian just {{before he went to}} the restaurant.|$|E
25|$|She criticizes H.G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, John Galsworthy {{of writing}} about {{unimportant}} things and called them materialists. <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be}} better for literature to turn their backs on them so it can move forward, for better or worse. While Woolf criticizes the aforementioned three authors, she praises several other authors for their innovation. This group of writers she names spiritualists, and includes James Joyce who Woolf says writes what interests and moves him.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the study}} of {{communication}}, Stanback and Pearce as well as Kramarae used muted group theory to help explain communication patterns and social representation of non-dominant cultural groups Kramarae (1981) believed that [...] "those experiences unique to subordinate group members often cannot be effectively expressed within the confinements of the dominant communication system". <b>She</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> people within these groups create alternative forms of communication to articulate their experiences. Although, Kramarae used muted group theory to communications strategies of women <b>she</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the framework can be applied with equal validity {{to a number of}} dominant/non-dominant relationships (Orbe, 1996).|$|R

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{community}} or collective authorship that Fitzpatrick explores {{is related to}} remix culture. She proposes a possible model of scholarly writing that collects and compiles work in illuminating ways. To be viable, this would require institutional acknowledgement {{that this kind of}} work is as valuable as the traditional scholarly monograph, and also the participation of the scholarly community in a gift economy with their work. <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> scholars use a Creative Commons license for scholarly work to facilitate the use and reuse of material for the collective benefit of the community.|$|E
25|$|She has {{published}} more than 30 books, ranging in topics from black men, patriarchy, and masculinity to self-help, engaged pedagogy to personal memoirs, and sexuality (in regards to feminism and politics of aesthetic/visual culture). A prevalent theme in her most recent writing is the community and communion, the ability of loving communities to overcome race, class, and gender inequalities. In three conventional books and four children's books, <b>she</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> communication and literacy (the ability to read, write, and think critically) are crucial to developing healthy communities and relationships that are not marred by race, class, or gender inequalities.|$|E
25|$|An Auror is an {{employee}} of the Ministry whose mission is to pursue and apprehend Dark wizards. According to Minerva McGonagall, the Auror Office takes in new recruits with a minimum of 5 N.E.W.T.s (with marks no lower than “Exceeds Expectations”). <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Potions, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Charms, and Herbology N.E.W.T.s are the most appropriate for someone who aspires to be admitted to the training program. (A potential recruit will also have to pass “...a series of character and aptitude tests.”) Nymphadora Tonks mentions that two of the program’s courses of study are “Concealment and Disguise” and “Stealth and Tracking”, and that the training is hard to pass with high marks (a requirement).|$|E

25|$|The {{story begins}} {{when the family}} is about to leave Plum Creek, shortly after the family has {{recovered}} from the scarlet fever which caused Mary to become blind. The family welcomes a visit from Aunt Docia, whom they had not seen for several years. <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Pa and Ma move west to the rapidly developing Dakota Territory, where Pa could work in Uncle Henry’s railroad camp at very good wages for that era. Ma and Pa agree, since it will allow Pa {{to look for a}} homestead while he works. The family has endured many hardships on Plum Creek and Pa especially is anxious for a new start. After selling his land and farm to neighbors, Pa goes ahead with the wagon and team. Mary is still too weak to travel so {{the rest of the family}} follows later by train.|$|E
25|$|Mary Lefkowitz has criticised this {{research}}. <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> some of {{the research}} was done not to determine the reliability of the dating method, as was suggested, but to back up an assumption of age and to make certain points about pyramids and Greek civilization. She notes that not only are the results not very precise, but that other structures mentioned in the research are not in fact pyramids, e.g. a tomb alleged to be the tomb of Amphion and Zethus near Thebes, a structure at Stylidha (Thessaly) which is just a long wall, etc. She also notes the possibility that the stones that were dated might have been recycled from earlier constructions. She also notes that earlier research from the 1930s, confirmed in the 1980s by Fracchia was ignored. She argues that they undertook their research using a novel and previously untested methodology in order to confirm a predetermined theory about the age of these structures.|$|E
500|$|Zalampas {{notes that}} Kubizek claims that Hitler was {{interested}} in Rabatsch's singing voice, which Kubizek claimed was a soprano, and its suitability for singing Wagnerian roles. <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Hitler had a fantasy view of Stefanie which {{is indicative of the}} young Hitler's mixing of reality and fantasy and his views about art, war, the novels of Karl May, and Wagnerian themes.|$|E

500|$|Roach's batting {{was marked}} by inconsistency. In summing up his career, the {{historian}} Bridgette Lawrence wrote that his [...] "style {{took him to the}} heights and depths of batting". <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> he provided a bridge in West Indian batting between George Challenor, the first notably successful batsman to represent the West Indies, and George Headley, the leading West Indian batsman before the Second World War.
