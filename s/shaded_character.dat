5000|$|In Variety, David Rooney observed, [...] "Material {{that might}} have turned to {{standard}} dysfunctional family treacle in other hands is given stirring poignancy, warmth and emotional insight in Shona Auerbach's assured first feature ... has a firm command of the visual medium and an equally strong rapport with actors ... Auerbach and screenwriter Andrea Gibb spin a touching story that never descends into schmaltz despite ample potential. The film is anchored in part by its setting {{in the kind of}} milieu more common to classic British kitchen-sink dramas or the films of Ken Loach than to anything this emotionally tender. Enriched by subtle notes of humor, the intimate story is powered by well-drawn relationships and finely <b>shaded</b> <b>characters.</b> Not only the family bonds but also those of friendship and tentative romance are traced with delicate economy and nuance." ...|$|R

500|$|The PlayStation had a 512 × 240 {{video mode}} which used up video memory that would {{normally}} be used for textures, but was effective in rendering shaded but untextured polygons at a sharper detail. Rubin pointed out that since the polygons on the characters were just a few pixels in size, <b>shaded</b> <b>characters</b> would look better than textured ones. Thus, polygons were emphasized over textures; this was advantageous in that it allowed the programmers more polygons {{to work with and}} allowed them to work around the PlayStation's lack of texture correction or polygon clipping. To give the game more of a resemblance to an animated cartoon, vertex animation was implemented rather than the standard skeletal animation with [...] "one-joint" [...] weighting; this allowed the programmers to use the more sophisticated three-to-four-joint weighting available in PowerAnimator. Because the PlayStation was unable to match this at runtime, the location of every vertex was stored in every frame at 30 frames a second. Gavin, Baggett, and Cerny attempted to invent assembly language vertex compressors for this manner of animation; Cerny's version was the most successful and the most complicated.|$|R
