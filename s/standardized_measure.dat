40|$|Despite {{the influx}} of {{measures}} which can be customized {{to the demands of}} each business unit (e. g., customer satisfaction surveys and quality indices), many firms have been dogged in their reliance on <b>standardized</b> <b>measures</b> (e. g., conventional financial metrics) in performance evaluation. In this paper, we consider one justification: though customized measures may more accurately target the goals of a particular unit, <b>standardized</b> <b>measures</b> may offer more meaningful opportunities for relative performance evaluation. <b>Standardized</b> <b>measures</b> have a commonality in errors which is naturally absent among measures targeted to each circumstance. This commonality allows learning about one measure from another and, thus, the construction of more efficient proxies for unobservable employee inputs. The use of comparative evaluation schemes is not without its challenges, since it may induce unwanted coordination by those being evaluated.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Accurate assessment is critical for appropriate identification and diagnosis of mental health problems and for appropriate treatment referral and planning, but little is known about how frequently clinicians use valid assessment procedures in their work with children. A survey was conducted with a random sample of 5000 clinician members of the five largest mental health professional guild associations examining frequency of standardized and unstandardized assessment use, and the association between organization and clinician factors and use of <b>standardized</b> <b>measures</b> for assessment. Seven hundred and forty-six clinicians that work in organizations and conduct assessment with children were included in analysis. Unstandardized measures were used significantly more often than <b>standardized</b> <b>measures.</b> Significant positive associations were found between use of <b>standardized</b> <b>measures</b> and rigid hierarchical organizational structure, organizational culture that values empirical treatment, greater personal training in <b>standardized</b> <b>measures,</b> and more positive personal attitudes toward <b>standardized</b> <b>measures.</b> Implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

The CRISES framework provides a foundation for development of <b>standardized</b> <b>measures</b> for the crisis field.

50|$|There is a dialectical {{aspect to}} {{transformative}} assessment with <b>standardized</b> <b>measures</b> that implicitly claim that learning can be decontextualized and that comparisons of scores across contexts hold meaning. Transformative assessment by its title implies {{that there is}} no single absolute standard that can be assessed, and that each context requires its own definition of a successful learning performance. Further, the process of assessment will do much to shape the performance that defines the outcome. Central to transformative assessment, therefore, are the stakeholders (faculty AND students) who engage in the assessment process. Because <b>standardized</b> <b>measures</b> rarely involve faculty who teach or the hearts of the students who learn, they are not transformative.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the scale}} offers a <b>standardized</b> <b>measure</b> for {{psychological}} and biological function, {{the process of}} arriving at this assumption has been criticised.

5000|$|Psychological testing {{refers to}} the {{administration}} of psychological tests. A psychological test is [...] "an objective and <b>standardized</b> <b>measure</b> of a sample of behavior". The term sample of behavior refers to an individual's performance on tasks that have usually been prescribed beforehand. The samples of behavior {{that make up a}} paper-and-pencil test, {{the most common type of}} test, are a series of items. Performance on these items produce a test score. A score on a well-constructed test is believed to reflect a psychological construct such as achievement in a school subject, cognitive ability, aptitude, emotional functioning, personality, etc. Differences in test scores are thought to reflect individual differences in the construct the test is supposed to measure. The technical term for the science behind psychological testing is psychometrics.|$|E

The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) has identified three areas for evaluating teacher education graduates:. competency, entry, and effectiveness. Data for evaluation of teacher education graduates could be obtained from four categories: (1) career line data; (2) direct classroom observation; (3) pupil, peer, and supervisory evaluations; and (4) <b>standardized</b> <b>measures.</b> Each of these categories relates to an NCATE evaluation standard.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} Tajima's test is to {{identify}} sequences which do not fit the neutral theory model at equilibrium between mutation and genetic drift. In order to perform the test on a DNA sequence or gene, you need to sequence homologous DNA for at least 3 individuals. Tajima's statistic computes a <b>standardized</b> <b>measure</b> {{of the total number}} of segregating sites (these are DNA sites that are polymorphic) in the sampled DNA and the average number of mutations between pairs in the sample. The two quantities whose values are compared are both method of moments estimates of the population genetic parameter theta, and so are expected to equal the same value. If these two numbers only differ by as much as one could reasonably expect by chance, then the null hypothesis of neutrality cannot be rejected. Otherwise, the null hypothesis of neutrality is rejected.|$|E
50|$|The International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS) is a {{large scale}} {{international}} survey project about crime and victimization. The project {{was set up to}} fill the gap in adequate recording of offenses by the police for purposes of comparing crime rates in different nations and to provide a crime index independent of police statistics as an alternative <b>standardized</b> <b>measure.</b> The ICVS is the most far-reaching program of standardized sample surveys to look at a householders' experience with crime, policing, crime prevention, and feelings of insecurity in a large number of nations. It also allows for analysis of how risks of crime vary among different groups of populations across social and demographic lines. There have been 6 rounds of surveys to date (1989-1992-1996-2000-2004/05-2010). Surveys have been done on 80 countries and provides information about criminal victimization in 41 countries and 66 main(capital) cities from all continents.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnitude}} {{of the effect of}} interest in the population can be quantified in terms of an effect size, where there is greater power to detect larger effects. An effect size can be a direct estimate of the quantity of interest, or it can be a <b>standardized</b> <b>measure</b> that also accounts for the variability in the population. For example, in an analysis comparing outcomes in a treated and control population, the difference of outcome means Y &minus; X would be a direct measure of the effect size, whereas (Y &minus; X)/σ where σ is the common standard deviation of the outcomes in the treated and control groups, would be a standardized effect size. If constructed appropriately, a standardized effect size, along with the sample size, will completely determine the power. An unstandardized (direct) effect size will rarely be sufficient to determine the power, as it does not contain information about the variability in the measurements.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} {{relationships}} of family selected goals and scores on <b>standardized</b> <b>measures</b> using the ICF-CY as a classification system. Methods: Goal attainment scaling (GAS) -goals (n = 110) of 22 children, 11 girls, 1 - 6 years, bilateral or unilateral cerebral palsy, GMFCS I-IV and MACS I-IV were linked to the ICF-CY. The children had participated in goal-directed therapy during 12 weeks. GAS-goals, baseline assessments and change scores from PEDI and GMFM- 66 were used to explore the relationships. Results: All GAS-goals were classified in the Activity and Participation domain within ICF-CY. The number of GAS-goals correlated to baseline scores in PEDI and GMFM- 66. The change scores in PEDI and GMFM- 66 correlated to goal attainment in the Mobility and the Self-Care chapter. Conclusions: The family goals were reflected in <b>standardized</b> <b>measures.</b> The combined use of <b>standardized</b> and individual <b>measures</b> offers a possibility to explore the focus in therapy and the impact in children with cerebral palsy...|$|R
