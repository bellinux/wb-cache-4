40|$|Summary: Sickness insurance, its {{development}} and concept The diploma paper {{is focused on}} addressing the area of legal regulations concerning sickness insurance, {{its development}} and concept. The reason to choose this topic is undoubtedly my personal interest in this issue. The paper is divided into six chapters. Chapter one addresses history of the welfare system and the sickness insurance {{from the very beginning}} of mankind up to the current applicable legislation. Chapter two is devoted to the sickness insurance system, describes its difficult legislative process and outlines the overall characteristics of individual <b>sick</b> <b>pays.</b> Chapter three describes the health assessment for insurance purposes. Chapter four addresses the organization and implementation of sickness insurance. Chapter five describes international and supranational organizations, as the basic orientation in legal documents of the international community is necessary for understanding and examination of the legislation. Chapter six focuses on several European countries in order to highlight the legal diversity in various states. In conclusion of my diploma paper, I compare the previous legislation to the current legislation and I evaluate the goals that I had set in the beginning work...|$|R

25|$|Various {{improvements}} {{were also}} made {{to health care}} provision and coverage during the social-liberal coalition’s time in office. In 1974, domestic aid during in-patient or in-patient cures was established, <b>sick</b> <b>pay</b> to compensate for wages lost while caring for a child was introduced, and the time-limit to in-patient care was removed. That same year, the cover of rehabilitation services was increased, together with the cover of dental and orthodontic services. Health insurance coverage was extended to self-employed agricultural workers in 1972, and to students and the disabled in 1975. in 1971, an International Transactions Tax Law was passed.|$|E

25|$|The Trades Disputes Act 1927 was repealed, and a Dock Labour Scheme was {{introduced}} in 1947 {{to put an end}} to the casual system of hiring labour in the docks.

In 1999, for instance, the wage replacement rate for <b>sick</b> <b>pay</b> (which was reduced from 100% to 80% of earnings under the previous Kohl Government) was restored to 100%. A programme on combating youth unemployment was introduced, together new measures designed to out a stop to those designating themselves as “self-employed” for tax purposes, and new regulations on 630-DM jobs, which were subject {{for the first time to}} national insurance contributions. Tax reforms brought relief to people on low-incomes and benefited families, while a second pillar was added to the pension system which relied on self-provision for retirement.|$|E

The employers contributed one third, and the workers contributed two thirds. The minimum payments for medical treatment and <b>sick</b> <b>pay</b> for up to 13 weeks were legally fixed. The individual local health bureaus were administered by a committee elected {{by the members of}} each bureau, and this move had the unintended effect of establishing a majority representation for the workers on account of their large financial contribution.

25|$|With the four-party Michelsen's Cabinet {{appointed}} in 1905, Parliament voted {{to establish a}} Norwegian consular service. This {{was rejected by the}} king and on 7 June Parliament unanimously approved the dissolution of the union. In the following dissolution referendum, only 184 people voted in favor of a union. The government offered the Norwegian crown to Denmark's Prince Carl, who after a plebiscite became Haakon VII. The following ten years, Parliament passed a series of social reforms, such as <b>sick</b> <b>pay,</b> factory inspection, a ten-hour working day and worker protection laws. Waterfalls for hydroelectricity became an important resource in this period and the government secured laws to hinder foreigners from controlling waterfalls, mines and forests. Large industrial companies established in these years were Elkem, Norsk Hydro and Sydvaranger. The Bergen Line was completed in 1909, the Norwegian Institute of Technology was established the following year and women's suffrage was introduced in 1913—as the second country in the world. From the 1880s to the 1920s, Norwegians carried out a series of polar expeditions. The most important explorers were Fridtjof Nansen, Roald Amundsen and Otto Sverdrup.

25|$|In {{terms of}} working conditions, {{a number of}} reforms were {{introduced}} aimed at strengthening the rights of workers {{both at home and}} in the workplace. The Sickness Act of 1970 provided equal treatment of workers and employees in the event of incapacity for work, while maternity leave was increased. Legislation was introduced in 1970 which ensured continued payment of wages for workers disabled by illness. In 1970 all employees unit for work (with the exception of women in receipt of maternity benefits and temporarily and inconsiderably employed persons) were provided with an unconditional legal claim against their employer to continued payment of their gross wage for a period of 6 weeks, as also in the case of spa treatment approved by an Insurance Fund, the Fund bearing the full cost thereof. Previously, payment of employer's supplement and <b>sick</b> <b>pay</b> were only made from the day on which the doctor certified unfitness for work. In 1972, an Act on Agency Work was passed which sought to prevent works agencies from providing job placement services and aimed to provide job minimum protection for employees in agency work. A law on the hiring out of manpower, passed in October 1972, contained provisions to stipulate prior authorization for the hiring out of manpower, to draw a distinction between the system governing workers hired out and the placing of workers, to regulate and improve the rights of hired out workers pertaining to working conditions and social insurance, and provide for more severe penalties and fines to be imposed on offenders.|$|E
