5|$|<b>Strategically</b> located, Damascus {{attracted}} merchants {{from all}} over the world. The city was known as the paradise of Syria.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Soviets were {{designing}} and constructing increasingly sophisticated anti-ballistic missile defense systems to protect <b>strategically</b> important facilities around Moscow, reducing {{the threat posed}} by American ICBMs. These developments compelled the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, to commission a study to look into ways of improving the survivability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Chandra Mahal has {{the most}} luxurious room in the palace, which houses gold plated deities and {{paintings}} inlaid with precious stones. In the royal bedroom, mirrors have been <b>strategically</b> placed so that the Maharaja could see from his bed, any intruder entering his room.|$|E
5|$|Fort Montgomery, {{a massive}} masonry {{fortification}} mounting 125 guns on Lake Champlain {{was named for}} the General. Its construction begun in 1844, {{it was designed to}} guard the <b>strategically</b> important frontier between Canada and the United States; only ruins remain today.|$|E
5|$|Greg {{proposes to}} Pam. She accepts, {{and her parents}} agree that they should now meet Greg's parents. After Debbie's wedding, Jack views VHS footage of Greg {{recorded}} by hidden cameras that he had placed <b>strategically</b> around their house.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the Strip {{west of the}} Toledo area is a prime {{location}} for agriculture, because of its well-drained, fertile loam soil. The area had for many years produced large amounts of corn and wheat per acre. Michigan and Ohio both wanted what seemed <b>strategically</b> and economically destined to become an important port and a prosperous region.|$|E
5|$|King and the SCLC {{put into}} {{practice}} many {{of the principles of}} the Christian Left and applied the tactics of nonviolent protest with great success by <b>strategically</b> choosing the method of protest and the places in which protests were carried out. There were often dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.|$|E
5|$|Once forces began {{assembling}} at Oswegatchie, Lorimier {{made arrangements}} with a sympathetic priest near The Cedars for the provisioning of {{supplies for the}} troops. With the assistance of some men of the 8th Foot, he <b>strategically</b> hid several shallow-draft boats, known as bateaux, near {{a point where the}} Saint Lawrence River could be crossed.|$|E
5|$|Operation Ladbroke was a glider {{assault by}} the 1st Airlanding Brigade near Syracuse, that began on 9July1943 {{as part of}} the {{invasion}} of Sicily. The brigade were equipped with 144 Waco and six Horsa gliders. Their objective was to land near the town of Syracuse, secure the Ponte Grande Bridge, and ultimately take control of the city itself with its <b>strategically</b> important docks.|$|E
5|$|Philanthropenos {{remained}} at Philadelphia until 1326, possibly also 1327, {{but it appears}} that he was then appointed as governor of the <b>strategically</b> important Byzantine island of Lesbos, since he was dismissed from the same post in 1328 by Andronikos III Palaiologos.|$|E
5|$|Sandown Castle was an {{artillery}} fort constructed by Henry VIII in Sandown, Kent, between 1539 and 1540. It formed {{part of the}} King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the <b>strategically</b> important Downs anchorage off the English coast.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the very}} early days of alpine {{mountaineering}} a number of high-altitude mountain refuges have been positioned <b>strategically</b> across the massif to give climbers easier access to the high summits by permitting an overnight stay. The majority are owned by national mountaineering clubs, and many are wardened during the summer months, although the smaller bivouac huts are unmanned and have very basic facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Army first {{established}} {{a presence in}} Ashford in 1797 when it built a garrison on Barrow Hill, and storerooms along what is now Magazine Road. The military presence was scaled back during the 19th century, though the town was still considered <b>strategically</b> important {{in the event of}} an invasion. The Territorial Army {{established a}} presence in Ashford in 1910.|$|E
5|$|The Fortress {{is placed}} {{at the top of}} the {{mountain}} Srđ, just above the city of Dubrovnik. It was built in 1806 by Marshal Marmont, called the Imperial, in honor of emperor Napoleon. The fortress was <b>strategically</b> important to defend the northern side of the city.|$|E
5|$|The LFR ground {{component}} {{consisted of}} a network of radio transmission stations which were <b>strategically</b> located around the country, often near larger airports, approximately 200 miles apart. Early LFR stations used crossed loop antennas, but later designs were all based on the Adcock vertical antenna array for improved performance, especially at night.|$|E
5|$|The summit {{marked a}} shift in Alliance {{priorities}} towards greater involvement in the Middle East, a <b>strategically</b> important region, whose security and stability was regarded as {{closely linked to the}} Euro-Atlantic security. The existing Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) cooperation was broadened, and two new major engagements were launched: the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI) and a training mission for Iraqi troops.|$|E
5|$|A castle {{may have}} been {{constructed}} on Castle Island by 1257, when the 16-year-old King Alexander III of Scotland was forcibly brought there by his regents. During the First War of Scottish Independence (1296–1328), the invading English army held the castle, then named Loch Leven Castle, which lies at a <b>strategically</b> important position between the towns of Edinburgh, Stirling and Perth. Parts of the present fortification, the curtain wall, may date from this time and were perhaps built by the occupying English. The castle was captured by the Scots {{before the end of}} the 13th century, possibly by the forces of William Wallace.|$|E
5|$|After Kilinochchi was captured, several {{foreign governments}} urged {{both parties to}} seek a {{political}} solution. The Colombo Stock Exchange recorded a rise and the rupee stabilized, while celebrators lit firecrackers on the streets soon after the capture was declared. Amidst the celebrations, a suicide bomb attack occurred in the evening {{in front of the}} air force headquarters in Colombo, killing 3 and wounding about 30 people. The SLA continued to advance into LTTE held territory, capturing some more <b>strategically</b> important locations, including Elephant Pass and the entire A9 Highway soon after the fall of Kilinochchi.|$|E
5|$|After the {{occupation}} of Corsica, Hood ordered Nelson to open diplomatic relations with the city-state of Genoa, a <b>strategically</b> important potential ally. Soon afterwards, Hood returned to England and was succeeded by Admiral William Hotham as commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. Nelson put into Leghorn, and while Agamemnon underwent repairs, met with other naval officers at the port and entertained a brief affair with a local woman, Adelaide Correglia. Hotham arrived {{with the rest of}} the fleet in December; Nelson and Agamemnon sailed on a number of cruises with them in late 1794 and early 1795.|$|E
5|$|Although Kilinochchi {{is not a}} <b>strategically</b> {{important}} {{location in}} terms of military operations, it bears a symbolic importance because of the LTTE using it as the de facto capital of Tamil Eelam, the separate state that the LTTE is fighting for. Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Colonel Karuna, a former commander of the LTTE, claimed that the town of Kilinochchi was important for the LTTE {{because it was the}} showcase of the organization According to government claims, all civil administrative affairs were handled by government authorities despite the LTTE being in control of the town.|$|E
5|$|An {{affluent}} 19th-century {{agricultural community}} {{of the same name}} established near the lakeside in the mid-19th century, but dwindled in status, becoming virtually abandoned {{in the aftermath of the}} American Civil War. It was <b>strategically</b> important during the early stages of the war, due to its proximity to fresh water and the Gulf of Mexico. After reaching its low point during the Great Depression, the lakeside community modestly rebounded in 1947 following the nearby discovery of oil. A fictional lake of the same name and with a similar history is featured in the 1998 novel Holes.|$|E
5|$|At Kruger's {{suggestion}} Joubert {{was elected}} Commandant-General of the restored republic, {{though he had}} little military experience and protested he was not suited to the position. The provisional government set up a temporary capital at Heidelberg, a <b>strategically</b> placed town {{on the main road}} from Natal, and sent a copy of the proclamation to Lanyon along with a written demand that he surrender the government offices in Pretoria. Lanyon refused and mobilised the British garrison.|$|E
5|$|At this time, and {{following}} the disastrous Battle of Acheloos in 917, the Byzantines were mostly occupied in the Balkans in a protracted conflict against Bulgaria. Hence, Kourkouas's first task as Domestic of the East was {{the suppression of the}} revolt of Bardas Boilas, the governor (strategos) of Chaldia, a <b>strategically</b> important area on the Empire's northeastern Anatolian frontier. This was quickly achieved and his brother, Theophilos Kourkouas, replaced Boilas as governor of Chaldia. As commander of this northernmost sector of the eastern frontier, Theophilos proved a competent soldier and gave valuable assistance to his brother's campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Bad weather {{prevented}} {{this action}} and on 24 December, Jhangar, a <b>strategically</b> advantageous {{position in the}} Naushahra Sector, was captured by the Pakistanis which gave them control over the communication lines between Mirpur and Poonch and provided a starting point from which attacks could be made on Naushahra. The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces. Brigadier Mohammad Usman, the commanding officer of the 50th Para Brigade, had made necessary arrangements to counter the expected attack. Soldiers were deployed in small groups on possible enemy approaches.|$|E
5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. Children must learn to use their words appropriately and <b>strategically</b> in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others {{in a wide variety of}} interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.|$|E
5|$|Bowes Castle {{was built}} within {{the ruins of}} the Roman fort of Lavatrae. The route {{was one of the few}} upland passes to link England and Scotland and had {{remained}} <b>strategically</b> important during the medieval period. The castle site lay within the Honour of Richmond, a grouping of lands traditionally owned by the Counts of Brittany during the early medieval period, but the land itself was a demesne estate, owned by the Crown.|$|E
5|$|But <b>strategically,</b> Smith {{was most}} {{associated}} with his implementation of John McLendon's four corners offense, {{a strategy for}} stalling with a lead {{near the end of}} the game. Smith's teams executed the four corners set so effectively that in 1985 the NCAA instituted a shot clock to speed up play and minimize ball-control offense. Although fellow Kansas alum John McLendon actually invented the four corners offense, Smith got credit for utilizing it in games. Smith was also the author of Basketball: Multiple Offense and Defense, which is the best-selling technical basketball book in history.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1643, most of the {{south-west}} {{was under}} Royalist control; only Plymouth, Poole and Lyme Regis held out against them. The Parliamentarians controlled the navy, and Lyme Regis was <b>strategically</b> important, due to its location between Bristol and the English Channel. In early 1644, Charles I ordered Lyme Regis to be captured, and sent a large force {{under the command of}} his nephew, Prince Maurice.|$|E
5|$|Cambridge Castle was one {{of three}} castles built across the east of England in late 1068 by William the Conqueror in the {{aftermath}} of his northern campaign to capture York. Cambridge, or Grantabridge as it was then known, was on the old Roman route from London to York and was both <b>strategically</b> significant and at risk of rebellion. The initial building work was conducted by Picot, the high sheriff, who later founded a priory beside the castle. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design, within the existing town, and 27 houses had to be destroyed to make space for it.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{consists}} of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area {{in front of their}} own goal. Though {{there are a variety of}} positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are <b>strategically</b> placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.|$|E
5|$|East of Boyne City, M-75 turns northward {{and runs}} in that {{direction}} until turning again to follow the south shore of Walloon Lake. There it follows North Shore Drive into the town of Walloon Lake. M-75 ends at an intersection with US 131. The roadway continues eastward as C-81/Springvale Road. This northern segment carried 4,100vehicles and 170trucks in 2007. Neither segment is listed on the National Highway System, a system of <b>strategically</b> important highways.|$|E
5|$|Fort Cumberland {{was located}} on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which connects modern {{mainland}} Nova Scotia with New Brunswick. The area was <b>strategically</b> important in earlier conflicts between the French colony of Acadia and British-controlled Nova Scotia. Originally built by the French in 1750 as Fort Beauséjour, Fort Cumberland was in deplorable condition. Won from the French in the Battle of Fort Beauséjour in 1755, the fortifications had been minimally garrisoned by the British after the Seven Years' War and abandoned in 1768.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stanwix {{occupied}} a strategic western portage {{known as the}} Oneida Carrying Place (site of modern Rome, New York) between the Mohawk River, which flowed southeast to the Hudson River, and Wood Creek, whose waters ultimately led to Lake Ontario. Built by the British in 1758 during the French and Indian War on the only dry ground in the area, the fort had fallen into disrepair. When the American Revolutionary War widened in 1776 to include the frontier areas between New York and the Province of Quebec, the site again became <b>strategically</b> important.|$|E
5|$|Fort Tanjong Katong was {{designed}} and built in 1879 by Henry Edward McCallum, who was the Colonial Engineer and Architect of the Singapore History Museum on Stamford Road. The fort reflected the British concerns that other European powers such as the Netherlands and Russia, might attack the <b>strategically</b> located colony founded by Sir Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company in 1819. On the island of Sentosa, Fort Siloso, Fort Connaught and Fort Serapong were built {{around the same time}} as Fort Tanjong Katong, to guard the western and eastern entrances to the New Harbour (now Keppel Harbour).|$|E
5|$|Gebhard clearly {{intended}} to transform an important ecclesiastical territory into a secular, dynastic duchy. This problematic conversion would then bring {{the principle of}} cuius regio, eius religio into play in the Electorate. Under this principle, all of Gebhard's subjects {{would be required to}} convert to his faith: his rule, his religion. Furthermore, as a relatively young man, heirs would be expected. Gebhard and his young wife presented the very real possibility of successfully converting a rich, diplomatically important and <b>strategically</b> placed ecclesiastical territory of a prince-prelate into a dynastic territory that carried with it one of the coveted offices of imperial elector.|$|E
5|$|In February 1918 General Mannerheim {{weighed the}} {{question}} of where to focus the general offensive of the Whites, between two <b>strategically</b> vital enemy strongholds: Tampere, Finland's major industrial town in the south-west, and Viipuri, Karelia's main city. Although seizing Viipuri offered major advantages, the lack of combat skills of his army and potential for a major counterattack by the enemy in the area or in the south-west made it too risky.|$|E
