50|$|Nibali and Wiggins {{entered the}} Giro d'Italia {{as the two}} favourites for overall victory. Nibali took the leader's pink jersey (maglia rosa) on stage eight after {{finishing}} fourth in the time trial won by Alex Dowsett, conceding only 11 seconds to Wiggins. On stage ten, the first mountain top finish, Nibali finished third behind Rigoberto Urán to extend his lead over second placed Evans to 41 seconds. The rest of the race was severely affected by poor weather conditions. Nibali put further time into his rivals on stage 14, finishing on Monte Jafferau, as he and Mauro Santambrogio rode away in freezing conditions, with Nibali allowing Santambrogio to take the stage win; after the disqualification of Santambrogio, due to a positive test for EPO, the stage victory was retroactively awarded to Nibali. Nibali won stage 18, a mountain time trial, by 58 seconds from Samuel Sánchez, to extend his lead over Evans and Urán to over four minutes. The following stage, scheduled to be the queen stage of the race, had to be cancelled due to <b>snow.</b> <b>Stage</b> 20, the final mountain stage, also saw heavy snow, as Nibali attacked on the final climb to Tre Cime di Lavaredo to win the stage by 17 seconds from Fabio Duarte, with Urán a further two seconds back. Nibali also moved into {{the lead in the}} points classification. Nibali safely negotiated the final stage to Brescia to win the Giro by four minutes 43 seconds over Urán, his second Grand tour overall victory. However, as Mark Cavendish collected all the intermediate sprints before winning the final stage, Nibali finished second to Cavendish in the points classification.|$|E

40|$|A {{sophisticated}} {{physical model}} of the dry snow/firn densification process in ice sheets is proposed. Macroscopically, snow and firn undergo vertical uniaxial compression with non-zero deviatoric stresses and strain rates. The present mathematical description of densificntion includes dilatancy and "force-chain" effects in snow and develops previous concepts of ice-particle rearrangement by grain-boundary sliding and sintering by power-law creep under overburden pressure. Both densification mechanisms work together during the first <b>snow</b> <b>stage</b> until the closest packing of ice grains is reached at critical densities of 0. 7 - 0. 76 and the firn stage controlled only by the dislocation creep sets on. In addition to the ice-grain coordination number and {{the slope of the}} radial distribution function, a new structural parameter is introduced to account for grain bonding (agglomeration) effects. The model is constrained and validated on direct stereological observations of ice core structures and a representative set of snow/firn density-depth profiles covering a wide range of present-day climatic conditions (- 57. 5 to - 10 ℃ and ice accumulation at 2. 15 to 330 cm yr^[- 1]). Simple equations are derived for predicting the depth of pore closure in firn and the ice age at close-off. The paleoclimatic evolution of quasi-stationary density-depth profiles and close-off characteristics at Vostok Station (East Antarctica) are simulated and discussed. III.

40|$|The {{release of}} heavy metals (such as Pb and Cd) from foliar litter play an {{important}} role in element cycling in alpine forest ecosystems. Although natural forest gaps could play important roles in the release of heavy metals from foliar litter by affecting the snow cover during the winter and solar irradiation during the growing season, few studies have examined these potential roles. The objectives of this study were to document changes in Pb and Cd dynamics during litter decomposition in the center of gaps and under closed canopies and to investigate the factors that controlled these changes during the winter and growing seasons. Senesced foliar litter from six dominant species, including Kangding willow (Salix paraplesia), Masters larch (Larix mastersiana), Mingjiang fir (Abies faxoniana), Alpine azalea (Rhododendron lapponicum), Red birch (Betula albosinensis) and Mourning cypress (Sabina saltuaria), was placed in litterbags and incubated between the gap center and closed canopy conditions in an alpine forest in the eastern region of the Tibetan Plateau. The litterbags were sampled at the <b>snow</b> formation <b>stage,</b> <b>snow</b> coverage <b>stage,</b> <b>snow</b> melt <b>stage</b> and during the growing season. The Pb and Cd concentrations in the sampled foliar litter were determined by acid digestion (HNO 3 /HClO 4). Over one year of decomposition, Pb accumulation and Cd release from the foliar litter occurred, regardless of the foliar litter species. However, Pb and Cd were both released from the foliar litter during the winter and accumulated during the growing season. Compared with the gap center and the canopy gap edge, the extended gap edge and the closed canopy showed higher Pb and Cd release rates in winter and higher Pb and Cd accumulation rates during the growing season, respectively. Statistical analyses indicate that the dynamics of Pb were significantly influenced by frequent freeze-thaw cycles in winter and appropriate hydrothermal conditions during the growing season, the dynamics of Cd were strongly influenced by species and the presence of a forest gap at different decomposition stages. These results show that forest gaps could inhibit Pb and Cd release from foliar litter in the alpine forest of western Sichuan. In addition, a decrease in the snow depth in the winter warming scenario would promote the release of Pb during foliar litter decomposition. There exist some difference that may be influenced by litter quality, microenvironment and microtopography during litter decomposition...|$|R

50|$|Since {{the race}}'s conclusion, the race has been marred by accusations of race {{officials}} favoring Francesco Moser. On several occasions, Moser was seen drafting behind team cars and being pushed up mountains {{which is not}} allowed in the race rules. Moser was not penalized the times he committed the violations, but several other riders in the race were punished by officials when they committed the same infractions. Another instance appeared when the race officials cancelled the crossing of the Stelvio Pass during the eighteenth <b>stage.</b> <b>Snow</b> had fallen on the Stelvio and {{was thought to be}} able to be cleared by the day of the stage as race director Vincenzo Torriani had photos showing that it could be done. However, the day before the <b>stage,</b> the <b>snow</b> had yet to be cleared. There's speculation that a government official from Trent - Moser's hometown - would not allow the Giro to cross the Stelvio. The race was re-routed to go over the Tonale Pass and Palade Pass. The changes in the stage resulted in another collective finish of the general classification contenders, thus keeping the time gaps the same and playing into the hand of Moser. 1986 race winner Roberto Visentini quit the race because he felt the it was being fixed. In the final time trial, TV helicopters have been accused of flying low behind Moser in order to propel him forward, increasing his speed.

40|$|Wet snow {{can create}} serious {{electrical}} and mechanical problems to power transmission networks {{due to its}} high adherence to materials. In this study, both adherence of wet snow to cables and wet snow shedding following the application of periodic loads were investigated in small-scale experiments. Wet snow was obtained from fresh dry snow collected from {{the top layer of}} snow accumulated outdoors. The collected dry snow was exposed to warm air for periods of time long enough to obtain the desired liquid water content (LWC) values. Wet snow sleeves were manually prepared after being compressed around the cable. The room temperature, snow sleeve length, cable diameter, and cable length were kept constant for each experiment. Dynamic load on the cable was simulated by a periodic excitation applied {{at one end of the}} cable, while the other end was fixed. Since fading adhesion is a condition for snow shedding, and since LWC is a critical factor influencing adhesion, the effects of excitation frequency and amplitude were investigated for different LWC values. LWC was examined for values from 10 to 40 %. When free water began to increase, <b>snow</b> at this <b>stage</b> was wet and it adhered stronger to the cable than low LWC, where there is no enough water to stick on the cable or high LWC where snow is transparent. The LWC range was found experimentally between 20 to 30 % (Hefny R. et al., 2009).

40|$|P otential water {{pollution}} associatedwith melting snow are a concern to watershedmanagers in northern climates. In fact, in some urban areas, substantial {{portions of the}} annual load of pollutants such as hydrocarbons, metals, solids, nutri-ents, and chlorides come from snowmelt and early spring runoff events. Thus the annual cycle of pollut-ant build-up and subsequent release during snowmelt {{can be a real}} threat to the attainment of water quality objectives. This article examines the mechanisms involved in snow pollutant accumulation and the movement of various pollutants from the snowpack. With this knowl-edge practitioners can plan management actions to anticipate changing flows and pollutant concentra-tions. Techniques that can be incorporated include the designation of “salt-free ” areas near key streams and wetlands, and dumping plowed snow in pervious areas where melt water can infiltrate. The Snowmelt Sequence Snowmelt can be described as a predictable process with three distinct stages (Figure 1). The first melt stage is called pavement melt. As the name implies, it occurs when deicers are applied or the sun shines on heat-absorbing paved areas. These applications result in a winter-long sequence of chemically-driven melt events in which very saline water carries accumulated road pollutants into drainage systems and local receiving waters. The second melt stage involves the more gradual melt of snow piles adjacent to road surfaces. Roadside melt contributes runoff intermittently as chemical splash and solar radiation gradually reduce piled <b>snow.</b> The final <b>stage</b> of the snowmelt sequence is the melt of non-paved pervious areas of the site, such as grassed lawns. The pervious area melt stage has the potential to contribute a substantial volume of runoff quickly, par-ticularly when accelerated by a rain event. Runoff Quantity The volume of runoff generated by each of the three melt stages is dictated primarily by the amount of snow and the weather conditions (Table 1). In most cases, runoff produced during pavement melt is not substan-tial. The end-of-season melt of the snowpack (i. e. ...|$|R

In this paper, our objective is to evaluate the potential of MODIS-based indices for determining the SGN stage. Those included: (i) enhanced vegetation index (EVI), (ii) normalized difference water index (NDWI) using the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands centered at 1. 64 µm (NDWI 1. 64 µm) and at 2. 13 µm (NDWI 2. 13 µm), and (iii) normalized difference snow index (NDSI). These were calculated using the 500 m 8 -day gridded MODIS-based composites of surface reflectance data (i. e., MOD 09 A 1 v. 005) for the period 2006 – 08. We performed a qualitative evaluation of these indices over two forest fire prone natural subregions in Alberta (i. e., central mixedwood and lower boreal highlands). In the process, we generated and compared the natural subregion-specific lookout tower sites average: (i) temporal trends for each of the indices, and (ii) SGN stage using the ground-based observations available from Alberta Sustainable Resource Development. The EVI-values were found to have large uncertainty {{at the onset of the}} spring and unable to predict the SGN stages precisely. In terms of NDSI, it showed earlier prediction capabilities. On the contrary, both of the NDWI’s showed distinct pattern (i. e., reached a minimum value before started to increase again during the spring) in relation to observed SGN stages. Thus further analysis was carried out to determine the best predictor by comparing the NDWI’s predicted SGN stages with the ground-based observations at all of the individual lookout tower sites (approximately 120 in total) across the study area. It revealed that NDWI 2. 13 µm demonstrated better prediction capabilities (i. e., on an average approximately 90 % of the observations fell within ± 2 periods or ± 16 days of deviation) in comparison to NDWI 1. 64 µm (i. e., on an average approximately 73 % of the observations fell within ± 2 periods or ± 16 days of deviation) ...|$|R
