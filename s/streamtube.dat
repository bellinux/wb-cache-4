40|$|Introduction We apply {{hierarchical}} clustering methods on <b>streamtubes</b> for visualization and analysis. <b>Streamtubes</b> {{are integrated}} {{in the major}} eigenvector field of the DTI data set. In a 256 256 50 data set, our algorithm can generate {{tens of thousands of}} <b>streamtubes.</b> It is hard to find features in a dense set of undistinguished tubes. Thus it is important to impose some structural information on the <b>streamtubes</b> for visualization and interpretation purposes. Hierarchical clustering produces a dendrogram that groups objects into different number of clusters in a continuous way. We apply some clustering methods on a set of <b>streamtubes</b> and found that the <b>streamtubes</b> correlating to major neural structures tend to cluster together because of their shape similarities. Also, different distance criteria produce different types of clusters. The dendrogram produced by the hierarchical clustering methods {{has the potential to be}} utilized by visualization applications to interactively displa...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{adaptive}} seeding strategy for visualization of diffusion tensor {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (DT-MRI) data using <b>streamtubes.</b> DT-MRI is a medical imaging modality that captures unique water diffusion properties and fiber orientation information of the imaged tissues. Visualizing DT-MRI data using <b>streamtubes</b> has the advantage that not only the anisotropic nature of the diffusion is visualized but also the underlying anatomy of biological structures is revealed. This makes <b>streamtubes</b> significant {{for the analysis of}} fibrous tissues in medical images. In order to avoid rendering multiple similar <b>streamtubes,</b> an adaptive seeding strategy is employed which takes into account similarity of tensors in a given region. The goal is to automate the process of generating seed points such that regions with dissimilar tensors are assigned more seed points compared to regions with similar tensors. The algorithm is based on tensor dissimilarity metrics that take into account both diffusion magnitudes and directions to optimize the seeding positions and density of <b>streamtubes</b> {{in order to reduce the}} visual clutter. Two recent advances in tensor calculus and tensor dissimilarity metrics are utilized: the Log-Euclidean and the J-divergence. Results show that adaptive seeding not only helps to cull unnecessary <b>streamtubes</b> that would obscure visualization but also do so without having to compute the culled <b>streamtubes,</b> which makes the visualization process faster...|$|R

50|$|In fluid dynamics, the Stokes stream {{function}} {{is used to}} describe the streamlines and flow velocity in a three-dimensional incompressible flow with axisymmetry. A surface with a constant value of the Stokes {{stream function}} encloses a <b>streamtube,</b> everywhere tangential to the flow velocity vectors. Further, the volume flux within this <b>streamtube</b> is constant, and all the streamlines of the flow are located on this surface. The velocity field associated with the Stokes stream function is solenoidal—it has zero divergence. This stream function is named in honor of George Gabriel Stokes.|$|E
50|$|The {{streamlines}} {{divide the}} flow around the airfoil into streamtubes as depicted by {{the spaces between}} the streamlines in the adjacent diagram. By definition, fluid never crosses a streamline in a steady flow. Assuming that the air is incompressible, the rate of volume flow (e.g. liters or gallons per minute) must be constant within each <b>streamtube</b> since matter is not created or destroyed. If a <b>streamtube</b> becomes narrower, the flow speed must increase in the narrower region to maintain the constant flow rate. This is an application {{of the principle of}} conservation of mass.|$|E

We have a <b>streamtube,</b> {{in which there is}} the fluid and the rotor. We will assume that there is no interaction between the contents of the <b>streamtube</b> and everything outside of it. That is, we are dealing with an isolated system. In physics, isolated systems must obey conservation laws. An example of such is the conservation of angular momentum. Thus, the angular momentum within the <b>streamtube</b> must be conserved. Consequently, if the rotor acquires angular momentum through its interaction with the fluid, something else must acquire equal and opposite angular momentum. As already mentioned, the system consists of just the fluid and the rotor, the fluid must acquire angular momentum in the wake.

50|$|In our <b>streamtube</b> we have fluid {{flowing from}} left to right, and an {{actuator}} disk that represents the rotor. We will assume that the rotor is infinitesimally thin. From above, {{we can see that}} {{at the start of the}} <b>streamtube,</b> fluid flow is normal to the actuator disk. The fluid interacts with the rotor, thus transferring energy from the fluid to the rotor. The fluid then continues to flow downstream. Thus we can break our system/streamtube into two sections: pre-acuator disk, and post-actuator disk. Before interaction with the rotor, the total energy in the fluid is constant. Furthermore, after interacting with the rotor, the total energy in the fluid is constant.|$|E

Consequently, the intake capture area is less than the intake lip area, which reduces the intake airflow. Depending on the airflow characteristics of the engine, it may be desirable to lower the ramp angle or move the cone rearwards to refocus the shockwaves onto the cowl lip to maximise intake airflow.|$|E

40|$|A {{previous}} axisymmetric {{model of}} the supersonic expansion of a collisionless, hot plasma in a divergent magnetic nozzle is extended here in order to include electron-inertia effects. Up to dominant order on all components of the electron velocity, electron momentum equations still reduce to three conservation laws. Electron inertia leads to outward electron separation from the magnetic <b>streamtubes.</b> The progressive plasma filling of the adjacent vacuum region is consistent with electron-inertia being part of finite electron Larmor radius effects, which increase downstream and eventually demagnetize the plasma. Current ambipolarity is not fulfilled and ion separation can be either outwards or inwards of magnetic <b>streamtubes,</b> depending on their magnetization. Electron separation penalizes slightly the plume efficiency and is larger for plasma beams injected with large pressure gradients. An alternative nonzero electron-inertia model [E. Hooper, J. Propul.

40|$|Biogeochemical {{modeling}} using PHREEQC 2 and a <b>streamtube</b> ensemble {{approach is}} utilized {{to understand a}} well-to-well subsurface treatment system at the Vadose Zone Research Park (VZRP) near Idaho Falls, Idaho. Treatment involves in situ microbially-mediated ureolysis to induce calcite precipitation for the immobilization of strontium- 90. PHREEQC 2 is utilized to model the kinetically-controlled ureolysis and consequent calcite precipitation. Reaction kinetics, equilibrium phases, and cation exchange are used within PHREEQC 2 to track pH and levels of calcium, ammonium, urea, and calcite precipitation over time, within a series of one-dimensional advective-dispersive transport paths creating a <b>streamtube</b> ensemble representation of the well-to-well transport. An understanding {{of the impact of}} physical heterogeneities within this radial flowfield is critical for remediation design; we address this via the <b>streamtube</b> approach: instead of depicting spatial extents of solutes in the subsurface we focus on their arrival distribution at the control well(s). Traditionally, each <b>streamtube</b> maintains uniform velocity; however in radial flow in homogeneous media, the velocity within any given <b>streamtube</b> is spatially-variable in a common way, being highest at the input and output wells and approaching a minimum at the midpoint between the wells. This idealized velocity variability is of significance in the case of ureolytically driven calcite precipitation. <b>Streamtube</b> velocity patterns for any particular configuration of injection and withdrawal wells are available as explicit calculations from potential theory, and also from particle tracking programs. To approximate the actual spatial distribution of velocity along streamtubes, we assume idealized radial non-uniform velocity associated with homogeneous media. This is implemented in PHREEQC 2 via a non-uniform spatial discretization within each <b>streamtube</b> that honors both the streamtube’s travel time and the idealized “fast-slow-fast” pattern of non-uniform velocity along the streamline.
