The study included mature (34. 5 – 36. 5 years old) and young stands (10 – 11 years old) measured under normal climate and during an extreme drought. The effect of water stress on heartwood development was examined using sapwood percentage, sapwood saturation, development of dry sapwood and evidence of cavitation in <b>sapwood.</b> <b>Trees</b> at the warm–dry site developed heartwood at faster rates than on the high-altitude site. At breast height, the mature stands of the warm–dry site had 8 – 14 % less sapwood. Extensive cavitation towards the sapwood/heartwood boundary occurred {{in some of the}} mature and young stands on the warm–dry site. We postulated that in water-limiting environments, cavitation of the inner sapwood precedes heartwood formation and is an adaptation mechanism that regulates stem conductance capacity and thus water use in the tree. The drought of 2006 led to decreases in moisture associated with cavitation not previously reported for radiata pine and demonstrated the drought hardiness of the species. In the warm–dry site, breast-height sapwood saturation dropped to 58 and 82 % for suppressed and average-sized trees in a mature unthinned stand; and 75 – 78 % for two young stands. These saturation levels, however, only imply average values as some cells cavitated whilst others were fully saturated.

40|$|EN] 1. It is {{expected}} that climate warming will enhance tree growth of mountain conifer forests in cold regions. However, trees have shown unstable, age-related and site-dependent growth responses to climate throughout the past century, but information on the drivers controlling such responsiveness at the site and tree scales is lacking. We evaluated whether such changing growth responses are more influenced by site features, such as altitude, or by tree features, such as size and sapwood area. 2. We quantified the growth trends at the site and tree levels in Iberian Pinus uncinata forests using dendrochronology. Tree-ring width was converted to basal area increment (BAI) to assess the relationships between growth and site and tree variables over three time periods (1901 - 1994, 1901 - 1947, 1948 - 1994) using structural equation models. 3. Trees were older at higher altitudes, {{and the amount of}} <b>sapwood</b> decreased as <b>trees</b> aged. BAI trends were lower in the period 1948 - 1994 than in the period 1901 - 1947, that is, tree growth is decelerating, despite BAI values of both periods showing the reverse pattern. Sapwood area and, to a minor extent, tree age were the main positive and negative drivers, respectively, controlling BAI during the 20 th century, whereas altitude played a minor role. 4. Synthesis. Our results highlight the relevance of tree individual characteristics as the main drivers modulating growth responses to climate warming. We conclude that climate warming will have a lower effect on radial growth in slow-growing high-elevation trees than in fast-growing low-elevation trees, which produce a greater <b>sapwood</b> area. <b>Trees</b> may become relatively insensitive to climate as they age and reach a size-related functional threshold linked to reduced sapwood production.

Mean basal area (BA), diameter at breast height (DBH) and height increments and percent earlywood and sapwood hydraulic parameters of branches and boles were measured 7 or 8 years after the initial treatments at Sheridan Creek and Kenneth Creek. At Sheridan Creek, fertilization significantly increased BA and DBH incre-ments, but had no effect on height increment. At Kenneth Creek, fertilization increased BA, but fertilized trees had sig-nificantly lower height increments than control <b>trees.</b> <b>Sapwood</b> permeability was greater in lower branches of repeatedly fertil-ized trees than in those of control <b>trees.</b> <b>Sapwood</b> permeabil-ities of the lower branches of trees in the control, periodic and annual treatments were 0. 24 × 10 – 12, 0. 35 × 10 – 12 and 0. 45 × 10 – 12 m 2 at Kenneth Creek; and 0. 41 × 10 – 12, 0. 54 × 10 – 12 and 0. 65 × 10 – 12 m 2 at Sheridan Creek, respectively. Annual fertil-ization tended to increase leaf specific conductivities and Huber values of the lower branches of trees at both study sites.

40|$|Abstract The {{value of}} black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) is {{affected}} by {{the quality and quantity of}} darkly colored heartwood in its stem. We are exploring the regulation of heartwood production by identifying genes associated with the transition from sapwood to heartwood. Previous microarray data indicated that heartwood formation may be related to programmed cell death (PCD). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the region of heartwood formation in walnut stems (i. e., the transition zone, TZ) for the expression of 80 ESTs putatively associated with PCD. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time PCR was per-formed to detect the expression changes in candidate genes in the TZ and <b>sapwood</b> of <b>trees</b> harvested in summer and fall. The results revealed that the transcript of a clone that encodes a presumed homeobox protein knotted- 1 -like 3 (KNAT 3) was highly expressed in the TZ when compared with other tissues. Analysis of the full-length coding sequence revealed that the black walnut gene contains regions with 67 % similarity to Knox 1 and Knox 2 domains from the Arabidopsis thaliana KNAT 3, as well as a putative homeodomain known to be a transcription factor in other plants. JnKNAT 3 -like transcript was detected in the pith meristem, roots, embryogenic callus, vascular cambium, female flowers, male flowers, green leaves, and partially and fully senescent leaves of black walnut, although tran-script abundance varied considerably among tissues.

40|$|Summary Leaf {{specific}} conductivity (LSC; {{the ratio of}} stem conductivity (KP) to leaf area (AL)), {{a measure of the}} hydraulic capacity of the stem to supply leaves with water, varies with soil water content. Empirical evidence for LSC responses to drought is ambiguous, because previously published results were subject to many confounding factors. We tested howLSC of similar-sized trees of the same population, under similar climatic conditions, responds to persistently wet or dry soil. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and pubescent oak (Quercus pubescensWilld.) trees were compared between a dry site and a wet site in theValais, an inner alpine valley in Switzerland. Soilwater strongly influenced AL and KP and the plant components affecting KP, such as conduit radius, conduit density and functional <b>sapwood</b> area. <b>Trees</b> at the dry site had lower LSC than trees with the same stem diameter at the wet site. Low LSC in trees at the dry site was associated with a smaller functional sapwood area and narrower conduits, resulting in a stronger reduction in KP than in AL. These observations support the hypothesis that trees maintain a homeostatic water pressure gradient. An alternative hypothesis is that relatively high investments in leaves compared with sapwood contribute to carbon gain over an entire season by enabling rapid whole-plant photosynthesis during periods of high water availability (e. g., in spring, after rain events and during morning hours when leafto- air vapor pressure deficit is small). Dynamic data and a hydraulic plant growth model are needed to test how investments in leaves versus sapwood and roots contribute to transpiration and to maximizing carbon gain throughout entire growth seasons.

40|$|Woodpeckers are {{the primary}} tree-cavity {{producers}} in North America and, through their process of cavity excavation, they create nesting and roosting habitat for a complex web of cavity-using species. Managing for potential woodpecker nest trees requires an understanding of factors that influence decisions by which woodpecker select trees for nest cavity excavation, including tree decay availability associated with softened heartwood and <b>sapwood</b> in <b>trees.</b> We evaluated woodpecker nest cavity excavation {{in relation to the}} nature and availability of decay in trembling aspen (Populustremuloides) using 12 years of nest and tree decay class data from British Columbia. We used a cavity-nest web to visually depict decay selection profiles for six woodpecker species and compared these woodpecker decay selection profiles to the availability of decay in aspen (96. 7 % of all cavity nests found), identifying the most suitable nest tree stages used by woodpeckers. The suitable woodpecker nest tree stage consists primarily of live unhealthy trees and recently dead trees (93. 9 % of active nests found in aspen). Compared to non-nest trees (trees within which no cavity nests were found during the study period), live trees that were used for nest cavity excavation had higher annual probabilities of entering the suitable woodpecker nest tree stage than non-nest trees, and they also had a lower probability of progressing outside of this stage. This suggests excavation decisions involve a balance of competing tradeoffs between ease of excavation and tree security. Nest trees remained within the suitable woodpecker nest tree stage for an average of 11. 8 years, and almost half of this time involved live trees in an unhealthy state. We suggest that forest management guidelines that focus on retaining only dead trees to provide cavities for wildlife are missing a significant component of available and future tree cavity resources...|$|R
