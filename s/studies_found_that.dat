5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E
5000|$|A 1997 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> CAP {{laws were}} {{associated}} with a 23% decrease in accidental shooting deaths among children younger than 15 years old. A 2000 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Florida's CAP law appeared to have [...] "significantly reduced unintentional firearm deaths to children," [...] but that the similar laws that existed in 14 other states {{did not seem to}} have such an effect. At the time, only three states in the U.S., including Florida, allowed those who violated their state's CAP law to be prosecuted on felony charges. A 2004 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> CAP laws {{were associated with}} a [...] "modest reduction in suicide rates among youth aged 14 to 17 years." [...] A 2006 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> states with CAP laws experienced faster declines in accidental child firearm deaths than states without such laws. A 2015 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> these laws have no significant impact on unintentional gun deaths, but that states with such laws had lower rates of youth suicide. Some <b>studies</b> have also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> CAP laws are associated with lower rates of nonfatal gun injuries among {{children under the age of}} 18.

5|$|Psychological <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{individuals}} with little mathematics education tend to estimate quantities logarithmically, that is, they position {{a number on}} an unmarked line according to its logarithm, so that 10 is positioned as close to 100 as 100 is to 1000. Increasing education shifts this to a linear estimate (positioning 1000 10x as far away) in some circumstances, while logarithms are used when the numbers to be plotted are difficult to plot linearly.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. <b>Studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E

5000|$|With {{respect to}} the Criminal Law Amendment Act, a gun control law passed in Canada in 1977, some <b>studies</b> have <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it was {{ineffective}} at reducing homicide or robbery rates. One <b>study</b> even <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the law may have actually increased robberies involving firearms. A 1993 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> after this law was passed, gun suicides decreased significantly, as did the proportion of suicides committed {{in the country with}} guns. A 2003 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> this law [...] "may have had an impact on suicide rates, even after controls for social variables," [...] while a 2001 study by the same research team concluded that the law [...] "may have had an impact on homicide rates, at least for older victims."

5|$|The tree {{of heaven}} is a very rapidly growing tree, {{possibly}} the fastest growing tree in North America. Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6ft) per {{year for the first}} four years is considered normal. Shade considerably hampers growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees. <b>Studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Californian trees grew faster than their East Coast counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than Chinese ones.|$|E
5|$|Hematinic {{deficiencies}} (vitamin B12, {{folic acid}} and iron), occurring singly or in combination, and {{with or without}} any underlying gastrointestinal disease, may be twice as common in people with RAS. However, iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration. The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six {{ecotypes}} – genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables. These findings were in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference {{to remain in the}} type of habitat that it was born into.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, gout {{is twice}} as likely in males of African descent than those of European descent. Rates are high among Pacific Islanders and the Māori, but the disease is rare in {{aboriginal}} Australians, despite a higher mean uric acid serum concentration in the latter group. It has become common in China, Polynesia and urban sub-Saharan Africa. Some <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> attacks of gout occur more frequently in the spring.

5|$|Repairs to the RAAF's F-111Cs were {{undertaken}} {{from late}} 1971, and all 24 were accepted on 15March 1973. The RAAF considered retaining the Phantoms after the F-111s entered service, and the US Government offered {{to sell the}} 23 remaining aircraft to Australia for $54 million. <b>Studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the upfront cost of keeping the F-4Es would be $77 million, {{and that one of}} the MirageIII squadrons would need to be disbanded to man the Phantom-equipped units. Nevertheless, the Air Board recommended that the aircraft be retained, but a proposal to do so was rejected by the Cabinet in 1972 on advice from the Treasury. If the Phantoms had remained in service they would have been used to provide close air support for the Army.|$|E

A descriptive review looking specifically at Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) intervention <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> several studies reported an increase in speech, often during later phases, while one noted little or no effect.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the {{financial}} crisis and accompanying recession could {{not account for the}} entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit.

Paul Krawzak claimed that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies of}} FH cohorts suggest that {{additional}} risk factors are generally at play {{when a person}} develops atherosclerosis.

5|$|In 1924, one of Independence Hall's {{exterior}} doors {{was replaced by}} glass, allowing some view of the bell even when the building was closed. When Congress enacted the nation's first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve took their oaths of enlistment before the Liberty Bell. Once the war started, the bell was again a symbol, used to sell war bonds. In {{the early days of}} World War II, it was feared that the bell might be in danger from saboteurs or enemy bombing, and city officials considered moving the bell to Fort Knox, to be stored with the nation's gold reserves. The idea provoked a storm of protest from around the nation, and was abandoned. Officials then considered building an underground steel vault above which it would be displayed, and into which it could be lowered if necessary. The project was dropped when <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the digging might undermine the foundations of Independence Hall. The bell was again tapped on D-Day, as well as in victory on V-E Day and V-J Day.|$|E
5|$|Mups {{are members}} of a large family of low-molecular weight (~19kDa) {{proteins}} known as lipocalins. They have a characteristic structure of eight beta sheets arranged in an anti-parallel beta barrel open on one face, with alpha helices at both ends. Consequently, they form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a cup-like pocket that binds small organic chemicals with high affinity. A number of these ligands bind to mouse Mups, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo-brevicomin (DHB). These are all urine-specific chemicals that have been shown to act as pheromones—molecular signals excreted by one individual that trigger an innate behavioural response in another member of the same species. Mouse Mups have also been shown to function as pheromone stabilizers, providing a slow release mechanism that extends the potency of volatile pheromones in male urine scent marks. Given the diversity of Mups in rodents, it was originally thought that different Mups may have differently shaped binding pockets and therefore bind different pheromones. However, detailed <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> most variable sites are located {{on the surface of the}} proteins, and appear to have little effect on ligand binding.|$|E
5|$|The RAN {{conducted}} armament effectiveness {{studies of}} each of the six DDL variants in parallel with Y-ARD's development of the designs. These <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> including an area air defence capability and an ability to operate two helicopters greatly improved the DDL's effectiveness. As a result, these features were included in the Navy's specification for the DDL design which was issued in late 1970. By this time the design had evolved to specify a general-purpose destroyer of 4,200 tons, armed with a five-inch gun and a Tartar missile launcher, and capable of operating two helicopters. The changes increased the cost of building the ships, and the number planned was reduced to three. Nevertheless, the DDL design was considered likely to result in very capable ships, with the 1972–73 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships commenting favourably.|$|E
