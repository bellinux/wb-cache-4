For this, design steps of lower levels (in particular the expensive tasks of logic and layout synthesis) have to be performed only once for the design identified for most suitable within the design space exploration process.

40|$|Todays’ {{systems for}} {{telecommunication}} {{are getting more}} and more complex. Automatic testing is required to guarantee quality of the systems produced. An actual example is the introduction of GPRS traffic in the GSM network nodes. This thesis investigates the need and demands for such an automatic testing of the traffic channels in the GSM system. A solution intended {{to be a part of}} the Ericsson TSS is proposed. One problem to be solved is that today’s tools for testing do not support testing of speech channels with the <b>speech</b> <b>transcoder</b> unit installed. As part of the investigation, a speech codec is implemented for execution on current hardware used in the test platform. The selected speech codec is the enhanced full rate codec, generating a bitstream of 12. 2 kbit/s, and gives a good trade-off between compression and speech quality. The report covers the design of the test tool and the implementation of speech codec. Particularly performance problems in the implementation of the encoder will be addressed...|$|E
