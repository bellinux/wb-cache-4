25|$|The {{pillars of}} the 3x3 bay gate were sunk {{directly}} into the ground, rather than their being supported on base stones; similar sunken pillars may be found at Ise Jingū. The central pillar of the 3x3 bay pagoda rested on a base stone a metre below the podium on which it stood, as in the later examples at Hōryū-ji and Hōrin-ji. The base stones, uniquely carved with lotus petals, of the kondō reveal a 3x2 bay central core or moya and unusually narrow side bays. The base stones of the 8x4 bay lecture hall include holes bored for <b>swing</b> <b>doors.</b> The precinct itself extended 22 bays east to west, some eighty-four metres between the outer walls.|$|E
25|$|Champneys {{suggested}} that, {{in order}} to protect the books and manuscripts, 'it will be very desirable to keep the air in the interior of the building as clear and free from smoke and chemical matter (both of which are held in the air of Manchester) as may be possible'. The ground floor was built with numerous air inlets and, although his client felt it would prove impossible to exclude foul air, Champneys installed jute or hessian screens to trap the soot, with water sprays to catch the sulphur and other chemicals, which was a very advanced system for the period. Internal screen doors were employed in the entrance hall to prevent the air being 'fouled by the opening of the outer doors' with internal <b>swing</b> <b>doors</b> between the circulation areas and the main library to 'preserve the valuable books from injury'. By 1900 the ventilation system had evolved to include electric fans to draw in air at pavement level through coke screens sprayed with water.|$|E

2500|$|Great Western Railway had {{permission}} for {{a line from}} Ealing Broadway to a station near to CLR's [...] Shepherd's Bush station, with {{a connection to the}} West London Railway and in 1911 there was agreement to connect the line to the Central London Railway and for the CLR to run trains to Ealing. Construction started in 1912 and the CLR ordered 24 new all-steel motor cars from Brush for the Ealing services. These were [...] long and equipped with an incompatible traction control system, with automatic acceleration, controlling more powerful [...] GE212 motors. Seating 32 in a heated saloon accessed by centre and end <b>swing</b> <b>doors,</b> these were the first tube cars without end gates. However, work on the line was stopped by the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and the 22 vehicles that had been received in 1915 were stored until 1917 when they were lent to the Bakerloo line. These ran on the extension to [...] Watford Junction with Piccadilly line trailers until 1920/21 when they returned to the Central London. Trailer cars were modified with new control cables compatible with the new motor cars and heaters, as the line to Ealing was not in tunnel, and two groups of stock formed, known as Tunnel (or Local) Stock and Ealing Stock. As traffic to Ealing increased, in 1925/26 eight of the original motor cars were modified to augment the Ealing Stock.|$|E
