30|$|Ultimately, {{not using}} the {{intervention}} tool itself but increasing the teachers’ motivation and improving the teachers’ skills to teach English pronunciation following certain strategies, was the goal. The initial, improved <b>student</b> <b>outcome</b> was supposed to work as an incentive for a teacher to change or adapt his or her teaching behaviour. So the initial evidence of better <b>student</b> <b>outcome</b> does not show the link between teacher professional development and <b>student</b> learning <b>outcome</b> but more {{the link between the}} use of the intervention tool (CAPTT) and better <b>student</b> <b>outcome,</b> with the teacher having had more of a facilitating role in test phase 1. However, teachers were asked to follow a strict procedure, asking them to briefly introduce each topic. For that purpose the intervention tool provided the teacher with a teacher’s guide, aiming to build on the teacher’s content knowledge (what to teach) but also on the pedagogical content-knowledge (how do students learn this best), which in many studies is considered to be eminent for improving and changing teachers’ teaching practice and improving <b>student</b> learning <b>outcome</b> (Van Driel and Berry, 2012; Yoon et al., 2007; Borko, 2004).|$|R

2500|$|Improving {{the school}} climate {{can be one}} of the tasks of a school psychologist. School climate is {{consistently}} identified by researchers as a variable that is related to effectiveness of schools. [...] Specifically, positive school climate is associated with several <b>student</b> <b>outcomes</b> including achievement, attendance, self-concept, and behavior. [...] Therefore, school psychologists seek to improve school climate as a school-wide preventative approach rather than a reactive or remedial approach. [...] Best practice proposes that school climate is first described and measured [...] before a plan of action is developed and implemented. While efforts to improve school climate can be implemented at the national level with large-scale reform, or on a smaller scale at the individual school or district level, the strategies used to improve school climate need to be based on the individual strengths and weaknesses of each school.|$|E

2500|$|The {{general idea}} of value added {{modeling}} {{has also been}} extended to consider principals and school leaders. [...] While there has been considerable anecdotal discussion {{about the importance of}} school leaders, there has been very little systematic research into the impact of them on <b>student</b> <b>outcomes.</b> [...] Recent analysis in Texas has provided evidence about the effectiveness of leaders by looking at how the gains in student achievement for a school change after the principal changes. [...] This outcome-based approach to measuring effectiveness of principals is very similar to the value-added modeling that has been applied to the evaluation of teachers. [...] The early research in Texas finds that principals have a very large impact on student achievement. [...] Conservative estimates indicate that an effective school leader improves the performance of all students in a school, with the magnitude equal on average to two months additional learning gains for the students in each school year. [...] These gains come at least in part through the principal's impact on selecting and retaining good teachers. [...] Ineffective principals, however, have a similarly large negative effect on school performance, suggesting that issues of evaluation are as important with respect to school leadership as they are for teachers.|$|E

The parties responsible within the school for making the decisions about how the school responded were investigated and how the school was informing the wider school community of any changes were also investigated. Three schools which seemed, from their responses to the questionnaire, to have approached accountability in innovative ways were approached and informal interviews were conducted to investigate further the methods of assessment and accountability and the processes that had been used within the school in the decision making process that had been undertaken.

The dependent variable is receptivity towards the use of <b>Student</b> <b>Outcome</b> Statements and is measured in four aspects: Overall Feelings, Attitudes, Behaviour Intentions and Behaviour. Two is to investigate the relationships between receptivity, as the dependent variable and ten independent variables: non-monetary cost benefits, alleviation of fears and concerns, significant other support, feelings compared to the previous system, shared goals (shared teaching goals and cohesiveness), collaboration (team teaching, involvement in decision making and teacher collaboration) and teacher learning opportunities. Three is to investigate the relationships between receptivity and the independent variables {{in the context of the}} situation variables related to the school department and teacher. The situation variables are: school size, school location, socio-economic status, department size, department type, teacher status, teacher experience, sex, age, use of <b>Student</b> <b>Outcome</b> Statements and purpose to which <b>Student</b> <b>Outcome</b> Statements are put. The study will add to knowledge in three ways. First, it will test a model of major educational change at the beginning of the implementation stage in a centralised educational system. The model is based on existing research and combines variables from various studies including some from Western Australia and some from overseas. Second, it will provide new data on teacher receptivity to a major change in Western Australia: the use of <b>Student</b> <b>Outcome</b> Statements. Third, the study will provide advice to educational decision-makers and administrators on how best to implement system-level changes in a centralised education system. The empirical data for the study were collected using a teacher questionnaire including existing and newly developed scales. There were 126 valid questionnaires returned to the researcher from 30 different senior high schools across Western Australia. An analysis of the scales measuring each variable was undertaken using a Rasch measurement model.
