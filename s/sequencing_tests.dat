Midlife HD patients {{have been found}} to have neurocognitive impairment, particularly in areas of executive functioning, but the extent to which this is due to comorbid psychiatric disorders has not been clear. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine executive functioning in geriatric HD patients without any comorbid Axis I disorders (n = 42) compared with a healthy older adult comparison group (n = 25). We hypothesized that older adults with HD would perform significantly worse on measures of executive functioning (Wisconsin Card Sort Task [Psychological Assessment Resources, Lutz, Florida, USA] (Psychological Assessment Resources, 2003) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV digit span and letter-number <b>sequencing</b> <b>tests</b> [Pearson, San Antonio, TX, USA]). Older adults with HD showed significant differences from healthy older controls in multiple aspects of executive functioning. Compared with healthy controls, older adults with HD committed significantly more total, non-perseverative errors and conceptual level responses on the Wisconsin Card Sort Task and had significantly worse performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV digit span and letter-number <b>sequencing</b> <b>tests.</b> Hoarding symptom severity was strongly correlated with executive dysfunction in the HD group. Compared with demographically-matched controls, older adults with HD have dysfunction in several domains of executive functioning including mental control, working memory, inhibition, and set shifting. Executive dysfunction is strongly correlated with hoarding severity and is not because of comorbid psychiatric disorders in HD patients. These results have broad clinical implications suggesting that executive functioning should be assessed and taken into consideration when developing intervention strategies for older adults with HD.

Fifteen of 16 participants passed vocal <b>sequencing</b> <b>tests,</b> and five of eight passed hand-signed tests. Three of eight participants required joint control training for stimuli taught via hand signs.

As networks increase in size and complexity, the frequency of faults increases. At the same time, the tremendous increase in network speed means that the cost per unit time of failures is much greater than in the recent past. Network faults may be difficult to predict or diagnose, and may result in huge costs. Our focus in this paper is on sequential search techniques for fault detection and diagnosis. Thus, it is concerned with the optimal scheduling of monitoring/testing tasks for a single intelligent agent. We seek to obtain rules that lead to schedules exhibiting an "optimal" [...] ...|$|E

In a previous work, a <b>test</b> <b>sequencing</b> method to calculate time-optimal <b>test</b> <b>sequences</b> has been developed. Because complex systems are composed of several subsystems, which are again composed of several modules, there exists a need to hierarchically model <b>test</b> <b>sequencing</b> problems. Such a hierarchical <b>test</b> <b>sequencing</b> problem consists of a high-level model that describes a <b>test</b> <b>sequencing</b> problem at the system level, and one or more low-level models that describe the <b>test</b> <b>sequencing</b> problems at the subsystem or module level.

Thus, it would appear that part of the ability of a competent reader is to recognize the appropriate order of ideas in text, to identify cohesion and coherence in text in order to relate the ideas to each other, and to understand authorial intention with respect to the sequence of ideas. It follows from this that a potentially useful test method that might tap such abilities is to require candidates to inspect text in which the elements are out of order, and to reconstruct the original order. This, it might be supposed, would require candidates to detect the relationship among ideas, to identify cohesive devices and their interrelationships.
