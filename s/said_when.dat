5|$|Most of Tender Mercies {{was filmed}} in Waxahachie and Palmer, two towns in Ellis County in north central Texas. Beresford largely avoided the Victorian {{architecture}} and other picturesque elements of Waxahachie and instead focused on relatively barren locations more characteristic of West Texas. The town {{portrayed in the}} film is never identified by name. Foote <b>said</b> <b>when</b> he wrote the script {{he did not have}} the same isolated and lonely vision for the setting Beresford did, but he felt the atmosphere the director captured served the story well.|$|E
5|$|Recipients {{consider}} the Golden Film {{to be an}} award given to films that are a success. Director Martin Koolhoven <b>said,</b> <b>when</b> Schnitzel Paradise (2005) received the award, {{that he did not}} expect his film to be such a success. Schnitzel Paradise was his first commercially successful film. Fifteen-year-old Sem Veeger, lead actress in the film Keep Off (2006), said she knew that many people had seen the film, but she did not expect it to receive a Golden Film.|$|E
5|$|After the {{standoff}} entered its fourth hour, Valencia {{succeeded in getting}} Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself. Saldívar <b>said</b> <b>when</b> she placed the gun to her own head, Selena {{tried to tell her}} not to kill herself. When Selena opened the door to leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it. She also said the gun went off when Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, ran back to her truck, picked up the revolver, and pointed it at her head again. Saldívar surrendered after more than nine hours. By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away. A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports. Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Quintanilla, Jr. told the press the possible motive was Selena's intention to terminate Saldívar's employment.|$|E

5|$|The Lennons {{were married}} on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool. Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance, as was their manager, Brian Epstein, who was best man; no parents were there. The wedding was farcical, because {{as soon as}} the {{ceremony}} began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a jackhammer which drowned out anything the registrar, Lennon, or Powell <b>said.</b> <b>When</b> the registrar asked for the groom to step forward, Harrison stepped forward instead. With no photographs or flowers the wedding party celebrated afterwards, at Epstein's invitation, in Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square, which was the same restaurant where Lennon's parents, Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon, had celebrated their marriage in 1938. Lennon was 21 years old, and Powell 22. The newlyweds had no honeymoon, as Lennon had to play an engagement at the Riverpark Ballroom in Chester the same night, although they did travel to the Hotel George V in Paris, for a belated honeymoon on 16 September, but were accompanied by Epstein, even though he had not been invited to join them.|$|E

The clashes took the lives of five peoples, including two policemen and three civilians. News outlets reported that police forces and army troops exchange fire, what was denied by the Egyptian armed forces official spokesperson. Over 500 persons were injured only in Port Said that day, with 39 with bullet wounds.|$|E
25|$|Stewart Brand <b>said</b> <b>when</b> {{introducing}} {{the work of}} Philip Tetlock that Brand's partner had given a talk in the 1980s to top Central Intelligence Agency people {{about the future of}} the Soviet Union.

A CIA analyst said that the presentation was fine, but there was no way the Soviet Union was going to break up in his lifetime or his children's lifetime. The analyst's name was Robert Gates.|$|E

25|$|Obesity expert, Dr Boyd Swinburn, Professor of Population Nutrition and Global Health at the University of Auckland, says dirty {{politics}} and {{conflicts of interest}} in government appointments are having a detrimental impact on Public health.

25|$|Mills’ {{philosophy}} always possessed for him strong musical implications. “The {{purpose of}} Music is to reveal to man his innate at-one-ment with a harmonic state of Being”, he <b>said.</b> <b>When</b> three singers (from the vocal group The Free Design) {{asked him for}} help with their voices in 1976, Mills soon found himself re-engaging the world of concertizing. Within a short time, the three singers were joined by seven others, and the a cappella vocal ensemble he called The Star-Scape Singers was formed. These singers were ultimately acclaimed in the United States and abroad as creators of a renaissance in choral art.|$|E
25|$|Hensleigh and Arad said in many {{interviews}} that Jane {{was the first}} and only actor to be asked to play the title role. Arad had previously pursued Jane for other roles in Marvel Studios films. He turned down The Punisher twice, as he did not see himself as a superhero actor. Jane <b>said,</b> <b>when</b> asked the second time to play the Punisher, that he became interested when Arad sent Tim Bradstreet's artwork of the character. After learning more about the Punisher, he accepted. Jane went on to read as many Punisher comics he could find to understand the character, and became a fan of the Punisher in the process. Jane trained for six to seven months with the United States Navy SEALs and gained more than twenty pounds of muscle for the part.|$|E

25|$|Interestingly, Charlton was his {{maternal}} grandmother Marian's maiden name, not {{his mother}} Lilla's. This {{is contrary to}} how 20th century references read and what Heston <b>said.</b> <b>When</b> Heston's maternal grandmother and his true maternal grandfather Charles Baines separated or divorced in the early 1900s, Marian (née Charlton) Baines married William Henry Lawton in 1907. Charlton Heston's mother, Lilla, and her sister May were adopted by their grandfather, and changed their last name to Charlton in order {{to distance themselves from}} their biological father, Mr. Baines. After the Carters divorced in 1933 and Lilla Carter married Chester Heston, Charlton, sister Lilla and brother Alan Carter became Heston although not legally adopted. It was thus as Charlton Heston that he appeared in his first film with younger brother Alan (small role), an adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt (1941).|$|E
25|$|Family {{members also}} do not use their {{standards}} on road vehicles, either privately or during official engagements (when more discreet cars are used, such as Jaguar) or state occasions (when the Liveried cars of the Royal Mews are used), this seems reserved for the Queen only, although when Prince Philip travels alone at state occasions, his standard flies {{from the roof of}} his car, as seen with the funerals of Diana, Princess of Wales (when the Queen Mother also flew her personal standard from her car) and that of the Queen Mother, also, when a visiting Head of State on a state visit uses a car from the Royal Mews, his/her own flag is displayed. That <b>said,</b> <b>when</b> abroad, the standards of members of the family may well be flown: examples include Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince William.|$|E
25|$|On 21 February 2001, {{police arrested}} Field at his flat in Birmingham.

Just before Field was put into his cell for a third night he had been asked to submit DNA samples. Field could not sleep that night and the following day he confessed in detail to the abduction, rape and murder of Tutill.
