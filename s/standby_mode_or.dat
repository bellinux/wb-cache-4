40|$|Increasing {{household}} {{energy consumption}} and increasing primary energy cost urged to improve home energy efficiency. Improved energy management can suggest {{the ways to}} improve home energy efficiency. Various home appliances are the prime cause to the increased power demand. Appliance&# 039;s energy rating information helps to develop awareness and reduce energy consumption. Load shifting can help to reduce overall cost of used energy bill by shifting peak time load to off-peak time. However most of the present appliances remains in <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> (active <b>or</b> passive) for {{a significant part of}} the day, and load shifting cannot reduce the total energy consumption. Therefore investigation is required to identify any possible scopes to improve energy management at home. This paper investigated several home appliances and monitored daily time of use power consumption. It was found that by controlling standby power from a daily home load of 4. 482 kWh, power demand can be reduced 12. 56 % moreover energyrelated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission can be reduced 133. 08 kg/year...|$|R

50|$|SCART {{allows a}} {{connected}} device {{to bring it}} {{in and out of}} <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> <b>or</b> to switch it to the AV channel. A VCR or other playback device will optimally power on when a cassette is inserted, power on the TV (or switch it to video mode) and then start playing immediately if the cassette's write protection tab is absent. When turned off, the VCR will ask the TV to power off, which it will do if it had been powered on by the VCR's request and if it remained in video mode. Only some TVs will do this—most only implement automatic switching to and from the SCART input.|$|E
5000|$|Multiple Sonos {{devices in}} a single {{household}} are connected to each other wirelessly or through a wired ethernet network or a mixture of the two. The Sonos system creates a proprietary AES-encrypted peer-to-peer mesh network, known as SonosNet. This allows for each unit to play any chosen input and if desired share it as synchronized audio {{with one or more}} other chosen zones. A single ZonePlayer or ZoneBridge must be wired to a network for access to LAN and Internet audio sources when using this feature, or when creating a 3.1/5.1 surround setup. [...] SonosNet 2.0 integrates MIMO on 802.11n hardware, providing a more robust connection. Sonos does not implement wake-on-wireless technology, instead requiring that every Sonos player or bridge constantly maintains a wireless connection, even when in <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> <b>or</b> connected by cable. Sonos devices do not have power buttons, and the company claims that each speaker consumes 4-8W in idle/standby.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{develops}} a probabilistic {{model of a}} cold standby system considering the failure of unit in <b>standby</b> <b>mode.</b> Initially the model contains one unit in operation and another identical in cold <b>standby</b> <b>mode.</b> The unit in cold <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> fails after passage of pre specified time and goes under inspection for feasibility check for maintenance or replacement, whereas the operative unit directly goes under repair at its failure. A single service facility available in the system handles the tasks of repair, inspection, maintenance or replacement. The replacement of unit in <b>standby</b> <b>mode,</b> at its failure, takes some time; that follows certain probability distribution.

40|$|A {{system of}} the subject {{invention}} includes a mobile telecommunications switching office (MTSO), several base stations and mobile units. The base stations serve respective sectors or cells to establish radio communications with mobile units in their sectors or cells. The base stations {{are connected to the}} MTSO which performs switching to establish call connections between mobile units and/or between units served by an external network to which the MTSO is connected. The MTSO uses dynamic channel allocation to designate base stations to serve a call connection in active <b>mode</b> and in <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> for a particular channel. Therefore, if communication with the base station serving a call connection in active mode is disrupted by a building, terrain or an equipment failure, for example, the MTSO can set the base station currently in active <b>mode</b> to <b>standby</b> <b>mode,</b> and can set the base station currently in <b>standby</b> <b>mode,</b> to active mode to serve the call connection on the channel. Thus, the use of sectors or cells in active and <b>standby</b> <b>modes,</b> allows for relatively reliable communications through macro-diversity. Also, the ping-pong effect occurs relatively infrequently because the sectors or cells are switched between active and <b>standby</b> <b>modes</b> as a mobile unit moves along a sector or cell boundary, rather than requiring a handoff to another channel as required in conventional systems. Further, through use of dynamic channel allocation, handoffs in the traditional sense are relatively rare in the {{system of the}} subject invention. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R
