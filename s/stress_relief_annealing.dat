The microstructures of the as-welded and stress relief annealed samples were examined by optical microscope and SEM. The properties of the all welded samples were determined by hardness measurement, tension and V notch-impact tests. The high hardness especially in the weld interface resulted in low toughness.

Real and simulated impacts were conducted using spherical projectiles launched at 300 m/s and quasi-static chisel indentation, respectively. A unique test specimen configuration that replicates {{the leading edge of}} a typical fan blade was ballistically shot at 30 ° with 1 mm diameter spheres, while rectangular plates were indented quasi-statically using a 2 mm diameter steel indentor at 0 °. Fatigue strengths were developed for both geometries at 350 Hz. A number of specimens from both configurations were <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> <b>annealed,</b> after impacting and before HCF testing, to remove residual stresses. Attempts were made to correlate the measured damage (macro-/microscopic) to the debit in fatigue strength.

40|$|Advanced {{manufacturing}} approaches, including {{additive manufacturing}} (i. e., “ 3 D printing”) of metallic structures requires a change to qualification strategies. One approach, informed qualification, integrates modeling strategies to make predictions of material characteristics, including {{the prediction of}} tensile properties for given chemistries and microstructures. In this work, constitutive equations are developed and presented that can predict the yield strength of additively manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V subjected {{to one of three}} different heat-treatments: a <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> <b>anneal</b> in the α+β phase field; a hot isostatic press treatment in the α+β phase field; and a β-anneal. The equations are nominally identical, though different strengthening mechanisms are active according to subtle microstructural differences. To achieve an equation that can predict the yield strength of the material, it is also necessary to include an assessment of dramatic reduction in the tensile strength due to texture (i. e., a “knock-down” effect).

Based on the experimental results {{in which the}} creep strain rate is highest for <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> <b>annealed</b> cladding (SRA) and lowest for recrystallized cladding (RXA), the annealing factor was introduced and derived by iterative calculations until the best predictions for all the rods were obtained.

Eight iron-based materials were tested: 3 ledeburitic cast steels, 2 hypereutectoid cast steels, normalized and <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> <b>annealed</b> steel, hardened and tempered steel and nodular mottled cast iron. Design/methodology/approach: The exploitation tests were performed on the hot rolling mills for selected rolled sections, rolling stands and roll passes.

Moreover, the influence of <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> <b>annealing</b> at the temperatures of 730 and 750 oC on microstructure and properties has been investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Microstructure of the cast steel was characterized using optical metallography and transmission electron microscopy.

However, the porosity area increases with increasing joint gap. The hardness is maximum in the fusion zone (FZ) followed by a sharp decrease in the heat affected zone (HAZ) to the base metal (BM). The low temperature annealing process increases the hardness of the fusion zone but the combination of the high temperature solution treatment followed by aging decreases the fusion zone hardness almost to the base metal values. Tensile testing shows that the joint efficiency varies between 95 and 105 %. The porosity and underfill are the two main defects for failure in the FZ and HAZ, respectively. The local mechanical properties determined by digital image correlation (DIC) technique show that the elastic modulus and yield stress are maximum in the FZ and minimum in the HAZ. The lowest plastic strain at fracture is obtained in the FZ...|$|E
40|$|Additive Manufacturing (AM) {{is a new}} {{innovative}} {{technique that}} allows the direct fabrication of complex, individual, delicate and high-strength products, based on their 3 D data. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) {{is one of the}} AM processes that generates metallic components layer by layer using powder-bed technique. The irradiation and consequent melting of metallic powder is realised by the laser source. Employing SLM, especially complex and individual products, such as implants or aerospace parts, are well suited for economic production in small batches. The first important issue in this work was to analyse the fatigue crack growth (FCG) in titanium alloy Ti- 6 - 4 and stainless steel 316 L processed by SLM. As a first step, stress intensity range decreasing tests were performed on SLM samples in their “as-built” condition. The next step was to adopt measures for optimisation of fatigue crack growth performance of SLM parts. For this purpose various heat treatments such as <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> <b>annealing</b> and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) were applied to the CT specimens. Finally, the strong impact of heat treatment on the residual lifetime was demonstrated by numerical fatigue crack growth simulations. For this purpose, the hip joint implant consisting of Ti- 6 - 4 and processed by SLM was taken into account. It was found that residual stresses have a strong influence on the crack growth in Ti- 6 - 4, while the influence of the micro-pores on the threshold values remains low. In contrast the results for 316 L show that its fracturemechanical behaviour is not affected by residual stresses, whereas the microstructural features lead to modification in the da/dN-K-data. The second fundamental aim of this work was to demonstrate the possibilities of the SLM process. For that reason, the individually tailored bicycle crank was optimised regarding its weight and local stresses and finally manufactured using the SLM system. The iterative optimisation procedure was based on static and cyclic loading situations as well as displacements obtained by results from numerical analyse...|$|E
40|$|High cycle fatigue (HCF) {{has been}} of great concern of late {{in light of the}} many HCF gas turbine engine {{failures}} experienced by the U. S. Air Force. Due to the high frequency, failures occur rapidly when components sustain damage from other sources. Low cycle fatigue (LCF) can initiate cracks that produce such damage. This study investigates the HCF threshold of Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V when naturally initiated small surface cracks (2 a = 25 μm– 600 μm) are present. Small surface cracks are initiated in notched specimens using two different LCF loading histories at room temperature and 10 Hz. Direct current potential difference (DCPD) is used to detect crack initiation. Surface crack measurements are made using a scanning electron microscope prior to HCF testing. Heat tinting prior to HCF testing is used to mark the crack front to allow for post fracture crack measurements. HCF thresholds at R = 0. 1 and R = 0. 5 are determined for each specimen using step loading at room temperature and 600 Hz. Additionally, the HCF threshold is measured at R = 0. 1 for specimens with small cracks that have been stress relief annealed to eliminate residual stresses and load history. Long crack thresholds are determined using a similar step loading procedure at R = 0. 1 and R = 0. 5 for specimens which have been precracked using a range of Kmax. Long crack threshold measurements are also determined for specimens which have been precracked using a range of Kmax, but stress relief annealed prior to testing. Comparisons show that HCF threshold measurements, when naturally initiated small cracks are present, are dependent on the load histories that are used to initiate the cracks. Further comparisons show that the measured small crack thresholds follow similar trends for load history effects which occur in the long crack threshold data. Additionally, it is found that thresholds can be measured free of load history effects by using a <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> <b>annealing</b> process after the precracking and prior to the threshold testing. ...|$|E
