However, due to various possible designs of <b>safety</b> <b>guards,</b> information about requirements on their fixation is only provided for isolated cases. In the impact test laboratory of the IWF, a broad series of FE simulations and impact tests has been accomplished in order to provide quantitative values to machine tool guard designers. In addition, a method to validate FE simulation results and to determine their reliability is presented. This allows an integration of FE simulations in the dimensioning process of machine tool guards and significantly reduces required experimental impact tests...|$|R
