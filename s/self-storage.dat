500|$|The {{idea for}} Public Storage was {{conceived}} by Southern California {{real estate developer}} B. Wayne Hughes in the early 1970s. During a trip to Texas, he observed that local real estate developers were doing well creating mini-storage facilities outside of Dallas and Houston; he brought the <b>self-storage</b> concept back with him to California.

500|$|In 2005, Public Storage said in {{a public}} filing {{that there had been}} [...] "an {{increasing}} number of claims and litigation against owners and managers of rental properties relating to moisture infiltration, which can result in mold or other property damage." [...] The company's rental contract says it is not responsible for the storage unit's contents, even if damage is caused by defects in the unit, and The Wall Street Journal reported that there were [...] "surprisingly few remedies" [...] for theft or property damage at <b>self-storage</b> facilities.|$|E
500|$|Investment {{funding was}} used to build mini-storage {{warehouses}} beyond California, targeting the 39 largest US cities. The firm opened <b>self-storage</b> locations {{in close proximity to}} each other, so the [...] sites could share a development office, and [...] justify local television advertising. The firm's growth slowed in the mid-1980s as new competition increased the cost of property and slowed the increase in rental prices to consumers. Poor weather and difficult labor markets outside of California delayed development projects; the company also made poor investments in office parks. Interest in real estate investing also diminished.|$|E
