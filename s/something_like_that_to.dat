500|$|In January 1944, the Soviet Union sent another commission, the Extraordinary State Commission for ascertaining and {{investigating}} crimes {{perpetrated by}} the German-Fascist invaders to the site; the very {{name of the}} commission implied a predestined conclusion. It was headed by Nikolai Burdenko, {{the president of the}} USSR Academy of Medical Sciences (hence the commission is often known as the [...] "Burdenko Commission"), who was appointed by Moscow to investigate the incident. Its members included prominent Soviet figures such as the writer Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, but no foreign personnel were allowed to join the Commission. The Burdenko Commission exhumed the bodies, rejected the 1943 German findings that the Poles were shot by the Soviet army, assigned the guilt to the Nazis, and concluded that all the shootings were done by German occupation forces in autumn of 1941. Despite a lack of evidence, it also blamed the Germans for shooting Russian prisoners of war used as labor to dig the pits. It is uncertain how many members of the commission were misled by the falsified reports and evidence, and how many actually suspected the truth. Cienciala and Materski note that the Commission {{had no choice but to}} issue findings in line with the Merkulov-Kruglov report, and that Burdenko himself most likely was aware of the cover-up. He reportedly admitted <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> friends and family shortly before his death in 1946. The Burdenko commission's conclusions would be consistently cited by Soviet sources until the official admission of guilt by the Soviet government on 13 April 1990.|$|E
500|$|Director Radha Mohan {{expressed}} a desire to remake the film but decided against it: [...] "If there is one film I want to remake, [...] will be the one, but I know I will not, because I believe classics should be left alone." [...] Director and choreographer Prabhu Deva ranked Server Sundaram among his favourite films. A restaurant named [...] "Hotel Server Sundaram" [...] is located in the Thuraipakkam area of Chennai. In December 2014, G. Babu Jayakumar of The New Indian Express included the film in his list of Balachander's noted films. Clips from Server Sundaram were screened along with clips from other films such as Iru Kodugal (1969), Arangetram (1973), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), Avargal (1977) and Azhagan (1991) at a function held in Balachander's honour at Tiruchirappalli in January 2015, a month after his death. Server Sundaram is also used as the title of an 2017 film starring Santhanam and Nagesh's grandson Bijesh, with its producer Selva having bought the title rights from AVM Productions. On why that title was chosen, Selva said, [...] "Santhanam plays a chef in the film and we felt that Server Sundaram, in which Nagesh played the role of a server, would be apt for this film, too. It is amazing how well the title suited the concept of our film, which is why we went right ahead with our decision." [...] S. Jegathiswaran, writing for Daily News Sri Lanka, noted, [...] "In [...] Sundaram, [...] showed that after having gained the social status one shouldn't forget one's past." [...] Actor Vikram, who became popularly known by the moniker [...] "Chiyaan" [...] after the release of Sethu in 1999, stated in August 2016, [...] "After Nagesh sir [...] becomes something else, he still holds his server uniform close to his heart as a memento. Chiyaan is <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> come out, so people can see I {{do more than just}} hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{anonymous}} interview, the jury foreman stated, [...] "When I {{had to sign}} off on the verdict, the sheet that was given to me—there was just a feeling of disgust that came over me knowing that my signature and [...] signature were {{going to be on the}} same sheet," [...] but that [...] "there was a suspicion of [...] " [...] that played a part in the jury's deliberations. The foreman stated his work experience enabled him to read people and that George Anthony [...] "had a very selective memory" [...] which stayed with the jurors, emphasizing that the jury was frustrated by the motive, cause of death, and George Anthony. [...] "That a mother would want to do <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> her child just because she wanted to go out and party," [...] he said. [...] "We felt that the motive that the state provided was, in our eyes, was just kind of weak." [...] Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and the jury did not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10–2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement.|$|E
2500|$|In the Preliminary Final against Sydney FC, the Phoenix lost 4–2 in {{controversial}} circumstances. After {{being locked}} at 1–1 through goals from Chris Payne for Sydney and Andrew Durante for Wellington, Payne apparently missed a header and deflected {{the ball into}} the goal off his hand. Andrew Durante, who was marking Payne went straight over to the linesman, but the goal stood. [...] "I went straight to the linesman. I knew 100 per cent it was handball. I spoke to the ref at halftime about it and he said it wasn't deliberate. It's pretty funny that one. Such a big game and such a big occasion, for <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> change the game is very disappointing." [...] Sydney FC strikers Alex Brosque and Mark Bridge both scored break-away goals as Phoenix pushed forward. Eugene Dadi then added a late consolation goal. Phoenix striker Chris Greenacre said that it changed the dynamics of the game. [...] "It just rips the heart out of you. We got back in the game with a good goal and that takes it away from you. It wasn't to be. I think we were right back in it. They played some good football but I thought we had withstood it OK. If we went into halftime [...] we were really confident we could get something out of it." [...] Coach Ricki Herbert echoed those statements. The loss brought the end to the Phoenix's season, meaning that Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC would compete in the Grand Final.|$|E

6000|$|He was a {{peculiar}} and rather battered looking individual, apparently over {{forty years of}} age, and yet bearing upon him that unmistakable stamp of dignity and self-respect which, {{if it does not}} exclusively belong to, {{is still one of the}} distinguishing attributes of the English gentleman. In face he was ugly, no other word can express it. Here were not the long mustachios, the almond eyes, the aristocratic air of the Colonel of fiction--for our dreamer was a Colonel.

One good feature, however, he did possess, a mouth of such sweetness and beauty that set, as it was, above a very square and manly-looking chin, it had the air of being ludicrously out of place.

With all the newspaper men there too! You probably saw about it in the papers. It made a great story for them. Well, that killed the whole thing. The public had never been any too sure that this fellow Bugs Butler had a chance of putting up a scrap with the champion that would be worth paying to see; and, when they read that he couldn't even stop his sparring-partners slamming him all around the place they simply decided to stay away. Poor old Fill! It was a finisher for him.
