Adams approached the King, telling him that he felt greatly honored by his appointment, and promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality [...] "between People who, tho <b>Seperated</b> by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood." [...] After hearing this, King George, promised to [...] "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States." [...] He added that [...] "while he had been the last to consent" [...] to American independence, he wished Adams to know that he had always done what he thought right and proper. Towards the end of the interview, the King said, which to Adams appeared very sudden, [...] "There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France." [...] Adams replied, [...] "That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country." [...] To this King George responded, [...] "An honest Man will never have any other." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{order to}} this, {{you are to}} understand, That the Southern Part of the Island was the most {{remarkable}} of any, as to the Policy of their Government, and the Character of the People; and excepting Englishmen and Polanders, there is not such another Nation in the World: Here they reckoned about Fifty three several Sects, Divisions, and espoused Opinions in Religion, upon most of the Heads whereof the People actually <b>seperated</b> from one another; such as, (1.) Churchmen, and among them High Church, Low Church, Non Jurors, Prelatists, Socinians, Arians, Arminians, Deists, Atheists, Immoralists, Flyers, Soul-Sleepers, Prophets, &c. (2.) Presbyterians, and under that head all kind of Dissenters, Cameronians, Independants, Anabaptists, Baptists, Seventh-Day-Men, Sabatarians, Donatists, Gnosticks, Antiprelatists, Muggletonians, and various undistinguishable Quakers both wet and dry, Sweet Singers, Family of Love, Christian Jews, Jewish Christians, and the like. In the State, the Divisions were no less Fatal, or the variety greater in Proportion, these we may, as I said before, call by the Names which the like Factions are distinguish'd by here; such as Tory, Whig, Low Church, Hot Whig, Old Whig, Modern Whig, High Flyer, High Church, High Tory, a Gillicranky, a Tantivy, Tackers, Non Jurors, Assassinators, Junto's, Squadroni, Court, Country, Revolutionists, Non Resisters, Passive Obedience Men, and the like.|$|E
60|$|My {{convalescence}} rapidly advanced, {{yet this}} was the thought that haunted me, and I was for ever forming plans how I might hereafter contrive to escape the tortures that were prepared for me when I should mix in society, and to find that solitude which alone could suit one whom an untold grief <b>seperated</b> from her fellow creatures. Who can be more solitary even in a crowd than one whose history and the never ending feelings and remembrances arising from it is [sic] known to no living soul. There was too deep a horror in my tale for confidence; I was on earth the sole depository of my own secret. I might tell it to the winds and to the desart heaths but I must never among my fellow creatures, either by word or look give allowance to the smallest conjecture of the dread reality: I must shrink before the eye of man lest he should read my father's guilt in my glazed eyes: I must be silent lest my faltering voice should betray unimagined horrors. Over the deep grave of my secret I must heap an impenetrable heap of false smiles and words: cunning frauds, treacherous laughter and a mixture of all light deceits would form a mist to blind others and be as the poisonous simoon to me.[44] I, the offspring of love, the child of the woods, the nursling of Nature's bright self was to submit to this? I dared not.|$|E
40|$|Cutting a polytope is a {{very natural}} way to produce new classes of {{interesting}} polytopes. Moreover, {{it has been very}} enlightening to explore which algebraic and combinatorial properties of the orignial polytope are hereditary to its subpolytopes obtained by a cut. In this work, we put our attention to all the <b>seperating</b> hyperplanes for some given polytope (integral and convex) and study the existence and classification of such hyperplanes. We prove the exitence of <b>seperating</b> hyperplanes for the order and chain polytopes for any finite posets that are not a single chain; prove there are no such hyperplanes for any Birkhoff polytopes. Moreover, we give a complete <b>seperating</b> hyperplane classification for the unit cube and its subpolytopes obtained by one cut, together with some partial classification results for order and chain polytopes...|$|R

Between November and February, the only access to Glenelg is by road over the 339 m Mam Ratagan (known loosely as [...] "the Bealach" [...] (pass)) from Shiel Bridge {{on the main road}} from Inverness to Skye. From the summit of Mam Ratagan the road runs gently into Glenelg down Glen More (Gleann Mhòr, [...] "big valley"), which is otherwise isolated from Loch Duich by Beinn a Chuirn, and from Loch Alsh by Glas Beinn. There is a second valley, approximately parallel to Glen More and to the south known as Glen Beag (Gleann Beag, [...] "small valley"), <b>seperated</b> from Glen More by Beinn a Chaonich. On reaching the coast, the road continues southwards, following the shore of Loch Hourn, where it abruptly terminates at Arnisdale; Loch Hourn is <b>seperated</b> from Glen Beag by Beinn a'Chapuil and Beinn Sgritheall.|$|E

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{description of}} the mean flow, the rms values, and spectral distributions of the <b>seperated</b> boundary layer fluctuating velocities {{plays an important role}} in predicting trailing edge far field noise. A possible method for describing the mean and rms quantities based on a modification of Coles' law of the wake and Prandtl's mixing length theory is presented. The model is validated against related experiments from literature and new measurements conducted at DLR Braunschweig. Additionally, a comparison between the von Kármán spectrum for isotropic turbulence and the measured spectra inside the <b>seperated</b> boundary layer is given. The results strongly suggest that the spectra as well as the mean and rms values of the <b>seperated</b> flow can be modeled with the proposed approaches...|$|E
