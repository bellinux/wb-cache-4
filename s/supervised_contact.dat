40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a recent {{research}} project which explored children’s understandings and experiences of <b>supervised</b> <b>contact</b> and of {{their participation in the}} decision making processes that surround <b>supervised</b> <b>contact.</b> The paper begins with an overview of the study and a summary of the findings in relation to the key research questions: What are children’s experiences of having a say? What are children’s views and understandings of having a say? Did children want a say in the decision for them to have <b>supervised</b> <b>contact?</b> How did having (or not having) a say feel? The discussion then focuses on a key finding from the study that suggests children’s understandings of participation are often expressed in dialogical terms. In other words, the children in this study perceived participation as taking place in and through particular forms of dialogue or conversation that provides for them, and for what they have to say, to be acknowledged, recognised and respected. With these findings in mind, we suggest that when we talk about ‘children’s participation’ in the difficult and complex context of <b>supervised</b> <b>contact,</b> we need to focus more closely on the ways in which we invite, engage and interpret dialogue and conversations with children. The paper concludes by exploring some of the implications for both researchers and practitioners when we assign conversation to {{a central role in the}} conceptualisation and practice of participation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Practice fields provide {{authentic}} {{learning experiences}} where users come to “know about problems and practices ” faced in real professional practice and develop {{knowledge and skills}} to transfer to professional roles. Evaluating learning outcomes and transfer {{of knowledge and skills}} from training to use is complex. The evaluation needs to identify the contexts and implementation strategies that are effective for producing learning as well as facilitating their transfer to professional practice in real environments. This presentation describes an evaluation model based on multiple research studies {{that can be used for}} assessing learning outcomes and transfer from practice field systems involving interactive cases, computer-mediated discussions, and electronic performance support tools. In K- 12 education, educators must learn to use problem-solving approaches for working with children with behavioral problems and/or disorders. By learning and reflecting on these skills during the pre-professional training period, future educators are more likely to possess the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary for teaching these children. These skills are difficult to learn and practice without <b>supervised</b> direct <b>contact</b> with children, parents, teachers, and other care providers. Case-based learning approaches delivered through practice fields can provide a bridge between learning as a student and professional practice. Practice fields provid...|$|R
40|$|Skin-to-skin contact {{after birth}} is {{propagated}} to facilitate breast-feeding and mother-child bonding. We describe two term infants with sudden unexpected postnatal collapse (SUPC) during skin-to-skin contact.

After stimulation, both infants recovered completely. No specific potential cause, other than the position, could be found. These cases illustrate that skin-to-skin contact after birth is not without risk. In available literature, risk factors for SUPC include primiparity and infant orientation such as prone and lateral positions. These positions are also risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). To improve safety, a primipara should be <b>supervised</b> during skin-to-skin <b>contact</b> and not be left alone in the first hours after delivery; the infant should be guaranteed a free airway, especially when the mother has a high BMI...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Distance {{learning}} (e-learning) {{can facilitate}} access to training. Yet few public health E-learning experiments have been reported; institutes {{in developing countries}} experience difficulties in establishing on-line curricula, while developed countries struggle with adapting existing curricula to realities on the ground. In 2005, two schools of public health, one in France and one in Benin, began collaborating through contact sessions organised for Nancy University distance-learning students. This experience {{gave rise to a}} partnership aimed at developing training materials for e-Learning for African students. The distance-learning public health course at Nancy teaches public health professionals through a module entitled "Health and Development. " The module is specifically tailored for professionals from developing countries. To promote student-teacher exchanges, clarify content and <b>supervise</b> dissertations, <b>contact</b> sessions are organized in centres proximate and accessible to African students. The Benin Institute's main feature is residential team learning; distance-learning courses are currently being prepared. Outcome: The two collaborating institutions have developed a joint distance-learning module geared toward developing countries. The collaboration provides for the development, diffusion, and joint delivery of teaching modules featuring issues that are familiar to African staff, gives the French Institute credibility in assessing research work produced, and enables modules on specific African issues and approaches to be put online. Lessons learned: While E-learning is a viable educational option for public health professionals, periodic contact can be advantageous. Our analysis showed that the benefit of the collaboration between the two institutions is mutual; the French Institute extends its geographical, cultural and contextual reach and expands its pool of teaching staff. The Benin Institute benefits from the technical partnership and expertise, which allow it to offer distance learning for Africa-specific contexts and applications...|$|R

40|$|Introduction There is {{currently}} little research evidence {{on how to}} manage contact in a child protection context, and for which children, in what circumstances it is beneficial. Methods This study uses data from a larger study of mothers in pharmacological treatment for opioid dependence in Sydney, Australia. Mothers who {{had at least one}} child in out-of-home care were interviewed about their characteristics, contact and other care arrangements. Results Women (n = 56) were generally disadvantaged and had 1. 8 children in care on average. Two-thirds (n = 66) of their 99 children were in kinship care and one-third in foster care (n = 33). The majority of the children (84 %) had some contact with their mother, most of which was supervised, in some cases for many years. Bivariate analyses showed that contact was significantly more likely to be supervised if the children were in foster care, the mother was on psychiatric medication and/or had used cannabis more frequently in the past month. Discussion This study {{is one of the largest}} studies to examine the issue of contact amongst mothers with a substance-using history. We found that <b>supervised</b> <b>contact</b> was common in these families and highlight the need for better support for contact. The need for better research evidence on the impacts of current models of <b>supervised</b> <b>contact</b> is also identified, particularly given the high monetary cost to the child protection system...|$|E
40|$|Child {{contact with}} {{non-resident}} parents {{has become a}} key issue in family law and policy. Within the substantial and {{growing body of research}} into how legal systems deal with child contact disputes, there is little empirical data on the use courts make of orders for supervised, supported or indirect contact. This article presents empirical research findings focusing on the use of these sorts of contact orders in England and Wales. The research involved an examination of 343 court records, 60 follow-up interviews with parents and ten interviews with judges responsible for making the orders. Use of orders for <b>supervised</b> or supported <b>contact</b> was relatively common as a short-term measure, while orders for indirect contact were made only as a matter of last resort. On the basis of the post-court developments in contact within the families in the sample and the parents' largely negative experiences of the court system, we conclude that future policy developments ought to focus on finding alternatives to court, which would aim to provide assistance rather than adjudication to the families in dispute...|$|R
5000|$|To {{become a}} {{clinical}} neuropsychologist in Canada requires {{the completion of}} a 4-year honours degree in psychology and a 4-year doctoral degree in clinical neuropsychology. Often a 2-year master's degree is required before commencing the doctoral degree. The doctoral degree involves coursework and practical experience (practicum and internship). Practicum is between 600 and 1,000 hours of practical application of skills acquired in the program. At least 300 hours must be <b>supervised,</b> face-to-face client <b>contact.</b> The practicum is intended to prepare students for the internship/residency. Internships/residencies are a year long experience in which the student functions as a neuropsychologist, under supervision. Currently, there are 3 CPA-accredited Clinical Neuropsychology internships/residencies in Canada, although other unaccredited ones exist. Prior to commencing the internship students must have completed all doctoral coursework, received approval for their thesis proposal (if not completed the thesis) and the 600 hours of practicum. Clinical neuropsychology courses are offered at the following Canadian universities:Université de Montréal, Simon Fraser University, University of Victoria, York University [...] and University of Windsor.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Communication {{training}} {{builds on}} the assumption that understanding of the concepts related to professional communication facilitates the training. We know little about whether students' knowledge of clinical communication skills is affected by their attendance of communication training courses, or to what degree other elements of the clinical training or curriculum design also play a role. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine which elements of the curriculum influence acquisition of knowledge regarding clinical communication skills by medical students. Methods The study design was a cross-sectional survey performed in the four Norwegian medical schools with different curricula, spring 2003. A self-administered questionnaire regarding knowledge of communication skills (an abridged version of van Dalen's paper-and-pencil test) was sent to all students attending the four medical schools. A total of 1801 (59 %) students responded with complete questionnaires. Results At the end of the 1 st year of study, the score on the knowledge test was higher in students at the two schools running communication courses and providing early patient contact (mean 81 %) than in the other two medical schools (mean 69 – 75 %, P ≤ 0. 001), with students studying a traditional curriculum scoring the lowest. Their scores increased sharply towards the end of the 3 rd year, during which they had been subjected to extensive patient contact and had participated in an intensive communication course (77 % vs. 72 % the previous year, P ≤ 0. 01). All students scored generally lower in academic years in which there was no communication training. However, at the end of the final year the difference between the schools was only 5 % (81 % vs. 86 %, P ≤ 0. 001). Conclusion The acquisition of knowledge regarding communication skills by medical students may be optimised when the training is given together with extensive <b>supervised</b> patient <b>contact,</b> especially if this teaching takes place in the initial years of the curriculum. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} lived {{experience}} of contact supervisors in the contact encounter. Contact supervisors and managers from five London local authorities participated in ten semi-structured interviews. Data were thematically and discursively analysed {{paying attention to}} issues of performativity of text and disciplinary power. A psychoanalytically informed analysis was also applied to add further complexity to the psychosocial investigation of the ‘warp and weft’ of the psychological and the social in contact supervision. Two core themes were identified. The Cinderella Service core theme postulated {{that the role of}} the contact supervisor is necessarily fractured and conflicted, as manifested in mutually enforcing and destabilising subject positions active in storylines of Rags to Riches and Doing the Dirty Work. Supervisors maintained panoptic systems of enclosed discourses, and concurrently resisted these through taking up alternative relational positions with regards to the triad of social care system/supervisor/family. The themes of rivalry and exclusion were voiced through the metaphor of early oedipal psychic functioning which enabled an understanding of the dynamics of unresolved mourning and loss {{at the heart of the}} contact encounter. The Gut Feelings/Fine Lines core theme presented the role of contact supervisor as a meeting point for competing moral dilemmas that are created and maintained through shifting relational experiences. These were articulated through the storylines Here-for-a-reason, Same-as-us and Parent-as-child that positioned and counter positioned supervisors in relation to families. The first order positioning of blame drew on neoliberal discourses of parenting, class and gender. The moral dilemmas faced by contact supervisors were formulated as being generated in part by a struggle to integrate dynamics of ambivalence. In discussion of the findings, contact was characterised by degrees of paralysis, active in structural, moral and emotional interrelated dimensions. This aspect of <b>supervised</b> <b>contact</b> enabled an exploration of the present challenges in contact and the implications of this research project on <b>supervised</b> <b>contact</b> design and practice. It is argued that because of the growth of contact supervision resulting from the increase in children in care it is urgent that this under-researched area should be studied and understood as a distinctive field of practice. This study offers a contribution of lived experience, psychosocially theorised to meet the lag between policy and practice. It stands as a call to focus on the contact encounter as the site for policy development derived from experience, respectful intervention for families rooted in relationships with supervisors and a validation and recognition of delicate and dedicated contact work...|$|E
40|$|Ten years ago, in {{the case}} of M and M, the High Court of Australia handed down what is still the {{definitive}} judgment in the area of child sexual abuse allegations in family court proceedings. The Court's approach in that case gave much cause for hope that the protection of children would be the major focus of parenting disputes where such allegations had been made. The High Court held, inter alia, that: 1. it was not the family court's role {{to determine whether or not}} child sexual abuse had actually occurred (as would be the case in a criminal trial); however, 2. a court was not to grant custody or contact to a parent if that custody or contact would expose the child to an unacceptable risk of sexual abuse. The Full Family Court of Australia later added that if there is a positive finding of abuse, only in the most extraordinary cases would contact with the perpetrator of the abuse not be seen as exposing the child to an unacceptable risk of abuse. It was also held that if there is a finding of an unacceptable risk of abuse occurring, <b>supervised</b> <b>contact</b> may still provide an unacceptable risk of disturbance, whether physical, emotional or psychological, to a child who is compulsorily brought into contact with a parent who has sexually abused him or her or, who the child believes to have sexually abused him or her, and the court has the obligation to protect children from such harm...|$|E
40|$|Background: When {{children}} {{are unable to}} safely live {{at home with their}} parents, contact between these children and their parents is considered, in most cases, important for maintaining children’s sense of identity and relationships with their parents. However, the research evidence on contact is weak and provides little guidance on how to manage contact and when it is beneficial or potentially harmful. The evidence in relation to contact interventions with parents and their children who are to remain in long-term care is the most limited. A small number of studies have been identified where interventions which were therapeutic, child-focused and with clear goals, particularly aimed at preparing and supporting parents, showed some promising results. This trial aims to build on the existing evidence by trialling an enhanced model of contact in multiple sites in Australia. Methods/Design: This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial of an enhanced contact intervention with children in long-term care who are having <b>supervised</b> <b>contact</b> with their parents. Intervention sites will implement the kContact intervention that increases the preparation and support provided to parents in relation to contact. Baseline and follow-up interviews are being conducted with parents, carers and agency workers at intervention and control sites. Follow-ups interviews will assess whether there has been an increase in children’s emotional safety and a reduction in distress in response to contact visits with their parents (the primary outcome variable as measured using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire), improved relationships between children and their parents, improved parental ability to support contact, and fewer contact visits cancelled. Discussion: By increasing the evidence base in this area, the study aims to better guide the management and supervision of contact visits in the out-of-home care context and improve outcomes for the children and their families...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effects of repetitive hopping training on muscle activation profiles and fascicle–tendon interaction in the elderly. Methods: 20 physically active elderly men were randomly assigned for training (TG) and control groups (CG). TG performed <b>supervised</b> bilateral short <b>contact</b> hopping training with progressively increasing training volume. Measurements were performed before the training period (BEF) as well as after 2  weeks (2  W) and 11  weeks (11  W) of training. During measurements, the gastrocnemius medialis–muscle (GaM) fascicle and its outer Achilles tendon length changes during hopping were examined by ultrasonography together with electromyographic (EMG) activities of calf muscles, kinematics, and kinetics. Results: At 2  W, the ankle joint stiffness was increased by 21. 0  ±  19. 3  % and contact time decreased by 9. 4  ±  7. 8  % in TG. Thereafter, from 2 – 11  W the jumping height increased 56. 2  ±  18. 1  % in TG. Simultaneously, tendon forces increased 24. 3  ±  19. 0  % but tendon stiffness did not change. GaM fascicles shifted to shorter operating lengths after training without any changes in their length modifications during the contact phase of hopping. Normalized EMG amplitudes during hopping did not change with training. Conclusions: The present study shows that 11  W of hopping training improves the performance of physically active elderly men. This improvement is achieved with shorter GaM operating lengths and, therefore, increased fascicle stiffness and improved tendon utilization after training. Based on these results, hopping training could be recommended for healthy fit elderly to retain and improve rapid force production capacity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: Internship in {{clinical}} neuropsychology {{is an essential}} part of specialty training. This paper reports a survey of the applicant evaluation and selection criteria currently used at clinical neuropsychology internships. Method: Training sites were identified from listings published by INS, AITCN, APA Division 40, and APPIC. Internship information was reviewed for concordance with the Houston Conference and INS/APA Division 40 guidelines. Utilizing these criteria, 103 internships that offered a minimum of 50 % of training devoted to clinical neuropsychology were identified. <b>Supervising</b> neuropsychologists were <b>contacted</b> and asked to complete a 10 -item survey of candidate selection criteria used in a prior similar study. Results: 72. 8 % of sites (n = 75) responded to the survey. Clinical experience in neuropsychological assessment, specialization in neuropsychology during graduate school, the interpersonal skills of the applicant during the interview, and letters of recommendation from clinical neuropsychologists were reported as the most salient selection criteria. Applicants who had completed graduate school curricula that provided specialty education in neuropsychology, with clinical neuropsychologist faculty and supervisors, were preferred. Internship supervisors valued prior practicum experience with neurological cases at university affiliated or V. A. medical centers, flexible assessment approaches, and supervision by neuropsychologists. Research experience was also viewed important by most internship sites. Conclusions: Results indicate continued endorsement of the vertically integrated model of education and training outlined by the Houston Conference and INS/APA Division 40 guidelines for the didactic and experiential components of specialization {{in clinical}} neuropsychology. The number of neuropsychology internship sites has more than doubled during the past 10 years...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study {{was of the}} making and administration of Divorce Court Supervision Orders. Although established in England and Wales in 1958, {{there has been no}} detailed examination of supervision in domestic proceedings. In the 1979 period, when the population was obtained, 6, 935 Divorce Court Supervision Orders were made. This figure has reduced to approximately 5, 000 in 1985, with a total of 26, 50 C) ongoing orders. The population consisted of 121 children in 62 family units. Supervision could be undertaken by both probation officers or social workers. A review was undertaken of the original intentions of Divorce Court Supervision Orders as conceived by the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce 1951 - 55, and any subsequent amendments by legislation. Particular emphasis is also given to changing aspects of family law which might affect provision for children the history of social work to children in divorce proceedings was also examined. A detailed analysis was undertaken of descriptive material, on the place of children in divorce proceedings. This included research studies on the effects of divorce on children and any changes in the provision of services to parents and their children at the time of divorce proceedings. A full explanation is given of concepts such as conciliation. The original theoretical framework, placed the study of Divorce Court Supervision orders, in the wider context of the social policy of divorce proceedings. Reference is made to principles of family law and the possible relevance of a Juvenile Justice framework to the Divorce Court. In addition, Weber's concept of legitimacy was applied to the examination of Divorce Court Supervision Orders. The original research design, indicated the specific purposes of the research, which relate directly to the principles of a juvenile justice system. Details were given of the interview procedure, experience survey, identification of the validity and reliability considerations and the tests to be applied. The findings of the research are outlined in two chapters. They concentrate {{on the history of the}} families concerned, the nature of the divorce process and the details of Welfare Report recommendations. Due to the absence of any study of the process of supervision, as opposed to limited studies on the content of Divorce Court Welfare Reports, one chapter describes in some depth, the process of supervision. The analysis uses a combination of statistical tests and case examples. The use of case examples can illustrate most effectively the nature of the supervision provided. A section of the final empirical chapter addresses validity questions, by examination of what organisations a <b>supervising</b> officer had <b>contact</b> with during their involvement with a family, and the degree of continued jurisdiction of the Divorce Court over the supervision undertaken. A review of the main findings asks fundamental questions about the benevolence or control provided in domestic supervision. The final chapter places the present study, in the changing context of social work with children and their parents, involved in divorce proceedings. Child protectionism was identified as a fundamental principle, in spite of the last thirty years of reforms in family law. In addition, the final chapter questions the desirability of continued confusion over better services to divorcing parents and their children and child-protectionist based interventions by social work agencies. Parallels are drawn between the present study and other aspects of family law involving social work agencies. Throughout the {{research study}}, it was emphasised that the present research is exploratory and where appropriate, future areas of appropriate research were indicated...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea that}} {{children}} should be heard and their views respected in decision-making has become an important principle of family law in recent years. No longer considered objects of concern, children are now understood as entitled to ‘have a say’ in the decision making that determines post separation residence and contact arrangements. At the same time, though, concerns are being voiced that the rhetoric of children’s participation does not readily translate into practice in the complex reality of family law settings. Significantly, children themselves report that they are unheard in family law decision-making processes and their views are not taken seriously. This study explores the ambiguous and contested nature of children’s participation. It draws on the narratives of thirteen children interviewed {{in relation to their}} views and experiences of having a say in family law decision making, specifically within the context of <b>supervised</b> <b>contact.</b> Utilising a critical hermeneutic approach, the findings suggest a number of important and inextricable links between children’s participation, their recognition, {{and the ways in which}} adults engage in and interpret dialogue with children. The children’s narratives further reveal the complex power practices at work which act to facilitate as well as to resist and prevent the dialogue which is integral to the recognition of children. The study argues that children’s participation demands ongoing scrutiny in terms of its enactment in family law processes. Such scrutiny must extend to the social and political power practices that enable, constrain and/or silence the dialogue that supports and facilitates children’s participation in family law decision-making. The thesis concludes by exploring some of the implications for researchers and practitioners when dialogue and recognition are assigned a central role in the conceptualisation and practice of participation...|$|E
