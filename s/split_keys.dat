5000|$|There {{have been}} {{variations}} {{in the design of}} the keyboard to address technical and musical issues. The earliest designs of keyboards were based heavily on the notes used in Gregorian chant (the seven diatonic notes plus B-flat) and as such would often include B and B both as diatonic [...] "white notes," [...] with the B at the leftmost side of the keyboard and the B at the rightmost. Thus, an octave would have eight [...] "white keys" [...] and only four [...] "black keys." [...] The emphasis on these eight notes would continue for a few centuries after the [...] "seven and five" [...] system was adopted, in the form of the short octave: the eight aforementioned notes were arranged at the leftmost side of the keyboard, compressed in the keys between E and C (at the time, accidentals that low were very uncommon and thus not needed). During the sixteenth century, when instruments were often tuned in meantone temperament, some harpsichords were constructed with the G and E keys split into two. One portion of the G key operated a string tuned to G and the other operated a string tuned to A, similarly one portion of the E key operated a string tuned to E, the other portion operating a string tuned to D. This type of keyboard layout, known as the enharmonic keyboard, extended the flexibility of the harpsichord, enabling composers to write keyboard music calling for harmonies containing the so-called wolf fifth (G-sharp to E-flat), but without producing aural discomfort in the listeners (see: Split sharp). The [...] "broken octave," [...] a variation of the aforementioned short octave, similarly used <b>split</b> <b>keys</b> to add accidentals left out of the short octave. Other examples of variations in keyboard design include the Jankó keyboard and the chromatic keyboard systems on the chromatic button accordion and bandoneón.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout the Renaissance and Enlightenment, theorists {{as varied}} as Nicola Vicentino, Francisco de Salinas, Fabio Colonna, Marin Mersenne, Constantijn Huygens, and Isaac Newton {{advocated}} the use of meantone tunings that were extended beyond the keyboard's twelve notes, and hence {{have come to be}} called [...] "extended" [...] meantone tunings. These efforts required a concomitant extension of keyboard instruments to offer means of controlling more than 12 notes per octave, including Vincento's Archicembalo (shown in Figure 3), Mersenne's 19-ET harpsichord, Colonna's 31-ET sambuca, and Huygens' 31-ET harpsichord.

40|$|Binary search {{trees are}} old hat, aren't they? Search trees are {{routinely}} covered in introductory computer science classes {{and they are}} widely used in functional programming courses to illustrate the benefits of algebraic data types and pattern matching. And indeed, the operation of insertion enjoys a succinct and elegant functional formulation. Alas, both succinctness and elegance are lost {{when it comes to}} implementing the dual operation of deletion. Why this discrepancy? The algorithmic explanation is that insertion always takes place at an external node, that is, at a leaf whereas deletion always takes place at an internal node and that manipulating internal nodes is notoriously more difficult than manipulating external nodes. Our own stab at explaining this phenomenon is algebraic or, if you like, linguistic. Arguably, the data type Tree with its two constructors, Leaf and Node, does not constitute a particularly elegant algebra. If we use binary search trees for representing sets, then Leaf denotes the empty set ∅ and Node l a r denotes the set s ∪ a ∪ t where s and t are the denotations of l and r, respectively. One might reasonably advance that Node mingles two abstract operations, namely, forming a singleton set `-' and taking the disjoint union `∪' of two sets, and that it is preferable to consider these two operations separately. Of course, there is a good reason for using a ternary constructor: the second argument of Node, the <b>split</b> <b>key,</b> is vital for steering the binary search. Thus, as a replacement for the tree constructors the algebra ∅, -, `∪' is inadequate; we additionally need a substitute for the <b>split</b> <b>key.</b> Now, a search tree satisfies the invariant that for each node the <b>split</b> <b>key</b> is greater than the elements in the left subtree (and smaller than the ones in the right subtree). This suggests to augment the algebra with an observer function max (or min, equivalently) that determines the maximum (or the minimum) element of a set. We will see that all standard operations on search trees can be conveniently expressed using this extended algebra. This does not mean, however, that we abandon binary search trees altogether. Rather, we shall use the algebra as an interface to the concrete representation of this data structure. This is the point of the pearl: even concrete data types may benefit from data structural abstraction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Recent work in {{defending}} against pollution attacks for intra-flow network coding systems proposed a null spaces based algebraic approach {{which has a}} smaller computation cost than previous pollution defenses. The approach requires the source to distribute keys periodically, {{but in order to}} scale involves forwarder nodes in the creation of new keys and their distribution. As a result the key distribution is secure only in specific network topologies such as those created by large-scale peer to peer systems, and is not secure in wireless networks where such topologies do not exist. We propose <b>Split</b> Null <b>Keys,</b> which <b>splits</b> the <b>keys</b> such that {{only a small portion of}} the key is updated periodically. The small updates allow for a scalable key distribution scheme that does not involve forwarder nodes in creating keys and thus does not rely its security on constraints imposed on the network topology. We prove that our scheme is secure despite <b>splitting</b> the <b>key</b> and we show that when compared with existing defenses our scheme imposes lower communication and computation overhead, is resilient to colluding adversaries, and does not require time synchronization.
