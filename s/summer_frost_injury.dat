Two approaches {{were used to}} assess hardiness: the electrolyte-leakage method based on artificial freezing, and meas-urements of chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. The <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> index at- 20 °C differed between prove-nances, with a significant provenance-by-plot interaction. In material from the lower-altitude Vel’ký Lom trial plot, the high-elevation TANAP provenance exhibited much lower <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> than the middle-elevation Habovka and low-elevation Beòuš provenances. In material from the high-altitude Mútne-Zákamenné trial plot, all three tested provenances showed approximately the same degree of <b>frost</b> <b>injury.</b> At- 80 °C no differences between prove-nances were observed, and the trees growing at the high-elevation site exhibited lower average <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> than the trees at Vel’ký Lom.

40|$|Several {{different}} silvicultural treatments {{were studied}} in two experiments. In the first, mechanical scarification, slash removal, vegetation control, clear-cut age and seedling types were investigated {{with respect to}} <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seedlings. Frost damage was also related to near-ground minimum temperature. In the other experiment, the effects of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)) shelterwood density gradients, ranging from dense, uncut forest to complete clear-cuttings, were analysed. Near-ground temperature and radiation were monitored close to planted Norway spruce cuttings with a mobile data acquisition system. Growth, frost damage and chlorophyll fluorescence were monitored and analysed in relation to microclimate. Budburst date was estimated and the nocturnal near-ground temperature during the period when the seedlings were most susceptible to frost was analysed in both experiments. The shelterwood moderated near-ground radiation fluxes and diurnal temperature varia-tions, while the daily mean temperature was unaffected. Near-ground minimum tempera-tures were lower, and vertical temperature inversions were more pronounced in clear-cuttings than in shelterwoods, during clear and calm nights. The effects were most pro-nounced during a dry period. Budburst was delayed in the shelterwood. Later budburst was shown {{to reduce the risk}} of exposure to frosts during the most frost-susceptible period, when cuttings of two clones, differing in budburst date, were compared. Mechanical scarification reduced frost damage to seedlings in the first growing season, but neither herbicide treatment, nor mowing affected the frequency of <b>frost</b> <b>injury.</b> The frequency of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> was higher amongst containerised seedlings than amongst bare-rooted seedlings, especially in the first growing season. Neither clear-cut age nor slash removal affected the frequency of <b>frost</b> damage. <b>Frost</b> <b>injury</b> to the cuttings was reduced by the shelterwoods, since 80 % were damaged by frost in clear-cuts and low-density shelterwoods, 27 % in moderately dense shelterwoods, and only 5 % in dense shelter-woods. Of the climatic variables tested, the accumulated net and global radiation the day after a severe frost event were the most strongly correlated with the degree of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> among cuttings, and the variation in their Fv/Fm ratios, in the graduated shelterwoods. <b>Frost</b> <b>injuries</b> were rarely lethal, but reduced growth and increased the proportion of seed-lings with multiple leaders and spike knots, especially amongst seedlings that were re-peatedly injured over several years.

Cellular freezing tolerance was studied using ion leakage tests and {{the sensitivity of}} the photosynthetic apparatus to freezing and high light intensity stress by measuring changes in chlorophyll fluorescence (FV/FM) and oxygen evolution. Exposure to high light intensities after freezing stress increased <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> significantly in all genotypes studied. Compared with S. tuberosum cultivars, the hybrids were more tolerant both of freezing and intense light stresses. In field experiments the mechanism of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> varied according to the severity of night frosts. During night frosts in 1999, the temperature inside the potato canopy was significantly higher than at ground level, and did not fall below the lethal temperature for potato cultivars (from - 2. 5 to - 3. 0 °C). As a result, <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> developed slowly, indicating that damage occurred to the photosynthetic apparatus. However, as the temperature at ground level and inside the canopy fell below - 4 °C, cellular freezing occurred and the canopy was rapidly destroyed. This suggests that in the field visual frost damage can follow from freezing or non-freezing temperatures accompanied with high light intensity. Therefore, in an attempt to improve low temperature tolerance in potato, it is important to increase tolerance to both freezing and chilling stresses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOver-wintering {{reproductive}} buds of many {{woody plants}} survive frost by supercooling. The bud tissues are isolated from acropetally advancing ice {{by the presence}} of ice barriers that restrict ice growth. Plants living in alpine environments also face the risk of ice formation in summer months. Little knowledge exists, how reproductive structures of woody alpine plants are protected from <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> during episodic <b>summer</b> <b>frosts.</b> In order to address this question, frost resistance of three common dwarf shrubs, Calluna vulgaris, Empetrum hermaphroditum and Loiseleuria procumbens was measured and ice formation and propagation were monitored in twigs bearing reproductive shoots during various stages of reproductive development (bud, anthesis, and fruit) throughout the alpine summer. Results indicated that, in the investigated species, ice barriers were present at all reproductive stages, isolating the reproductive shoots from ice advancing from the subtending vegetative shoot. Additionally, in the reproductive stems ice nucleating agents that are active at warm, sub-zero temperatures, were absent. The ice barriers were 100 % effective, with the exception of L. procumbens, where in 13 % of the total observations, the ice barrier failed. The ice barriers were localized {{at the base of the}} pedicel, at the anatomical junction of the vegetative and reproductive shoot. There, structural aspects of the tissue impede or prevent ice from advancing from the frozen stem into the pedicel of the reproductive shoot. Under the experimental conditions used in this study, ice nucleation initially occurred in the stem of the vegetative shoot at species-specific mean temperatures in the range of − 4. 7 to − 5. 8 °C. Reproductive shoots, however, remained supercooled and ice free down to a range of − 7. 2 to − 18. 2 °C or even below − 22 °C, the lowest temperature applied in the study. This level of supercooling is sufficient to prevent freezing of reproductive structures at the lowest air temperature occurring at the altitude of the upper distribution boundary of the natural habitat of the investigated species which is between − 8 and − 10 °C in <b>summer.</b> <b>Frost</b> resistance assays indicated that reproductive shoots are much less frost resistant than vegetative stems, and in contrast to vegetative shoots, are not ice tolerant. Supercooling of reproductive shoots in alpine, woody plant species is an effective mechanism that protects developing offspring from potential frost damage resulting from episodic summer freezing events...|$|R

The relationship between nucleation frequency and <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> was examined by subjecting corn seedlings to − 4 °C immediately after they were sprayed with bacterial suspensions with different nucleation frequencies and by following both ice nucleus concentration and bacterial population size on leaves of corn seedlings as a function of time after bacterial application.

This research was undertaken {{to investigate the}} effects of frost on pear buds, flowers, and fruit through controlled freezing tests and field studies {{in order to better}} understand the frost phenomenon and refine frost protection decisions. Controlled freezing studies on 'Bartlett' pear (Pyrus communis L.) showed that the percent of florets injured by frost increased with decreasing temperature, advancing developmental stage, and increasing duration at minimum temperatures of - 2, - 3, and - 4 ° C. Increases in injury occurred with exposures of 30 or 60 minutes at all stages except the small fruit stage, in which injury continued to increase for 2 hours at - 2 ° C. No significant effects of freezing rate were found at - 2, - 3, or - 4 ° C. However, there was a significant effect of freezing rate at - 5 ° C. No hardiness differences were found between comparable floral developmental stages from weak and vigorous trees. Bloom delay through evaporative cooling resulted in a loss of hardiness beyond that found earlier in the season on non-misted trees for similar stages of development. However, under field conditions a certain amount of frost protection was gained through bloom delay. Simulated <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to small fruit ovaries at intervals after full bloom significantly-increased fruit malformation, reduced fruit weight, and increased fruit drop of 'Bartlett', 'Bosc', and 'Comice' pear trees. Time of injury did not affect fruit weight and malformation in most cases, but early injury did significantly increase fruit drop. Significant positive correlations were found between fruit weight and seed content, while negative correlations were found between fruit malformation and seed content for all cultivars. Crop density was correlated significantly with sum of percent floral <b>injury</b> from <b>frost,</b> orchard design, and height in the tree for 'Bartlett', 'Bosc', and 'Anjou' pear. Regression models for crop density, regressed on sum of the percent injury, orchard design, and height in the tree differed between cultivars indicating that one model cannot be used to estimate crop density at harvest for all cultivars. Crop density was greater at low levels of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> in free standing than in hedgerow trees, and at greater elevations in the trees.

The relative INFs of individual strains varied with plant host and environment. However, none of seven plant species tested optimized the INFs of all 15 strains. Similarly, incubation for 48 h at near 100 % relative humidity with short photoperiods did not always decrease the INF when compared with a 72 h, 40 % relative humidity, long-photoperiod incubation.
