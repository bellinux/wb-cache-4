50|$|B&Q {{developed}} two new trading formats: HomeCentres, retailing furniture, bathrooms, <b>soft</b> <b>furniture,</b> flooring and lighting; and AutoCentres, being {{similar to}} a Halfords, the first launch taking place at Cribbs Causeway, Bristol, in the late 1980s. The concept being to have a HomeCentre, AutoCentre and DIY Superstore with one communal car park. The forays into these new markets were relatively short lived, and the various sites were sold {{on a couple of}} years later. The AutoCentres becoming in the main 'Charlie Browns', the HomeCentres being sold off individually.|$|E

[...] In the article, Popcorn cited {{the increased use}} of gourmet frozen foods, <b>soft</b> <b>furniture</b> such as Barcaloungers, investment services, and [...] "mom foods" [...] that remind consumers of adolescence, as examples of cocooning behavior. She cited less involvement in social and political issues as a downside of cocooning, though she predicted a counter-trend to emerge.|$|E

50|$|The Jane Bancroft Cook Library {{uses the}} Library of Congress Call Number system and holds its main {{circulating}} collection of physical {{books on the}} second floor, beginning in the far northwest corner with the Juvenile section. This proceeds to the DVD stacks coupled with alternative media such as audiobook cassettes and CDs, and VHS videos followed by musical CDs. The rest of the general collection then starts at A and wraps around the northeast corner, then heads south and wraps around the southeast corner where it stops at Z and the Oversized collection. In this area there are tables, <b>soft</b> <b>furniture,</b> and study carrels. Downstairs, where the lobby can be found, is where the Circulation Desk sits where reserves for classes may be located as well as non-book items may be borrowed. The large selection of physical periodicals is stored here too. Here also are the Faculty/Alumnus Authored and Writer in Residence displays, and {{on the far side}} of the periodical shelves, there is the Dr. Helen N. Fagin Collection for Holocaust Genocide Humanitarian Studies.The library houses many other areas of specialized studies including the Writing Resource Center, the Qualitative Resource Center (these first two operated mostly by students), Educational Technology Services, Language Resource Center, Study Abroad, and the Center for Engagement and Opportunities.|$|E
40|$|Textile materials, {{which are}} {{different}} in fibre content, weave type, density and thickness, as well as multi-layered synthetic leathers, are used in <b>soft</b> <b>furniture</b> upholstery production. Deformation - relaxation behaviour, which depends on mechanical properties of such materials differs significantly, also. From this standpoint substantial problem exists in <b>soft</b> <b>furniture</b> production, because the dimensions of its upholstery patterns, i. e. initial pretention must be adjusted {{taking into account the}} differences of applied materials mechanical properties. Otherwise external view and quality of upholstery may be unacceptable due to obvious visual material excess on <b>soft</b> <b>furniture</b> surfaces, which is called pull-on ease. The aim of this investigation was to determine the dependencies between three different levels of <b>soft</b> <b>furniture</b> upholstery pre-tension and corresponding values of pull-on ease. New testing method presented in this study allows defining <b>soft</b> <b>furniture</b> upholstery deformational behaviour and its regularities in respect to the initial dimensions of upholstery patterns.

40|$|Unrealised design {{capacity}} in computerised seamless knitting technology is highlighted in emerging research. The adoption of this technology, both in New Zealand and internationally, is largely {{driven by the}} economic gains it affords knitted garment manufacturers rather than the opportunities it presents for new design (Challis, Sayer, & Wilson, 2006; Evans-Mikellis, 2011; Smith, 2013; Yang, 2010). Complexities of the machinery and its user interface have constrained textile designers, impacting on their creative output, leaving the technology largely unexplored (Black, 2002; Mowbray, 2002). By acquiring technical skills {{and understanding of the}} seamless environment through practice-based enquiry, this research integrates computerised seamless knit technology into small-scale textile design practice; the goals are to exploit the creative potential of the technology and realise crafted design outcomes.

60|$|He {{was less}} {{reserved}} {{than the average}} Englishman, but he felt the charm of his surroundings more keenly than the latter would probably have done. Everything {{in the room was}} artistic, but its effect was deeper than mere prettiness. It was cool, though the autumn sunshine streamed in, and the girl had somehow impressed her personality upon it. <b>Soft</b> colorings, <b>furniture,</b> even the rather incongruous mixture of statuettes and ivory carvings, blended into a harmonious whole, and the girl made a most satisfactory central figure, as she sat opposite him in her unusually thoughtful mood. He felt the charm of her presence, though he could hardly have analyzed it. As he said, it was not even needful that she should talk to him.|$|R
40|$|Vibroacoustic {{therapy is}} a {{recently}} recognized technology that uses {{sound in the}} audible range to produce mechanical vibrations that are applied directly to the body. The technology uses speakers or transducers placed within mats, mattresses, chairs, recliners, tables, or <b>soft</b> <b>furniture</b> to provide a physiologic and auditory experience. Benefits include pain management, anxiety relief, symptom reduction, physical therapy, and health improvement. Three general designs of vibroacoustic technology have been developed over the past 30 years, with unique capabilities and purposes. The designs differ {{in the type of}} vibration-generating systems used; the frequencies selected for stimulus; the extent to which sound vibrations are processed, measured and monitored ' and the qualities and patterns of resonance in the vibrating surfaces. Interest in incorporating vibroacoustics in patient care practices may be attributable to the nonpharmacologic and noninvasive nature of the technology. Because some models of vibroacoustic technology can be administered easily in nursing care, this may have also led to broad use of vibroacoustics in medical and wellness practices. Research and/or development of vibroacoustic use include applications to manage pain; reduced symptoms for patients in chemotherapy; reduce stress; distract patients during biopsies...|$|E
40|$|An INdoor air Detailed Chemical Model was {{developed}} to investigate the impact of ozone reactions with indoor surfaces (including occupants), on indoor air chemistry in simulated apartments subject to ambient air pollution. The {{results are consistent with}} experimental studies showing that approximately 80 % of ozone indoors is lost through deposition to surfaces. The human body removes ozone most effectively from indoor air per square meter of surface, but the most significant surfaces for C 6 -C 10 aldehyde formation are <b>soft</b> <b>furniture</b> and painted walls owing to their large internal surfaces. Mixing ratios of between 8 and 11 ppb of C 6 -C 10 aldehydes are predicted to form in apartments in various locations in summer, the highest values are when ozone concentrations are enhanced outdoors. The most important aldehyde formed indoors is predicted to be nonanal (5 - 7 ppb), driven by oxidation-derived emissions from painted walls. In addition, ozone-derived emissions from human skin were estimated for a small bedroom at nighttime with concentrations of nonanal, decanal, and 4 -oxopentanal predicted to be 0. 5, 0. 7, and 0. 7 ppb, respectively. A detailed chemical analysis shows that ozone-derived surface aldehyde emissions from materials and people change chemical processing indoors, through enhanced formation of nitrated organic compounds and decreased levels of oxidants...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} health and working conditions in 10 carpenter’s workshops in the municipality of Armenia (Colombia). In these workshops, all the most exposed workers to wood dust were surveyed at the areas of sanding, brushing, immunization and painting (workers with the highest risk to get chronic respiratory disease). They were 177 workers. The use of hard and <b>soft</b> woods for <b>furniture</b> was detected. Besides, some pesticides, volatile organic solvents, synthetic epoxy resins glues and paintings, were used for finishes, which increases the risk of acquiring some neurological diseases and damage to the nervous system. Occurrence of cancer in nostrils mainly due to the use of hardwoods is an additional risk. With regard to the basic lighting conditions, it was found that half of workshops had deficiencies in special carving areas, because they were below the minimum allowable lighting limit level (500 lux). With relation to noise, all the workshops exceeded the permissible maximum limit value (85 dBA). With respect to the occurrence of occupational events, no data were found in the companies, or analysis of employee absenteeism due to the exposure to particulate matter. Key words...|$|R
