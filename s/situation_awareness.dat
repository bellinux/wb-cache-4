5|$|A {{helmet-mounted sight}} (HMS) {{developed}} by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC {{was developed in}} parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006. It was dubbed as EO HMS, (Electro-Optical Helmet Mounted Sight) and was first revealed {{to the public in}} 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display. The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target. An externally carried day/night laser designator targeting pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs). An extra hardpoint may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of targeting pods required, the aircraft's tactical data link can transmit target data to other aircraft not equipped with targeting pods. The communication systems comprise two VHF/UHF radios; the VHF radio has the capacity for data linking for communication with ground control centres, airborne early warning and control aircraft and combat aircraft with compatible data links for network-centric warfare, and improved <b>situation</b> <b>awareness.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a twofold context modelling approach that integrates beliefs (uncertain knowledge) and facts to reason about various everyday <b>situations.</b> <b>Awareness</b> of everyday <b>situations</b> enables mobile devices {{to adapt to}} the social and conceptual settings in which they operate; it also enables resources which share a similar context to cooperate in order to carry out a distributed task on behalf of their user. Our context modelling process involves the identification of the context of interest, the determination of those aspects of a context which can be captured by employing sensors, the determination of contextual states for each aspect, and finally, the determination of logical and probabilistic relationships between the contextual aspects and the context they represent. We demonstrate our approach by modelling physical places. Data from various heterogeneous sensors build our system’s belief, while containment relationships build its factual knowledge regarding places. The system utilises its belief and factual knowledge to reason about the whereabouts of a mobile user. ...|$|R

The proliferation of contract prompted the emergence of professional contract managers who played an important but relatively peripheral role applying <b>situations</b> <b>awareness</b> to the practice of compliance and business relationship management. As more complex organizational forms emerge (outsourcing, supply chains and enterprise IS), contract has come {{to be seen as a}} standard coordination device whose foundational assumptions are taken for granted. In this study, we draw attention to two different ways of designing the organizational technology of contract: a process-oriented approach and a market-based valuation of contract. Both approaches promise to provide management information by offering a form of calculability but we argue distort organizational awareness. Our conclusion is that a more developed notion of organizational awareness is needed supported by an alternative conceptualization of contract as a technology or connectedness...|$|R
40|$|Metacognition or metacognitive {{awareness}} {{is defined as}} the comprehension of individuals of their possessed skills, the controlling of these skills by those individuals and the stimulation of cognitive processes possessed by individuals in order to complete the learning process at high level (Flavell, 1979). Metacognitive awareness means the knowledge of individuals regarding metacognition system they possess. The metacognitive knowledge of individuals and their opinions regarding the control level of this metacognitive knowledge reveal metacognitive awareness (Yıldırım, 2010). The goal of the conducted study is to determine the metacognitive <b>awareness</b> <b>situations</b> of secondary students receiving 3 -B programming education with Alice. The study group of the study consists of 186 students in 6 th grade in Konya. Pre-test – Post-test single subject quasi-experimental method is used as research model. “Metacognitive awareness scale for children” prepared by Karakelle and Saraç (2007) is used as data collection tool. The scale is 5 point likert type and consists of 18 items. Additionally, the Cronbach alpha value of the scale is calculated as =. 80. SPSS package program is used in the analyses of data obtained. As a result of analysing the data obtained during their study, the following conclusions are made; metacognitive <b>awareness</b> <b>situations</b> of secondary students receiving programming education with Alice have increased, their metacognitive <b>awareness</b> <b>situations</b> differ meaningfully in terms of their sexes and their metacognitive <b>awareness</b> <b>situations</b> don’t differ in terms of their possession of computers, possession of internet and weekly internet usage situations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONHepatocellular carcinoma, {{the most}} {{frequent}} primary hepatic tumor, metastasizes in more than 50 % of cases. However, parotid gland metastatic HCCs are very uncommon. We report a patient in whom the finding of a left parotid mass revealed metastatic HCC. PRESENTATION OF CASEA thirty-six-year-old male presented with a round palpable left neck mass that persisted for 3 months. He had received right hemihepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Preoperative evaluation revealed a benign tumor of the parotid gland. We performed superficial parotidectomy. Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma of the parotid gland was diagnosed. DISCUSSIONAlthough HCC metastases to the oral cavity have been reported, to date, only 4 cases HCC metastasis to the parotid gland have been reported. Although clinicians and cytopathologists alike both agree that salivary gland fine needle aspiration biopies (FNABs) are highly useful and safe diagnostic alternatives to biopsies and resections, we believe that in specific clinical <b>situations,</b> <b>awareness</b> of potential diagnostic pitfalls in salivary gland FNAB is {{a necessary part of}} the microscopic interpretations of these lesions. CONCLUSIONAlthough rare, since HCC can metastasize to the parotid gland, high suspicion should be maintained in a patient presenting with a parotid mass with a history of HCC. In addition, since potential diagnostic pitfalls in salivary gland fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies exist, incisional or excisional biopsy may be necessary for definite diagnosis of metastatic HCC to the parotid gland...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the <b>situation</b> {{considering}} national <b>awareness</b> of the Chuvash people is described. The central question {{in this research}} is the following: how can awareness of the Chuvash people be described and which factors are/were crucial in its formation? In order to analyze the problem in greater depth, the historical background {{of the region and}} the Chuvash people since the 10 th century till post-communist period is studied in the first chapter. Additionally, socio-political awareness of the national elite and its development was studied for a broader understanding of the topic. Particular attention is paid to Ivan Iakovlevich Iakovlev, the pedagogical activist, nationalist, founder of the Chuvash alphabet and first Chuvash national schools. This person {{played an important role in}} the development of the national awareness among the Chuvash as his activities contributed to formation of national intelligentsia and thereby to establishment of the Chuvash statehood. The <b>situation</b> considering national <b>awareness</b> among the Chuvash in modern Russia is analyzed in the second chapter. Contradictions in evaluation of the situation are explained there: was it a period of national awakening or rather of “national nihilism”, in other words underestimation of own ethnic group, lack of confidence in the prospects of their development and orientation on other nation. In the third chapter, the results of interviews and current situation are described. Possible economic, political and socio-cultural reasons for the current <b>situation</b> considering national <b>awareness</b> among the Chuvash are discussed there too...|$|R

Furthermore thanks to recent convergence of greater access to broadband connections, the availability of Global Positioning Systems at affordable prices, and more participative forms of interaction on the Web (Web 2. 0) vast numbers of individuals are able to create and share geographic information. The potential of up to 6 billion human sensors to monitor the state of the environment, validate global models with local knowledge, contribute to crisis <b>situations</b> <b>awareness</b> and provide information that only humans can capture (e. g. emotions and perceptions like fear of crime) is vast and has yet to be fully exploited. However, integrating VGI into Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) is a major challenge, as it is often regarded as insufficiently structured, documented or validated according to scientific standards. Early instances of SDIs used to have limited ability to manage and process geosensor-based data (beyond remotely sensed imagery snapshots), which tend to arrive in continuous streams of real-time information. The current works on standards for Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) aim to fill this gap. This paper shows how such SWE standards can be applied to VGI, thus converting it in a timely, cost-effective and valuable source of information for SDIs. By doing so, we extend previous works describing a workflow for VGI integration into SDI and further advance an initial set of VGI Sensing and event detection techniques.
