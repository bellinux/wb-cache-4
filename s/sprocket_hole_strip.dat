50|$|The highest {{grade of}} {{continuous}} form paper uses a heavy bond weight similar to typing paper. Perforations {{are very small}} and close together, referred to as microperforations or microperf, to allow the sheets to be separated and the <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> <b>strip</b> torn off leaving a very smooth edge almost as if guillotine-cut.|$|E
25|$|The Minox cameras project {{an image}} of 8×11mm onto the negative. The film is in strips 9.2mm wide, or less than one-quarter the size of 35 mm film, and unlike 35mm film, it has no <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes.</b> This film <b>strip</b> is rolled up in the supply side chamber of a small twin chamber {{cartridge}}, with the film leader taped to a take-up spool in the take up chamber. The film strips can be up to 50 frames in length for Riga Minox and Minox II, III, IIIs and B cameras. From Minox BL and C cameras onward the Minox film cartridge holds 15, 30, or 36 exposures.|$|R
50|$|After {{printing}} the separated sheets {{can be held}} in binders {{by using}} the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> when simply required as a record.

50|$|Film in Which There Appear Edge Lettering, <b>Sprocket</b> <b>Holes,</b> Dirt Particles, Etc. is a 1966 American {{experimental}} {{short film}} directed by Owen Land.|$|R
50|$|Data were {{represented}} by {{the presence or absence}} of a hole at a particular location. Tapes originally had five rows of holes for data. Later tapes had six, seven and eight rows. An early electro-mechanical calculating machine, the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or Harvard Mark I, used paper tape with twenty-four rows. A row of smaller <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> that were always punched served to feed the tape, originally using a wheel with radial teeth called a sprocket wheel. Later optical readers used the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> to generate timing pulses. The <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> are slightly to one side, making it clear which way to orient the tape in the reader and dividing the tape into unequal sides. The bits on the narrower side of the tape are generally the least significant bits, when the code is represented as numbers in a digital system.|$|R
50|$|In film movies these timing {{errors are}} most {{commonly}} caused by worn films skipping over the movie projector sprockets because {{the film has}} torn <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Film in Which There Appear... is a six-minute loop of the double-printed {{image of}} a {{blinking}} woman; her image is off-centre, making visible the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> and edge lettering on the film. According to Land, there is some slight variation in the image onscreen, but [...] "no development in the dramatic or musical sense." [...] Land's intention was {{to focus attention on}} the components that film viewers are not supposed to, and do not usually, notice, such as scratches, dirt particles, edge lettering, and <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes.</b> For this reason, Land often scheduled the film first in screenings of his work.|$|R
5000|$|Striped {{magnetic}} film is motion picture film in which 'stripes' of magnetic oxide {{are placed on}} the film between the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> and {{the edge of the}} film, and sometimes also between the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> and the image. Each of these stripes has one channel of the audio recorded on it. This technique was first introduced in September, 1953 by Hazard E. Reeves for Cinemascope. Four tracks are present on the film: Left, Center, Right and Surround. This 35mm four-track magnetic sound format was used from 1954 through 1982 for [...] "roadshow" [...] screenings of big-budget feature films.|$|R
50|$|Earlier processes, used on 70 mm film {{prints and}} special presentations of 35 mm film prints, {{recorded}} sound magnetically on ferric oxide tracks bonded {{to the film}} print, outside the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes.</b> 16 mm and Super 8 formats sometimes used a similar magnetic track on the camera film, bonded {{to one side of}} the film on which the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> had not been punched ("single perforated") for the purpose. Film of this form is no longer manufactured, but single-perforated film without the magnetic track (allowing an optical sound track) or, in the case of 16 mm, utilising the soundtrack area for a wider picture (Super 16 format) is readily available.|$|R
50|$|Many {{motion picture}} cameras do not record audio {{sound on the}} film, so in {{professional}} film production, {{there is a need}} to have the sound recorded and played back on a device that has a double-system recording to tapes, either DAT or Nagra, and then transferred to 16mm or 35mm separate magnetic film. The sound recording would then be synchronized with a movie projector or a telecine. Either 35mm film or 16mm film that is fully coated with a magnetic material can be locked, <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> by <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole,</b> to the film with the picture image. On the set, a clapperboard is used to mark the spot where the sound and picture will later be synced.|$|R
50|$|Godard envisaged Breathless as a reportage (documentary), and tasked cinematographer Raoul Coutard {{to shoot}} the entire film on a {{hand-held}} camera, with next to no lighting. In order to shoot under low light levels, Coutard had to use Ilford HPS film, which was not available as motion picture film stock at the time. He therefore took 18-metre lengths of HPS film sold for 35mm still cameras and spliced them together to 120-metre rolls. During development he pushed the negative one stop from 400 ASA to 800 ASA. The size of the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> in the photographic film {{was different from the}} <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> for motion picture film, and the Cameflex camera was the only camera that would work for the film used.|$|R
50|$|In a {{standard}} film projector, each frame of film is positioned, or registered by being held motionless against a rectangular opening, {{known as the}} gate, {{for a fraction of}} a second. While in the gate, light passes through the image in the frame, to be projected onto the screen. As soon as the shutter cuts off the light, either sprockets or a device called a claw is used to move the film rapidly so that the next frame can be registered in the gate before the shutter opens again. However, the pins on the sprockets (or the claw) do not fit the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> in the film perfectly. There must be some slight clearance to allow the pins to enter and leave the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> without undue friction or binding. This discrepancy means that each frame cannot be positioned perfectly within the gate each time; the frame may be slightly too high or low (jump) or to the left or right (weave). This introduces unintended motion from frame to frame as the film is projected. This discrepancy can increase as the film becomes worn with use, causing the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> to become more and more enlarged, thus allowing more error in frame position.|$|R
5000|$|This double-system audio {{recording}} {{could then be}} transferred or [...] "resolved" [...] to sprocketed magnetic film, with <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> that match one to one with the original camera film. These two sprocketed media could be run through a [...] "Moviola" [...] or flat-bed editing table such as the Steenbeck for synchronous sound editing.|$|R
50|$|A scene-by-scene color {{correction}} option was later added to film chains. This was first done by notching {{the edge of}} the film where a color change was wanted. Later, machines that counted the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> were used. At the mark (the notch or the electronic sprocket-count number) the next stored {{color correction}} would occur. See color grading for more information.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> {{photography}} is {{a style of}} photography that exposes the full width of 35 mm film, creating a photograph punctuated by the [...] "sprocket holes" [...] (perforations) {{along the edges of}} the film. Usually, this style involves the use of a modified medium format camera, since a 35 mm camera ordinarily will not expose the edges of the film.|$|R
5000|$|Due to Edison's lack of {{securing}} an international patent on his film inventions, similar devices were [...] "invented" [...] around the world. The Lumière brothers (Louis and Auguste Lumière), for example, created the Cinématographe in France. The Cinématographe {{proved to be}} a more portable and practical device than both of Edison's as it combined a camera, film processor and projector in one unit. In contrast to Edison's [...] "peepshow"-style kinetoscope, which only one person could watch through a viewer, the cinematograph allowed simultaneous viewing by multiple people. Their first film, Sortie de l'usine Lumière de Lyon, shot in 1894, is considered the first true motion picture. The invention of celluloid film, which was strong and flexible, greatly facilitated the making of motion pictures (although the celluloid was highly flammable and decayed quickly). This film was 35 mm wide and pulled using four <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes,</b> which became the industry standard. This doomed the cinematograph, which could only use film with just one <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|R
50|$|DX (Digital indeX) {{encoding}} is an ANSI and I3A standard, originally {{introduced by}} Kodak in March 1983, for marking 135 and APS photographic film and film cartridges. It has several parts, a latent image DX film edge barcode {{on the film}} below the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes,</b> a code on the cartridge used by automatic cameras, and a barcode on the cartridge read by photo-finishing machines.|$|R
5000|$|... 35 mm Film Adapter, {{available}} in two models: full negative and [...] "panoramic." [...] Both adapters {{come with a}} light-proof back and a mask made to hold the 135 canister in place. The only {{difference between the two}} models is the size of the mask. The [...] "panoramic" [...] adapter will mask out the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes.</b> A rarer model {{available in}} Japan is an all-in-one back and cartridge unit.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is also a}} 35 mm width, {{but this}} variety is more similar to the motion picture stock of the same width. It is {{referred}} to by the recording and motion picture industries as [...] "magfilm". It is used for recording analog sound for a motion picture, and for interlocked playback of sound with a picture reel when editing motion picture film on a flatbed editor. It has also seen use for studio audio recording and mastering, a few albums released by the Command label in the 1960s were mastered using 35mm magfilm. It has the same <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> and the thicker acetate (or polyester) base of 35mm negative or reversal cinema stock, but instead has a magnetic oxide layer, coating the full width of the film base (as opposed to a photographic emulsion). This variety {{is referred to as}} [...] "fullcoat magfilm". Another variant, [...] "stripe magfilm", has only three separate oxide [...] "tracks" [...] on the base, {{with the rest of the}} base being clear, with the same 35mm <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> as well.|$|R
25|$|To avoid violating Edison’s {{motion picture}} patents, Biograph cameras from 1895-1902 used a large-format film, {{measuring}} 2-23/32 inches (68mm) wide, {{with an image}} area of 2×2½ inches, four times that of Edison’s 35mm format. The camera used friction feed instead of Edison’s sprocket feed to guide the film to the aperture. The camera itself punched a <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> {{on each side of}} the frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second.|$|R
5000|$|The {{perforated}} {{tapes were}} read photo-electrically at a [...] "gate" [...] which was placed {{as near as}} possible to thesprocket to reduce the effect of stretched tapes. Successive characters on the tape were read by a battery of ten photocells, an eleventh for the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> and two additional ones for the [...] "stop" [...] and [...] "start" [...] signals that were hand-punched between {{the third and fourth}} and fourth and fifth channels.|$|R
50|$|Long {{used for}} home movies before the video camera, this uses double sprocketed 16 mm film, which is {{run through the}} camera, exposing one side, then removed from the camera, the takeup and feed reels are switched, and the film run through a second time. exposing the other side. The 16 mm film is then split {{lengthwise}} into two 8 mm pieces that are spliced to make a single projectable film with <b>sprockets</b> <b>holes</b> on one side.|$|R
50|$|When film is scanned so that an {{electronic}} (video) copy can be made, various means {{are used to}} help ensure that the variations in frame position {{as a result of}} <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> wear are minimized. The more effective these means are, the less of a 'film look' the result will have. On the contrary, if this compensation is reduced or disabled, the resulting electronic copy may exhibit more jump and weave, giving the result a sense of constant jitter.|$|R
50|$|The {{intermittent}} mechanism can {{be constructed}} in different ways. For smaller gauge projectors (8 mm and 16 mm), a pawl mechanism engages the film's <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> one side, or holes on each side. This pawl advances only when the film is to be moved to the next image. As the pawl retreats for the next cycle it is drawn back and does not engage the film. This {{is similar to the}} claw mechanism in a motion picture camera.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, compact {{imported}} European stereo cameras that used 35 mm slide film began {{appearing in the}} US market. The most notable example was the Verascope F40. These cameras featured a [...] "7P" [...] format, meaning that each image was 7 film perforations (<b>sprocket</b> <b>holes)</b> wide, yielding 11 stereo pairs on a 20-exposure roll of 35 mm film. Because these cameras (and some later models) came from Europe, this {{became known as the}} [...] "European format".|$|R
