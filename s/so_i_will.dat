I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not going to destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.|$|E

500|$|In Stage one (obedience and {{punishment}} driven), individuals {{focus on the}} direct {{consequences of their actions}} on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. [...] "The last time I did that I got spanked, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not do it again." [...] The worse the punishment for the act is, the more [...] "bad" [...] the act is perceived to be. This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is [...] "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own. There is [...] "deference to superior power or prestige".|$|E

500|$|York manager McEwan {{compared}} Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September 2006, but following York's 2–0 away defeat against Oxford United {{later that}} month, McEwan criticised Donaldson's selfishness in attack, saying it cost them the match. In late 2006, Donaldson became {{subject of much}} transfer speculation. Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York's 1–0 home victory over Altrincham, in which he scored his 12th goal of the season, on 5 November 2006. He was also watched by Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. In response to this speculation, Donaldson said: [...] "I don't read too much into the speculation. I've heard it before and nothing has happened <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> just keep my head down and enjoy my football until a point comes when the manager or board come and tell me they have had an offer they want to consider".|$|E
500|$|As {{entertainment}} and cultural artifact, Manhunt is totally disturbing.

Do I think games such as these could have dire psychological consequences, particularly for young people? As always, I remain agnostic on the matter. Who knows, really? The debate will never be resolved. The American military obviously thinks there's something there: The troubling new TV ad campaign for the U.S. reserves lures potential young soldiers with tales of adventure accompanied by blatant, video-game-styled animation. And, curiously, no one has complained about or tried to ban , in which stealth and killing figure even more heavily than in Manhunt.|$|E
500|$|In 1822, {{the first}} animal {{protection}} law was enacted in the British parliament, {{followed by the}} Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin, who wrote to Ray Lankester in March 1871: [...] "You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite {{agree that it is}} justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night." [...] In response to the lobbying by anti-vivisectionists, several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research: The Physiological Society was formed in 1876 to give physiologists [...] "mutual benefit and protection", the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in 1882 and focused on policy-making, and the Research Defence Society (now Understanding Animal Research) was formed in 1908 [...] "to make known the facts as to experiments on animals in this country; the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them".|$|E

500|$|Monteux {{wished to}} {{continue}} his work in helping young conductors: [...] "Conducting is not enough. I must create something. I am not a composer, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> create fine young musicians." [...] In addition to his classes in Paris and Les Baux in the 1930s he had given private lessons to Igor Markevitch; later private students included André Previn, Seiji Ozawa, José Serebrier and Robert Shaw. Previn called him [...] "the kindest, wisest man I can remember, {{and there was nothing}} about conducting he didn't know." [...] After a performance conducted by Previn, Monteux said to him, [...] "Did you think the orchestra was playing well? ... So did I. Next time don't interfere with them." [...] Previn said that he never forgot this advice. Monteux's best-known undertaking as a teacher was the Pierre Monteux School for conductors and orchestral musicians, held each summer at his home in Hancock, Maine from 1943 onwards. Internationally known alumni of the school include Leon Fleisher, Erich Kunzel, Lorin Maazel, Neville Marriner, Hugh Wolff and David Zinman. Other Monteux students included John Canarina, whose 2003 biography was the first full-length study of the conductor in English, Charles Bruck, one of Monteux's first pupils in Paris, who became music director of the school in Hancock after Monteux's death, and Emanuel Leplin.|$|E
500|$|Moore said he left DC in 1989 {{due to the}} {{language}} in his contracts for Watchmen and his V for Vendetta series with artist David Lloyd. Moore felt the reversion clauses were ultimately meaningless, because DC {{did not intend to}} let the publications go out of print. He told The New York Times in 2006, [...] "I said, 'Fair enough,' [...] 'You have managed to successfully swindle me, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> never work for you again. In 2000, Moore publicly distanced himself from DC's plans for a 15th anniversary Watchmen hardcover release as well as a proposed line of action figures from DC Direct. While DC wanted to mend its relationship with the writer, Moore felt the company was not treating him fairly in regards to his America's Best Comics imprint (launched under the WildStorm comic imprint, which was bought by DC in 1998; Moore was promised no direct interference by DC as part of the arrangement). Moore added, [...] "As far as I'm concerned, the 15th anniversary of Watchmen is purely a 15th Anniversary of when DC managed to take the Watchmen property from me and Dave [...]" [...] Soon afterward, DC Direct cancelled the Watchmen action-figure line, despite the company having displayed prototypes at the 2000 San Diego Comic-Con International.|$|E
500|$|In her 2015 book Proba the Prophet, Cullhed {{counters}} Shanzer et al.s claims. She {{disputes the}} first argument, noting that [...] "there are no 'grounds for determining {{priority of the}} lines. Regarding the second point, Cullhed notes that the reference to the 387 debate about Easter could have referred to an earlier dispute. About the third point, Cullhed says that many other scholars feel that Jerome would have never insulted Anicia Proba; he praised her as [...] "the richest, noblest and most powerful woman in Rome" [...] in another letter. Regarding the fourth argument, Cullhed notes that Faltonia Betitia Proba's alleged death in AD 351 is unproven. Opposing the fifth point, Cullhed writes that the titles {{used to refer to}} the author could have been inserted during the Middle Ages. Finally, she introduces new evidence that if Anicia Proba had written De laudibus Christi, the Latin poet Claudian would have probably mentioned her poetic skills in his 395 panegyric celebrating the joint consulship of her sons Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius and Anicius Probinus. Cullhed summarizes her argument: [...] "The evidence for discrediting Isidore's attribution [...] is not sufficient, and <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> assume that the cento was written in the mid-fourth century by Faltonia Betitia Proba." [...] Karl Schenkl also argues that scholars should accept Isidore's testimony, which clearly attributes De laudibus Christi to Faltonia Betitia Proba, and today, the general consensus of classicists and scholars is that De laudibus Christi was indeed written by Faltonia Betitia Proba.|$|E

2500|$|According to Björk herself, {{the lyrics}} express {{how she felt}} obliged to produce music because {{of the people that}} occupationally {{depended}} of her. The lyrics [...] "I will bring back the goods/But don't know when" [...] refer to her songwriting process; in her own words: [...] "Sometimes I don't do things that people I work with do —like spend time with families and lead a normal life.

2500|$|Individuals with {{receptive}} aphasia may speak in long sentences {{that have no}} meaning, add unnecessary words, and even create new [...] "words" [...] (neologisms).
