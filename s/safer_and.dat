5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode. Generally held to be <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E

5|$|Bicycle kicks are {{generally}} done in two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player facing his side's goal uses the action to clear {{the ball in the}} direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has his back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle kicks can also be done in the midfield, but this is not recommended because <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> more accurate passes can be done in this zone.|$|E
5|$|Expanding {{and moving}} out of their {{homeland}} in Scandinavia and northern Germany, the Germanic peoples had lived in today's Poland for several centuries, during which period many of their tribes also migrated out in the southern and eastern directions (see Wielbark culture). With {{the expansion of the}} Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes came under the Roman cultural influence. Some written remarks by Roman authors that are relevant to the developments on Polish lands have been preserved; they provide additional insight when compared with the archeological record. In the end, as the Roman Empire was nearing its collapse and the nomadic peoples invading from the east destroyed, damaged or destabilized the various Germanic cultures and societies, the Germanic people left eastern and central Europe for the <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> wealthier southern and western parts of the European continent.|$|E

5|$|Nowhere was demobilization more of {{a problem}} than at Los Alamos, where there was an exodus of talent. Much {{remained}} to be done. The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply because of the problems with the reactors. However, uncertainty {{about the future of the}} laboratory made it hard to induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement. In fact, Bradbury would remain in the post for the next 25 years. Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.|$|E
5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage of this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at {{the right place at the}} right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E

40|$|We {{extend the}} Alpern and Schneider linear time {{characterization}} {{of safety and}} liveness properties to branching time, where properties are sets of trees. We define two closure operators {{that give rise to}} the following four extremal types of properties: universally safe, existentially <b>safe,</b> universally live, <b>and</b> existentially live. The distinction between universal and existential properties captures the difference between the CTL path quantifiers A (for all paths) and E (there is a path). We show that every branching time property is the intersection of an existentially <b>safe</b> property <b>and</b> an existentially live property, a universally <b>safe</b> property <b>and</b> a universally live property, <b>and</b> an existentially <b>safe</b> property <b>and</b> a universally live property. We also examine how our closure operators behave on linear time properties. We then focus on sets of finitely branching trees and show that our closure operators agree on linear time safety properties. Furthermore, if a set of trees is given implicitly as a Rabin tree automaton, B, we show {{that it is possible to}} compute the Rabin automata corresponding to the closures of the language of B. This allows us to effectively compute B <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> B live such that the language of B is the intersection of the languages of B <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> B live. As above, B <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> B live can be chosen so that their languages are existentially <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> existentially live, universally <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> universally live, or existentially <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> universally live...|$|R
