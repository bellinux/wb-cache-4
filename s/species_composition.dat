5|$|The {{biological}} {{interest is}} focused on the species-rich mesotrophic grassland found across the site, which is actively maintained by grazing. The species present are predominantly grasses, although herbs and orchids are also found. The area has been classified as MG5 under the British National Vegetation Classification because of the <b>species</b> <b>composition.</b> The site is small and isolated, and therefore requires careful management to avoid damage caused by activity on neighbouring land.|$|E
5|$|Under the British National Vegetation Classification (NVC) Whitton Bridge Pasture is {{considered}} as mesotrophic grassland because it represents well-drained and permanent pasture. In particular it {{is considered}} to be an MG5 community because of the species present. MG5 is widespread in many lowland areas in England, Wales, and Scotland, particularly in the Midlands. Whitton Bridge Pasture is predominantly subcommunity MG5c (Danthonia decumbens), however subcommunity MG5a (Lathyrus pratensis) is present with a substantially different <b>species</b> <b>composition.</b>|$|E
5|$|From a phytogeographic viewpoint, the {{southern}} part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile. Much of the vegetation of {{the western part of the}} state has similar <b>species</b> <b>composition</b> with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau in the adjoining state of Jharkhand. The predominant commercial tree species is Shorea robusta, commonly known as the sal tree. The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the Casuarina. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous sundari (Heritiera fomes), from which the forest gets its name.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the same}} genera were present across these formations, though they varied at the species level. For example, the Djadochta was {{inhabited}} by Velociraptor mongoliensis, Protoceratops andrewsi, and Pinacosaurus grangeri, while the Bayan Mandahu was home to Velociraptor osmolskae, Protoceratops hellenikorhinus, and Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus. These differences in <b>species</b> <b>composition</b> may be due a natural barrier separating the two formations, which are relatively {{close to each other}} geographically. However, given the lack of any known barrier which would cause the specific faunal compositions found in these areas, {{it is more likely that}} those differences indicate a slight time difference.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Maya had {{diverse and}} {{sophisticated}} methods of food production. It {{was believed that}} shifting cultivation (swidden) agriculture provided most of their food, but it is now thought that permanent raised fields, terracing, intensive gardening, forest gardens, and managed fallows were also crucial to supporting the large populations of the Classic period in some areas. Indeed, evidence of these different agricultural systems persist today: raised fields connected by canals {{can be seen on}} aerial photographs. Contemporary rainforest <b>species</b> <b>composition</b> has significantly higher abundance of species of economic value to ancient Maya in areas that were densely populated in pre-Columbian times, and pollen records in lake sediments suggest that maize, manioc, sunflower seeds, cotton, and other crops have been cultivated in association with deforestation in Mesoamerica since at least 2500 BC.|$|E

25|$|Forest {{succession}} in {{its traditional}} sense implies two important features that resist direct examination (Solomon et al. 1981). First, classical definitions generally connote directional changes in <b>species</b> <b>composition</b> and community structure through time, yet {{the time frame}} needed for documentation of change far exceeds an average lifespan (Solomon et al. 1981). The second feature that defies quantitative description is the end point or climax.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} a fishery to recover from {{overfishing}} depends on whether the ecosystem's conditions are suitable for the recovery. Dramatic changes in <b>species</b> <b>composition</b> can result in an ecosystem shift, where other equilibrium energy flows involve species compositions different from those that had been present before the depletion of the original fish stock. For example, once trout have been overfished, carp might take over {{in a way that}} makes it impossible for the trout to re-establish a breeding population.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we used electro-spray {{ionization}} mass-spectrometry to determine phospholipid class and molecular <b>species</b> <b>compositions</b> in bacteriophages PM 2, PRD 1, Bam 35 and phi 6 {{as well as their}} hosts. To obtain compositional data of the individual leaflets, phospholipid transbilayer distribution in the viral membranes was studied. We found that 1) the membranes of all studied bacteriophage are enriched in PG as compared to the host membranes, 2) molecular <b>species</b> <b>compositions</b> in the phage and host membranes are similar, and 3) phospholipids in the viral membranes are distributed asymmetrically with phosphatidylglycerol enriched in the outer leaflet and phosphatidylethanolamine in the inner one (except Bam 35). Alternative models for selective incorporation of phospholipids to phages and for the origins of the asymmetric phospholipid transbilayer distribution are discussed. Notably, the present data are also useful when constructing high resolution structural models of bacteriophages, since diffraction methods cannot provide a detailed structure of the membrane due to high motility of the lipids and lack of symmetric organization of membrane proteins. Lipid-containing bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) are useful models in which to study membrane assembly and lipid-protein interactions. Interpretation of high-resolution structures of these viruses require knowledge on the detailed compositions of their components. In {{this study we}} determined phospholipid class and molecular <b>species</b> <b>compositions</b> in bacteriophages PM 2, PRD 1, Bam 35 and phi 6 as well as their hosts. Quantitative electro-spray ionization mass-spectrometry was used to obtain this compositional data. In addition, the phospholipid transbilayer distribution in the viral membranes was studied {{in order to determine the}} phospholipid compositions of individual sides of these membranes. We found that 1) there is relatively more of phosphatidylglycerol in bacteriophage membranes as compared to the host membranes, but the molecular <b>species</b> <b>compositions</b> in the viral and host membranes are similar, and 2) phospholipids in the viral membranes are distributed asymmetrically with phosphatidylglycerol enriched in the outer side of the mmebrane and phosphatidylethanolamine in the inner one (except in one virus) ...|$|R

25|$|The marine {{ecosystem}} is highly complex and natural fluctuations in <b>species</b> <b>composition,</b> abundance and distribution are a basic feature of its normal function. The extent of damage {{can therefore be}} difficult to detect against this background variability. Nevertheless, {{the key to understanding}} damage and its importance is whether spill effects result in a downturn in breeding success, productivity, diversity and the overall functioning of the system. Spills are not the only pressure on marine habitats; chronic urban and industrial contamination or the exploitation of the resources they provide are also serious threats.|$|E
25|$|Eutrophication {{may cause}} {{competitive}} release by making abundant a normally limiting nutrient. This process causes {{shifts in the}} <b>species</b> <b>composition</b> of ecosystems. For instance, an increase in nitrogen might allow new, competitive species to invade and out-compete original inhabitant species. This {{has been shown to}} occur in New England salt marshes. In Europe and Asia, the common carp frequently lives in naturally Eutrophic or Hypereutrophic areas, and is adapted to living in such conditions. The eutrophication of areas outside its natural range partially explain the fish's success in colonising these areas after being introduced.|$|E
25|$|One {{suspected}} {{cause of}} their precipitous decline was overfishing of Alaska pollock, herring, and other fish stocks in the Gulf of Alaska. This stems largely from the “junk-food hypothesis” representing a shift in their diet from fatty herring and capelin to leaner fare such as pollock and flounder, thereby limiting their ability to consume and store fat. Other hypotheses include increased predation by orcas and sharks, indirect effects of prey <b>species</b> <b>composition</b> shifts due to changes in climate, effects of disease or contaminants, shooting by fishermen, and others. The decline is certainly due to a complex of interrelated factors which {{have yet to be}} defined by the research effort.|$|E
50|$|Cyclic {{succession}} is {{a pattern}} of vegetation change in which in {{a small number of}} species tend to replace each other over time in the absence of large-scale disturbance.

40|$|We sampled {{the fish}} fauna of 9 small natural {{estuaries}} and 2 constructed estuarine lakes in Australia’s dry tropics over 15 mo to detail {{the dynamics of}} fish assembly structures over time. The estuaries chosen were small enough that the cast net sampling method which we used could cover {{the full extent of}} the estuary, obviating the problem that within-estuary migration might lead to the false appearance of assemblage change over time. Temporal patterns in assemblage structure were consistent across the natural estuaries, overprinting complex spatial differences. Nursery ground utilisation and assemblage composition were intimately interlinked. In natural estuaries, assemblage change was a function of changes in both probability of encounter of individual species and in <b>species</b> <b>compositions,</b> and the recruitment, growth and subsequent emigration from the estuaries of juveniles was the main contributor to overall assemblage change. In contrast, in artificial lakes where connectivity with offshore sources of recruits was restricted, <b>species</b> <b>compositions</b> were attenuated and temporal change was not driven by the recruitment of offshore species...|$|R
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to characterize the historic food web of the San Francisco Estuary because of the dramatic changes in geography, hydrology, and <b>species</b> <b>composition</b> {{that have occurred in}} the past century. However, monitoring begun in the 1970s gives some information about the historic dynamics of the foodweb. Prior to the 1980s the LSZ was dominated by a phytoplankton-driven foodweb, a stable mesoplankton population dominated by the copepod Eurytemora affinis, and large macrozooplankton typified by San Francisco bay shrimp and mysid shrimps. These provided nutrition and energy to native filter feeders such as the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), and planktivores such as delta smelt and juvenile salmon.|$|E
25|$|Xerocrassa geyeri {{seems to}} have survived in local refugia the {{reduction}} of the favourable steppe-like habitat due to climatic extremes during the pleniglacial and interstadial periods, as it is the case today. Pfenninger & Bahl (1997) suggested that snail species with restricted dispersal might survive in habitats of a size in the magnitude of few square meters. There is increasing evidence that such small spots with a favourable microclimate existed in the periglacial area of central Europe and were presumed to have provided refuges for comparatively cold resistant snail species. Southern and eastern European refugia were also supplemented by cryptic sanctuaries in northern Europe during the late Pleistocene in shaping present day <b>species</b> <b>composition.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{ecosystems}} are governed primarily by stochastic processes, through which its subsequent {{state would be}} determined by both predictable and random actions, {{they may be more}} resilient to sudden change than each species individually. In the absence of a balance of nature, the <b>species</b> <b>composition</b> of ecosystems would undergo shifts that would depend {{on the nature of the}} change, but entire ecological collapse would probably be infrequent events. In 1997, Robert Ulanowicz used information theory tools to describe the structure of ecosystems, emphasizing mutual information (correlations) in studied systems. Drawing on this methodology and prior observations of complex ecosystems, Ulanowicz depicts approaches to determining the stress levels on ecosystems and predicting system reactions to defined types of alteration in their settings (such as increased or reduced energy flow, and eutrophication.|$|E

25|$|Landscape patches have a {{boundary}} between them {{which can be}} defined or fuzzy. The zone composed of the edges of adjacent ecosystems is the boundary. Edge means the portion of an ecosystem near its perimeter, where influences of the adjacent patches can cause an environmental difference between {{the interior of the}} patch and its edge. This edge effect includes a distinctive <b>species</b> <b>composition</b> or abundance. For example, when a landscape is a mosaic of perceptibly different types, such as a forest adjacent to a grassland, the edge is the location where the two types adjoin. In a continuous landscape, such as a forest giving way to open woodland, the exact edge location is fuzzy and is sometimes determined by a local gradient exceeding a threshold, such as the point where the tree cover falls below thirty-five percent.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} grass by grazing affects the woody plant {{component}} of woodland systems in two major ways. Grasses compete with woody plants for {{water in the}} topsoil and removal by grazing reduces this competitive effect, potentially boosting tree growth. In addition to this effect, the removal of fuel reduces both the intensity {{and the frequency of}} fires which may control woody plant species. Grazing animals can have a more direct effect on woody plants by the browsing of palatable woody species. There is evidence that unpalatable woody plants have increased under grazing in savannas. Grazing also promotes the spread of weeds in savannas by the removal or reduction of the plants which would normally compete with potential weeds and hinder establishment. In addition to this, cattle and horses are implicated in the spread of the seeds of weed species such as Prickly Acacia (Acacia nilotica) and Stylo (Stylosanthes spp.). Alterations in savanna <b>species</b> <b>composition</b> brought about by grazing can alter ecosystem function, and are exacerbated by overgrazing and poor land management practices.|$|E
25|$|El Paraíso is {{situated}} {{near the mouth}} of the Chillón River Valley and is 2km from the Pacific Ocean. The temperature averages at 70°F ranging from 55°F to 90°F. El Paraíso is a river valley, which provides rich resources and is surrounded by barren desert land. There is a large flood plain near the site, which supports the growth of cotton fields. The Pacific Ocean brings the Humboldt Current through, creating rich and diverse marine life as well as lush tropical vegetation. The Humboldt Current most likely provided an extremely important food source before the advent of agriculture on the coast. Due to the lack of geologic and climatic evidence, it is assumed that the current climate on the Peru Coast is much {{the same as it was}} 4–5000 years ago. Studies conducted by Reitz et al. found mollusc remains which indicated at least two major El Niño events took place during the occupation of El Paraíso. El Niño would have affected the abundance, diversity and <b>species</b> <b>composition</b> of available resources. Most likely, El Niño only affected two separate human life-times and there is evidence that people subsisted from remaining marine life and the lush vegetation which El Niño brings to desert lands.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Environmental {{conditions}} in distinct tropical rainforest phytophysiognomies {{can act as}} regional filters in determining the distribution of montane bryoflora likewise, local filters inherent to phorophyte species can have modulating influences. We analyzed the bryophyte communities in three phytophysiognomies of Atlantic Forest, {{in order to examine}} the influences of local (phorophyte species) and regional (forest phytophysiognomies) filters on their distributions. The study was undertaken in the Serra do Mar State Park, Ubatuba, SP, Brazil, using 1 ha plots in three forest phytophysiognomies along an elevational gradient. Four phorophyte species were selected, with three to seven replicates each. The line-intercept method was used on each phorophyte for collecting botanical material. Multivariate analyses were used to correlate species distributions with environmental filters. A total of 71 taxa were identified. Mean bryophyte coverage did not vary among the different phytophysiognomies, and although their <b>species</b> <b>compositions</b> were markedly distinct, no cohesive or isolated groups were found. Among the local filters examined, phorophyte DBH was found to be correlated with bryophyte coverage; the pH of the bark of Euterpe edulis and the high rugosity of the trunk of the Cyatheaceae influenced <b>species</b> <b>compositions.</b> Other filters not evaluated here may also be relevant for determining species distributions...|$|R
