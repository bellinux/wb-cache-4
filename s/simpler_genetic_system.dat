40|$|The {{distribution}} {{of variation in}} a quantitative trait and its underlying {{distribution of}} genotypic diversity can both be shaped by stabilizing and directional selection. Understanding either distribution is important, because it determines a population’s response to natural selection. Unfortunately, existing theory makes conflicting predictions about how selection shapes these distributions, and very little pertinent experimental evidence exists. Here we study a <b>simple</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>system,</b> an evolving RNA enzyme (ribozyme) in which a combination of high throughput genotyping and measurement of a biochemical phenotype allow us to address this question.

40|$|We {{describe}} a <b>genetic</b> <b>system</b> for monitoring {{the activity of}} a specific proteolytic enzyme {{by taking advantage of}} the properties of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL 4. The GAL 4 protein contains two separable and functionally essential domains: the amino-terminal DNA binding domain and the carboxyl-terminal transcriptional activating domain. We constructed two hybrid proteins by inserting between the DNA binding domain and the activation domain of GAL 4 either (i) a self-cleaving protease (3 C protease of a picornavirus, coxsackievirus B 3) or (ii) a mutant form of the protease that is unable to cleave. We show that, although the hybrid protein containing the mutant protease activates transcription of GAL 1 -lacZ reporter gene, the hybrid protein bearing the wild-type protease is proteolytically cleaved and fails to activate transcription. Our approach to monitor the proteolytic activity could be used to develop <b>simple</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>systems</b> to study other proteases...|$|R

The breakpoint junctions of these rearrangements often contain small overlapping sequences called "microhomology," yet the genetic pathway(s) responsible have yet to be defined. We report a <b>simple</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>system</b> to detect microhomology-mediated repair (MHMR) events after a DNA double-strand break (DSB) in budding yeast cells. MHMR using > 15 bp operates as a single-strand annealing variant, requiring the non-essential DNA polymerase subunit Pol 32. MHMR is inhibited by sequence mismatches, but independent of extensive DNA synthesis like break-induced replication. However, MHMR using less than 14 bp is genetically distinct from that using longer microhomology and far less efficient for the repair of distant DSBs. MHMR catalyzes chromosomal translocation almost as efficiently as intra-chromosomal repair. The results suggest that the intrinsic annealing propensity between microhomology sequences efficiently leads to chromosomal rearrangements...|$|R

We report that expression of wild-type hMLH 1 protein causes an approx. 19 -fold increase in mutation rates. The mutator phenotype {{was due to the}} ability of hMLH 1 protein to interact with bacterial MutL and MutS proteins, thereby interfering with the formation of complexes between MMR proteins and mismatched DNA. Conversely, expression of proteins encoded by alleles deriving from hereditary-non-polyposis-colon-cancer (HNPCC) families decreases mutation rates, depending on the specific amino acid substitutions.

Wild-type cells are biflagellate, but “uni ” mutations result in failure of some centrioles (basal bodies) to assemble cilia (flagella).

Phosphorylation of the Uni 2 protein is reduced in uni 1 mutant cells. Immunogold electron microscopy showed that the Uni 2 protein localizes at the distal end of the basal body where microtubule transition occurs. These results provide the first mechanistic insights into the function of UNI 1 and UNI 2 genes in the pathway mediating assembly of doublet microtubules in the axoneme from triplet microtubules in the basal body template. ...|$|R

A DHR 96 null mutant displays increased sensitivity to the sedative effects of phenobarbital and the pesticide DDT as well as defects in the expression of many phenobarbital-regulated genes.

Predictions were based on sheep management practices such as lambing, weaning, sheep/paddock rotation, anthelmintic treatment, the use of controlled release devices (capsules) for anthelmintic delivery and daily meteorological records to determine the development and survival of infective larvae (L 3) on pasture. Evolution of drug resistance was determined by a <b>simple</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>system</b> which allowed for up to three genes, each with two alleles, to give a maximum of 27 genotypes associated with one drug or three genotypes for each of three drugs. The model was validated against egg counts, L 3 counts on pasture and host mortalities observed in a grazing trial, however, aspects of the model such as the development of drug resistance and use of the model in a variety of climatic zones have yet to be tested against field observations. The model was used to examine the impact of grazing management and capsule use on anthelmintic resistance and sheep production over 20 years using historical weather data. Predictions indicated that grazing management can play a dominant role in parasite control and that capsule use will reduce sheep mortalities and production losses, and in some circumstances will not cause a substantial increase in anthelmintic resistance for up to 5 years...|$|R
40|$|Proteins on gamete {{surfaces}} are major determinants of fertilization success, particularly in free-spawning animals. Molecular analyses of these <b>simple</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>systems</b> show rapid evolution, positive selection, accelerated coalescence and, sometimes, extensive polymorphism. Careful {{analysis of the}} behavior of sperm produced by males with different gamete alleles shows that these alleles can deliver sig-nificant functional differences. Three forms of allele-specific fertilization advantage have been shown: assortative mating based on gamete type, rare allele advantage and hetero-zygote superiority. Models suggest that sperm and egg proteins may be coevolutionary partners that can alternate between directional selection for high fertilization ability and cyclic adaptation of eggs and sperm driven by sexual conflict. These processes act within allopatric populations and may accelerate their divergence if gamete adaptations in separate demes reduce cross-fertilization. Reproductive character displacement by reinforcement may play a diversifying role when previously allopatric populations rejoin. In circum-stance that might prove to be common, divergence in sympatry can be driven by sexual conflict or by association of mating types with ecological differences. The ecology of fertilization, especially the degree of sperm competition and egg death via polyspermy, are important determinants of the strength and direction of selection on gametes. Free-spawning animals allow careful analysis of gamete recogni-tion-from the behavior of adults and interactions of gametes, to molecular patterns of allele divergence.

This fungus was first used for {{studying}} changes in the wood chemistry and structure of Shorea (Shorea obtusa).

Wood blocks of Shorea were exposed to monokaryons and dikaryons under in vitro condition and biodegradation took place over a 12 -week-period. Shorea wood block degradation was determined by (1) wood weight loss (2) Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and (3) Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the degradation of Shorea wood blocks by monokaryons and dikaryons was 57. 48 and 55. 73 %, respectively. The FTIR analyses showed that the Shorea wood blocks degraded by the monokaryons and dikaryons were differed in their chemical components (aromatic, C-H and C-O). The results also suggested that the lignin and carbohydrates were decayed. Meanwhile, the C-O, C-O-H and C-H groups were decreased, revealing that hemicelluloses and cellulose polymers were broken down by hydrolytic enzymes during fungal growth. SEM was used to observe the physical changes of the Shorea wood blocks and it showed that the wood cells were changed. In conclusion, Cambodian P. linteus monokaryons are more appropriated for the paper industry (biopulping and bio-breaching) and enzyme technology than dikaryons, due to monokaryons leave no dark pigments and residues from the fruiting bodies.

40|$|The genetic {{architecture}} of many phenotypic traits {{is such that}} genes often contribute to multiple traits, and mutations in these genes can therefore affect multiple phenotypes. These pleiotropic interactions often manifest as tradeoffs between traits where improvement in one property entails a cost in another. The life cycles of many pathogens include periods of growth within a host punctuated with transmission events, such as passage through a digestive tract or a passive stage of exposure in the environment. Populations exposed to such fluctuating selective pressures are expected to acquire mutations showing tradeoffs between reproduction within and survival outside of a host. We selected for individual mutations under fluctuating selective pressures for a ssDNA microvirid bacteriophage by alternating selection for increased growth rate with selection on biophysical properties of the phage capsid in high-temperature or low-pH conditions. Surprisingly, none of the seven unique mutations identified showed a pleiotropic cost; they all improved both growth rate and pH or temperature stability, suggesting that single mutations even in a <b>simple</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>system</b> can simultaneously improve two distinct traits. Selection on growth rate alone revealed tradeoffs, but some mutations still benefited both traits.

In {{the context of}} mating system evolution, we evaluated the potential consequences of hybridization by studying the variation in sexual phenotype and prezygotic fertility. Firstly, {{as a result of}} hybridization between the two sexual systems, gender variation may arise depending on the relative importance of genes with large versus small phenotypic effects. We thus qualitatively examined the extent of gender variation within and among individual hybrids in comparison with both parental species. Secondly, if hybridization breaks up co-adapted gene complexes, hybrid fertility may be reduced in comparison with both parental species. Therefore, we also quantified male and female prezygotic fertility in parental species and their hybrids in order to test for reduction in hybrid fitness. A total of 89 sexually mature individuals (20 F. spiralis, 40 F. vesiculosus, 10 hermaphrodite hybrids and 19 dioecious hybrids) were sampled in two geographically distant regions (France and Portugal) and six conceptacles per individual were observed. Within-individual variation was very restricted qualitatively – only one hybrid carried a conceptacle with a different sexual phenotype from the five others – as well as quantitatively. This suggests a <b>simple</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>system</b> for sex determination involving a few genes with major effects. In addition, analyses showed no significant decrease in hybrid fertility compared with parental species. Moreover, hybrids exhibited all sexual phenotypes, suggesting several generations of hybridization and backcrossing and, therefore, that hybrids are reproductively successful. Finally, the occurrence of sterile paraphyses in female and hermaphrodite individuals was interpreted as a relic of male function and suggests that, as in higher plants, evolution from hermaphroditism to dioecy may be the most parsimonious pathway...|$|R

To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying sexual development, which involves many genes, generating multiple gene disruptants is required. However, the number of transformation markers available for C. cinerea is limited. This problem would be solved by establishing marker recycling.

A set of complete diallel crosses was made using six cultivars as the parents which differed in ability of callus growth and plant regeneration. The Vr/Wr graphical analysis showed that there were epistasis, or interaction among nonallelic genes for callus growth. As to ability of plant regeneration, no epistasis existed in the subdiallel without P 1 (J 232) which showed high specific combining ability, and it was controlled by a <b>simple</b> additive dominance <b>genetic</b> <b>system.</b> The mean degree of dominance(0. 42) was relatively low and the broad(0. 86) and narrow(0. 78) sense heritabilities were high. オオムギ培養細胞の再分化の制御や細胞選抜の実用化に寄与するために、植物体再分化能の遺伝様式を解析した。未熟胚培養系においては世界各地の 99 品種についてカルス生長量及び植物体再分化能の調査を行ったところ、両形質共に連続的な変異を示し、複数の遺伝子あるいは微動遺伝子が関与していることが推察された。カルス生長量及び植物体再分化能の遺伝様式を調べるために、 6 品種で正逆総当たり交雑を行い、ダイアレル分析を行った。カルス生長量については、非対立遺伝子間の相互作用（エピスタシス）があると推察された。一方、植物体再分化能については、特定組み合わせ能力が高かったP 1 （J 232 ）を除いた副ダイアレルの分析によって、植物体再分化能の遺伝変異は主として遺伝子の相加効果によるものと推察され、その平均優性度は 0. 42 であった。遺伝率の推定値は狭義で 0. 78 、広義で 0. 86 といずれも高かった...|$|R

40|$|Pili of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are virulence-associated organelles (1) whose {{expression}} and variation {{depend on a}} seemingly <b>simple</b> yet versatile <b>genetic</b> <b>system</b> (2, 3). Its structural elements are an expressed complete pilin gene (pilE) 1 and 16 or more partial (5 '-deleted), silent pilin genes (pilS), whose homologous regions separate stretches of divergent sequence that range from 18 to> 70 by (4) in length. Pilus+ (P +) cells undergo "antigenic " change when their pilE receives a newpilS oligonucleotide stretch and comes to encode a novel functional pilin polypeptide (1, 5 - 8). When a nonsense or missense mutation is created in the newly constituted pilE, a "defective " pilin polypeptide is expressed, no pili are formed, and piliation "phase " changes to pilus- (9 -) (9, 10). Such recombinations usually leave the participating pilS unaltered (5, 7), though reciprocal pilE-pilS exchanges have been observed in gonococci grown on medium with DNase (11). Missense or nonsense P- variants spawn P + progeny when their pilE mutation is "corrected, usually by recombinational replacement of the mutated region with the corresponding portion of yet another pilS (7, 9, 10). Thus, pilus phase and antigenic changes reflect the same process (12, 13) ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} an Escherichia coli <b>genetic</b> <b>system</b> that permits bacterial genetic methods {{to be applied}} to the study of essentially any prokaryotic or eukaryotic site-specific DNA binding protein. It consists of two parts. The first part is a set of tools that facilitate construction of customized E. coli strains bearing single copy lacZYA reporters that are repressed by a specific target protein. The second part is a pair of regulatable protein expression vectors that permit in vivo production of the target protein at levels appropriate for genetic experiments. When expressed in a properly designed reporter strain, the target protein represses the lac genes, resulting in an E. coli phenotype that can be quantitatively measured or exploited in large scale genetic screens or selections. As a result, large plasmid-based libraries of protein genes or pools of mutagenized variants of a given gene may be examined in relatively <b>simple</b> <b>genetic</b> experiments. The strain construction technique is also useful for generating E. coli strains bearing reporters for other types of <b>genetic</b> <b>systems,</b> including repression-based and activation-based systems in which chimeric proteins are used to examine interactions between foreign protein domains...|$|R
40|$|Exploring {{the forces}} that drive {{evolution}} at the gene network level and investigating underlying principles behind this process are fundamental questions {{in the context of}} understanding how evolution shapes transcriptional circuits. In this thesis I present two different explorations along these lines with special emphasis on the contribution of gene dosage variations to the alteration of phenotypes. On one hand I describe the design of an experimental system for observing evolution in vivo in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the construction of a <b>simple</b> two-component <b>genetic</b> <b>system</b> and how I used the setup to explore its adaptative capabilities. An external inducer allowed me to tune the basal state of the system and by doing this I was able to tune the relative contribution of gene duplications and point mutations to the evolution of the system against an imposed fitness defect. This illustrates how the number of evolutionary solutions available against an imposed fitness constraint depends on the operating point of the underlying circuit. Increasing in complexity I then describe an analysis of the effect of gene dosage variations {{in the context of the}} galactose uptake network in the same organism. This network is composed of four regulatory elements and it contains several feed- back loops built into it, which makes its analysis nontrivial. The effect of dosage variations was explored experimentally by systematically deleting one of two copies of each regulatory gene in a diploid background. Surprisingly the system turned out to be invariant to proportional changes in all its regulatory elements, a property that we call network-dosage invariance. I developed a modeling framework for rationalizing these observations and found that the presence of both an activator and inhibitor interacting with a 1 -to- 1 stochiometry as well as certain topological constraints are requirements for such a behavior. This provides insight into what kind of regulatory circuits are robust to global effects like genomic duplications events, ploidy changes or global variations in the concentration of transcription factors. This work could be extended to the study of more complicated circuits, allowing the systematic exploration of evolutionary properties of small scale <b>genetic</b> <b>systems.</b> by Bernardo Fabián Pando.
