The regularization of the self force is done using the recently-proposed Mode Sum Regularization Prescription. In all cases the <b>self</b> force <b>acting</b> on the charge is repulsive. We find that in the scalar case the force is quadratic in {{the mass of the}} shell, and is a second post-Newtonian effect. For the electric case the force is linear in the shell's mass, and is a first post-Newtonian effect. When the charge is outside the shell our results correct the known zero self force in the scalar case or the known repulsive, inverse-cubic force law in the electric case, for the finite size of the shell.

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{presents}} a theoretical analysis {{and discussion of}} the theory of gerotranscendence, formulated by Lars Tornstam (University of Uppsala, Sweden). The theory is presented as a meta-theory of ageing, as a theory of universal and general ageing processes. Ageing is seen as an urge (a drive) towards a less engaged posititon in the wordly life, moving towards a higher degree of transcendence, with a more cosmic outlook and another definition of reality. In this article the theory is discussed from another theoretical position; Ageing seen in a cultural gerontological perspective, as a varied culturally and historically situated phenomenon – differing in different times and different cultures. The theoretical perspective underlines that ageing is complex dialectical processes, an intertwined interplay between individual development and cultural change. The varied individual ageing processes are not seen as the result of «drives». In Western post-modern cultures the ageing processes are becoming manifold, often contradictory. Elderly present versions of the selves that are becoming complex, multiplied (multiple <b>selves),</b> <b>acting</b> at different scenes, stamped by varied cultural values, presenting mixed versions of activity and passivity, engagement and retractment, wordliness and transcendence.

40|$|A sociological {{approach}} to self and identity {{begins with the}} assumption that there is a reciprocal relationship between the self and society (Stryker, 1980). The self influences society through the actions of individuals thereby creating groups, organizations, networks, and institutions. And, reciprocally, society influences the self through its shared language and meanings that enable a person to take the role of the other, engage in social interaction, and reflect upon oneself as an object. The latter process of reflexivity constitutes the core of selfhood (McCall & Simmons, 1978; Mead, 1934). Because the self emerges in and is reflective of society, the sociological {{approach to}} understanding the self and its parts (identities) means that we must also understand the society in which the <b>self</b> is <b>acting,</b> and {{keep in mind that the}} <b>self</b> is always <b>acting</b> in a social context in which other selves exist (Stryker, 1980). This chapter focuses primarily on the nature of self and identity from a sociological perspective, thus some discussion of society is warranted. The nature of the self and what individuals do depends to a large extent on the society within which they live. In general, sociologists are interested in understanding the nature of society or social structure: its forms and patterns, the ways in which it develops and is transformed.

The right distance between liquid level and the cantilever must be kept. A camera with high resolution and macro objective is used to acquire an image. Camera image is then calibrated to suppress distortions and scene position with respect to camera position. Length conversion coefficient is also computed. Object recognition and distance measurement is based on standard computer vision methods, mainly: adaptive thresholding, moments, image statistics, canny edge detector, Hough transform… Proposed algorithms have been implemented in C++ using Intel OpenCV library.

40|$|We {{present a}} new, simple method for calculating the scalar, electromagnetic, and {{gravitational}} <b>self</b> forces <b>acting</b> on particles {{in orbit around}} a Kerr black hole. The standard ``mode-sum regularization'' approach for self-force calculations relies on a decomposition of the full (retarded) perturbation field into multipole modes, followed by {{the application of a}} certain mode-by-mode regularization procedure. In recent years several groups have developed numerical codes for calculating black hole perturbations directly in 2 + 1 dimensions (i. e., decomposing the azimuthal dependence into $m$-modes, but refraining from a full multipole decomposition). Here we formulate a practical scheme for constructing the self force directly from the 2 + 1 -dimensional $m$-modes. While the standard mode-sum method is serving well in calculations of the self force in Schwarzschild geometry, the new scheme should allow a more efficient treatment of the Kerr problem.

40|$|Building on the {{philosophy}} of Charles Sanders Peirce, recent advances in biosemiotics have resulted into a concise framework {{for the analysis of}} signs in living systems. This paper explores the potential for economics and shows how biosemiotics can integrate two different research agendas, each of which are also connected with biological theories, namely neuroeconomics and the theory of networks. I introduce the triadic conceptual framework established by Peirce which distinguishes between object, sign and interpretant and the corresponding causal forces in evolving hierarchical systems. This framework is used to systematize recent results of neuroeconomics {{in the form of the}} dual selves approach, following early contributions of James Coleman, partitioning the individual into the <b>acting</b> <b>self</b> and the object self. This distinction implies that there is a fundamental information asymmetry between the two selves. Against this background, the semeiotic process is an information generating and processing dynamics, which is driven by the internal selection of classificatory schemes of actions chosen and the population level dynamics of sign selection, with mimetic behavior as a driver. This can be further analyzed by means of the theory of signal selection. A central insight is that the internal information gap between <b>acting</b> <b>self</b> and object self implies a systematic role of sign processing in social networks for any kind of consumer choice. I exemplify my approach with empirical references to food consumption as a most universal and simple form of consumer choice...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>self</b> force <b>acting</b> on a {{particle}} endowed with scalar charge, which is held static (with respect to an undragged, static observer at infinity) outside a stationary, axially-symmetric black hole. We {{find that the}} acceleration due to the self force {{is in the same}} direction as the black hole's spin, and diverges when the particle approaches the outer boundary of the black hole's ergosphere. This acceleration diverges more rapidly approaching the ergosphere's boundary than the particle's acceleration in the absence of the self force. At the leading order this self force is a (post) $^ 2 $-Newtonian effect. For scalar charges with high charge-to-mass ratio, the acceleration due to the self force starts dominating over the regular acceleration already far from the black hole. The self force is proportional to the rate at which the black hole's rotational energy is dissipated. This self force is local (i. e., only the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force and the local coupling to Ricci curvature contribute to it). The non-local, tail part of the self force is zero.
