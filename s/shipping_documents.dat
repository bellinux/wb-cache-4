25|$|An {{illustration}} {{of the burden of}} proof is given in Howard Marine and Dredging Co Ltd v A Ogden & Sons (Excavations) Ltd, where a shipping company told a client that its barge for hire would hold 1600 tonnes. This is what the Lloyd's Register of ships said. But the ships own documents, accessible to the shipping company, said the barge could only take 1055. The Court of Appeal (Lord Denning MR dissenting) held that in preferring a more convenient source (the Lloyd's Register) over another (the <b>shipping</b> <b>documents),</b> the shipping company had not been reasonable. It was up to the shipping company to positively prove this, and in the circumstances looking to the register was not reasonable. It is likely that a company's own standards and practices will be relevant to what constitutes reasonable grounds for a belief.|$|E

Analysis was done by a review of the technical and non-technical factors, because the scene of the ship accident was not purely due to technical factors but also non-technical factors. The first step is analyzing the <b>ship</b> <b>document,</b> such as the certificate of ship from classification, incident reports, docking report, ship crew certificates and other <b>ship</b> <b>document.</b> Then on the next step, the evidence that has been obtained from the analysis of the documents related to the  ship sail is use to make the analysis using 5 whys method to looking for the root cause. According to the analysis that has been done, the technical cause of the leak vessel caused by system shafting system is reconditioned flange bolts that have been damaged and the addition of flax on the bearing shaft has to cope without straightening axle deflection itself.
