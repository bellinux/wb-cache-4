40|$|Measurements of NO(x) {{and ozone}} {{performed}} during the NOXAR project are compared with {{results from the}} coupled chemistry-climate models ECHAM 4. L 39 (DLR) /CHEM and GISS-model. The measurements are based on flights between Europe and the East coast of America and between Europe and the Far East in the latitude range 40 deg N to 65 deg N. The comparison concentrates on tropopause altitudes and reveals strong longitudinal variations of seasonal mean NO,, of 200 pptv. Either model reproduced strong variations 3 km below {{but not at the}} tropopause, indicating a strong missing NO(x) or NO(y) sink over remote areas, e. g. NO(x) to HNO 3 conversion by OH from additional OH sources or HNO 3 wash-out. Vertical profiles show maximum NO(x) values 2 - 3 km below the tropopause with a strong seasonal cycle. ECHAM 4. L 39 (DLR) /CHEM reproduces a maximum, although located at the tropopause with a less pronounced seasonal cycle, whereas the GISS model reproduces the seasonal cycle but not the profile's shape due to its coarser vertical resolution. A comparison of NO(x) frequency distributions reveals that both models are capable of reproducing the observed variability, except that ECHAM 4. L 39 (DLR) /CHEM shows no very high NO(x) mixing ratios. Ozone mean values, vertical profiles and frequency distributions are much better reproduced in either model, indicating that the NO(x) frequency distribution, namely the most frequent NO(x) mixing ratio, is more important for the tropospheric photochemical ozone production than its mean value. Both models show that among all sources, NO(x) from lightning contributes most to the seasonal cycle of NO(x) at tropopause altitudes. The impact of lightning in the upper troposphere on NO(x) does not vary strongly with altitude, whereas the impact of surface emissions decreases with altitude. However, the models show significant differences in lightning induced NO(x) concentrations, especially in winter, which {{may be related to the}} different treatment of the lower <b>stratospheric</b> <b>coupling</b> between dynamics and chemistry...|$|E

40|$|The {{radiative}} {{balance of the}} stratosphere is examined {{in the light of}} the possible sensitivity of tracers to small changes in the diabatic heating. A comprehensive radiative transfer algorithm is developed on the basis of accurate and efficient methods for use in <b>coupled</b> <b>stratospheric</b> models of chemistry, dynamics, and radiative transfer, and the individual components of the code are validated against available line-by-line calculations. Finally, the results of different approximations commonly employed in radiative transfer algorithms are compared, and their effects on tracer transport are evaluated using a 2 D ozone model...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} here that surface ozone {{concentrations}} at the South Pole in the austral summer decreased by 17 {{percent over the}} period 1976 - 90. Over the same period, solar irradiance at the South Pole in January and February decreased by 7 percent {{as a result of}} a 25 percent increase in cloudiness. It is suggested that the trend in the summer ozone concentrations is caused by enhanced photochemical destruction of ozone in the lower troposphere caused by the increased penetration of UV radiation associated with <b>stratospheric</b> ozone depletion, <b>coupled</b> with enhanced transport of ozone-poor marine air from lower latitudes to the South Pole...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to increase winter rainfall and flooding in many extratropical regions as evaporation and precipitation rates increase, storms become more intense and storm tracks move polewards. Here, we show how changes in stratospheric circulation could {{play a significant role in}} future climate change in the extratropics through an additional shift in the tropospheric circulation. This shift in the circulation alters climate change in regional winter rainfall by an amount large enough to significantly alter regional climate change projections. The changes are consistent with changes in stratospheric winds inducing a change in the baroclinic eddy growth rate across the depth of the troposphere. A change in mean wind structure and an equatorward shift of the tropospheric storm tracks relative to models with poor <b>stratospheric</b> resolution allows <b>coupling</b> with surface climate. Using the Atlantic storm track as an example, we show how this can double the predicted increase in extreme winter rainfall over Western and Central Europe compared to other current climate projection...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the daytime}} {{location}} of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) crest derived from GPS observations at low latitude over China during the 2005 – 2006 stratospheric sudden warming (SSW), a quasi- 16 -day periodic meridional movement of EIA crest with the maximum amplitude of about 2 degrees relative to the average location of EIA crest has been revealed. In addition, periodic variations that are in phase with the meridional EIA movement are also revealed in the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) and F 2 layer peak height (hm F 2) over Chinese ionosonde stations Haikou and Chongqing. The quasi- 16 -day periodic component in Dst index is weak, and the 16 -day periodic component {{does not exist in}} F 10. 7 index. Such large-scale periodic meridional movement of EIA crest is likely related to the globally enhanced <b>stratospheric</b> planetary waves <b>coupled</b> with anomalous <b>stratospheric</b> zonal wind connected with SSW. In addition, such large-scale periodic movement of EIA should be global, and can affect the ionospheric morphology around the low-latitude belt near the EIA region. Further case analysis, simulation and theoretical studies must proceed {{in order to understand the}} periodic movements of EIA connected with the different periodic atmospheric variations...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} stratosphere-resolving atmospheric model, with interactive <b>stratospheric</b> ozone chemistry, <b>coupled</b> to ocean, sea ice {{and land}} components {{is used to}} explore the tropospheric and surface impacts of large springtime ozone anomalies in the Arctic stratosphere. Coupling between the Antarctic ozone hole and Southern Hemisphere climate has been identified in numerous studies, but connections of Arctic ozone loss to surface climate have been more difficult to elucidate. Analyzing an ensemble of historical integrations with all known natural and anthropogenic forcings specified over the period 1955 – 2005, we find that extremely low stratospheric ozone changes are able to produce large and robust anomalies in tropospheric wind, temperature and precipitation in April and May over large portions of the Northern Hemisphere (most notably over the North Atlantic and Eurasia). Further, these ozone-induced surface anomalies are obtained {{only in the last}} two decades of the 20 th century, when high concentrations of ozone depleting substances generate sufficiently strong stratospheric temperature anomalies to impact the surface climate. Our findings suggest that coupling between chemistry and dynamics is essential for a complete representation of surface climate variability and climate change not only in Antarctica but also in the Arctic.

40|$|Analysis {{of model}} output from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5) reveals that, in the zonal mean, the near-term {{projections}} of summertime changes of precipitation in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) subtropics are very widely scattered among the models. As a consequence, {{over the next}} 50 years, the CMIP 5 multimodel mean projects no statistically significant trends in the SH subtropics in summer. This appears to {{be at odds with}} the widely reported, and robust, poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zones {{by the end of the}} twenty-first century. This discrepancy between the shorter- and longer-term projections in SH summer, as shown here, rests in the recovery of the ozone hole in the coming decades, as a consequence of the Montreal Protocol. This is explicitly demonstrated by analyzing model experiments with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, version 4 (WACCM 4), a high-top model with interactive <b>stratospheric</b> chemistry, and <b>coupled</b> to land, ocean, and sea ice components. Contrasting WACCM 4 integrations of the representative concentration pathway 4. 5 with and without trends in surface concentrations of ozone-depleting substances allows for demonstrating that stratospheric ozone recovery will largely offset the induced “wet gets wetter and dry gets drier” projections and the accompanying poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zone in the SH. The lack of near-term statistically significant zonal-mean changes in the SH hydrological cycle during summer is of obvious practical importance for many parts of the world, and it might also have implications for the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic continent...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of downward propagation mechanisms that <b>couple</b> <b>stratospheric</b> disturbances to the troposphere motivated {{the study of}} processes that can influence these stratospheric regimes. The dependence of the variability on the amplitude of the tropospheric wave forcing was studied on a stratosphere-mesosphere model, showing the atmosphere {{to be at a}} transition phase between the two regimes, with potential large amplification of the response to small perturbations.;The recent discovery of transient luminous events (TLEs) such as sprites motivated the systematic study of the response of the middle atmosphere model to increasingly complex idealised ozone perturbation experiments. Within radioactively driven regions, the response of the middle atmosphere was found to be linear on the magnitude of the ozone reduction, within the location and time of the perturbation. In dynamically controlled regions, localised ozone perturbations (e. g. the ozone hole) could induce larger non-local responses compared to an equivalent uniform ozone change. Impulsive perturbations were found to be more capable of inducing changes to the variability compared to the equivalent forcing that was constant in time.;The first estimates of the chemical impact of sprites were obtained using satellite data. Sprites were shown to cause no significant NOx or ozone changes at a global level, but to induce up to tens of percentage changes in NOx at 50 to 70 km height over active sprite-producing thunderstones, in reasonable agreement with ion-chemistry model estimates. Sprite ozone changes were found to be 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than the weakest ozone perturbation needed to induce significant responses in the model...|$|R
40|$|Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are {{critical}} elements for polar ozone depletion. A new PSC model <b>coupling</b> <b>stratospheric</b> chemistry, microphysics and climate is constructed {{and the formation}} of STS (Super-cooled Ternary Solution) and NAT (Nitric-Acid Trihydrate) PSCs are explored STS particle properties are dominated by thermodynamics. Simulations of particle volumes and size distributions are generally within the observational error bars. STS particles are not in equilibrium with their environment when the particle surface area is smaller than 4 μm 2 /cm 3. A new nucleation rate equation for NAT is derived based on observed denitrification in the 2010 - 2011 Arctic winter. The homogeneous nucleation scheme leads to supermicron NAT particles as observed. The simulated the lidar backscatter, and denitrification are generally within observational error bars. However, the simulations are very sensitive to temperature. Using the same STS and NAT schemes, as well as a prognostic treatment for ice PSC formation and dehydration, the PSCs are simulated during the Antarctic winter of 2010. The current model correctly simulates large NAT particles and denitrification, but cannot produce NAT with high backscattering ratio/number density sometimes observed by CALIPSO. However, our simulated ice has similar backscatter and depolarization which is often attributed to NAT by CALIPSO. Possibly the CALIPSO algorithm misclassifies ice as NAT when the stratosphere is denitrified or dehydrated. STS and NAT form near the pole in May and June, but form a ring outside 80 ˚S later in the winter when polar HNO 3 is depleted. Ice always forms in the coldest area, but becomes less abundant later in the winter. The model is missing some processes forming NAT such as gravity waves or evaporating ice. These processes should be added to the model in the future...|$|R
