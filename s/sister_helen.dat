25|$|Schultz {{was born}} to German Jewish {{immigrants}} Herman and Emma (Neu) Flegenheimer, who had married in Manhattan on November 10, 1900. He had a younger <b>sister,</b> <b>Helen,</b> born in 1904. Herman Flegenheimer apparently abandoned his family, and Emma is listed as divorced in the 1910 census. (In her 1932 petition for U.S. citizenship, however, she wrote {{that her husband had}} died in 1910.) The event traumatized Schultz, and he always denied his father had left them. Schultz would drop out of school in the eighth grade to help support himself and his mother. From 1916 to 1919, he worked as a feeder and pressman for the Clark Loose Leaf Company, Caxton Press, American Express, and Schultz Trucking in the Bronx. He then worked at a neighborhood night club owned by a minor mobster, and began robbing craps games before turning to burglary. Schultz was caught breaking into an apartment and sent to the prison on Blackwell's Island (now called Roosevelt Island). A photograph of Schultz at age 18, during his incarceration, was published in the 2010 book New York City Gangland.|$|E
