40|$|This report {{describes}} how in-tank measurements of moisture (H{sub 2 }O) and {{total organic carbon}} (TOC) are used to calculate combustible waste fractions (CWF) for 138 of the 149 Hanford single shell tanks. The combustible waste fraction of a tank is defined as that proportion of waste {{that is capable of}} burning when exposed to an ignition source. These CWF estimates are used to <b>screen</b> <b>tanks</b> for the organics complexant safety issue. Tanks with a suitably low fraction of combustible waste are classified as safe. The calculations in this report determine the combustible waste fractions in tanks under two different moisture conditions: under current moisture conditions, and after complete dry out. The first fraction is called the wet combustible waste fraction (wet CWF) and the second is called the dry combustible waste fraction (dry CWF). These two fractions are used to <b>screen</b> <b>tanks</b> into three categories: if the wet CWF is too high (above 5 %), the tank is categorized as unsafe; if the wet CWF is low but the dry CWF is too high (again, above 5 %), the tank is categorized as conditionally safe; finally, if both the wet and dry CWF are low, the tank is categorized as safe. Section 2 describes the data that was required for these calculations. Sections 3 and 4 describe the statistical model and resulting fit for dry combustible waste fractions. Sections 5 and 6 present the statistical model used to estimate wet CWF and the resulting fit. Section 7 describes two tests that were performed on the dry combustible waste fraction ANOVA model to validate it. Finally, Section 8 presents concluding remarks. Two Appendices present results on a tank-by-tank basis...|$|R

40|$|Interim {{storage of}} alkaline, {{high-level}} radioactive waste, from {{two generations of}} spent fuel reprocessing and waste management activities, {{has resulted in the}} accumulation of 238 million liters of waste in Hanford Site single and double-shell tanks. Before the 1990 `s, the stored waste was believed to be: (1) chemically unreactive under its existing storage conditions and plausible accident scenarios; and (2) chemically stable. This paradigm was proven incorrect when detailed evaluation of tank contents and behavior revealed a number of safety issues and that the waste was generating flammable and noxious gases. In 1990, the Waste Tank Safety Program was formed to focus on identifying safety issues and resolving the ferrocyanide, flammable gas, organic, high heat, noxious vapor, and criticality issues. The tanks of concern were placed on Watch Lists by safety issue. This paper summarizes recent progress toward resolving Hanford Site high-level radioactive waste tank safety issues, including modeling, and analyses, laboratory experiments, monitoring upgrades, mitigation equipment, and developing a strategy to <b>screen</b> <b>tanks</b> for safety issues...|$|R

2500|$|As in the {{previous}} instalments, Stuart Craig and Stephenie McMillan provided the film's art and set designs, respectively. Due to the film's scope, there were many new sets and transformations of old sets created. McMillan was most excited about redesigning the Great Hall for the scenes involving the Yule Ball. [...] "Originally we thought silver curtains, silver table cloths and an ice dance floor," [...] said McMillan, [...] "but it just went on and on. The drapes man eventually said, 'Why not just stick the fabrics on the wall?'" [...] Each task of the Triwizard Tournament required massive sets. The rock quarry set for the first task, where Harry faces off with the Hungarian Horntail, was built in two sections at Leavesden Studios. Craig called it [...] "one of the biggest sets we've ever built {{for any of the}} films." [...] For the second task, involving the film's underwater scenes, the film crew designed and built a blue <b>screen</b> <b>tank</b> holding [...] "about half a million gallons of water." [...] As for the final task, which took place in the maze, hedge walls ranging from 20 to 40 feet tall were constructed and enhanced with computer-generated imagery.|$|R
50|$|The game {{allows for}} up to ten players in any {{combination}} of human and computer players. The number of games played in a set is chosen before the game (default is 20 games). New terrain is randomly drawn {{at the start of}} each individual game, and the tanks fall one by one into their start positions in random order, evenly spaced horizontally on the <b>screen.</b> The <b>tanks</b> then take turns firing at opponent tanks, order going left to right, until only one tank remains.|$|R

50|$|Reverse osmosis is a water {{purification}} technology {{that uses a}} semipermeable membrane to remove ions, molecules, and larger particles from drinking water. Currently, reverse osmosis is the technology by which water reuse is made possible, in conjunction with filtering methods for larger solids (e.g., <b>screens</b> and settling <b>tanks),</b> other techniques for removing smaller particulates (e.g., aeration to allow bacteria to metabolize the suspended matter), and chlorination to kill any remaining harmful bacteria. Reverse osmosis can also remove dissolved solids, color, pesticides, nutrients, and pathogens.|$|R
40|$|A {{septic tank}} is a {{traditional}} wastewater treatment technology that uses an underground tank to hold and treat wastewater. As wastewater flows into the tank, heavier materials settle {{to the bottom and}} form a sludge layer, while lighter greases and fats float to the top, forming a scum layer. Clarified effluent is piped {{from the center of the}} tank and into a drainfield, where it percolates into the surrounding soil. An effluent screen (Figure 1) is a physical device that is placed on the outlet pipe of the septic tank to enhance solids removal from the septic tank effluent. In addition, by preventing excess solids from flowing out into the drainfields with the clarified effluent, these screens help to prevent blockages that can damage the drainfield. Finally, in some cases, a thin layer of organic growth called a “biomat ” may build up on the screen. This biomat is rich in anaerobic bacteria, which can help to remove viruses and pathogens from the effluent.

40|$|In this Bureau of Mines investigation, {{production}} was monitored for 1 year at over 30 coalbed gas-drainage boreholes located in Alabama, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Results {{indicate that the}} quality of data gathered from such wells can be improved greatly if potential problems are anticipated and prevented {{in the early stages of}} well production. Major water-monitoring problems include solids buildup, freezing, the presence of gas in surface waterlines, and improper pumping interval settings. Such problems may be avoided by incorporating in the original well design waterline filters, sand <b>screens,</b> separator <b>tanks,</b> and systems to automatically control pumping intervals. Problems related to measurement of coalbed gas flow include large quantities of water vapor contained in the gas, especially during winter months; freezing and subsequent obstruction of flow; sudden, uncontrolled release of gas pressure; and solids buildup in metering equipment. The installation of commercially available items, such as filters, separators, and insulation, and the thoughtful application of a basic knowledge of coalbed gas reservoir characteristics will prevent most production-monitoring problems...|$|R
