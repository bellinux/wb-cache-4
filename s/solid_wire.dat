5|$|A related process, {{flux-cored}} {{arc welding}} (FCAW), uses similar equipment but uses wire {{consisting of a}} steel electrode surrounding a powder fill material. This cored wire is {{more expensive than the}} standard <b>solid</b> <b>wire</b> and can generate fumes and/or slag, but it permits even higher welding speed and greater metal penetration.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored, {{self-shielding}} or gasless wire-fed welding {{had been}} developed for simplicity and portability. This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an inert shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for <b>solid</b> <b>wire.</b> The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than inert, so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (inert gas shield). This limits the process to steel and not aluminium.|$|E
25|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>wire</b> {{consists}} of one strand of copper metal wire, bare or {{surrounded by an}} insulator. Single-strand copper conductors are typically used as magnet wire in motors and transformers.

50|$|Over time, many {{of these}} {{terminations}} with <b>solid</b> aluminum <b>wire</b> began to fail due to improper connection techniques and the dissimilar metals having different resistances and significantly different coefficients of thermal expansion, as well as problems with properties of the <b>solid</b> <b>wires.</b> These connection failures generated heat under electrical load and caused overheated connections.|$|R
50|$|A {{braided wire}} is {{composed}} {{of a number of}} small strands of wire braided together. Similar to stranded wires, braided wires are better conductors than <b>solid</b> <b>wires.</b> Braided wires do not break easily when flexed. Braided wires are often suitable as an electromagnetic shield in noise-reduction cables.|$|R
25|$|The AWG {{tables are}} for a single, solid, round conductor. The AWG of a {{stranded}} wire {{is determined by the}} cross-sectional area of the equivalent solid conductor. Because there are also small gaps between the strands, a stranded wire will always have a slightly larger overall diameter than a <b>solid</b> <b>wire</b> with the same AWG.|$|E
25|$|A solid-core cable uses one <b>solid</b> <b>wire</b> per {{conductor}} {{and in a}} four pair cable {{there would}} be a total of eight solid wires. Stranded conductor uses multiple wires wrapped around each other in each conductor and in a four pair with seven strands per conductor cable, {{there would be a}} total of 56 wires (2 per pair × 4 pairs × 7 strands).|$|E
25|$|AWG gauges {{are also}} used to {{describe}} stranded wire. In this case, it describes a wire which is equal in cross-sectional area to the total of all the cross-sectional areas of the individual strands; the gaps between strands are not counted. When made with circular strands, these gaps occupy about 10% of the wire area, thus requiring a wire about 5% thicker than equivalent <b>solid</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
50|$|Twist-on {{connectors}} are {{not often}} used on wire gauges thicker than AWG #10 (5.26 mm²), because such <b>solid</b> <b>wires</b> are too stiff to be reliably connected with this method. Instead, set screw connectors, clamps or crimp connectors are used.|$|R
50|$|For smaller branch {{circuits}} with <b>solid</b> <b>wires</b> (15A/20A circuits) typical connections of {{an electrical}} wire to an electrical device are usually made by wrapping the wire around a screw on the device, also called a terminal, and then tightening the screw.

The {{thickness of the}} wire is based on amperage requirements in conjunction with safe operating temperatures. <b>Solid</b> <b>wire</b> is used for smaller diameters; thicker diameters are stranded to provide flexibility. Conductor types include non-metallic/non-metallic corrosion-resistant cable (two or more insulated conductors with a nonmetallic outer sheath), armored or BX cable (cables are surrounded by a flexible metal enclosure), metal clad cable, service entrance cable, underground feeder cable, TC cable, fire resistant cable, and mineral insulated cable, including mineral-insulated copper-clad cable.

40|$|The information-carrying {{capacity}} of optical fields is usually stated {{in terms of}} an area density as being related to communication through a surface. We render these well-understood results in a form such that they can be interpreted as a volume-density limit, applicable to an arbitrary array of points communicating with one another. An important example of such a situation is an optically interconnected computing system. We show that regardless of their actual spread or mutual overlap, optical communication links may be viewed as <b>solid</b> <b>wires</b> of minimum cross section X 2 / 21 r for the purpose of calculating bounds on volumes and cross sections. Thus the results of area-volume complexity theory for <b>solid</b> <b>wires</b> are also applicable to optically communicating systems. The maximum number of binary pulses that may be in transit in an optical communication network occupying volume V is found to be p 2 irV/A 3, p denoting the modulation bandwidth normalized by the carrier frequency.

5000|$|Most of the {{problems}} related to aluminum wire are typically associated with older (pre-1972) AA-1350 alloy <b>solid</b> aluminum <b>wire,</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "old technology" [...] aluminum wiring, as the properties of that wire result in significantly more expansion and contraction than copper wire or modern day AA-8000 series aluminum <b>wire.</b> Older <b>solid</b> aluminum <b>wire</b> also had some problems with a property called creep, which results in the wire permanently deforming or relaxing over time under load.|$|R

50|$|Stranded wire is {{composed}} {{of a number of}} small wires bundled or wrapped together to form a larger conductor. Stranded wire is more flexible than <b>solid</b> <b>wire</b> of the same total cross-sectional area. Stranded wire tends to be a better conductor than <b>solid</b> <b>wire</b> because the individual wires collectively comprise a greater surface area. Stranded wire is used when higher resistance to metal fatigue is required. Such situations include connections between circuit boards in multi-printed-circuit-board devices, where the rigidity of <b>solid</b> <b>wire</b> would produce too much stress as a result of movement during assembly or servicing; A.C. line cords for appliances; musical instrument cables; computer mouse cables; welding electrode cables; control cables connecting moving machine parts; mining machine cables; trailing machine cables; and numerous others.|$|E
50|$|At high frequencies, current travels {{near the}} surface of the wire because of the skin effect, {{resulting}} in increased power loss in the wire. Stranded wire might seem to reduce this effect, since the total surface area of the strands is greater than the surface area of the equivalent <b>solid</b> <b>wire,</b> but ordinary stranded wire does not reduce the skin effect because all the strands are short-circuited together and behave as a single conductor. A stranded wire will have higher resistance than a <b>solid</b> <b>wire</b> of the same diameter because the cross-section of the stranded wire is not all copper; there are unavoidable gaps between the strands (this is the circle packing problem for circles within a circle). A stranded wire with the same cross-section of conductor as a <b>solid</b> <b>wire</b> is said to have the same equivalent gauge and is always a larger diameter.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{experimental study}} was undertaken {{to examine the}} suitability of pulsed current {{gas metal arc welding}} of 12 mm thick P 91 steels in groove joint configurations with metal cored filler wire. Both the single and multipass welds showed satisfactory bead morphology, tensile strength and toughness especially at higher groove angles of 60 and 750 for the selected range of welding current and speeds. The weld metal compositions showed considerably high presence of Ni, Mn and Si with little loss of other alloying elements. The weld properties were primarily affected by the heat input per unit length of weld and the groove angle. The maximum ultimate tensile strength and toughness of the welds were found to be around 845 MPa and 125 J, respectively, for a heat input of 1. 38 kJ/mm and a groove angle of 75 degrees. The use of metal cored filler wires could enhance the welding speed by 20 % and filler wire deposition rate by 42 % compared to that with the <b>solid</b> <b>wires.</b> Overall, the present study showed that the pulsed current gas metal arc welding of medium to high thickness P 91 steels using metal cored filler wires could provide higher deposition rate and welding speed, and enhanced weld bead properties in comparison to <b>solid</b> <b>wires.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier B.
