40|$|Abstract. In the {{development}} of a three-dimensional measurement system, binocular stereo matching is the most important and difficult. In the basis of introducing selective principles of matching algorithm, a new stereo matching algorithm for binocular vision is put forward that is named noncoded difference measuring distance. The algorithm effectively grapples with the problem of searching for the coincidence relation of raster and can efficiently and accurately obtain three-dimensional world coordinates of the entities. Experiment results show that this 3 D measuring machine can effectively measure the 3 D <b>solid</b> <b>profile</b> of free surface. During the evaluation test for accuracy, scan a standard plane. Fit all 3 D points in one plane, and then the flatness value of this plane is obtained. The flatness value of the standard plane has been ultimately measured as: ± 0. 0462 mm, this measuring accuracy can completely satisfy the requirements of rapid prototyping or CNC machining, it as well as achieves the stated accuracy (± 0. 05 mm) ...|$|E

The image becomes a function of time because the sensor body is moving. From this function, we extract features of contacting object. We classified the possible movements of sensor by means of degrees of freedom. Then we formulated the available information from them. Through several experiments, we confirmed that by simple movements of the sensor body and by a simple temporal correlation calculus we can obtain shapes, surface normals, and edges of the contacting object...|$|E

40|$|In {{chemical}} looping combustion systems, accurate {{measurement of}} the solid circulation rate (SCR) is crucial for optimising the system performance. Conventionally, the SCR is predicted using the riser total pressure drop leading to an overestimation of up to 70 %. In this work, a model has been proposed for the SCR prediction using the pressure drop at the top section of the riser.

40|$|Thickening is the {{separation}} of suspended solid particles from a liquid by gravity settling. As a feed stream enters the thickener, the solids settle to the bottom. Clarified liquid overflows the top and the settled solids (underflow) is removed. Thickeners are widely used in the minerals and metal processing industry. To assist in the monitoring and control of thickeners a conductivity probe has been developed. Test work was carried out on a concentrate thickener at the Copper Cliff, Ontario Division of Inco Limited in Sudbury. The conductivity probe is a multicell arrangement. It exploits the difference in conductivity between liquid, slurry and settled <b>solids.</b> A conductivity <b>profile</b> is collected which locates the interfaces (liquid/slurry, slurry/settled solids) by detecting the change in conductivity, The conductivity profile can be readily converted to a <b>solids</b> concentration <b>profile</b> using a model due to Maxwell.

40|$|Abstract––In extrusion, {{the desired}} shape is {{obtained}} by plastic deformation of the billet material achieved by forcing {{it through a}} die. In any simple homogeneous and uniaxial compression (or tension), the metal flows plastically when the stress reaches {{the value of the}} flow stress. Once the applied force exceeds the shear strength of the material, sticking friction at the container surface becomes the dominant friction mode, and deformation takes place through shear in the bulk of the material. Non homogeneous metal flow through an extrusion die can directly affect product quality, productivity and die life. The complexity of a die profile is an indicator of {{how difficult it is to}} extrude the profile. Some investigations about the effect of die complexity on extrusion pressure, product quality and die life can be found in this published literature. However the effect of profile complexity on metal flow through the extrusion die has not been explored much. such a study can directly contribute toward die design improvement and reduction of extrusion defects related to metal flow. This article investigates the effect of shape complexity on the dead metal zone(DMZ) and metal flow through cold extrusion experiments and finite element simulations on some <b>solid</b> <b>profiles.</b> Experiments were performed using flat face dies & conical dies of different complexities and different billet materials. A 2 D & 3 D finite element simulations were carried out to perform these operations. One significant conclusion is that currently existing definitions of extrusion shape complexity cannot satisfactorily explain the variation in DMZ size under different conditions. The factors such as die profile symmetry and extrusion ratio may play a significant roles in the formation of DMZ and distortion of metal flow through the die.

These differential operators are of fundamental importance for the computation of the viscous drag and the viscous/diffusive terms in the momentum and energy equations. It has been proved that close to the boundaries some of the mirroring techniques leads to intrinsic inaccuracies in the convergence of the differential operators.
