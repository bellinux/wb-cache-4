5|$|The {{story begins}} as Mr. and Mrs. Mallard fly over various {{potential}} {{locations around the}} city of Boston, Massachusetts (United States) to start a family. Each time Mr. Mallard selects a location, Mrs. Mallard finds something wrong with it. Tired from their search, the mallards land at the Public Garden Lagoon to spend the night. In the morning, a swan boat passes by the mallards. The mallards mistake the swan boat for a real bird and enjoy peanuts thrown by {{the people on the}} boat. Mrs. Mallard suggests that they build their nest in the Public Garden. However, just as <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>this,</b> her husband is nearly run down by a passing bicyclist. The mallards continue their search, flying over Boston landmarks such as Beacon Hill, the Massachusetts State House, and Louisburg Square. The Mallards finally decide on an island in the Charles River. From this island, the Mallards visit a policeman named Michael on the shore, who feeds them peanuts every day.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{researchers}} {{maintain that}} people only engage in survival sex {{when they have}} no other options. Psychologist and anti-prostitution activist Melissa Farley, writing in the New York Times, says that prostitution is nearly always coercive and lacking in full consent. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>this</b> is the biggest issue, not simple inequalities between buyers and sellers, nor health and safety risks. Farley says women rarely have viable alternative means of paying for the basic needs {{of themselves and their}} loved ones. Farley argues that even having the [...] "job option" [...] is immoral because it will most likely hurt women who are very vulnerable (psychologically, economically, or otherwise). Farley says for women looking to survive, the experience can be traumatizing, and she describes it as [...] "Becoming objects for masturbation". She also warns that the men who pay for prostitution the most are usually the most violent towards women.|$|E
2500|$|Anime News Network had six editors {{review the}} first episode of the anime adaptation: Lynzee Loveridge {{compared}} the series to The Asterisk War and while she considered the Chivalry characters to be more likeable, she was critical of the blended in CG artwork and considered Stella's becoming Ikki's servant to be [...] "cringe-worthy"; Nick Creamer expressed criticism towards the episode and called it a [...] "concentrated capsule of hoary clichés"; Hope Chapman called the episode's plot [...] "soul-suckingly lame" [...] and considered Asterisk as a much nicer series; Rebecca Silverman wrote that {{the first episode}}'s plot was already done by Asterisk and Lance N' Masques and while she praises Stella for some initial character development, <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>this</b> gets lost with her [...] "tsundere ranting"; and Zac Bertschy said that the anime is [...] "a total waste of [...] time, but it serves a purpose, however unintentional.". The sixth reviewer, Theron Martin, agreed that [...] "formulaic and generic" [...] wouldn't be wrong ways to describe the story and he also praised Stella's underlying motivations. Martin concluded that while the series has potential, it needs to find [...] "fresher angles" [...] to stand out from other similar storylines. Silverman reviewed the anime's future episodes; she called the final episode [...] "a triumphant one in terms of Ikki's battle against his own insecurities, his place at school, and his relationship with Stella", and would later go {{on to say that}} she was [...] "pretty happy with this ending and [...] wouldn't be sad if another season materialized somewhere along the way." ...|$|E

6000|$|But it was {{not written}} in the Book of Fate that {{stripped}} and battered Eblis should die that night as Gehenna died. After the burial of the books {{it was found that}} the several fires on her were manageable, that she [...] "was not making water aft of the damage," [...] which meant two-thirds of her were, more or less, in commission, and, best of all, that three boilers were usable in spite of the cruiser's shells. So she [...] "shaped course and speed to make the least water and the most progress towards land." [...] On the way back the wind shifted eight points without warning--it was this shift, if you remember, that so embarrassed Cripple and Paralytic on their homeward crawl--and, what with one thing and another, Eblis was unable to make port till the scandalously late hour of noon on June 2, [...] "the mutual ramming having occurred about 11.40 P.M. on May 31."

"It's beautiful, the way {{she draws}} you out," [...] Verena had said to her mother; [...] "there's {{something}} so searching {{that the first time}} I visited her it quite realised my idea of the Day of Judgement. But she seems to show all that's in herself at the same time, and then you see how lovely it is. She's just as pure as she can live; you see if she is not, when you know her. She's so noble herself that she makes {{you feel as if you}} wouldn't want to be less so. She doesn't care for anything but the elevation of our sex; if she can work a little toward that, it's all she asks. I can tell you, she kindles me; she does, mother, really. She doesn't care a speck what she wears--only to have an elegant parlour. Well, she has got that; it's a regular dream-like place to sit. She's going to have a tree in, next week; she says she wants to see me sitting under a tree. I believe it's some oriental idea; it has lately been introduced in Paris. She doesn't like French ideas as a general thing; but <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>this</b> has more nature than most. She has got so many of her own that I shouldn't think she would require to borrow any. I'd sit in a forest to hear her bring some of them out," [...] Verena went on, with characteristic raciness. [...] "She just quivers when she describes what our sex has been through. It's so interesting to me to hear what I have always felt. If she wasn't afraid of facing the public, she would go far ahead of me. But she doesn't want to speak herself; she only wants to call me out. Mother, if she doesn't attract attention to me there isn't any attention to be attracted. She says I have got the gift of expression--it doesn't matter where it comes from. She says it's a great advantage to a movement to be personified in a bright young figure. Well, of course I'm young, and I feel bright enough when once I get started. She says my serenity while exposed to the gaze of hundreds is in itself a qualification; in fact, she seems to think my serenity is quite God-given. She hasn't got much of it herself; she's the most emotional woman I have met, up to now. She wants to know how I can speak the way I do unless I feel; and of course I tell her I do feel, so far as I realise. She seems to be realising all the time; I never saw any one that took so little rest. She says I ought to do something great, and she makes me feel as if I should. She says I ought to have a wide influence, if I can obtain the ear of the public; and I say to her that if I do it will be all her influence." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here {{the points}} to be noted are, first, the violent {{movement}} of the sticks, which the men could hardly hold; next, the physical agitation of the men. The former point {{is illustrated by the}} confession of a civil engineer writing in the 'Times.' This gentleman had seen the rod successfully used for water; he was asked to try it himself, and he determined that it should not twist in his hands 'if an ocean rolled under his feet.' Twist it did, however, in spite of all his efforts to hold it, when he came above a concealed spring. Another example is quoted in the 'Quarterly Review,' vol. xxii. p. 374. A narrator, in whom the editor had 'implicit confidence,' mentions how, when a lady held the twig just over a hidden well, 'the twig turned so quick as to snap, breaking near her fingers.' There seems to be no indiscretion in saying, as the statement has often been printed before, that the lady spoken of in the 'Quarterly Review' was Lady Milbanke, mother of the wife of Byron. Dr. Hutton, the geologist, is quoted as a witness of her success in the search for water with the divining rod. He says that, in an experiment at Woolwich, 'the twigs twisted themselves off below her fingers, which were considerably indented by so forcibly holding the rods between them.' {186} Next, the violent excitement of the four young men of the Mauganja is paralleled by the physical experience of the lady quoted in the 'Quarterly Review.' 'A degree of agitation was visible in her face when she first made the experiment; <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>this</b> agitation was great' when she began to practise the art, or whatever we are to call it. Again, in 'Lettres qui decouvrent l'illusion' (p. 93), we read that Jacques Aymar (who discovered the Lyons murderer in 1692) se sent tout emu--feels greatly agitated--when he comes on that of which he is in search. On page 97 of the same volume, the body of the man who holds the divining rod is described as 'violently agitated.' When Aymar entered the room where the murder, to be described later, was committed, 'his pulse rose as if he were in a burning fever, and the wand turned rapidly in his hands' ('Lettres,' p. 107). But the most singular parallel to the performance of the African wizard must be quoted from a curious pamphlet already referred to, a translation of the old French 'Verge de Jacob,' written, annotated, and published by a Mr. Thomas Welton. Mr. Welton {{seems to have been a}} believer in mesmerism, animal magnetism, and similar doctrines, but the coincidence of his story with that of the African sorcerer is none the less remarkable. It is a coincidence which must almost certainly be 'undesigned.' Mr. Welton's wife was what modern occult philosophers call a 'Sensitive.' In 1851, he wished her to try an experiment with the rod in a garden, and sent a maid-servant to bring 'a certain stick that stood behind the parlour door. In great terror she brought it to the garden, her hand firmly clutched on the stick, nor could she let it go [...] . ' The stick was given to Mrs. Welton, 'and it drew her with very considerable force to nearly the centre of the garden, to a bed of poppies, where she stopped.' Here water was found, and the gardener, who had given up his lease as there was no well in the garden, had the lease renewed.|$|E
