2500|$|The {{basking shark}} {{is the only}} member of the family Cetorhinidae, part of the {{mackerel}} shark order Lamniformes. Gunnerus was the first to describe and name the species Cetorhinus maximus from a specimen found in Norway. The genus name Cetorhinus comes from the Greek ketos which means marine monster or whale and rhinos meaning nose; the species name maximus is from Latin and means [...] "greatest". In the following centuries there were more attempts at naming: Squalus isodus, in 1819 by Italian Zoologist Saverio Macri (17541848); [...] Squalus elephas, by Lesueur in 1822; Squalus rashleighanus, by Couch in 1838; Squalus cetaceus, by Gronow in 1854; Cetorhinus blainvillei by the Portuguese Biologist Felix Antonio De Brio Capello (18281879) in 1869; Selachus pennantii, by Cornish in 1885; Cetorhinus maximus infanuncula, by the Dutch Zoologists Antonius Boudewijn Deinse (18851965) and Marcus Jan Adriani (19291995) in 1953; and finally Cetorhinus maximus normani, by Siccardi in 1961. Other names include bone shark, elephant shark, hoe-mother (sometimes contracted to homer), sail-fish, and <b>sun-fish.</b>|$|E
60|$|After we {{have walked}} {{a mile or}} so more, we find that our noisy friend has quieted down very much indeed. It is a little wider, and it may be it is a little deeper, but it flows along very placidly between its low banks.

60|$|But this {{luminosity}} is {{not entirely}} confined to the minute creatures of the sea. Some fish have the power of emitting light. Some species of the shark emit a greenish light; and the <b>sun-fish</b> is said, when seen down in the sea on a dark night, to glow like a white-hot cannon-ball. Fish when dead and putrid frequently glow in the dark with a truly magnificent light, as can be proved by every one who will take the trouble to procure several kinds of fish, and keep them, {{for the purpose of}} proving the fact, in a dark closet.|$|E
60|$|Of Radiata, {{there were}} the Sea Chestnut or Egg (Echinus granulatus), {{commonly}} divested of its spines; flat circular shells (Scutella parma?) covered with chocolate-colored spines, but becoming smooth and white, with five petal-like figures; a few Star-fishes or Five-fingers (Asterias rubens); and <b>Sun-fishes</b> or Sea-jellies (Aurelioe).|$|R
60|$|It enhances {{our sense}} of the grand {{security}} and serenity of nature, to observe the still undisturbed economy {{and content of the}} fishes of this century, their happiness a regular fruit of the summer. The Fresh-Water <b>Sun-Fish,</b> Bream, or Ruff, Pomotis vulgaris, as it were, without ancestry, without posterity, still represents the Fresh-Water <b>Sun-Fish</b> in nature. It is the most common of all, and seen on every urchin's string; a simple and inoffensive fish, whose nests are visible all along the shore, hollowed in the sand, over which it is steadily poised through the summer hours on waving fin. Sometimes there are twenty or thirty nests {{in the space of a}} few rods, two feet wide by half a foot in depth, and made with no little labor, the weeds being removed, and the sand shoved up on the sides, like a bowl. Here it may be seen early in summer assiduously brooding, and driving away minnows and larger fishes, even its own species, which would disturb its ova, pursuing them a few feet, and circling round swiftly to its nest again: the minnows, like young sharks, instantly entering the empty nests, meanwhile, and swallowing the spawn, which is attached to the weeds and to the bottom, on the sunny side. The spawn is exposed to so many dangers, that a very small proportion can ever become fishes, for beside being the constant prey of birds and fishes, a great many nests are made so near the shore, in shallow water, that they are left dry in a few days, as the river goes down. These and the lamprey's are the only fishes' nests that I have observed, though the ova of some species may be seen floating on the surface. The breams are so careful of their charge that you may stand close by in the water and examine them at your leisure. I have thus stood over them half an hour at a time, and stroked them familiarly without frightening them, suffering them to nibble my fingers harmlessly, and seen them erect their dorsal fins in anger when my hand approached their ova, and have even taken them gently out of the water with my hand; though this cannot be accomplished by a sudden movement, however dexterous, for instant warning is conveyed to them through their denser element, but only by letting the fingers gradually close about them as they are poised over the palm, and with the utmost gentleness raising them slowly to the surface. Though stationary, they keep up a constant sculling or waving motion with their fins, which is exceedingly graceful, and expressive of their humble happiness; for unlike ours, the element in which they live is a stream which must be constantly resisted. From time to time they nibble the weeds at the bottom or overhanging their nests, or dart after a fly or a worm. The dorsal fin, besides answering the purpose of a keel, with the anal, serves to keep the fish upright, for in shallow water, where this is not covered, they fall on their sides. As you stand thus stooping over the bream in its nest, the edges of the dorsal and caudal fins have a singular dusty golden reflection, and its eyes, which stand out from the head, are transparent and colorless. Seen in its native element, it is a very beautiful and compact fish, perfect in all its parts, and looks like a brilliant coin fresh from the mint. It is a perfect jewel of the river, the green, red, coppery, and golden reflections of its mottled sides being the concentration of such rays as struggle through the floating pads and flowers to the sandy bottom, and in harmony with the sunlit brown and yellow pebbles. Behind its watery shield it dwells far from many accidents inevitable to human life.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} the effects of a commonly used preservation technique on mercury con-centration in fish tissue. After fixing fish muscle tissue in formalin followed by preservation in iso-propanol, we found that mercury concentration in fish muscle tissue increased by 18 %, reaching an asymptote after 40 days. We used formalin– isopropanol-preserved longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis) from the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History to examine histori-cal changes and predict current mercury concen-trations in fish from two rivers in southeastern Oklahoma. Glover River was free-flowing, while Mountain Fork River was impounded in 1970 and a coldwater trout fishery was established upstream from the collection site in 1989. Mercury con-centrations in longear sunfish from Glover River showed no historical changes from 1963 to 2001. Mercury concentrations in longear sunfish from Mountain Fork River showed no change from 1925 to 1993 but declined significantly from 1993 to 2003. We also compared mercury concentra-tions of the most recently collected longear <b>sun-fish</b> in the museum to mercury concentrations of unpreserved fish collected from the rivers in 2006...|$|E
40|$|The <b>sun-fish</b> Lepomis {{responds}} to a moving system of stripes by a motion of its body. By changing {{the velocity of}} motion of the stripe system different flicker frequencies can be produced and thus the relation of flicker frequency to critical intensity of illumination can be studied. Threshold illumination varies with flicker frequency {{in such a way}} that with increasing flicker frequency the intensity of illumination must be increased to produce a threshold response in the fish. The curve of critical illumination as a function of frequency is made up of two distinct parts. For an intensity range below 0. 04 millilambert and flicker frequencies below 10 per second, the rods are in function. For higher intensities and flicker frequencies above 10, the cones come into play. The maximum frequency of flicker which can be perceived by the fish's eye is slightly above 50 per second. The flicker curve for the eye of Lepomis can easily be compared with that for the human eye. The extent of the curve for the fish is greater at low illuminations, the fish being capable of distinguishing flicker at illuminations lower than can the human eye. The transition of rod vision to cone vision occurs for the fish and for the human eye at the same intensity and flicker frequency. The maximum frequency of flicker which can be perceived is for both about the same...|$|E
40|$|From {{the data}} of {{experiments}} with bees in which threshold response is employed {{as a means of}} recognizing visual discrimination between stripes of equal width alternately illuminated by intensities I 1 and I 2, it is shown that the detectable increment of intensity ΔI, where ΔI = I 2 - I 1, is directly proportional to σI 2 (I 1 being fixed). From tests of visual acuity, where I 1 = 0 and the width of the stripes is varied, σI 2 = kI 2 + const.; here I 2 = ΔI, and ΔI/I 2 = 1. When the visual excitability of the bee is changed by dark adaptation, λI ≡ kΔI (= k' σΔI) = k'' I + const. For the measurements of critical illumination at threshold response to flicker, σI 2 (= σΔI) = k I 2 = k' ΔI + const. The data for critical illumination producing threshold response to flicker in the <b>sun-fish</b> Lepomis show for the rods σI 2 = K I 2 for the cones σI 2 = K'(I 2 + const.). The data thus indicate that in all these experiments essentially the same visual function is being examined, and that the recognition of the production of a difference in effect by alternately illuminated stripes takes place {{in such a way that}} d (ΔI) /d (σI 2) = const., and that ΔI is directly proportional to I (or "I 2," depending on the nature of the experiment). It is pointed out that the curve for each of the cases considered can be gotten equally well if mean I or σI is plotted as a function of the independent variable involved in the experiment. Certain consequences of these and related facts are important for the treatment of the general problem of intensity discrimination...|$|E
