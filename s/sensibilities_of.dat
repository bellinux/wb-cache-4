5|$|At {{this time}} {{operations}} were in train {{to drive the}} Japanese back to Salamaua. Once again, the difficulties of supplying the attacking force were formidable. Out of sensitivity towards the <b>sensibilities</b> <b>of</b> the Americans, Herring left the command arrangements between Major General Stanley Savige's 3rd Division and units of the American 41st Infantry Division ambiguous. This backfired, producing acrimony between the Australian and American commanders. Herring prepared to fire Savige, but an investigation by Major General Frank Berryman determined that the dispute was not Savige's fault.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Cromwell's rule and the {{subsequent}} Restoration, Smith manoeuvred to protect his position and to further his essentially Puritan religious stance, which he modified to suit the religious <b>sensibilities</b> <b>of</b> the new Royalist regime. He achieved this in part by creating an eponymous trust whereby some of his Irish property {{was used for the}} purpose of financing the education of children and provided scholarships for the most promising of those to continue their studies at Trinity College, Dublin. However, there have been claims that this trust was intended primarily to protect his interests in land, of which some was obtained by dubious interpretation of law.|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} about getting inside the <b>sensibility</b> <b>of</b> the archaic past. [1] Can {{we get into}} the {{creative}} mind of the painter of The Sorcerer? Can we reconstruct the <b>sensibility</b> <b>of</b> prehistoric humans? Can we recover the humor of the prehistoric artist? Can we do it? After all, sense equipment is the same in men and women of all ages, and though each age inflects its sense usages uniquely, there should remain an underlying continuity among sensibilities. Shouldn't we be able to return into earlier forms of those usages? Can we tell whether we have been successful in accomplishing that return? Can just getting inside the <b>sensibility</b> <b>of</b> the past be of use to us in our own quest for humanity?[2] Or is there some other justification for a regression into the <b>sensibility</b> <b>of</b> the past? I tackle those questions here...|$|R

5|$|During the season, Robinson pursued {{potential}} major-league interests. The Boston Red Sox held a tryout at Fenway Park for Robinson {{and other}} black players on April 16. The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist <b>sensibilities</b> <b>of</b> powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore Muchnick. Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson {{was subjected to}} racial epithets. Robinson left the tryout humiliated, and more than fourteen years later, in July 1959, the Red Sox became the last major league team to integrate its roster.|$|E
5|$|Karan Mahal (Public Audience Hall) {{was built}} by Karan Singh in c.1680 to mark his victory over the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.

It has stained glass windows and intricately carved balconies built in stone and wood fluted columns. Later Rajas, Anup Singh and Surat Singh, also added lot of glitter to this palace with inlaid polychrome glass, intricate mirror patterns, and red and gold paint. In the coronation chamber, there is a shored up alcove, which was used as a throne.|$|E
5|$|Since then, interpretations in {{successive}} eras {{have reflected}} the <b>sensibilities</b> <b>of</b> the time. Goya {{was seen as}} a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Traditional open {{literature}} about protection systems documents {{the use of}} residual currents or voltages (zero sequence components) and negative sequence components of currents or voltages to detect and protect the different power system elements against unbalanced conditions, as an option {{to the use of}} phase quantities.

This contribution details the results of experimental studies conducted to evaluate the <b>sensibility</b> <b>of</b> response of zero and negative sequence component protection functions under unbalanced conditions against the response to phase quantities.

5|$|For many scholars, {{the scene}} at 6.34 seems to {{anticipate}} and parallel the confrontation between Theodosius and Ambrose in 390; Erasmus used the two situations as parallel exempla in a letter written to Francis I in 1523. That later event has been taken as evidence against Philip's Christianity. Even in the later 4th century, {{in a society that}} had already been significantly Christianized, the argument goes, Theodosius' humiliation had shocked the <b>sensibilities</b> <b>of</b> the aristocratic elite. It is therefore inconceivable that 3rd century aristocrats, members of a society that had experienced only partial Christianization, would accept such self-abasement from their emperors. Shahîd contests this parallel, and argues that Philip's scene was far less humiliating than Theodosius': it did not take place against the same background (Theodosius had massacred seven thousand Thessalonicans some months before), no one was excommunicated (Theodosius was excommunicated for eight months), and it did not involve the same dramatic and humiliating dialogue between emperor and bishop. Philip made a quick repentance at a small church {{on his way back to}} Rome from the Persian front, a stark contrast to the grandeur of Theodosius' confrontation with Ambrose.|$|E

This product line aims to teach aspects of American history through a six-book series {{from the perspective of a}} girl living in that time period. Although the books are written for girls who are at least eight years old, they endeavor to cover significant topics such as child labor, child abuse, poverty, racism, slavery, animal abuse and war in manners appropriate for the understanding and <b>sensibilities</b> <b>of</b> their young audience.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultural}} background and erudition {{of her family}} members served to ignite the imaginative faculties of Schiaparelli’s impressionable childhood years.

The content of her writing so alarmed the conservative <b>sensibilities</b> <b>of</b> her parents they sought to tame her fantasy life by sending her to a convent boarding school in Switzerland. Once within the school’s confines, Schiaparelli rebelled against its strict authority by going on a hunger strike, leaving her parents to see {{no alternative but to}} bring her home again.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{effectively}} Alsace-Lorraine was annexed: German law {{applied to}} the region, its inhabitants were conscripted into the Wehrmacht and pointedly the customs posts separating France from Germany were placed back {{where they had been}} between 1871-1918. Similarly, a sliver of French territory in the Alps was under direct Italian administration from June 1940 to September 1943. Throughout the rest of the country, civil servants were under the formal authority of French ministers in Vichy. René Bousquet, the head of French police nominated by Vichy, exercised his power in Paris through his second-in-command, Jean Leguay, who coordinated raids with the Nazis. German laws, however, took precedence over French ones in the occupied territories, and the Germans often rode roughshod over the <b>sensibilities</b> <b>of</b> Vichy administrators.|$|E
25|$|When {{large-scale}} excavations of Pompeii were {{undertaken in}} the 1860s, much of the erotic art of the Romans came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the Roman Empire. They {{did not know what}} to do with the frank depictions of sexuality, and endeavored to hide them away from everyone but upper-class scholars. The movable objects were locked away in the Secret Museum in Naples, and what could not be removed was covered and cordoned off so as to not corrupt the <b>sensibilities</b> <b>of</b> women, children and the working class. England's (and the world's) first laws criminalising pornography were enacted with the passage of the Obscene Publications Act of 1857. Despite their occasional repression, depictions of erotic themes have been common for millennia.|$|E
25|$|The smallest, or Toy variety, was {{developed}} in England in the 18th century. Hunting and working dogs were typically of the standard variety, though some reports suggest that smaller varieties such as the miniature may have been popular for truffle hunting, as their feet {{were less likely to}} damage the delicate fungi. Miniature and Toy varieties tend to be bred primarily for companionship. In the mid to late 19th century, the trade in dyeing and affixing their fur to unusual proportions began with the need to compliment the Victorian and Georgian <b>sensibilities</b> <b>of</b> these women, to the point that their status as a dog of the middle and upper classes was quite solid {{by the time of the}} founding of the Kennel Club in the 1870s as they were one of the first dog breeds registered.|$|E
