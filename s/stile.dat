5|$|Il ritorno, says Carter, {{is clearly}} {{influenced}} by Monteverdi's earlier works. Penelope's lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from L'Arianna, while the martial episodes recall Il combattimento. <b>Stile</b> concitato is {{prominent in the}} fight scenes and in the slaying of Penelope's suitors. In L'incoronazione, Monteverdi represents moods and situations by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; <b>stile</b> concitato represents rage. There is continuing debate about {{how much of the}} extant L'incoronazione music is Monteverdi's original, and how much is the work of others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).|$|E
5|$|The final Halleluja is faster, {{giving up}} the fantasia format for a four-part fugue and in motet style, with all {{instruments}} doubling the voices. The style of the movement recalls the 16th-century <b>stile</b> antico, although the style is still unmistakably Bach's.|$|E

His younger brother Ashford was a contestant on The X Factor 2011 as part of boy band The Risk until they were voted out in Week 5.|$|E

5|$|Christoph Wolff notes a {{similarity}} between the fugue theme and one by Johann Hugo von Wilderer, whose mass Bach had probably copied and performed in Leipzig before 1731. Wilderer's mass also has a slow introduction, a duet as the second movement and a motet in <b>stile</b> antico, similar to late Renaissance music, as the third movement. Bach based the work on a composition in C minor, as mistakes in the copying process show.|$|E
5|$|Other risks {{associated}} with the crinoline were that it could get caught in other people's feet, carriage wheels or furniture, or be caught by sudden gusts of wind, blowing the wearer off their feet. In 1859, while participating in a paper chase, Louisa, Duchess of Manchester, caught her hoop while climbing over a <b>stile,</b> and was left with the entirety of her crinoline and skirts thrown over her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company.|$|E
5|$|The heraldic {{term for}} an X-shaped cross is a 'saltire', {{from the old}} French word saultoir or salteur (itself derived from the Latin saltatorium), a word for both a type of <b>stile</b> {{constructed}} from two cross pieces and a type of cross-shaped stirrup-cord. In heraldic language, it may be blazoned azure, a saltire argent. The tincture of the Saltire can appear as either silver (argent) or white, however the term azure does not refer to a particular shade of blue.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Stiles</b> {{family had}} a long history of ectrodactyly. <b>Stiles</b> was the sixth in a line that began with the birth of William <b>Stiles</b> in 1805.

When not traveling with the carnival the <b>Stiles</b> family lived in Gibsonton, Florida where many other carnival performers lived during the winter season.|$|R

5|$|Plans for Armidas {{performance}} were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo {{died at the}} end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio {{was still}} asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the <b>stile</b> concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy patron of the arts at whose Venetian palace Il combattimento had been performed in 1624.|$|E
5|$|If {{travelling}} in a North-South direction, the Wicklow Way {{begins in}} Marlay Park, a historic demesne {{on the outskirts}} of Dublin's suburbs laid out in the late 18th century by the La Touches, a family of Huguenot merchants and bankers, and later developed as a public park. The trailhead comprises a map board, beside which is a low wall with a stone <b>stile</b> through which walkers pass in order to make their first step on the trail. The Way traverses the park, following a wooded shelterbelt along the Little Dargle River, before emerging on the southern side of the park onto College Road. Passing under the M50 motorway, it ascends Kilmashogue Lane and enters the forest recreation area on Kilmashogue mountain. This is the first of many forest plantations, owned by Coillte, that the Wicklow Way passes through. The tree species in this area comprise Sitka spruce, Scots pine and beech. Much of this initial section of the Way is underlain by granite. The trail circles the mountain, emerging onto open moorland near Fairy Castle. This upland heath and bog habitat is dominated by heather, purple moor grass and bog cotton and supports many bird species, including red grouse, meadow pipit and skylark. The Way crosses a saddle between Two Rock mountain and Kilmashogue before descending from a broad ridge between Two Rock and Tibradden Mountain into the valley of Glencullen where it follows the R116 road to the hamlet of Boranaraltry. The road is flanked by hedgerow-bordered farmland. Ascending from Boranaraltry, the trail crests the shoulder of Prince William’s Seat, at which point the Way leaves County Dublin and enters County Wicklow. The habitat here alternates between blanket bog and upland heath. The trail descends {{to the floor of the}} Glencree valley via Curtlestown Wood where it then enters Lackan Wood and crosses the shoulder of Knockree Hill.|$|E
25|$|<b>STiLE</b> was {{unveiled}} during 2012 Auto Expo and {{was launched in}} July 2013. The vehicle {{was based on the}} Evalia platform and it was manufactured the same plant as that of the Evalia. <b>STiLE</b> was manufactured as a minivan for urban conditions. In the Auto Expo (2012), the prototype <b>STiLE</b> had Ashok Leyland's 1.5-liter engine which was later replaced by K9K (a family of straight-4 turbocharged diesel engines co-developed by Nissan and Renault) that powers the Evalia. Unlike Evalia, which produced 85 bhp, <b>STiLE</b> produced 75bhp. The company had initially planned to introduce a compressed natural gas (CNG) engine along with the conventional diesel engine.|$|E

50|$|When the temperance {{movement}} {{arose in}} the mid-1830s, Captain <b>Stiles</b> disposed of his liquor, transforming his tavern into a temperance house. After Captain <b>Stiles,</b> several innkeepers owned and managed the inn over the years.

The former mortuary, which is now used as a store, is a stone building which was used for laying out the corpses of drowned sailors.|$|E
