5|$|Carlson {{and the two}} companies, with Company B leading, marched west {{towards the}} village of Asamana on the Metapona River. While {{crossing}} the river, the Marines captured two Japanese soldiers and killed a third who happened by in a native boat, then attacked and occupied Asamana, <b>surprising</b> <b>and</b> killing several Japanese soldiers in the village. Signs in Japanese in the village indicated that it was {{being used as a}} rallying location for Shōji's forces. Occupying defensive positions around the village and river crossing, the raiders killed 25Japanese soldiers that approached the village during the remainder of the day.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, a guarded {{carriage}} carrying Prince Charming (Joshua Dallas) and his fiancee, Abigail (Anastasia Griffith), is halted by a roadblock. Charming {{notices a}} fallen tree is blocking the road, {{and that it}} was cut on purpose. The carriage is ambushed by a hooded vagabond, who takes Charming's bag of valuables, including a wedding ring. Charming pursues and knocks the mysterious thief off their horse. He discovers it is a woman, Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin). Before he can get an answer as to why she stole his bag, Snow hits him with a rock, <b>surprising</b> <b>and</b> cutting him to make her escape. Charming vows that he will find her.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, {{just hours}} before Sullivan's arrival, Thompson sent 600 troops {{under the command of}} Colonel Arthur St. Clair toward Trois-Rivières with the goal of <b>surprising</b> <b>and</b> beating back the small British force {{believed}} to be there. Sullivan, on his arrival at Sorel, immediately dispatched Thompson with an additional 1,600 men to follow. These forces caught up with St. Clair at Nicolet, where defenses against troop movements on the river were erected the next day. On the night of June 7, Thompson, St. Clair, and about 2,000 men crossed the river, landing at Pointe du Lac, a few miles above Trois-Rivières.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived on}} 22 July 1718, <b>surprising</b> <b>and</b> trapping a ship commanded by pirate Charles Vane. After negotiations failed, Vane used a captured French vessel as a fireship {{in an attempt}} to ram the naval vessels. The attempt failed, but the naval vessels were forced out of the west end of Nassau harbour, giving Vane's crew an opportunity to raid the town and secure the best local pilot. Vane and his men then escaped in a small sloop via the harbour's narrow east entrance. The pirates had evaded the trap, but Nassau and New Providence Island were in Rogers' hands.|$|E
5|$|While many documentaries {{maintain}} an emotional distance from their subjects, Meerkat Manor – {{due to its}} extended length, soap opera-like narration, romanticization of the animals' lives, and close-up filming techniques, provides a closer, more personal view of the meerkats. Viewers describe being emotionally involved in the animals' lives, sometimes forgetting they are watching a documentary. The meerkats' frequently short lives and brutal deaths become <b>surprising</b> <b>and</b> disturbing to some audiences. This experimental format was seen as expanding the boundaries of both the nature documentary genre {{and the nature of}} reality TV.|$|E
5|$|The German colony at Madang on Kaiser-Wilhelmsland (the New Guinea mainland) was {{occupied}} on 24 September, although the German armed merchant raider SMS Cormoran—which was lurking nearby—escaped undetected. Over {{the next two}} months the remaining outposts were also occupied. Meanwhile, the German East Asiatic Squadron steamed across the Pacific before <b>surprising</b> <b>and</b> sinking a British force off Coronel on 1 November. After rounding Cape Horn into the Atlantic and attempting a raid on the Stanley naval station, the squadron was itself destroyed by a more powerful British force during the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December 1914. Later it was alleged that widespread looting and destruction of civilian property by Australian troops occurred during this period. Indeed, ill-discipline among the Australian force appears to have been an issue—perhaps due to the haste with which the AN had been raised and the poor character of some of those that were enlisted. Claims in the Australian media of criminal behaviour caused considerable controversy at the time, and later led to a parliamentary enquiry. In the end a number of soldiers were court martialled and imprisoned for looting and theft, although more serious allegations, including rape, also arose.|$|E

25|$|Proprioception, the {{kinesthetic}} sense, {{provides the}} parietal cortex {{of the brain}} with information on the movement and relative positions of {{the parts of the}} body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in <b>surprising</b> <b>and</b> deep deficits in perception and action.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{the drama}} was also {{enormously}} popular, from the Queen and Court {{down to the}} commonest of the common people; indeed, the odd polarity of the theatre audience in this period, with the High and the Low favoring the drama, {{and the middle class}} generally more hostile with the growth of Puritan sentiments, is a <b>surprising</b> <b>and</b> intriguing phenomenon. Theatres proliferated, especially (though not exclusively) in neighborhoods outside the city's walls and the Corporation's control in Shoreditch to the north, or the Bankside and Paris Garden in Southwark, on the southern bank of the River Thames: the Curtain, the Rose, the Swan, the Fortune, the Globe, the Blackfrairs a famous roster.|$|E

The Marine detachment fought its way forward to a good position, which it maintained during the night, although subjected to a continuous fire from the Cacos.
