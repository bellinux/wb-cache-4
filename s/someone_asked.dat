25|$|The {{career of}} writer-producer Fred Barron began in 1975 {{when he used}} the history of Cambridge’s The Real Paper {{as the basis for}} a screenplay, Between the Lines. When Joan Micklin Silver brought Hester Street (1975) to the Welles Cinema, she was joined at the Welles Restaurant by Barron and others. When <b>someone</b> <b>asked</b> what she would direct next, she {{answered}} that she was looking at screenplays. Barron stood up, left the restaurant and returned with his screenplay. The success of Between the Lines (1977) led to a short-lived television series, also titled Between the Lines.|$|E
25|$|Prior to January 1972, if <b>someone</b> <b>asked</b> Genie a {{question}} using the interrogative word where she invariably responded {{by saying the}} last word of the speaker's sentence. In early January 1972 she began to give accurate, grammatical responses to where questions in conversations. By February 1972, in everyday interactions Genie clearly understood and appropriately acted on most questions using the interrogative words who, what, where, when, why, which, and how. Unlike most children, who grasp who, what, which, and where questions much earlier than when, how, or why questions, {{the only one of}} these which took longer for Genie understand was why and even this took much less time than linguists expected. Because the latter group of questions require more cognitive sophistication to properly answer, the scientists offered this as additional proof that Genie had a higher level of cognitive functioning than most children in similar phases of language acquisition.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to her linguistic abilities, Genie's nonverbal communication continued to excel. She invented her own system of gestures and pantomimed certain words {{as she said}} them, and also acted out events which she could not express in language. Initially she would only draw pictures if <b>someone</b> <b>asked</b> her to, but during her stay with the Riglers she began to use drawings to communicate if she could not explain something in words. In addition to her own drawings she often used pictures from magazines to relate to daily experiences, and for reasons the scientists never determined especially did so after encountering things that frightened her. Some time during mid-1972 Marilyn observed that a magazine picture of a wolf sent Genie into a terror, after which the Riglers asked Genie's mother if she knew a possible cause for this reaction; she then informed them {{that her husband had}} acted like a dog to intimidate Genie, making the underlying reason for her fear apparent to the scientists for the first time.|$|E

I said that we'd been asked to write for her but we'd never got round to it. And I said if we had to give her one of our songs, [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] would probably be the most suitable.

[...] The band then considered using Verse Chorus Verse—a title taken from its song [...] "Verse Chorus Verse", and an earlier working title of [...] "Sappy"—before eventually settling on In Utero. [...] The final title was taken from a poem written by Courtney Love.|$|E

So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1957 Robinson {{lost his}} title to Gene Fullmer. Fullmer used his aggressive, forward moving style to control Robinson, and knocked {{him down in}} the fight. Robinson, however, noticed that Fullmer was {{vulnerable}} to the left hook. Fullmer headed into their May rematch as a 3–1 favorite. In {{the first two rounds}} Robinson followed Fullmer around the ring, however in the third round he changed tactics and made Fullmer come to him. At the start of the fourth round Robinson came out on the attack and stunned Fullmer, and when Fullmer returned with his own punches, Robinson traded with him, as opposed to clinching as he had done in their earlier fight. The fight was fairly even after four rounds. But in the fifth, Robinson was able to win the title back for a fourth time by knocking out Fullmer with a lightning fast, powerful left hook. Boxing critics have referred to the left-hook which knocked out Fullmer as [...] "the perfect punch".*, ibhof.com. Retrieved June 6, 2007.

500|$|Other {{characters}} include Kirstie Alley as Saavik, Spock's protégée and a Starfleet commander-in-training {{aboard the}} Enterprise. The movie was Alley's first feature film role. Saavik cries during Spock's funeral. Meyer said that during filming <b>someone</b> <b>asked</b> him, [...] "'Are {{you going to}} let her do that?' And I said, 'Yeah,' and they said, 'But Vulcans don't cry,' and I said, 'Well, that's what makes this such an interesting Vulcan.'" [...] The character's emotional outbursts can be partly {{explained by the fact that}} Saavik was described as of mixed Vulcan-Romulan heritage in the script, though no indication is given on film. Alley was so fond of her Vulcan ears that she would take them home with her at the end of each day. Bibi Besch plays Carol Marcus, the lead scientist working on Project Genesis, and the mother of Kirk's son, David (played by Merritt Butrick). Meyer was looking for an actress who looked beautiful enough that it was plausible a womanizer such as Kirk would fall for her, yet who could also project a sense of intelligence. Meyer liked that Butrick's hair was blond like Besch's and curly like Shatner's, making him a plausible son of the two. John Winston reprises his series role as Kyle, the Enterprise transporter chief now Commander Kyle aboard Reliant.|$|E
500|$|While {{preparing}} the acoustic album, Grohl {{decided that he}} would improve it with guest appearances, and made a list of musicians {{that he would like to}} work with, such as Warren Haynes and Grant Hart. The guests that appeared on the record included Norah Jones, John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame, and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. John Paul Jones agreed to appear as he was in Los Angeles for the Grammy Awards, and Grohl described his appearance as the [...] "second-greatest thing to happen to me in my life" [...] behind his marriage. Norah Jones was brought for the bossa nova [...] "Virginia Moon" [...] after Grohl heard her record and considered that his song was [...] "her vibe" [...] and Jones' voice [...] "was so smooth and warm that I figured it would work out great with mine." [...] The song features Grohl's guitar technician Joe Beebe on lead guitar as he was the only one in the crew with jazz experience. The Wallflowers' keyboard player Rami Jaffee and that dog.'s violinist Petra Haden also contributed to the album, and were later drafted for the Foo Fighters' touring band. After the album was finished, Grohl stated that he hoped that the Foo Fighters were most remembered for this record, describing it as [...] "just the most fucking kick-ass thing we've ever done", and saying that [...] "If <b>someone</b> <b>asked</b> me which Led Zeppelin album to buy, I would tell them Physical Graffiti, because it has such a wide dynamic and it shows the range that band had.

I got off a plane and <b>someone</b> <b>asked</b> me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z.

I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it".
