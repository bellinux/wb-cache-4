5|$|In early 1801 Retribution {{detained}} the Spanish <b>schooner</b> La Linda, {{which was}} sailing from Campeachy to Havana, and the American <b>schooner</b> Sea Horse, which was sailing from Porto Cavello to New York. Retribution sent both into Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{then set}} {{off with the}} other two boats in an attempt to seize the <b>schooner</b> which had helped Revenge crew escape. This second <b>schooner</b> {{maintained}} a heavy fire upon the advancing American boats, and Alligator cutter soon lagged behind as it had taken heavy casualties and had trouble manning its oars. Allen attempted to rally his men by standing up and waving them forward. In doing so Allen exposed himself and was struck by musket fire, taking a round first in the head and then in the chest. With their commander mortally wounded and their crew taking heavy casualties, the American boats withdrew, thus allowing the second pirate <b>schooner</b> as well as a third that had not been engaged, to escape. The vessels the pirates had seized were left behind and recovered by the Americans after the action had ended.|$|E
5|$|In April 1913, The New York Times {{reported}} that El Occidente, loaded only with cargo, had rammed a <b>schooner</b> in fog off the New Jersey coast. Responding to a wireless message, the Savannah steamer City of Montgomery came alongside El Occidente to offer assistance, but was refused. The name and {{fate of the}} <b>schooner</b> were not reported.|$|E
50|$|All the <b>schooners</b> {{were mainly}} 300-dead-weight-tonne <b>schooners,</b> of which 91 were {{delivered}} to the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|<b>Schooners</b> {{were used}} in North American fishing, {{especially}} the Grand Banks fishery. Some Banks fishing <b>schooners</b> such as Bluenose also became famous racers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Schooners</b> hunted {{fur seals}} {{on the island}} between 1889 and 1896. At least 2,250 were caught, with a peak of 879 by four <b>schooners</b> in 1890.|$|R
5|$|In {{spite of}} this initial mishap, De Sotos first capture did not take long, as she and a bluejacket-crewed lugger took <b>schooner</b> Major Barbour off Isles Dernières, Louisiana on 28 January 1862. Cmdr. Walker's crew {{discovered}} 8 barrels of gunpowder and 198 cases of gunpowder, nitrates, sulfur, and percussion caps in the blockade runner. On 8 February, the steamer caught the small <b>schooner</b> Star out of Bayou Lafourche, taking her four-man crew prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Mitch {{was also}} {{responsible}} for the loss with all hands of Windjammer Barefoot Cruises' <b>schooner</b> Fantome. The story was recorded in the book The Ship and The Storm by Jim Carrier. The <b>schooner,</b> which was sailing {{near the center of}} the hurricane, experienced over 50foot (15m) waves and over 100mph (160km/h) winds, causing her to sink off the coast of Honduras.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} {{production}} is not clear. A commercial transport ship, the Victoria, took {{the cast and crew}} from Seattle, Washington, to Nome, Alaska. There, the <b>schooner</b> Nanuk was rented by the studio to take the production team farther north. Originally known as the Pandora, the <b>schooner</b> would next be used in the 1935 production of Mutiny on the Bounty, and rerigged for the 1937 film Maid of Salem. The Nanuk acted as a mobile base of operations, and as a set for the shipboard scenes. MGM bought the <b>schooner</b> outright during the production. On-screen credits for the film claim filming began in April 1932, but The Hollywood Reporter said it began in July and the New York Times said June.|$|E
5000|$|... 1881 - Bank Fishery {{began and}} Samuel Harris’s first {{season on the}} banks was a success. In short order, {{a number of other}} Grand Bankers with <b>schooners</b> {{followed}} (some of which include George Abraham Buffett, Simeon N. Tibbo and Daniel Tibbo). The demand for <b>schooners</b> dramatically increased. There were at one point (1885 & 1886) seven <b>schooners</b> being built in Grand Bank.|$|R
40|$|The Pond {{has been}} home to several types of fishing boats over the years, many of them built in Branch. Throughout the years <b>schooners,</b> dories, skiffs and {{longliners}} have sat in the Pond. The <b>schooners</b> of Thomas Nashs prime fishing years had a longer range than was needed for early Branch residents to catch cod in the nearby waters. The size of boats decreased from <b>schooners</b> to dories which were rowed to the fishing grounds. Later, dories were replaced by motorized skiffs. Skiffs were replaced by longliners with a range {{similar to that of}} the old <b>schooners...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Navy {{tried again}} {{to find a}} design for an advice-boat. In 1804 it ordered 18 Ballahoo-class <b>schooners.</b> Then a year later it ordered 12 Cuckoo-class <b>schooners.</b> Both classes were built in Bermuda.|$|R
5|$|Africaines {{journey to}} Madras took several months and Corbet {{made a number}} of stops on his passage, the final one being at the small British island base of Rodriguez in early September 1810. There Corbet was {{informed}} of the disaster at Grand Port and on his own initiative immediately sailed south to augment Rowley's weakened squadron. Arriving off Isle de France at 06:15 on 11 September, Corbet spotted a French <b>schooner</b> near Île Ronde and gave chase, the <b>schooner</b> sheltering behind the reefs at Grand Bay on {{the eastern side of the}} island. At 07:30, Corbet ordered the frigate's boats to enter the creek into which the <b>schooner</b> had fled, the small craft entering the waterway in the hope of storming and capturing the vessel. As the boats approached, French soldiers and militia appeared along the banks and began firing on the British sailors. Fire was returned by Royal Marines in the boats, but Africaines barge grounded soon after the ambush was sprung and became trapped, French gunfire killing two men and wounding ten. The other boat reached the grounded and abandoned <b>schooner,</b> but the six men aboard were unable to move the vessel unaided and were forced to depart, coming under fire which wounded five men, before they could escape the French trap.|$|E
5|$|As his {{businesses}} grew, {{he added}} to his fleet of ships, big ones to ship salmon to San Francisco and smaller ones for shallow waters and for towing larger ships {{in and out of}} the Rogue mouth. In 1879 he bought the steamer Varuna and the tug Mary Hume and started a shipyard at Ellensburg. In 1880 he added the steam <b>schooner</b> Mary D. Hume, the tug Pelican in 1883, the <b>schooner</b> Berwick in 1887, the steamer Thistle in 1888, and replacement craft in subsequent years. Returning ships brought goods for Hume's general store.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, gales {{from the}} former {{hurricane}} swept across the Great Lakes. Hundreds of spectators lined the shores of Lake Michigan at Chicago, Illinois, to watch the enormous waves. A <b>schooner</b> was torn from its moorings at Chicago, and crashed into nearly a dozen smaller vessels while being blown about. The <b>schooner</b> Belle from Racine, Wisconsin, went missing amid the storm, while the barge Sumatra broke up and capsized near Milwaukee, taking the lives of four crew members; the captain, first mate, and cook were safely rescued. The storm damaged around $75,000 worth of property on the Great Lakes.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} March, Restless {{put into}} Port Royal for provisioning. By then she had intercepted five more {{blockade}} runners; two <b>schooners</b> were kept as prizes; one sloop and two <b>schooners</b> were destroyed.|$|R
25|$|Barquentine Amaranth Co. {{incorporated}} in San Francisco on Sept. 14, 1901 with capital stock of $76,000 and was assigned state corporation no. 33,965. Captain Turner, a master shipbuilder, {{was known for}} his Bering Sea pelagic sealing <b>schooners,</b> codfishing <b>schooners,</b> South Seas <b>schooners,</b> and sugar packets. Amaranth measured 1,109 tons, and was a sister ship to Turner's 1,167 ton barquentine Amazon. The ship was named after the amaranth plant.|$|R
50|$|The Dano-Norwegian navy {{stationed}} {{eight in}} Bergen {{and two in}} Trondheim, though {{this is a little}} deceptive. After the British Royal Navy captured two at the Battle of Silda, the Danes built two more to replace them. The two new <b>schooners</b> received the same names (Thor and Balder) as the lost <b>schooners.</b> Thus there was only a maximum of eight <b>schooners</b> on active duty at any one time.|$|R
5|$|September 16, 1903- The Vagabond Hurricane {{parallels}} the Delmarva Peninsula coastline and makes landfall on southern New Jersey, bringing Category 1 hurricane-force winds to Delaware. It {{is one of}} only three storms to bring hurricane-force winds to the state. The hurricane washes a <b>schooner</b> ashore, killing five.|$|E
5|$|The band of pirates was {{relatively}} large, consisting of around 125 men and three armed schooners. One <b>schooner,</b> Revenge, was an 80-ton vessel armed with five cannon and 35 men; a second, 90-ton <b>schooner</b> had six guns and 30 men; a third vessel measured 60 tons, was armed with three cannon and manned by 60 men. In {{addition to their}} armed vessels, the pirates also had in their possession five American prizes. These were the ship rigged vessel William Henry from New York, the brigs Iris and Sarah Morril from Boston, {{and a pair of}} merchant schooners, with one hailing from Rochester, Massachusetts, and the other Salem.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{first brought}} rainfall to coastal parts of Georgia and South Carolina. Strong winds were reported along coastal areas of North Carolina, with sustained winds peaking at 72mph (116km/h) at Kitty Hawk. Winds reached 54mph (87km/h) at Cape Henry, Virginia, {{and the combination}} of the winds and rough surf washed some boats ashore. The <b>schooner</b> Beatrice was lost near Chincoteague with a crew of 30; 28people on board were killed. A squall line destroyed the front mast of a <b>schooner</b> near Cape Henry. Several boats broke free from their moorings near Salisbury and were subsequently destroyed after passing downstream. The <b>schooner</b> Hattie A. Marsh encountered strong winds from the hurricane along the Delaware coast, while strong waves washed it ashore the rocky coastline. The boat was wrecked and the rooms onboard were washed overboard, killing five members of the crew. Two people were rescued after conditions calmed, one of whom was injured and taken to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, there were only 56 ships on the Irish register; 14 of those were Arklow <b>schooners.</b> Sailing as neutrals, these <b>schooners</b> played {{a vital role in}} keeping Ireland supplied.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 August, the British were to windward. Chauncey formed his {{squadron}} {{into two}} lines; six <b>schooners</b> were nearest the British, with the heavier ships further away to leeward. As the British edged closer, firing became general. At 11:30 am, Chauncey ordered his windward line to steer downwind and reform to leeward {{of the heavy}} vessels. The two leading <b>schooners,</b> [...] and , failed to wear ship and were left {{cut off from the}} rest of Chauncey's squadron. Rather than try to beat upwind to rescue the two <b>schooners,</b> Chauncey withdrew downwind, hoping that Yeo would follow him. Instead, Yeo concentrated on the two isolated <b>schooners,</b> both of which were captured.|$|R
50|$|Despite this, Victoria's {{government}} purchased some {{ships to}} {{form the basis of}} the first Mexican Navy. They included the <b>schooners</b> Iguala, Anáhuac, Chalco, Chapala, Texcoco, Orizaba, Campechana and Zumpango. The <b>schooners</b> Tampico, Papaloapan and Tlaxcalteca were added later.|$|R
5|$|The men of Machias regrouped {{the next}} day, and Foster took around 20 men, {{including}} his brother, Wooden Foster, to East Machias where they seized the Unity and constructed deck breastworks {{to serve as}} protection. They also commandeered a local <b>schooner</b> named the Falmouth Packet.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{more substantial}} repairs over the winter, De Soto sailed to Venezuela on 3 March 1868, {{to secure the}} release of crewmen from the whaling <b>schooner</b> Hannah Grant, who had been captured on the peninsula of Paraguano. At Curaçao, Capt. Boggs learned that the crew had already been released, but he remained in Venezuelan waters {{in support of the}} American minister during interviews with the Venezuelan vice-president and other officials of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the Civil War, Roanoke recommissioned on 20 June 1861 and was {{assigned}} to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She destroyed the <b>schooner</b> Mary off Lockwood Folly Inlet, North Carolina, on 13 July 1861. The ship subsequently helped to capture the schooners Albion and Alert and the ship Thomas Watson off Charleston, South Carolina, on 15 October 1861.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, folk singer/songwriter Gordon Bok did a {{song called}} Wiscasset <b>Schooners.</b> Included in the group singing were Lois Lyman (the song's author), and her husband. Bok {{included}} the song on his albums <b>Schooners,</b> and Harbors of Home.|$|R
2500|$|Laura {{was built}} at Bermuda of the pencil cedar [...] The Adonis-class <b>schooners</b> {{were a little}} larger and much better armed than the Ballahoo- and Cuckoo-class <b>schooners</b> that they followed. The Admiralty's intent was to improve {{survivability}} of these dispatch boats.|$|R
50|$|Although two-masted <b>schooners</b> may be {{provided}} with masts of identical size, the aftmost is still {{referred to as the}} main-mast, and normally has the larger course. <b>Schooners</b> have been built with up to seven masts in all, with several six-masted examples.|$|R
5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate <b>schooner</b> made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another <b>schooner</b> covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{findings}} of Rae and Anderson, the Admiralty did not plan another search of its own. Britain officially labelled the crew deceased in service on 31 March 1854. Lady Franklin, failing to convince the government to fund another search, personally commissioned one more expedition under Francis Leopold McClintock. The expedition ship, the steam <b>schooner</b> Fox, bought via public subscription, sailed from Aberdeen on 2 July 1857.|$|E
5|$|Emeralds boats {{participated in}} a cutting-out {{expedition}} in Viveiro harbour on 13 March 1808. While cruising inshore at around 17:00, Emerald spotted a large French <b>schooner,</b> Apropos, of 250 tons (bm), anchored in the bay. Apropos was armed with twelve 8-pounder guns, though pierced for 16, and had a crew of more than 70 men {{under the command of}} lieutenant de vaisseau Lagary.|$|E
5000|$|Laura {{was built}} at Bermuda of the pencil cedar [...] The Adonis-class <b>schooners</b> {{were a little}} larger and much better armed than the Ballahoo- and Cuckoo-class <b>schooners</b> that they followed. The Admiralty's intent was to improve {{survivability}} of these dispatch boats.|$|R
5000|$|The first vessels {{used were}} the {{existing}} sloops, pungys and <b>schooners</b> on the Bay, {{but none of}} these types was well suited to the purpose; pungys and <b>schooners</b> were too deep in their draft to work the shallower waters of the Bay, the <b>schooners</b> and sloops had bulwarks too high to facilitate handling the dredges, the relatively complex rigs of all three types required uneconomically large crews of skilled sailors, and the vessels themselves were relatively expensive to build and maintain.|$|R
