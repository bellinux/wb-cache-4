25|$|Computable {{functions}} {{are the basic}} objects of study in computability theory. Computable {{functions are}} the formalized analogue of the intuitive notion of algorithm, in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> function is computable if there exists an algorithm that {{can do the job}} of the function, i.e. given an input of the function domain it can return the corresponding output. Computable functions are used to discuss computability without referring to any concrete model of computation such as Turing machines or register machines. Any definition, however, must make reference to some specific model of computation but all valid definitions yield the same class of functions.|$|E
25|$|Toledo, {{with a large}} {{population}} of Arabic-speaking Christians (Mozarabs) had been an important center of learning since {{as early as the}} end of the 10th century, when European scholars traveled to Spain to study subjects that were not readily available in the rest of Europe. Among the early translators at Toledo were an Avendauth (who some have identified with Abraham ibn Daud), who translated Avicenna's encyclopedia, the Kitāb al-Shifa (The Book of Healing), in cooperation with Domingo Gundisalvo, Archdeacon of Cuéllar. The translating efforts at Toledo are often overemphasized into a “school of translation,” however the representation of Toledo translating activity creates a false <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> formal school arose around the Archbishop Raymond. Only one translation, by John of Seville, can be definitively dedicated to the archbishop. It is more accurate to consider Toledo as a geographically bilingual environment where local interests were favorable to translation efforts, making it a practical and appealing location for translators to work. As a result, many translators became active in the area and Toledo became the focus of translating activity.|$|E

25|$|According to the Mexican government, {{the attacks}} of that day {{were one of the}} most brazen moves by {{organized}} crime against Mexican security forces in the ongoing Mexican Drug War (2006–present). The attack was also unique in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> relatively new criminal group in Mexico like that CJNG was willing to confront the government head-on. Though organized crime groups in Mexico had used rocket launchers against security forces in the past, {{it was the first time}} in history that they had shot down a military aircraft. That attacks of that day showed the government that the CJNG had the manpower and operational capacity to respond against the crackdowns and efforts of the Mexican government. The CJNG's influence in Mexico's criminal landscape grew significantly since 2009–2010. The group was formed as a splinter organization of the Milenio Cartel and Sinaloa Cartel after several of its leaders were arrested or killed. Their international drug trafficking operations, specifically for heroin and methamphetamine, increased the group's financial power and capacity. Their market share growth in Mexican territory was also correlated to the arrest and deaths of their rival criminal group leaders like the Knights Templar Cartel and Los Zetas. The CJNG's stronghold, Jalisco, gave the group a strategic advantage from its competitors since Jalisco ranked high in industrial output and gross domestic product (GDP).|$|E
25|$|This {{game was}} part of a double header at the Garda RFC Westmanstown. The Vikings {{entering}} the game as huge underdogs {{for the first time in}} many years. Making matters worse the Vikings lost starting QB Marc Ashworth and Starting RB Ryan Meches to unforeseen circumstances leaving them with a 22-man squad facing the Champions. The game started positively for the Vikings on offence gathering some first downs and field position. The Defence which was the story of the day matched the champions in every aspect and looked a better outfit than the one that lost to Belfast in the Shamrock bowl the year before. As the first half came to a close the score was a measly 0–0 with both teams showing why they have been dominant in Irish football in recent years. The Vikings cam out in the second half hoping to get some movement on offence with their Defence continuing to be Dominant and impressive. The Vikings turned to players like ever present Kieran Coen to play both sides of the ball and he was the best player on the field on the day. With many other players such as Ian Cahill, Craig Switzer, Michael Guinane, Kieran Coen, Adrian Garvey and Sean Goldrick playing Offence, Defence and Special teams the game started to wear on the Vikings. 0-0 entering the 4th quarter in unprecedented 28 degree heat there was an air of inevitability about the game with the Vikings continually running 3 and outs on offence something had to give. With less than 10 minutes left and the Trojans creeping into Viking territory there was a <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> big play needed to be made on Defence if they were going to have a shot of knocking off the Trojans. That chance came with a well read pass from the Trojans QB by Craig Switzer. The ball in his hands with 60 yards of clear field in front of the speedster nickel star of the Vikings and he took his eye off the ball and it fell on the turf. The crowd, the team and everyone else knew that was the chance and sure enough 3 plays later the Trojans constant Barrage finally broke the Vikings Defensive wall and ran in for a 20-yard score with 7 minutes left. The Trojans stopped the Vikings offense after some gutsy first downs by QB Paul Keane, RB/DL Ian Cahill and WR Sean Goldrick. The Trojans played the clock down to minutes left and with the game getting away from them the Vikings Defence gave up another score leaving it 14–0 final score.|$|E

500|$|Windsor Castle {{occupies}} , and {{combines the}} features of a fortification, a palace, and a small town. The present-day castle was created during a sequence of phased building projects, culminating in the reconstruction work after a fire in 1992. It is in essence a Georgian and Victorian design based on a medieval structure, with Gothic features reinvented in a modern style. Since the 14th century, architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions, repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles. As a result, architect Sir William Whitfield has pointed to Windsor Castle's architecture as having [...] "a certain fictive quality", the Picturesque and Gothic design generating [...] "a <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> theatrical performance is being put on here", despite late 20th century efforts to expose more of the older structures to increase the sense of authenticity. Although {{there has been some}} criticism, the castle's architecture and history lends it a [...] "place amongst the greatest European palaces".|$|E

[...] "You get the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> vogue for science fiction is being interpreted as {{the spirit of the}} Fifties, with emphasis being put on a handful of sci-fi films.

[...] The motivation for creating and marketing this album directly came in part from the very article Byrne wrote as well as Eno's belief that music fans want more than just the music on an album and prefer collectible deluxe editions as well as the live performances that promote them. A month after releasing the album, Byrne was skeptical of market saturation claiming [...] "I <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> lot of people don't know we have a record out" [...] and hoped to counterbalance that ignorance with his tour. He also described the digital music market as [...] "so infinite [...] it's easy for music to get lost out there" [...] and has noted that this business model would not work for performers who are not already established.|$|E

This poem, and the collection in which it was included, is described by one critic as [...] "one more mark in modern Black radical and revolutionary cultural reconstruction." [...] Princeton University poetry professor Craig Dworkin, said that he did not like the poem, but added [...] "I do like the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> poet can be disturbing and not necessarily comforting or consensus-building." [...] Immediately after its public reading, the poem met with harsh criticism by literary critics, politicians, and the public. The poem is highly critical of racism in America, and includes angry depictions of public figures such as Rudolph Giuliani, Trent Lott, Clarence Thomas, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Ward Connerly. [...] It was also considered anti-Semitic because of lines claiming Israel's involvement in the World Trade Center attacks, and supporting the theory that the United States government knew about the 9/11 attacks in advance.|$|E
