40|$|Abstract: To {{investigate}} whether the fertilizers N, P or K individually affect plant growth, oil {{content and the}} gender of <b>sweet</b> <b>gale,</b> two trials, pot and field trials, were carried out at Orkney College UHI in Scotland. A pot trial was established with eight soils which were collected from different <b>sweet</b> <b>gale</b> trial sites {{in the north of}} Scotland. Although neither shoot yield nor oil concentration in shoots was affected by soil, there were significant differences in shoot yields as a result of fertilizer treatments (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) or none (control)). The best yield was obtained from the N treatment which was double to that of the control and P treatments. N, P or K fertilizers did not consistently affect shoot oil concentration in two seasons; however, oil yield was significantly affected, and N treatment produced two-three fold oil yield increases compared with the control or P treatment. In the N treatment, the increase in shoot yield was positively correlated with total nitrogen or nitrate nitrogen in the soil, suggesting the occurrence of a nitrogen priming effect. Data suggested that as shoot yield increased the oil concentration in shoots decreased. Neither soil nor N, P or K fertilizers had a significant effect on oil composition. Amongst fertilizer treatments, P resulted in the largest number of plants changing gender from female to male. A field N trial confirmed that nitrogen significantly enhanced the shoot yield of young plants...|$|R

The staminate catkins range from 6 to 10 mm long, are crowded on the branchlet, with the individual flowers overtopped by the broad, shining, subtending, brown bracts. The pistillate catkins range from 7 to 10 mm long, each flower subtended by two wing-like bracts that remain fused to the fruit. The fruit of the <b>sweet</b> <b>gale</b> is a three-pointed, compressed, ovoid nutlet that at maturity is dotted with shining red to yellow resin glands.

It {{is also known as}} bog myrtle, Dutch myrtle English myrtle, and meadow fern, although this species is neither a true fern nor myrtle. <b>Sweet</b> <b>gale</b> is an aromatic, deciduous, shrub up to 2. 5 m tall. The plant is single or multistemmed, with strongly ascending branches. The twigs are terete, brown with scattered yellow glands. The leaves are 2 to 6 cm long (including the short petiole), oblanceolate (i. e., widest toward apex) with cuneate bases, toothed only toward the apex, glabrous and shining above but usually pubescent on the blade’s underside. Like the twigs, the blades on both sides are often beset with yellow glands. The flowers are in unisexual, unbranched catkins (aments), with the staminate (male) and pistillate (female) catkins appearing on different plants. Individual plants have been known to change sex from year to year Range. —Sweet gale is found in the New and Old World temperate regions. It occurs in th...|$|R

50|$|Gotlandsdricka is {{essentially}} the same everyday brew that the Vikings drank. Brewing techniques have been updated through the centuries, but the ingredients and taste remain the same. Originally this kind of brew was made in all Nordic countries, but the tradition of its brewing has only survived into modern times on the island of Gotland. When hops were introduced in Scandinavia during the 13th century, these were used to replace drikkes juniper boughs as flavoring. However, Gotland retained the tradition of using juniper although some hops were added to recipes, as it was a better preservative and added more flavor. The main flavoring was still juniper boughs and <b>sweet</b> <b>gale.</b> During the 20th century, sugar became a substitute for honey as the sweetener in drikke, but it is still brewed with honey, or without any additional sweetener at all, in parts of the island. Gotlandsdricka is closely related to the Finnish sahti, which is made using the same ingredients and techniques.|$|R
40|$|Actinorhizal plants invade nitrogen-poor soils {{because of}} their ability to form root nodule symbioses with N 2 -fixing {{actinomycetes}} known as Frankia. Frankia strains are difficult to isolate, so the diversity of strains inhabiting nodules in nature is not known. To address this problem, we have used the variability in bacterial 16 S rRNA gene sequences amplified from root nodules as a means to estimate molecular diversity. Nodules were collected from 96 sites primarily in northeastern North America; each site contained one of three species of the family Myricaceae. Plants in this family are considered to be promiscuous hosts because several species are effectively nodulated by most isolated strains of Frankia in the greenhouse. We found that strain evenness varies greatly between the plant species so that estimating total strain richness of Frankia within myricaceous nodules with the sample size used was problematical. Nevertheless, Myrica pensylvanica, the common bayberry, was found to have sufficient diversity to serve as a reservoir host for Frankia strains that infect plants from other actinorhizal families. Myrica <b>gale,</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>gale,</b> yielded a few dominant sequences, indicating either symbiont specialization or niche selection of particular ecotypes. Strains in Comptonia peregrina nodules had an intermediate level of diversity and were all from a single major group of Frankia.

Now, the first sight of her, the first touch of her hand, wrought a change in him, and all thought of Edgar and {{of the purpose of}} his visit vanished out of his mind. Even he, one of the great nobles of his time, the accomplished courtier and life of the court, stood silent like a person spell-bound before this woman who had been to no court, but had lived always with that sullen old man in comparative seclusion in a remote province. It was not only the beautiful dignity and graciousness with which she received him, with the exquisite beauty in the lines and colour of her face, and her hair which, if unloosed, would have covered her to the knees as with a splendid mantle. That hair of a colour comparable only to that of the <b>sweet</b> <b>gale</b> when that <b>sweet</b> plant is in its golden withy or catkin stage in the month of May, and is clothed with catkins as with a foliage of a deep shining red gold, that seems not a colour of earth but rather one distilled from the sun itself. Nor was it the colour of her eyes, the deep pure blue of the lungwort, that blue loveliness seen in no other flower on earth. Rather it was the light from her eyes which was like lightning that pierced and startled him; for that light, that expression, was a living spirit looking through his eyes into the depths of his soul, knowing all its strength and weakness, and in the same instant resolving to make it her own and have dominion over it.|$|R
60|$|There is, besides this, another blessing {{that comes}} to us by this living water, and that is, the blessing of communion. All the warmth {{that we have in}} our communion, it is the warmth of the Spirit: when a company of saints are {{gathered}} together in the name of Christ, to perform any spiritual exercise, and their souls be edified, warmed, and made glad therein, it is because this water, this river of water of life, has, in some of the streams thereof, run into that assembly (Jer 31:12,13). Then are Christians like those that drink wine in bowls, merry and glad; for that they have drank into the Spirit, and had their souls refreshed with the <b>sweet</b> <b>gales</b> and strong wine thereof. This is the feast that Isaiah speaks of, when he saith, 'In this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined' (Isa 25:6). This is called in another place, 'the communion of the Holy Ghost' (2 Cor 13:14). Now he warmeth spirits, uniteth spirits, enlighteneth spirits; revives, cherisheth, quickeneth, strengtheneth graces; renews assurances, brings old comforts to mind, weakens lusts, emboldeneth and raiseth a spirit of faith, of love, of hope, of prayer, and makes the Word a blessing, conference a blessing, meditation a blessing, and duty very delightful to the soul. Without this water of life, communion is weak, flat, cold, dead, fruitless, lifeless; there is nothing seen, felt, heard, or understood in a spiritual and heart-quickening way. Now ordinances are burdensome, sins strong, faith weak, hearts hard, and the faces of our souls dry, like the dry and parched ground.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{medicinal}} plants {{is a popular}} subject that, {{at least in the}} archaeological sciences, has met a lot of criticism {{due to the lack of}} physical data. It is problematic to distinguish the medicinal plants from local flora since many herbs that were used often could be found in the nearby vegetation.   The purpose of this essay is to archaebotanically analyze samples from the medieval town Nya Lödöse and compare the data with a previous analysis from the site and a literature study. The herbs meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), lady’s mantle (Alchemilla sp.), <b>sweet</b> <b>gale</b> (Myrica gale), hop (Humulus lupulus), common tormentil (Potentilla erecta), St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), catnip (Nepeta cataria) and motherwort (Leonurus cardiaca) have been selected for closer analysis since they occur with frequency in the historical medicinal texts and in previous analysis made on the site. The aim is to investigate the similarity between the samples and what is written about the plants in the different medieval medicinal documentations. The paper will also discuss the different contemporary views on medicine and the people who practiced it, and thus extend the subject for future studies. The Nya Lödöse locale is interesting since it was active in a period of increased trade, turbulent times of political power games, witch trials and ecclesiastical power. The harbor town of Nya Lödöse has had an intense history with numerous fires and invasions. In a time of reformation, when the plague had hit Gothenburg, the witch pyres were burning and the Dane was at hand, the need for medicine must have been great.

40|$|High {{resolution}} palaeoenvironmental {{records in}} Far-Eastern Russia are rare, and the Kamchatka Peninsula {{is among the}} least studied areas of the region. This paper describes a record spanning the last ca. 11, 000 yr, obtained from a bog {{in the southern part}} of Kamchatka. The radiocarbon dated core was analysed for pollen, testate amoebae, charcoal and loss-on-ignition (LOI). The vegetation during the early Holocene was dominated by grasses (Poaceae), birch (Betula) and heath (Ericaceae p. p.). Around 10, 300 cal yr BP there was a substantial change in the vegetation cover to shrub alder (Alnus viridis s. I.) stands with sedges and ferns (Polypodiophyta) as well as herbs such as meadow rue (Thalictrum) in the understory. In the surroundings of Utka peatlands started to form. The variations in the vegetation cover were most probably caused by climatic changes. At the beginning of sediment accumulation, before 10, 300 cal yr BP, the composition of the vegetation points to cooler summers and/or decreased annual precipitation. Around 10, 300 cal yr BP, changes in vegetation occurred due to rising temperatures and/or changed water regimes. Increased abundancies of dry indicating testate amoebae after 9100 cal yr BP point to intermediate to dry soil conditions. Between 8600 and 7700 cal yr BP tree alder (Alnus incana) was widely spread at the site which probably indicates optimal environmental conditions. The tephra layer at 381 - 384. 5 cm (ca. 8500 cal yr BP) produces a strong impact on the testate amoebae assemblages. At 7700 cal yr BP there was a sudden drop of A. incana in the local vegetation. From this time on, A. incana and also A. viridis decrease continuously whereas Betula gradually increases. The upper part of the sequence (after 6300 cal yr BP) shows higher abundancies of meadowsweet (Filipendula) and <b>sweet</b> <b>gale</b> (Myrica) pollen. After 6300 cal yr BP, changes in testate amoebae demonstrate variable soil moisture conditions at the site. Between 3700 and 1800 cal yr BP, wet conditions dominate as dry indicating testate amoebae decrease. After 1800 cal yr BP soil conditions become more variable again but this time with dry dominating testate amoebae. In contrast to surrounding regions, there is no evidence of trees such as spruce or larch growing in the surroundings of the site even though those trees are characteristic of many eastern Siberian sites. This difference might be because of the maritime influence of the Okhotsk Sea. Even dwarf pine (Pinus pumila), which is currently widely dispersed in northern Kamchatka, became part of the local vegetation only during the last 700 yr.
