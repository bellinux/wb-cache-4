Foley, Welch and Stewart would be the contractors for this railway as well and they planned to build the grade along the upper Fraser River from Fort George to Soda Creek so that sternwheelers could be used to aid in its construction.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} only one fossil Nectocaris was known, poorly {{preserved}} {{and without a}} counterpart. This fossil was a puzzle, as its head looked rather like that of an arthropod but its body, with {{what seemed to be}} fins along its back and belly, looked rather like of a chordate's. In 2010 Smith and Caron described another 91 specimens, <b>some</b> <b>very</b> <b>good,</b> and reconstructed it as a cephalopod, and the earliest one as of 2010. Unlike later cephalopods it had only two arms, and its eyes seem mounted on stalks. But it had a soft funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods.|$|E

Doors were most suitably adorned in this way, and the split baluster so characteristic of Jacobean work is often to be met with.

But the Swiss and Austrians elaborated this style, greatly improving the effect by the addition of color. However, the best Continental designs adopted the typical acanthus foliage of Italy, while still retaining a certain amount of Gothic feeling in the strength of the lines and the cut of the detail. Panelling often long and narrow was commonly used for all sorts of domestic purposes, a feature being a medallion in the center with a simple arrangement of vase, dolphins, dragons, or birds and foliage filling in the spaces above and below.|$|E

[...] In his review of Family Guy, volume 3, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk wrote [...] " [...] I will say there are <b>some</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> episodes in this set, starting with 'Petarded', which sees Peter declared mentally retarded. The ways he takes advantage of this status is classic Family Guy material, while the musical montage here, involving phone calls all over town, is actually quite funny. Plus, the appearance of the Naked, Greased-Up Deaf Guy gave hope that the creators still had that sense of the bizarre in them." ...|$|E

Having trained to a level of fitness few other players would reach, by the mid-1950s he was able to cut back on his intense training as his level of fitness was by then ingrained in his body. He never smoked; instead, he was very conscious of every item of food and drink he consumed, and he maintained a rigid daily training regime from childhood up until his old age. In an interview with the FA he said, [...] "I had <b>some</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> advice and started to eat more salads and fruit, and every Monday I had no food. Just one day, on a Monday, but I felt better." [...] The only time he knowingly consumed alcohol was when drinking champagne out of the FA Cup in 1953.|$|E

John Kubicek of BuddyTV stated that the episode [...] "does a lot of things right when it comes to the plot", and Billboard Rae Votta described the plot as [...] "consistent and well managed, with believable motivation, response and action all around". However, Jen Chaney of The Washington Post wrote that the episode [...] "brought more narrative developments that didn’t make sense", and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman stated that aside from Martin's scenes, [...] "the rest of the episode found us back in scatterbrained plot territory". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times liked the episode and described it as [...] "the kind that makes you belly-laugh and chortle and snicker despite your better judgment".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Take Off Your Pants and Jacket in 2001 was generally positive. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone was generally the most effusive {{of the positive}} reviews, praising the unpretentious attitude of the band: [...] "As they plow in their relatively un-self-conscious way through the emotional hurdles of lust, terror, pain and rage, they reveal more about themselves and their audience than they even intend to, turning adolescent malaise into a friendly joke rather than a spiritual crisis." [...] Darren Ratner of AllMusic felt likewise, writing that the record is [...] "one of their finest works to date, with almost every track sporting a commanding articulation and new-school punk sounds. They've definitely put a big-time notch in the win column". People commended the [...] "adrenaline-laced sonic gems reveling in blink's patented, potty-mouthed humor, recommended only for adolescents of all ages". British publication Q offered the sentiment that [...] "when they stop arsing around {{for the sake of}} it, Blink-182 write <b>some</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> pop songs". Kerrang! gave it a high-profile review, calling the record [...] "eminently hummable dummy-spitting tantrum rock for the emo generation".|$|E
500|$|After {{almost a}} year without work in football, Westley {{returned}} as Stevenage manager in May 2008 – two years after he had originally left. On his return, Westley stated {{he had come to}} [...] "finish the job he started" [...] – referring to trying to guide the club into the Football League {{for the first time in}} its history. He said that [...] "the moment was right" [...] for him to come back into football and that he [...] "had <b>some</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> times at Stevenage before". His appointment was met with a fair bit of scepticism by Stevenage fans, but Westley promised to deliver a winning team, playing attractive football. Westley started by completely overhauling the squad in the summer transfer window and brought in no fewer than twelve players in an attempt to mount a serious Conference Premier title challenge. Among those brought in were Gary Mills and David Bridges, who Westley had managed during his short-stint at Kettering. He also signed Michael Bostwick and Mark Albrighton, who he had also signed at Rushden & Diamonds. Westley also secured the signatures of Andy Drury and Eddie Odhiambo respectively, both of which were players Westley had previously earmarked.|$|E

500|$|While the {{portions}} of the episode focusing on Joan, Peggy, and Sally were critically acclaimed, some critics were mixed {{on the value of}} the dream sequence. One writer for Zap2it declared the episode one of the best episodes yet. Alan Sepinwall, writing for Hitfix said that the episode was [...] "full of nightmares and self-realizations" [...] as well as [...] "horrifying images". Sepinwall wrote that the [...] "only way the strangulation scene would have been acceptable to me was with the understanding going in that it was a dream. Had the show not telegraphed that — or had I not figured it out — and Don woke up the next morning with no corpse on the floor, I'd have been irked." [...] One writer for Paste Magazine noted that the [...] "brilliantly shot" [...] episode had a [...] "Hitchcockian feel", and pointed to the use of [...] "reverse point-of-view shots" [...] and [...] "close-ups of hands on doorknobs that added an air of suspense not usually present on Mad Men." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN declared it the [...] "best episode yet for Season 5, with <b>some</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> material for Joan, Peggy, Don and Sally packed into a busy hour." [...] Goldman praised the resolution to the Harris marriage, crediting Weiner with mastering [...] "the slow burn on this show, and it was just so gratifying to finally have this issue be dealt with." ...|$|E
