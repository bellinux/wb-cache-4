40|$|This thesis explores ways {{in which}} open space can be made memorable through the {{application}} of ecological design and landscape narrative principles. The Faerie Glen Nature Reserve is located in the predominantly residential eastern suburbs of Pretoria and has been identified as an important open space due to its unique ecological sensitivity. The hypothesis argues that through an understanding of the landscape narrative, interventions can be made in the reserve that will not negatively affect the ecological importance or the visual aesthetic of the reserve. These interventions will contribute to making a memorable landscape by reinforcing its beauty and genius loci. The interventions in the reserve should increase the daily use of the Faerie Glen Nature Reserve and thus promote the reserve as a <b>sustainable</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> while preserving its ecological importance.

40|$|In {{efforts to}} summon {{challenges}} that associated with people interactions cum activities among ethnic residents, {{this study explored}} users' interrelationship within three markets square in rural neighborhoods of South-west, Nigeria. This is {{with a view of}} exploring the significant relationship between resident's interactions and the community well-being. In this regards, this study highlighted the influence of market square as a typical neighborhood open space on residents' well-being. The study's quantitative approach encircled the survey questionnaire data obtained from Yorubas, Hausas, and Ibos respondents (n= 382), and analyzed by SPSS statistical package (version 20). Meanwhile the qualitative data included observation of activities pattern among the three groups. The study's findings revealed that an improvement on the market place quality could better increase residents' interactions that impacts positively on residents' well-being. It is concluded that residents' well-being is a reflection of an experience manifested within the interplay of individuals and group interactions that begets social bonds and well-being. This study's findings could better equip the professionals in built environment on the essence of creating a <b>sustainable</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and community revitalization efforts...|$|E
40|$|This master 2 ̆ 7 s project {{considers}} {{public participation}} {{in regards to}} design of sustainable public open spaces, and recommends methods to include it in current landscape design practice. The introduction describes {{the scope of the}} project, definition and evolution of landscape design of <b>sustainable</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and sustainability. It presents the claims that landscape architects need an understanding of the ranges of participation in order to deliver flexible, creative and sustainable public projects in a capitalist economy and that a more active participation and more creativity contributes to sustainable designs. The rationale, limitations, methods and introduction to the literature review are also presented. The literature review reviews definitions, goals, assumptions, standards, histories, claims, typologies and practices of participatory design. It then reviews documented public participation projects. It reviews research and arguments about who participates, how power dynamics affect participation, what knowledge is needed, and how to translate the public 2 ̆ 7 s contributions into sustainable designs, and qualifications limiting participatory design. The conclusion presents whether and how participation can strengthen possibilities for sustainable design outcomes. It presents a typology to choose the right frame to evaluate the needs of the project and take right action and offers an approach to participatory design processes from a social sustainability perspective.

40|$|As {{conservation}} subdivisions {{increase in}} popularity, {{large tracts of}} community <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> are being created. The typical landscape treatment is usually reminiscent of the English Landscape School: acres of turf providing little wildlife habitat or environmental benefits.

40|$|Thesis (M. T. R. P.) -University of Natal, Durban, 1998. This thesis {{provides}} an overview of the public <b>open</b> <b>space</b> policy for Durban and surroundings. The focus of the research is the sustainability of the <b>open</b> <b>space</b> policy with special emphasis on the integration of the natural environment, social aspects and economic factors within the <b>open</b> <b>space</b> system itself. Through this dissertation an attempt was made to ascertain to what extent the <b>Open</b> <b>Space</b> Policy of the Durban Metropolitan Area is sustainable. In order to achieve this it was necessary to specifically consider the status quo of the current <b>open</b> <b>space</b> policies internationally and locally with emphasis on the ecologically orientated Durban Metropolitan <b>Open</b> <b>Space</b> System. More appropriate public <b>open</b> <b>space</b> within the natural environment and urban context was considered, especially in respect of social needs and the aspirations and perceptions of communities with regards parks, sports fields, play areas, community areas, urban agriculture and natural areas. Social aspects, such as public participation and education, and economic implications were also investigated and considered. In order to locate this work theoretically and contextually, current planning theory and sustainable development was analysed. In addition existing policies, initiatives and strategies responsible for shaping development and consequently the local public <b>open</b> <b>space</b> policy in the Durban Metropolitan area were investigated. The dissertation argues that the success of a 'sustainable' policy is ultimately based in collaborative planning and implementation as well as appropriate management of the system. Current theory pertaining to sustainable management in the form of private / public partnerships was investigated and tested through selected case studies in Westville and Clermont. This dissertation concludes that sustainability is a process and that the public <b>open</b> <b>space</b> policy of the Durban Metropolitan Area, although attempting to achieve overall sustainability requires to address specifically, social needs and more appropriate collaborative planning and management strategies. Broad strategies to achieve this were considered and guidelines for a more <b>sustainable</b> public <b>open</b> <b>space</b> were proposed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUrban {{parks are}} now {{viewed as an}} {{important}} part of the urban and neighborhood development rather than just recreation and leisure facilities. They are oriented for multifunctional services. Besides, they play an important role in improving the environment and landscape conditions that result in green spaces which have become an essential part in cities due to their strategic importance for the quality of life. As the world's urban population increases, urban areas encounter new problems such as: uncontrolled use of resources, greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, …… etc. To face these problems of urban areas, sustainable urban parks have become a significant urban planning policy and development approach. The city of Alexandria (Egypt) is rich with its urban parks such as Al Montazah Park, Al Shalalat Park and Antoniadis Park. However, the lack of coordination of physical planning activities within the city, has resulted into an unpleasant quality of the environment and decrease in the number of sustainable urban parks. Moreover, urban population has rapidly increased, thus the city of Alexandria has been enlarged and gradually human relations with nature have been damaged. For these reasons, people in Alexandria have lost the opportunity to come in contact with nature. The paper will discuss the causes of decreasing urban parks and its effects on people's health and the significant need to improve these spaces to develop the city and achieve sustainability. It will also highlight the important role of urban parks and their design strategies. It will analyze an international example which was transformed to provide a high quality of living environment presenting the suggested ways to create <b>sustainable</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> as an integrated part of a sustainable city. Finally, the paper will focus on developing Al Montazah urban park in Alexandria to achieve sustainability. The aim of the paper is to transform urban parks within the environment of Alexandria to improve and enhance the quality of life in order to reach a sustainable city...|$|R

The need to maintain and provide <b>sustainable</b> public <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> within future and existing urban developments will therefore become more critical. Presently there are still a large number of undeveloped sites in the older suburbs of Johannesburg bordering on the inner city. These sites are owned and maintained by the City of Johannesburg and provide public <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> ranging from small pocket ‘parks’ to large destination parks, many of which incorporate some form of playground equipment. Research was conducted on a sampling of public playgrounds within these ‘park’ settings to establish: space utilisation and layout, the type of play equipment and subsequent play opportunities provided for children, the general condition of the playground equipment in relation to vandalism and maintenance, and other facilities available on the site. All authors writing on childhood development concur on the benefits of play for healthy development, with specific importance placed on outdoor play. However research has shown that the traditional forms of playground and play equipment design, which prevail in the majority of public parks surveyed for this study, do not adequately meet the developmental needs of children. They are also proving to be unsustainable within this context. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish design strategies for alternative design solutions for public playgrounds and play equipment that holistically meets the developmental needs of children, and which would, in turn contribute towards the sustainability of public <b>open</b> <b>spaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} uses {{a sequence}} of hedonic housing price regressions to estimate <b>open</b> <b>space</b> amenity values. The iterative approach empirically identifies the range of distance over which <b>open</b> <b>space</b> affects housing values. After controlling for numerous other factors in the spatial hedonic model, simple functional relationships were established between the implicit prices of developed <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> forest-land <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> and agriculture-wetland <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and the buffer radius of the area surrounding a given location. In the case of Nashville-Davidson County, Tennessee, households place a positive value on additional developed <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and forest-land <b>open</b> <b>space</b> up to distances of 2. 2 miles and 1. 5 miles, respectively, and a negative value for additional agriculture-wetland <b>open</b> <b>space</b> up to 0. 8 -miles from their location.

Estimates of amenity and disamenity values of homeowners would allow the aggregate value generated by a particular open-space site to be estimated. The aggregate value consumers receive reflects the value residents place on neighborhood <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and is an estimate of the value of open-space as a public good.

40|$|Modern cities do {{not only}} aim at {{focusing}} on economic development solely, {{but they also}} need to provide high quality of urban living environment which could achieve social, economic and environmental sustainability. Public <b>open</b> <b>space</b> constitutes an indispensible part in achieving this planning objective. Nevertheless, <b>open</b> <b>space</b> is not a unitary planning concept. It has been being constantly redefined to suit changing social and economic needs. This study investigates the development of land supply and land-use planning of public <b>open</b> <b>space</b> in Hong Kong. It attempts to examine how <b>open</b> <b>space</b> was understood, planned, and provided in different periods in Hong Kong. <b>Open</b> <b>space</b> is presumed to be influenced by the interplay of three main social forces, namely the government, the capitalists, and the people. The interplay of the three forces changes in different periods of time in Hong Kong, resulting in the changing meaning and transformation of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> in the aspects of locations, forms, distributions, and ways of provisions. My key arguments are as follows: In the pre-Second World War colonial period, extraction was regarded as the primary objective of the colonial government. Since the colonial atmosphere shared the idea of earning from re-exporting trade and temporal stay, public <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> except for private leisure facilities, was not truly a concern of any of the social groups. While recreational opportunities and <b>open</b> <b>space</b> were still necessary to attract foreign investments and provide political functions, the colonial government provided <b>open</b> <b>space</b> in a residual manner, utilizing urban fringe areas of Victoria City and existing land-uses for <b>open</b> <b>space</b> functions. To maximize the use of <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> though the government was reluctant to provide, <b>open</b> <b>space</b> was utilized for political functions to preach social conforming behaviours and Western lifestyle to the Chinese immigrants as well as to new Chinese generations. The post-Second World War <b>open</b> <b>space</b> development was characterized by an expansion of the scope of <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> as well as political reform of the municipal governments and the planning institution. Triggered by the large influx of Chinese refugees that migrated to Hong Kong and the rising population of the local-born Chinese youngsters, elected representatives were introduced to the municipal councils. These elected representatives endeavoured to urge the government to provide <b>open</b> <b>space</b> where available, persuading the government by giving new meanings to <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> The planning institution, however, continued to plan <b>open</b> <b>space</b> in a residual manner. Inspired by the Abercrombie Plan, <b>open</b> <b>space</b> was planned towards the countryside and new forms of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> were introduced to expand the scope of <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> The contemporary pattern of public <b>open</b> <b>space</b> is examined by quantitative analyses. Three kinds of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> are examined, namely zoned <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> administered public <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> and public <b>open</b> <b>space</b> within private developments. Results show that large-scale zoned <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> tend to cluster in urban fringe areas and countryside, whereas zoned <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> in urban areas tend to be fragmentary. Waterfront and coastal areas, whether in urban or rural areas, are commonly utilized for <b>open</b> <b>space</b> purposes. These findings echo the planning strategy, aiming at shifting <b>open</b> <b>space</b> from the inner urban areas to the urban fringe and rural areas. Administered public <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> are found {{to be related to the}} income level and the ratio of occupational status of a community. The analyses of planning applications further suggest that <b>open</b> <b>space</b> serves as the potential land reserve for various uses instead of being a mere recreational site. Public <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> within private developments are provided more flexibly compared to conventional public <b>open</b> <b>space</b> in terms of their physical forms and regulations. The manipulations are found to be wittingly introduced by the developers to suit their parochial interests. It is expected that <b>open</b> <b>space</b> will be subject to constant redefinition under further socioeconomic developments and changing compositions of the three social forces. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

The numerous studies, both in Britain and in the United States, detailing the demand for <b>open</b> <b>space</b> are followed by supply studies of <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> which expose the deficiencies of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and express people's desires for <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> A comparison of the ideal <b>open</b> <b>space</b> standards to the actual supply and deficiencies of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> are analysed in further local studies.

The need for new standards and new approaches to local <b>open</b> <b>space</b> designs in inner urban areas is discussed in the chapter on current policies on <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> Different design concepts and methods are suggested for solving the present problems.

An appraisal of the financial, legal and administrative difficulties is followed by a study of the availability of urban wasteland for public <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> New methods of assessing the multi-purpose use of existing <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and discovering potential new <b>open</b> <b>space</b> sites on a case-study basis are suggested. The concluding chapter summarises the need, character and problems of local <b>open</b> <b>space...</b>|$|R

S. urban areas raises some interesting questions: a) what determines the amount of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> in an urban area? b) How does <b>open</b> <b>space</b> affect community characteristics such as housing prices and local property tax rates? and c) are existing amounts of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> across U. S. urban areas socially optimal? In this paper, we conduct theoretical and empirical analysis to address these issues. Our theoretical analysis reveals that price elasticities of housing demand and supply, economies of scale in providing public services, and values of environmental benefits from <b>open</b> <b>space</b> are key parameters affecting the optimal amount of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> in an urban area. Our empirical results confirm that the price elasticity of housing supply varies widely across U. S. urban areas and is a significant determinant {{of the amount of}} <b>open</b> <b>space</b> in an urban area. Urban areas with a larger share of land in <b>open</b> <b>space</b> tend to have lower property tax rates and lower per-capita spending on public services. A significant share of U. S. urban areas are found to have too little <b>open</b> <b>space</b> in the sense that even if additional <b>open</b> <b>space</b> would not provide any amenities, it would still increase total land values and social welfare. However, for more than 10 % of U. S. urban areas, the total value of environmental benefits from <b>open</b> <b>space</b> must be at least as large as the total land value to justify for the amount of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> they have. Some of these urban areas likely have too much <b>open</b> <b>space...</b>|$|R

It includes agricultural and forest land, undeveloped coastal and estuarine lands, undeveloped scenic lands, public parks and preserves. It also includes water bodies such as lakes and bays. What land {{is defined as}} <b>open</b> <b>space</b> depends in part on its surroundings. A vacant lot or a small marsh can be <b>open</b> <b>space</b> in a big city. A narrow corridor or pathway for walking or bicycling is <b>open</b> <b>space</b> {{even though it is}} surrounded by developed areas. And while not strictly <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> this Plan also discusses cultural and historic resources which, along with <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> are part of the heritage of New York State...|$|R
