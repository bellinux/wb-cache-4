30|$|A {{possible}} explanation for the negative correlation between potential log yield gain and site index is that a slow growing tree results in a shorter distance between whorls and a shorter <b>sound</b> <b>knot</b> length [28 – 30], also resulting in lower yield when the sawing is uncontrolled, and therefore a higher potential for optimization. The impact of knot size was probably small in this study, since dead knots were not allowed at all, while sound knots had a rather generous size limit of 50  mm.|$|E
40|$|The {{appearance}} of sawn timber has huge natural variations {{that a human}} inspector easily compensates for in his brain when determining the types of defects and the grade of each board. However, for automatic wood inspection systems these variations are a major source for complication. For instance, normal wood grain and knots should be reliably discriminated in all circumstances, but simple thresholding based detection methods used in state-of-the-art inspection systems frequently fail even in this apparently straightforward task. Furthermore, the appearances of defects vary, so one board's <b>sound</b> <b>knot</b> is another board's dark one, {{making it difficult to}} use textbook methodologies for visual inspection. These generally aim at systems that are trained in a supervised manner with samples of defects and good material, but selecting and labeling the samples is an error prone process that limits the accuracy that can be achieved...|$|E
30|$|Knowledge of the {{occurrence}} of <b>sound</b> and dead <b>knots</b> {{on the surface of}} sugi is important for the classification and application of the material. This study examined a color vision system for detecting <b>sound</b> and dead <b>knots</b> on sugi. The system can be conceptually divided into three components: a CCD-camera scanning system, an image-segmenting module, and a rule-based defect identifying module. The results showed that the potential defect regions could be located by Otsu’s threshold algorithm in conjunction with t-test analysis. The accuracies of locating <b>sound</b> <b>knots</b> and dead knots were 92.6 % and 97.1 %, respectively. The rule-based approach was used to identify <b>sound</b> and dead <b>knots</b> and the identifying accuracies for <b>sound</b> <b>knots</b> and dead knots were 92.0 % and 94.1 %, respectively. The overall detection accuracy of the system was 87.6 %. The results indicated that the rule-based color vision system is an efficient means of detecting <b>sound</b> <b>knots</b> and dead knots on sugi.|$|R
40|$|The {{classification}} of round wood {{depends on the}} defects and other morphological features of a tree trunk. Various tree species growing on different forest sites and in different conditions eventually present a wood quality influenced by said factors. The objective {{of this paper was}} to find out: 1) the distribution of round wood qua-lity classes of beech in three different site conditions and 2) the frequency of the defects influencing timber grading. The research was carried out on 15 different sample plots of three site quality classes, on which 1389 beech logs were classified according to the existing grading scheme. The most common timber quality (by vo-lume) was WC 0 and then in decreasing order: WD, WB 0 and WA 0, in proportions of: 15 : 10 : 4 : 1. This order was the same for the assortments obtained from the trees in all the analysed site quality classes. The most frequent defects influencing wood quality were <b>knots,</b> among which <b>sound</b> <b>knots</b> were in the majority. The proportion of the appearance of knots was 7 : 3 : 2 for <b>sound</b> <b>knots,</b> unsound and dead knots, as well as covered knots, respectively. Sweep, red heart and scars were of a similar frequency to <b>sound</b> <b>knots,</b> approx. 20 %. Double pith, shakes, rot, top diameter an...|$|R
25|$|Knots do not {{necessarily}} influence the stiffness of structural timber, this {{will depend on the}} size and location. Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects. The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects. <b>Sound</b> <b>knots</b> do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain.|$|R
3000|$|By contrast, {{there were}} {{considerable}} discrepancies between the boards {{in the analysis}} and validation samples {{in the case of}} log-sector class 2. As Fig.  8 a shows, a three-cluster solution was distinct for the validation sample as well and therefore deriving the same number of groups for the validation sample as for the analysis sample did not conflict with a feasible interpretation of the cluster tree. However, the visual impression of the derived board compositions markedly differed for two of the three groups. While a group comprising only clear or near knot-free boards was established for the validation sample as well, a good separation between boards with large <b>sound</b> <b>knots</b> and boards with smaller dead knots was not accomplished. As compositions 2 and 3 in Fig.  8 b illustrate, boards with predominantly large <b>sound</b> <b>knots</b> and boards with black knots were mixed in those groups with some near clear boards distributed over both.|$|R
30|$|For {{the boards}} from the {{validation}} sample in log-sector class 1 —as {{it was the}} case for the analysis sample—repeated cluster analysis with the five variables included in the discriminant model caused reallocation of three boards from group 2 to group 1. Since large <b>sound</b> <b>knots</b> and small black knots were equally present on the faces of the reallocated three boards, this regrouping was neither considered an improvement of the classification nor an impairment. The shape of the dendrogram was not markedly altered with the two-cluster level still being most distinct.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was {{evaluation}} of knots in wood of 150 -year-old Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst. ] in stands situated at the altitude of 1450 – 1740 m above sea level in the Dolomites in Italian section of the Alps. In selected stands, spruce trees were cut down and their length, stem thickness, height to the crown base and stem diameters at every 1 m along the length of merchantable bole were measured. The diameter of knots was measured and they were classified according to their healthiness and the degree of their tightness with the surrounding wood. The relative knot diameters were calculated and the relative height of their location on stem was determined. In total on sample trees there were analysed 1070 <b>knots,</b> of which <b>sound</b> <b>knots</b> (close to 75 %) and tight (more than 60 %) prevailed. <b>Sound</b> and tight <b>knots</b> had largest diameters, relative diameters and relative heights of location on merchantable boles. The smallest diameters and relative diameters were indicated by rotten and not tight knots that were located at the lowest merchantable bole parts...|$|R
30|$|There were {{considerable}} {{differences between}} the sets of variables included in the discriminant models for the individual log-sector classes. While for log-sector class 1 —except for one variable—only variables describing the occurrence of <b>sound</b> <b>knots</b> appeared to be relevant for group discrimination, {{in the case of}} log-sector class 2 a large set of different variables was included in the discriminant model. It contained variables related to the size distribution of knots, but also variables describing knot shape and spatial distribution. Two variables were included in the discriminant models for both log-sector class 1 and 2. With maximum black knot size, the discriminant model for log-sector class 3 shared one variable with that for log-sector class 2, but it was apparently mainly governed by length sum of pith.|$|R
30|$|With {{the initial}} cluster analysis, a {{visually}} inhomogeneous classification of the boards in log-sector class 2 was observed for the validation sample. When cluster analysis was rerun {{on the basis}} of the included variables, the reassignment of nine boards at the three-cluster level indeed produced a visually homogeneous group of vertical-grain boards with large <b>sound</b> <b>knots</b> (group 3). However, this group comprised only six boards, whereas the large cluster that the boards were allocated to (group 2) contained 26 boards with large variation in appearance. Thus, the board counts in the three groups were very unbalanced and there was only little distance between the three-cluster level and levels with more clusters in the cluster tree—a less distinct three-cluster level due to variable reduction as it could be observed for the vertical-grain boards in the analysis sample as well. On the other hand, the cluster with (near) clear boards (group 1) was not affected by variable reduction; this robustness was also reflected in a large distance to the remaining cluster at the two-cluster level.|$|R
5000|$|Knots {{materially}} affect cracking and warping, ease in working, and cleavability of timber. They are defects which weaken {{timber and}} lower its value for structural purposes where strength {{is an important}} consideration. The weakening effect is much more serious when timber is subjected to forces {{perpendicular to the grain}} and/or tension than when under load along the grain and/or compression. The extent to which knots affect the strength of a beam depends upon their position, size, number, and condition. A knot on the upper side is compressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension. If there is a season check in the knot, as is often the case, it will offer little resistance to this tensile stress. Small knots, however, may be located along the neutral plane of a beam and increase the strength by preventing longitudinal shearing. Knots in a board or plank are least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam do not weaken it. <b>Sound</b> <b>knots</b> which occur in the central portion one-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not serious defects.

40|$|The {{forestry-wood chain}} today {{involves}} many actors, and {{the decisions taken}} {{in the process of}} making trees into finished products are so many that the effect of each individual decision is difficult to assess, especially if the natural variation of the input material is considered. This means that a simulation approach to the forestry-wood chain is suitable, since it makes it possible to evaluate the effects of decisions in a short timeframe, while the input material can be kept constant for different production setups. The long term aim is to connect tree and log properties to the quality of a final product through simulation, depending on the various operations involved in making the product. A part of this is realized through this thesis. It is shown that a simulation model of a cross-cutting and finger-jointing process is representative of a real process. The model is used to evaluate an adaptive strategy for setting the safety zone size between finger-joints and <b>sound</b> <b>knots,</b> a strategy which improves recovery in a finger-jointing operation by 3 %. Another issue addressed in this thesis is that of simulation input data. The sawing simulation tool used to a large extent in research today, Saw 2003, usesthe Swedish Pine Stem Bank as input data. This is a very well-documented datasource, and computed tomography (CT) scanning of the stem bank logs allows wood features such as knots to be represented in a realistic way in Saw 2003. There are limitations to the stem bank, however, mostly {{due to the fact that}} CT scanning is a time consuming process, which means that the amount of scanned logs is relatively small. In this thesis, it is shown that it is possible to use a small amount of log features for determining the knot structure in a log, which opens up possibilities for using industrial data from two-directional X-ray scanners. This would increase the amount of logs to be used as simulation input data. A second set of data used for simulation was also collected in a study of a production process, where the wood raw material was followed from the logyard through all production operations of making finger-jointed furniture components. Each individual piece of wood was traced through the operations, thus ensuring a link between the properties of logs and those of the finished product. This second data set was collected by grey-scale camera scanning of boards prior to cross-cutting and finger-jointing, and was used in the development of cross-cutting and finger-jointing simulation. It contains information on non-clearwood features of the board surfaces such as knots, cracks, and pitch pockets. It can be concluded from this thesis that it is possible to increase bothfunctionality and the amount of input data in the simulation of the forestry-wood chain, and by doing so production strategies and decisions can be evaluated. Wood quality discussions may be simplified by being able to assess the effects on the production process of decisions being made. Future work involves adding more functionality to the simulation environment as well as evaluating the methods proposed in this thesis industrially. The long term vision is to be able to integrate the forestry-wood chain from log to finished product in one simulation model.

40|$|One of {{the major}} users of thin, unsurfaced {{hardwood}} lumber is the pallet manufacturing industry. Almost all manufactured products spend part of their life cycle on a pallet during transportation. This makes pallets {{a critical component of}} both the transportation and manufacturing sectors of the economy. Many newly constructed wooden pallets, however, are not currently manufactured to deliver the best performance (strength, durability, and safety) —despite interest by pallet users and pallet manufacturers—because manual grading and sorting of parts is impractical due to processing speeds and volume, labor costs, and laborer skill. This paper describes initial work aiming to create an automated grading/sorting system for hardwood pallet parts using ultrasonic. Experiments were conducted on yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera, L.) and red oak (Quercus rubra, L.) deckboards using pressurecontact, rolling transducers in a pitch-catch arrangement. <b>Sound</b> and unsound <b>knots,</b> cross grain, bark pockets, holes, splits, and decay were characterized using six ultrasound variables calculated from the received waveforms. Our scanning system shows good data-collection repeatability, and scanning rate has little effect on the calculated variables. For each defect type, at least one ultrasonic variable demonstrated significant capability to discriminate between that defect and clear wood. Energy loss variables exhibited the greatest sensitivity to many defect types. Based on the empirical relationships identified in this study, we are now developing models to classify defects using ultrasonic signal characteristics. Scanning properties of the prototype apparatus suggest that it can readily be translated into a commercial product.
