40|$|Topic of my diploma {{thesis is}} {{creating}} design documentation on level of detailed design, Library of Nymburk. Project contains engineering reports, realization drawings, thermal assessment, fire safety assessment, <b>static</b> <b>ceiling</b> evaluation, simplified foundation design {{and design of}} staircases. Projected building has three above ground floors and one partial basement. Structural system vertical is made of mansory walls, based in basement on drilled piles and in first upper floor on strip foundations. Staircases are made of cast-in-place reinforce concrete same for ceiling slabs and joist slabs. Roof structure is warm flat roof. Project was designed in computer programs: ArchiCAD 19, IdeaSTATICA 7, WDLS 5, Svoboda software and vizualization done in Lumion 3 D...|$|E

The semantic complexity as well as the potential inefficiency of any resulting implementation seem to have been the main objections to including dynamic ceilings in Ada 95. Nevertheless, in frequent scenarios such as multi-moded real-time systems, it is desirable for ceiling priorities to be dynamic, to accommodate the different priority assignments given to tasks in the different modes. This problem is usually worked around by applying the so-called ceiling of ceilings as a <b>static</b> <b>ceiling</b> for all modes, which may result in lower schedulability as extra blocking potentially occurs. In this paper we investigate on how to use a hypothetical Set Ceiling dynamic operation, without incurring the risk of semantic ambiguities, and how a multimoded system can benefit from its existence...|$|E

However, for most innovations this assumption is tenuous. Rather, the ceiling, or the potential adopter population {{is more likely to be}} dynamic. The present paper relaxes this assumption and presents a dynamic diffusion model. To illustrate the application of this model, data from two innovations are analyzed. marketing, marketing: buyer behavior, health care: epidemiology...|$|R

While many games and other virtual world applications include real-time simulation of rigid bodies, fluids and gasses have proven harder to animate efficiently. This report describes {{a method for}} extending previous work with particle systems to efficiently simulate smoke that interacts with rigid bodies, using an existing rigid body simulator. The method is applicable compressible fluids and gasses other than smoke. Although the animations produced by this method are not physically correct, they exhibit the phenomenology of real smoke, including dissipation, vortices, and compression. The animations can also be controlled through aesthetically meaningful parameters like drag and vortex axis. Thus the simulator is wellsuited to applications where interactive performance and expressive power are preferred to realism; for example, video games and rapid development of animation. ...|$|R

In the first part, the thesis is focused to issues of energy efficiency and passive house standard of living. In the next part is described topic of the green roof. In the practical part is described selection of structural system, design of composition structures including requirement for implementation of construction works. Furthermore is performed thermal technical assessment of composition structures and calculation of energy balance according to PHPP. In the end is aÂ brief description of <b>static</b> design of <b>ceiling</b> structure. The drawing part includes project and manufacturing documentation including solutions of important construction details...|$|R

They were also adapted by Vittorio Avondo when he acquired the Castle in the 19th century to his own personal use. One reaches this floor by means of a stone spiral staircase adjoining the 'hall of justice'. The same spiral staircase also provides access to the rooms of the ground floor as well as directly to the courtyard. The staircase if formed from a series of stone steps of trapezoidal shape. The wider part of the step is immured into the wall and the narrower part finished with a cylindrical element. Overlapping vertically in a series of steps, these cylindrical elements form a central column that give the staircase a significant <b>static</b> strength. The <b>ceiling</b> of the ramp is created by leaving the lower surface of the upper steps exposed, thus giving the appearance of a continuous ribbon that draws one on as one ascends the staircase.|$|R
