Methodologic and reporting quality was independently assessed by two endocrinologists using a checklist developed by the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Studies Accuracy Group and data were independently abstracted. Results Limitations in methodologic quality were noted in all studies. In all subjects (including those with genetic predisposition) : the sensitivities for detection of pheochromocytoma were 96 %– 100 % (95 % CI ranged from 82 % to 100 %), whereas the specificities were 85 %– 100 % (95 % CI ranged from 78 % to 100 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIM: Unilateral choroidal {{infiltration}} as {{the initial}} manifestation of leukemic relapse in adults is rare, particularly after {{an extended period}} of remission. This report describes this unique ophthalmic presentation, highlights the associated diagnostic challenges, and reviews the literature. METHODS: Two cases are described and an extensive literature review was conducted. RESULTS: A 59 -year-old male with acute lymphoid leukemia, in remission for 18 months, presented with unilateral scleritis, exudative retinal detachment, and choroidal thickening. A 57 -year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia, in remission for 4 years, presented with unilateral choroidal thickening leading to secondary angle closure. In both cases, there was a significant lag from the onset of eye symptoms to establishing a systemic diagnosis of acute leukemia, leading to a delay in definitive systemic treatment, despite a high <b>suspicion</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> based on ophthalmic findings. CONCLUSIONS: These two cases illustrate the fundus findings consistent with leukemic choroidal infiltration that can represent the first sign of relapsed leukemia. The successful treatment of these patients hinges on collaboration between ophthalmologists and oncologists to optimize patient outcomes, highlighting the need for both groups to be aware of this rare ophthalmic presentation...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{this report}} the {{increase}} in the number <b>of</b> notifications <b>of</b> <b>suspicions</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> caused by the way the job is performed, observed recently in the Regional Center of Occupational Medicine in Wrocław, is highlighted. The problem stems from the recognition of medical certification <b>of</b> such <b>diseases</b> as occupational diseases only in one third of all notifications <b>of</b> <b>suspicions.</b> Material and Methods: The case study was based on statistical data concerning notifications <b>of</b> suspected occupational <b>diseases</b> collected in the Branches of the Regional Center of Occupational Medicine in Wrocław in the years 2006 - 2011, as well as on medical certificates issued by the Center's Out-patient Clinics <b>of</b> Occupational <b>Diseases.</b> More than 700 reports of suspected chronic occupational <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> the musculo-skeletal system and chronic <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> the peripheral nervous system caused by the way the job is performed were analyzed, taking into account gender, age and how the work had been done. On the basis of the analysis of medical certificates issued by physicians, decision-making procedures and the recognition <b>of</b> occupational <b>disease</b> certification are discussed. Results: The analysis of the data collected in the Regional Center of Occupational Medicine, Wroclaw, in the years 2006 - 2011 showed a significant increase in the percentage <b>of</b> notifications <b>of</b> <b>suspicions</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> caused by the way the job is performed.

We report a case of NHL involving the left anterior mandibular gingiva of a 56 -year-old man. He was initially treated with antibiotics and root canal therapy of the lower lateral incisor as there was a history of trauma to this area. The adjacent lateral incisor tested non-vital. However, after 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy the swelling increased in size and an incisional biopsy was performed. A diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, large-B cell type was rendered. The patient was then referred to medical oncology for staging work-up and treatment. A course of six cycles of CHOP chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamide, Hydroxydoxorubicin, Oncovin, Prednisone) and radiotherapy were scheduled. There was a complete response {{upon completion of the}} combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One year later, the patient developed a 2 × 2 -cm, painless, firm, fixed mass of the left anterior maxillary vestibule. No additional findings were noted clinically. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the clinical findings and there was no <b>suspicion</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> elsewhere. Pathologic examination revealed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, B-cell type. This lesion was identical morphologically and immunophenotypically to the initial mandibular lesion.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: To {{assess the}} change in hearing, {{vestibular}} function, and size of superior canal dehiscence (SCD) in patients with SCD syndrome over time. PATIENTS:: Adult patients with SCD in one or both ears with documented sign and symptom progression, {{as shown by the}} medical record, audiometry, cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP), and computed tomography (CT). INTERVENTION:: Audiometry, cVEMPs, and temporal bone CT were performed on patients with high clinical <b>suspicion</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> progression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:: Audiometry (magnitude of the air-bone gap [ABG]), cVEMP (magnitude of the thresholds), and CT scans (size of the superior canal dehiscence) were analyzed. Symptoms were assessed at each clinical visit and before repeat testing. RESULTS:: Retrospective review of 250 patients with SCDS showed three patients with disease progression over time with follow-up testing as outlined above. All patients presented initially with mild symptoms, ABGs, low cVEMP thresholds, and small bony defects of the arcuate eminence. Four, 6, and 8 years later, progression of SCD signs and symptoms was observed in these three patients, respectively. Audiometry showed larger ABGs and lower cVEMP thresholds compared with previous testing. CT showed an increase in bony defect size. CONCLUSION:: Progression of SCD symptoms can be associated with a wider air-bone gap, lower cVEMP thresholds, and a larger bony defect. Prospective studies using validated measures of hearing loss and dizziness in patients who have not yet undergone surgery for SCD will determine the association between specific symptoms and objective test outcomes and how these change over time...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{identify}} risk factors associated with extrapulmonar tuberculosis. Methods: We carried out a transversal study which included all patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis registered in a TB reference center in northern Portugal, between January 2008 and January 2012. We evaluated demographic data, comorbidities, BCG vaccination and previous tuberculosis treatments. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors (pÂ <Â  0. 05). Results: Among the 386 patients studied, 260 (67. 4 %) had pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and 126 (32. 6 %) extrapulmonary TB (EPTB). Age over 40 years old (ORÂ =Â  2. 09; 95 %CI: 1. 29 â 3. 38), female gender (ORÂ =Â  1. 63; 95 %CIÂ =Â  1. 02 â 2. 6) and HIV infection (ORÂ =Â  2. 72, 95 %CIÂ =Â  1. 25 â 5. 93) were independent risk factors for EPTB. Alcoholism (ORÂ =Â  2. 22, 95 %CI: 1. 00 â 4. 95) was associated with higher risk for PTB. Previous liver disease (ORÂ =Â  22. 30; 95 %IC: 1. 89 â 263. 57) was an independent risk factor for peritoneal TB. HIV co-infection (ORÂ =Â  12. 97; 95 %IC: 1. 71 â 48. 42) and the presence of previous TB treatment (ORÂ =Â  7. 62; 95 %IC: 1. 00 â 57. 9) increase the risk of disseminated disease.

40|$|Systemic {{amyloidosis}} (SA) {{is often}} diagnosed late. Combining clinical and biochemical biomarkers {{is necessary for}} raising <b>suspicion</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of subcutaneous fat enables SA detection by Congo red staining. The luminescent conjugated probe heptameric formic thiophene acetic acid (h-FTAA) is a sensitive alternative to Congo red-staining of tissue samples. Our objective was to compare h-FTAA fluorescence with the Congo red stain for amyloid detection in FNA-obtained fat tissue. Herein, we studied samples from 57 patients with established SA (19 with AA, 20 with AL, and 18 with ATTR) and 17 age-matched controls (34 - 75 years). Positivity for h-FTAA was graded according to a Congo red-based grading scale ranging from 0 to 4 +. Amyloid grading by both methods correlated strongly (r[*]=[*] 0. 87). Here h-FTAA was positive in 53 of 54 Congo red-positive cases (sensitivity 98 %) and h-FTAA was negative in 7 of 17 Congo red-negative controls (specificity 41 %), but was also positive for 3 Congo red-negative SA cases. We conclude that h-FTAA fluorescence is more sensitive than Congo red staining in this small exploratory study of fat tissue samples, implicating potential sensitivity for prodromal amyloidosis, but is less specific for clinical amyloidosis defined by Congo red positivity. Given its simplicity h-FTAA staining may therefore be the most appropriate method for rapid screening of fat tissue samples but should presently treat grade 1 + as only suggestive, whereas 2 + or higher as positive for amyloidosis. Parallel assessment of h-FTAA and Congo red staining appears highly promising for clinical applications...|$|E

Materials and methods. An MDCT multiphasic {{study of the}} liver was performed in 105 consecutive patients: 89 considered {{to be affected by}} HHT and 16 with <b>suspicion</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> alone. The scan delay was determined by using a test bolus of contrast material. The CT examination was performed with a triphasic technique (double arterial phase and portal venous phase). Multiplanar and angiographic reconstructions were then obtained, and the images checked for the presence of shunts, hepatic perfusion disorders, vascular lesions (telangiectases and large confluent vascular masses), indirect signs of portal hypertension, and anatomical vascular variants. Results. Hepatic vascular alterations were found in 78 / 105 cases (67 / 89 patients affected by H FIT and 11 / 16 patients with clinical suspicion alone). Therefore HHT diagnosis was excluded in 5 patients. 78 / 100 (78 %) patients with HHT had intrahepatic vascular alterations: arterioportal shunts in 40 / 78 (51. 2 %), arteriosystemic shunts in 16 / 78 (20. 5 %), and both shunt types in 22 / 78 (28. 3 %).

The clinical significance in children remains unclear. We investigated the incidence of HHV 6 reactivation in relation to HSCT-associated morbidity and mortality in children. Between January 2004 and May 2006, 58 pediatric patients, median age 7. 6 years (range: 0. 1 - 18. 1 years), received their first allogeneic HSCT. After HSCT, HHV 6, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and adenovirus (AdV) -plasma loads were weekly measured by quantitative PCR. Clinical features, engraftment, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and HSCT-associated mortality and morbidity were monitored. HHV 6 reactivations were classified in group I (no reactivation), group II (loads 1000 cp/mL). CMV, EBV, Herpes Simpex Virus, Varicella Zoster Virus, and AdV-reactivations were treated according to local guidelines. HHV 6 was treated only when there was clinical <b>suspicion</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> Thirty-six HLA-identical and 22 HLA nonidentical grafts were transplanted of which 43 were bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells grafts and 15 were cord blood (CB) grafts. Median follow-up of the patients was 15. 5 (1 - 35) months. HHV 6 reactivation occurred in 39 of 58 (67 %) patients with 31 of 39 (80 %) occurring within the first 30 days post-HSCT. In 26 of 58 (45 %) patients (group III), HHV 6 reactivation was significantly associated with higher nonrelapse mortality (P =. 02), using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models and grade 2 - 4 acute GVHD (P =. 03) and chronic GVHD (P =. 05) in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. HHV 6 reactivation is very common after HSCT in children and is associated with serious transplantation-related morbidity and mortality. Although the exact role of HHV 6 reactivation after HSCT has to be elucidated, early detection and initiation of therapy might be of benefit...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} whether endosonography {{can help in}} the detection and treatment <b>of</b> Dieulafoy's <b>disease,</b> we examined eight patients with <b>suspicion</b> <b>of</b> Dieulafoy's <b>disease.</b> Between December 1992 and April 1995, eight patients were referred because <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> <b>of</b> Dieulafoy's <b>disease.</b> Seven presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and one with a tiny ulcer. In all eight patients the stomach was examined with an Olympus GF-UM 20 echoendoscope. The stomach was filled with 200 to 400 ml of water after which the body, fundus, and cardia were carefully visualized. In all eight patients a clearly visible, relatively large caliber (2 to 3 mm) vessel was seen to penetrate the muscularis propria and could be followed running through the submucosa for 2 to 4 cm. Subsequently four patients received sclerotherapy, three under endosonographic guidance. Follow-up of all patients (median 10 months), showed recurrent bleeding in two patients, 3 and 5 months after sclerotherapy. One was then diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer and one with recurrent bleeding from the Dieulafoy's lesion. Endosonography is useful in the detection <b>of</b> Dieulafoy's <b>disease</b> in patients with unexplained upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Sclerotherapy can be performed during the same procedure, with endosonography-guided injection of the sclerosing agent near the abnormal vesse...|$|R
40|$|Immunoglobulin {{light chain}} {{amyloidosis}} {{is the most}} common acquired systemic amyloidosis. Its presentation is often insidious and progressive, which may delay diagnosis. The authors describe a rare case of immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis in a 34 -year-old man with scleroderma-like manifestation substantiated by multifarious laboratory investigations and the histopathologic feature of involved skin lesions stained with Congo red and crystal violet. This helps to maintain a high clinical <b>suspicion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>disease</b> when confronting similar skin presentation...|$|R
