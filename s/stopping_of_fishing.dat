40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the impact of Paenibacillus polymyxa as water additive probiotic bacterium in common carp, Cyprinus carpio based on water quality, survival, innate immune responses and disease resistance. The completely randomized experiment design was conducted for eight weeks and treatments consisted of three levels of P. polymyxa added in water at concentration of 103 cfumL− 1 (PP 1), 104 cfumL− 1 (PP 2) and 105 cfumL− 1 (PP 3) and one control (Con, without any probiotic). No significant differences (p> 0. 05) in water quality parameters, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonical nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen were observed throughout the experimental period among treatments. The influences of P. polymyxa at different concentrations significantly improved survival (p< 0. 05). Study of different innate immunological parameters viz. lysozyme activity, respiratory burst assay, myeloperoxidase content, catalase and superoxidase dismutase activities showed significant (p< 0. 05) improved immune responses in fish exposed to P. polymyxa as water additive at 103 (PP 1) and 104 (PP 2) cfumL− 1. The supplementation of probiotic in challenge test significantly (p< 0. 05) enhanced the resistance <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> against A. hydrophila infection. In view of recent reports of antibiotic failure from many countries to <b>stop</b> spread <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> diseases, renewed interest in a more complete understanding <b>of</b> the <b>fish</b> immune response to infectious diseases will be critical in developing new eco-friendly control strategies for future.
