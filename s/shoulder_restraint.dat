5|$|Nighthawk {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains. Each train has six cars that have four seats {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 24 riders. Riders are restrained by an over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint</b> and a lap bar. Riders can put on the over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint</b> but a ride operator will push down the lap bar. While in the station, the trains will recline back to the laying down position.|$|E
5|$|Raptor {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars that have four seats {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders in Ski lift like trains. Riders are secured by an over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint</b> with a locking belt. The trains were manufactured in Switzerland at Bolliger & Mabillard's headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Nitro {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has six cars that can seat four rides {{in a single}} row, {{for a total of}} 24 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint.</b> The structure of the trains are coloured blue, red, and yellow; the seats are black and the restraints are yellow. Also, unlike traditional steel roller coasters, Nitro has no floor on its trains.|$|E
5|$|In September 2001, {{the train}} on the Robin track was {{retrofitted}} with lap bars {{in place of}} the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints.</b> Both sides operated with lap bars by June 2002.|$|R
5|$|With the {{original}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints,</b> riders experienced some discomfort during the ride. The restraints {{were converted to}} individually ratcheting lap bars in the 2001 and 2002 seasons on the Batman and Robin trains, respectively.|$|R
50|$|After {{boarding}} the Mindbender, riders put {{on their}} seatbelt and lap restraints. Also, the ride operator lowers large <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints</b> over the riders. All of the restraints keep the riders firmly secured in the seat.|$|R
5|$|Dæmonen {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has six cars that can seat four rides {{in a single}} row, {{for a total of}} 24 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint.</b> This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,200 riders per hour. The structure of the trains are colored orange; the seats and restraints are black. Also, unlike traditional steel roller coasters, Dæmonen has no floor on its trains.|$|E
500|$|Dominator [...] {{operates}} {{with three}} open-air steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars that have four seats {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders per train. Riders are secured by an over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint</b> with a lap belt.|$|E

50|$|Dartron Industries has {{developed}} a floorless car version of the Hurricane. Known as the Down Draft, the ride uses <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints</b> to hold riders, and increases the passenger capacity to five per sweep, sitting in one row of three and a row of two.|$|R
50|$|In peak periods, Superman Escape {{operates}} {{with two}} trains. A single train features five cars, each seating riders in {{two rows of}} two. The trains are of an open design and feature over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints.</b> When operating with both trains, the ride's capacity is 820 riders per hour.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the ride {{vehicles}} is unique. The train consists of two cars, each seating three rows of two people. Instead of conventional <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints,</b> the ride uses special hip restraints. This does allow freedom of upper body movement, however it can cause discomfort if not fitted properly to the lower body.|$|R
50|$|Dominator {{operates}} {{with three}} open-air steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars that have four seats {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders per train. Riders are secured by an over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint</b> with a lap belt.|$|E
50|$|The Airborne Shot {{operates}} {{very similar}} to the HUSS Swing Around. The major noticeable difference is the cars where riders are suspended (legs dangling) while seated being restrained by a <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint</b> throughout the duration of the ride. The Airborne Shot features eight two-passenger open cars with an overall capacity of 16 passengers per ride.|$|E
5000|$|One {{problem was}} {{clearance}} between the riders {{and the track}} overhead. After the trains were mounted to the track, it was quickly discovered that riders could reach and touch the track while the train was in motion, posing the risk of injury. Vekoma had to improvise, adding new bars to the original <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint</b> to prevent guests from reaching up too high.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem of}} the ride is the locking {{mechanism}} for the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints.</b> The Giant Inverted Boomerangs {{require the use of}} a battery pack to unlock each restraint {{in the event of a}} power loss. Virtually all other roller coasters have a quick manual release system to unload in unusual locations or emergency situations.|$|R
50|$|The Dactylus is {{very similar}} to the Huss Swing Around except the ride only {{features}} eight cars with a maximum lift of 90° that each seats two passengers which are restrained by over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints.</b> The Moser version also moves in a counterclockwise (anticlockwise) rotation, where the HUSS Swing Around rotates in a clockwise rotation.|$|R

50|$|In {{order for}} guests to ride Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom, riders {{must be at}} least 48 inches. Each seat {{includes}} an individual over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint.</b> Due to the aggressiveness and very high height of this ride, it is not labeled by Six Flags Magic Mountain as a family friendly ride. The park labels the ride as maximum in the intensity thrill rating. Guests who have fear of heights, high blood pressure, or who are pregnant are not allowed to ride the ride attraction.|$|E
50|$|The ride {{experience}} {{is enhanced by}} the fact that it has a lap bar instead of the over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints.</b> This gives riders more freedom and feel more exposed. The ride is powered by compressed air which makes the ride extremely loud. Some guests feel the noise adds to the experience but it has been criticised due to the noise as well.|$|R
50|$|When Rugrats Runaway Reptar {{became so}} immensely popular at Paramount's Kings Island, the then-owners, Paramount {{decided to build}} {{a copy of the}} ride at Carowinds. Rugrats Runaway Reptar opened in 2003 at Paramount's Carowinds. The ride is exactly the same; paint color and all. The only {{difference}} is the color of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints.</b> At Carowinds, the restraints are red and perhaps more bulky. At Kings Island, the restraints are yellow and had more padding.|$|R
50|$|Riders are {{restrained}} using {{over the}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints</b> and a seatbelt. There {{is a blast}} of air which sends the gondola {{to the top of}} the tower, this is followed by a second blast, in which the gondola reaches 2/3 of the way up the tower, there is then a small blast of air sending the gondola 1/3 of the way up the tower. During the descent, the riders might experience weightlessness for a brief second.|$|R
50|$|Attendance dropped {{even further}} when an {{accident}} {{occurred on the}} Lightning Loops roller coaster. A teenage girl was thrown from the train because she was seated {{on the wrong side}} of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint.</b> After the accident, new safety features were added not only to Great Adventure's roller coasters, but also to roller coasters around the world. Once again, Great Adventure set both a bad and later good example for the amusement park world. However, the accident was not good for the park's attendance. Attendance was so low, in fact, that in 1987 rumors began to spread that the park may close in a few years. At the end of that season, the park was slated to get a new multiple looping coaster but by the end of the year, it was decided that Six Flags Great America would get the coaster since Great Adventure was not seen as a good investment. At the end of the 1988, the park was about to lose its license to sell food, and attendance was so low park management realized a big new addition was necessary.|$|E
40|$|Work-related {{aircraft}} crashes are {{the leading}} cause of occupational fatality in Alaska, with civilian pilots having the highest fatality rate (410 / 100, 000 /year). To identify factors affecting survivability, the authors examined work-related aircraft crashes that occurred in Alaska in the 1990 s (1990 – 1999), comparing crashes with pilot fatalities to crashes in which the pilot survived. Using data from National Transportation Safety Board reports, the authors carried out logistic regression analysis with the following variables: age, flight experience, use of a <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint,</b> weather conditions (visual flight vs. instrument flight), light conditions (daylight vs. darkness), type of aircraft (airplane vs. helicopter), postcrash fire, crash location (airport vs. elsewhere), and state of residence. In the main-effects model, significant associations were found between fatality and postcrash fire (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 6. 43, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 38, 17. 37), poor weather (AOR = 4. 11, 95 % CI: 2. 15, 7. 87), and non-Alaska resident status (AOR = 2. 10, 95 % CI: 1. 05, 4. 20). Protective effects were seen for <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint</b> use (AOR = 0. 40, 95 % CI: 0. 21, 0. 77) and daylight versus darkness (AOR = 0. 50, 95 % CI: 0. 25, 0. 99). The finding that state of residence was associated with survivability offers new information on pilot survivability in work-related aircraft crashes in Alaska. These results may be useful in targeting safety interventions for pilots who fly occupationally in Alaska or in similar environments. Am J Epidemiol 2001; 154 : 1037 – 42...|$|E
40|$|Traumatic {{anterior}} shoulder instability is {{a frequent}} problem and often requires surgical management. In the absence of significant bone deficiency, arthroscopic capsulolabral repair is associated with low recurrence rates and good functional outcome. However, capsulolabral deficiency, particularly after multiple previous attempts at repair, may preclude traditional arthroscopic Bankart techniques. Previous reports have described the use of autograft or allograft augmentation or coracoid transfer {{in the treatment of}} this difficult problem. The purpose of this report is to describe a novel technique of arthroscopic Bankart augmentation of capsulolabral deficiency using a split subscapularis tendon flap to reinforce a damaged capsule. In the absence of bone deficiency, this technique can restore anterior <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint</b> without excessively constraining the glenohumeral joint...|$|E
5000|$|Kong {{starts with}} a 115 ft lift hill. Followed by that is a 108 ft drop, a heartline loop, sidewinder, and back to back inline twists. Despite dislike from the coaster enthusiast {{community}} {{for this type of}} coaster, Kong is typically one of the busiest coasters in the park and well liked by park guests. SLC coasters are commonly referred to as [...] "Hang-and-Bang" [...] coasters by enthusiasts, referring to your head hitting the over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints</b> during the ride.|$|R
50|$|Every two years, Adventure World announces a new major attraction, nicknamed MI (Major Impact) {{followed}} by a number (in sequential order). In 2016, MI3 was announced, opening in September 2017. The ride is estimated to cost at least $7.5 million and be the largest of its type in Australia. On 17 July 2017, MI3 was revealed to be an Intamin Gyro Swing with similar characteristics to its east coast counterpart The Claw, {{the only difference is}} that it will have lap bars instead of over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints.</b>|$|R
500|$|GateKeeper has {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{from the media}} and public. Some riders complained about the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints</b> becoming too tight while sitting in the brake run {{at the end of}} the ride. Others praised the near-miss elements; one woman said, [...] "It feels like you're going to get your knees chopped off and your head chopped off." [...] Many guests also praised the smoothness of the ride and how the renovated main entrance is very appealing. On GateKeeper's opening weekend, Cedar Point achieved its most successful opening weekend in the history of the park, due to the popularity of GateKeeper.|$|R
40|$|Far {{side impact}} trauma has been {{demonstrated}} as {{a significant portion of}} the total trauma in side impacts. The objective of the study was to assess the potential usefulness of countermeasures and assess the trade-offs associated with generic countermeasure design. Because the WorldSID dummy has demonstrated promise as a potential far side impact dummy, it was chosen to assess countermeasures in this mode. A unique far side impact buck was designed for a sled test system that included, as a standard configuration, a center console and outboard three-point belt system. This configuration assumed a left side driver with a right side impact. The buck allowed for additional options of generic restraints including shoulder or thorax plates or an inboard shoulder belt. The entire buck could be mounted on the sled in either a 90 -degree (3 -o’clock PDOF) or a 60 -degree (2 -o’clock PDOF) orientation. A total of 19 WorldSID tests were completed. The inboard shoulder belt configuration produced high shear forces in the lower neck (2430 N) when the belt position was placed over the mid portion of the neck. Shear forces were reduced and of opposite sign when the inboard belt position was horizontal and over the shoulder; forces were similar to the standard outboard belt configuration (830 – 1100 N). A shoulder or thorax restraint was effective in limiting the head excursion, but each caused significant displacement at the corresponding region on the dummy. A <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraint</b> resulted in shoulder displacements of 30 – 43 mm. A thorax restraint caused thorax deflections of 39 – 64 mm. Inboard restraints for far side impacts can be effective in reducing head excursion but the specific design and placement of these restraints determine their overall injury mitigating characteristics...|$|E
5000|$|Roller coaster trains {{also have}} {{restraints}} {{that keep the}} passengers in their seats. There are two major types of restraints: lapbar and over-the-shoulder (Most modern OSTR restraints {{come into contact with}} riders at the lap; however, older so-called [...] "horsecollar" [...] ones actually restrain riders by the <b>shoulders).</b> <b>Restraints</b> always use two locking mechanisms, one on each side, for redundancy. If one fails, the restraint will remain locked. Most roller coasters also have seat belts that may act as secondary safety devices. On over-the-shoulder restraints, this seatbelt is mostly cosmetic as the restraint locks on its own.|$|R
50|$|Over-the-shoulder restraints, {{the most}} common type, consist of a roughly U-shaped padded bar mounted {{to the top of}} each seat that swings downward. Roller {{coasters}} that have inversions usually have this type of restraint. Additionally, almost all Inverted roller coasters and Floorless roller coasters have this type of restraint, since it is difficult to mount a lapbar restraint. One disadvantage of over-the-shoulder restraints is that they can provide discomfort to the rider (known among coaster enthusiasts as headbanging), especially on rougher roller coasters. It is recommended that earrings should be removed before riding roller coasters with Over the <b>Shoulder</b> <b>restraints.</b> Some rides, such as Maverick at Cedar Point, require that guests must remove earrings before riding.|$|R
5000|$|September 22, 2012: A Piper PA-28R-180 Cherokee, {{registration}} number N4567J, inexplicably descends {{to the left}} and strikes trees immediately after takeoff from Runway 17. The commercial rated pilot and certificated flight instructor (CFI) are killed and the airplane is substantially damaged. Initial reports from witnesses indicate that the takeoff roll was noticeably longer than airplanes typically perform, with an unusual engine sound. The NTSB determines the probable cause(s) of this accident as follows: The loss of engine power during takeoff due to fuel contamination. Contributing to the accident was maintenance personnel's failure to adequately correct the water contamination effects. Contributing to the severity of the occupants' injuries was the lack of <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike the Stitch-themed {{replacement}} show, much of Alien Encounter {{took place}} in total darkness while the attraction operated on the guests' non-visual senses. Most of the effects came from individual units mounted on the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints</b> behind audience members' heads. The most common effects were binaural cues which came from the highly separated speakers arranged next to each ear. These speakers bolstered {{many of the other}} effects with foley, creating unique effects like positional audio from the monster, and created general atmospherics to keep the audience tense, including the murmuring and screams of other audience members, pink noise, and heartbeats. The theater's circular design allowed these positional audio effects to be particularly effective, as it prevented individual guests from perceiving that their experiences were not unique.|$|R
500|$|Maverick {{features}} six three-car steam-era style trains {{that seat}} twelve passengers each. The trains have tiered seating and are named and colored as follows: Brett— Brass, Brent— Gold, Ben— Gunmetal, Beau— Gold, Bart— Silver, [...] and Sam— Copper. The restraint system, similar to Accelerator Coasters, includes a hydraulic {{over the shoulder}} harness and an interlocking seat belt. The station features an elevated dual unloading and loading platform enabling two trains to be loaded and unloaded simultaneously. Maverick features western music, contributing to the western theme. There is also an elevator shaft designed {{to look like a}} silo, that also contributes to the western theme. The passenger height restriction was initially set to a minimum of [...] In May 2007, the height restriction was raised to a minimum of [...] per recommendations made by Intamin. At the 2015 Winter Chill Out, Cedar Point announced that the traditional over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>restraints</b> would be replaced with the soft vest style restraints seen on Intimidator 305.|$|R
