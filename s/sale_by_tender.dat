40|$|The {{urban land}} {{development}} options literature invariably assumes that developers are risk-averse {{and that the}} risks can be perfectly spanned in a complete urban land market are discussed in this working paper series. The proposed utility based real options model that allows for developers’ risk preferences and incomplete urban land markets shows that developers’ precautionary savings motives {{have important implications for}} optimal land development decisions. These results predict that high uncertainty decreases the optimal intensity and threshold of capital investment in urban land. The negative impact of developers’ risk-aversion on the threshold disproves the standard real options prediction that uncertainty inhibits urban growth. Using empirical data on public land <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> <b>tender</b> in Singapore from 1 Q 1990 to 1 Q 2012, we found that developers’ risk aversion has a significant negative impact on the values (option premiums) of development lands. Furthermore, our results showed a significant negative relationship between developers’ risk-aversion and the supply of private residential units under construction. When we separated the supply (pipeline) into low-density (landed) and high-density (non-landed) developments, we found the opposite result in the low-density development lands. Thus, risk-averse developers are more likely to delay low-density development projects in an uncertain market...|$|R

2500|$|During her {{crossing}} of the Atlantic she ran into Force K, a number of British ships that had been deployed {{in search of the}} German commerce raider the Admiral Graf Spee. Attached to the force was the aircraft carrier , whose aircraft had spotted another disguised German merchant the previous month, when on 9 October they had sighted the German tanker Altmark. The Altmark had been disguised as the American Delmar, and consequently had escaped unmolested. The Uhenfels was not so fortunate. Detected on 5 November the aircraft reported the German ship, and the destroyer [...] was directed to secure the German merchant. The crew attempted to scuttle the ship but a boarding party from the Hereward was able to prevent this. The captured ship was brought into Freetown the following day. The 61 crew were marched off to a prison camp ashore, defiantly singing Nazi songs. By the time she had been captured the Uhenfels was running short of food. Uhenfels was then taken to Gibraltar for drydocking and inspection, arriving on 18 March. She arrived at London on 5 April 1940, the first captured German vessel to arrive in port there.
