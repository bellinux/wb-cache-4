5|$|Temperatures {{rose in the}} mid-continent {{during the}} Middle Archaic, a warming trend known as the Hypsithermal. Grasslands {{expanded}} east, forests became less common, and many Iowa lakes shrank or disappeared. Humans responded by diversifying their subsistence strategy: eastern Iowa saw a shift towards river resources, and western Iowa towards Plains resources. Excavated sites in eastern and central Iowa include the Brash Site, the Gast Spring <b>Site,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ed’s Meadow Site. Western Iowa sites include the Turin Site, Horizon I of the Cherokee Sewer <b>Site,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pony Creek Site.|$|E

5|$|Based on this information, Frost {{decided to}} divide the company into five groups of forty men for the raid, each named after a famous Royal Navy admiral: 'Nelson', 'Jellicoe', 'Hardy', 'Drake' and 'Rodney'. 'Nelson' would clear and secure German {{positions}} defending the evacuation beach, whilst 'Jellicoe', 'Hardy' and 'Drake' would capture the radar site, villa and the enclosure. 'Rodney' was the reserve formation, placed between the radar <b>site</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> main likely enemy approach to block any counterattack.|$|E
5|$|Between 1872 and 1880, Giovanni and Antonio Rossi, cousins born in Italy, began {{operating}} a vegetable garden on the property.

His son, Joe Vallerga, later built a grocery store on part of the <b>site,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Vallerga family continued to own the property until the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Hungarian {{mathematician}} Pál Turán {{was forced}} {{to work in a}} brick factory, pushing wagon loads of bricks from kilns to storage sites.

Turán was inspired by this situation to ask how the factory might be redesigned to minimize the number of crossings between these tracks.|$|E

5|$|During the Early Archaic period {{regional}} {{variation in}} point forms {{is seen in}} Iowa, and Indians adapted to more localized forms of hunting and gathering while probably maintaining seasonal movements from camp to camp.

40|$|Very often, {{correlation}} analysis of behavioral patterns between social network <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> society suggests that people's behaviors in social network sites are independent from external influences. Recently, some research works {{have demonstrated that}} the assumptions are not always true. The work {{presented in this paper}} shows an approach to identify the possible associations between social network <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> society. It utilized the D-Miner service framework in which different social network analysis tools can be plugged-in <b>and</b> used. <b>The</b> framework is supported by multi-agents, which include crawlers for different social network sites, schedulers to dispatch user requests, and analysis engines with different analytical algorithms. Two new agents have been developed for the association identification. A crawler agent is to collect incidents in <b>the</b> society <b>and</b> an association agent is to identify which social media messages are correlated to corresponding incidents. These identified associations {{can be applied to the}} evaluation of {{correlation analysis}} such as tracing the information propagation between social network <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> society; <b>and</b> indentifying whether <b>the</b> correlations of behavioral patterns between social network <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> society have been dominated by those incidents or not. The new agents have been tested with satisfactory results in identifying the number of connections which support the association between social network <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> society.
