5000|$|In {{state-dependent}} models {{the decision}} to change prices is based on changes {{in the market and}} is not related to the passage of time. Most models relate {{the decision to}} change prices to menu costs. Firms change prices when the benefit of changing a price becomes larger than the menu cost of changing a price. Price changes may be bunched or <b>staggered</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> Prices change faster and monetary shocks are over faster under state dependent than time. [...] Examples of state-dependent models include the one proposed by Golosov and Lucas and one suggested by Dotsey, King and Wolman.|$|E
50|$|Enset (E. ventricosum) is Ethiopia's most {{important}} root crop, a traditional staple in the densely populated south and southwestern parts of Ethiopia. Its {{importance to the}} diet and economy of the Gurage and Sidama peoples was first recorded by Jerónimo Lobo. The root is the main edible portion as its fruit is insipid. Each plant takes {{four to five years}} to mature, at which time a single root will give 40 kg of food. Due to the long period of time from planting to harvest, plantings need to be <b>staggered</b> <b>over</b> <b>time,</b> to ensure that there is enset available for harvest in every season. Enset will tolerate drought better than most cereal crops.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} job {{placement}} of 5 males with severe traumatic brain injury. An individual placement model of supported employment was used. All individuals {{were placed in}} competitive employment and received <b>staggered</b> intervention <b>over</b> <b>time</b> by trained employment specialists. A multiple baseline design across persons {{was used to evaluate}} results. All individuals had been unable to work consistently or at all in competitive work environments. The range of wages was $ 4. 25 to $ 5. 00 per hour with an average of 339 hours of employment specialist intervention time required per case. The major problems experienced by employment specialists were insubordinate and disruptive behaviors as well as other inappropriate social behaviors displayed at the job site...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{decades of}} {{policies}} {{aimed at improving}} the economic position of African Americans in terms of relative income and earnings, they remain substantially behind whites, and research presented in this brief indicates that the wealth gap is even more <b>staggering.</b> Following families <b>over</b> <b>time</b> {{in order to understand}} racial differences in the sources and patterns of wealth accumulation, the author finds that African Americans would have gained significant ground relative to whites in the past 30 years if they had inherited similar amounts, comparable levels of family income, and more similar portfolio compositions. Therefore, even if the income gap between whites and African Americans were immediately eliminated, it may take another two generations for the wealth gap to close. However, certain policies could help speed up the process. ...|$|R
40|$|Temporal {{distribution}} of individual price changes is of crucial importance for business cycle theory {{and for the}} micro-foundations of price adjustment. While it is routinely assumed that price changes are <b>staggered</b> <b>over</b> <b>time,</b> both theory and evidence are ambiguous. We use a large Belgian data set to analyze whether price changes are staggered or synchronized. We find that the more aggregate the data, the closer the distribution to perfect staggering. This result holds for both aggregation across goods and across locations. Our results provide support for Bhaskar 2 ̆ 019 s (2002) model of synchronized adjustment within, and staggered adjustment across, industries...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{develops}} a two-country model with {{flexible exchange rates}} and perfect capital mobility, for evaluating the alternative macroeconomic policy rules. Macroeconomic performance is {{measured in terms of}} fluctuations in inflation and output. Expectations are rational, and prices are sticky; wagesetting is <b>staggered</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> The countries are linked by aggregate spending effects, relative price effects, and mark-up pricing arrangements. The modelis solved and analyzed through deterministic and stochastic simulation techniques. The results suggest that international capital mobility is not necessarily an impediment to efficient domestic macroeconomic performance. Changes in the expected appreciation or a depreciation of the exchange rate along with differentials between real interest rates in the two countries can permit macroeconomic performance in one country to be relatively independent of the policy rule chosen by the other country. The results depend on the particular parameter values used in the model and suggest the need for further econometric work to determine the size of these parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} social interaction {{contributes to the}} disposition ef-fect. I analyze a unique database drawn from a social network for retail traders. Participating in the social network requires an agreement between the social network and a trader’s brokerage. The introduction of roughly fifty retail-specific brokerages into the social networking environment was <b>staggered</b> <b>over</b> <b>time,</b> which provides an op-portunity to causally identify the impact of social interaction. Traders are almost twice as susceptible to the disposition effect after entering the social network. Relative {{to the formation of}} a simulated network, traders who are similarly prone to the disposition effect tend to form friendships with one another, which suggests a feedback effect. A number of alternative theories – adverse selection, transaction costs, blame delegation, learning, and a belief in mean-reversion – while valid on their own, are unlikely to explain the detrimental impact of social influence. The social network increases (has little effect on) the propensity to hold onto losses (gains), which supports the simplest explanation for the disposition effect: individuals are loss-averse, and it can be eve...|$|E

40|$|A simulation-based {{modelling}} {{approach is}} {{used to examine the}} effects of stratified seed dispersal (representing the distribution of the majority of dispersal around the maternal parent and also rare long-distance dispersal) on the genetic structure of maternally inherited genomes and the colonization rate of expanding plant populations. The model is parameterized to approximate postglacial oak colonization in the UK, but is relevant to plant populations that exhibit stratified seed dispersal. The modelling approach considers the colonization of individual plants over a large area (three 500 km x 10 km rolled transects are used to approximate a 500 km x 300 km area). Our approach shows how the interaction of plant population dynamics with stratified dispersal can result in a spatially patchy haplotype structure. We show that while both colonization speeds and the resulting genetic structure are influenced by the characteristics of the dispersal kernel, they are robust to changes in the periodicity of long-distance events, provided the average number of long-distance dispersal events remains constant. We also consider the effects of additional physical and environmental mechanisms on plant colonization. Results show significant changes in genetic structure when the initial colonization of different haplotypes is <b>staggered</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> and when a barrier to colonization is introduced. Environmental influences on survivorship and fecundity affect both the genetic structure and the speed of colonization. The importance of these mechanisms in relation to the postglacial spread and genetic structure of oak in the UK is discussed...|$|E
