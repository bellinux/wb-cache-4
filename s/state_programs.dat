5|$|In addition, Wang Anshi {{had his own}} {{commentaries on}} Confucian {{classics}} made into a standard and required reading for students hoping to pass the state examinations. This and other reforms of Wang's were too much for some officials to bear idly, as there were many administrative disagreements, along with many personal interests at stake. In any case, the rising conservative faction against the reformer Wang Anshi branded him as an inferior-intellect who was not up to par with their principles of governance (likewise, the reformers branded conservatives in the same labeled fashion). The conservatives criticized Wang's reforms {{as a means of}} curbing the influence of landholding families by diminishing their private wealth in favor of self-sufficient communal groups. The conservatives argued that the wealth of the landholding class should not be purposefully diminished by <b>state</b> <b>programs,</b> since the land holding class was the essential socio-economic group that produced China's scholar-officials, managers, merchants, and landlords.|$|E

25|$|The {{external}} difficulties had far-reaching consequences. The {{government was}} forced to suspend part of the country's debt payments and eventually to impose exchange controls. Excess coffee production led to increasing interventions in the coffee market. The <b>state</b> <b>programs</b> to support coffee prices went bankrupt in 1930. To avoid further decreases in coffee prices, the central government bought huge amounts of coffee, which was then destroyed. Central government intervention provided support to the coffee sector and, through its linkages, {{to the rest of}} the economy.|$|E

In the UK, the slum clearance effort was bigger in scale than the formation of British Railways, the National Health Service and other <b>state</b> <b>programs.</b> UK Government data suggests the clearances that took place after 1955 demolished about 1.5 million slum properties, resettling about 15% of UK's population out of these properties. Similarly, after 1950, Denmark and others pursued parallel initiatives to clear slums and resettle the slum residents.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, DSPD {{has faced}} steep {{obstacles}} in its mission {{to care for}} Utahns with disabilities. The most acute and recent challenge involved funding issues which arose after the economic downturn of 2008. As state tax receipts fell {{in the months following}} the crisis, the legislature began making difficult decisions about how to fund <b>state</b> <b>programs.</b> The Division was asked to make do with a significant budget reduction. DSPD decided {{that the best way to}} reduce operational costs was to privatize casework. This allowed the Division to preserve critical services. By the end of 2009, all but a handful of caseworkers had transitioned from direct employment with the state to a private contractor. In both 2010 and 2011, the Division met additional budget shortfalls with staffing reductions, to avoid the reduction of critical services to waiver services recipients. It has been challenging for the Division to meet the same workload demands with less staff and resources.|$|E
25|$|Romney’s initial {{emergency}} {{budget proposal}} {{for fiscal year}} 2003 called for $343 million in immediate funding cuts, necessitating layoffs of state employees and cuts in aid to cities and towns for public safety and education. He explained in a televised address, “There's no time to restructure state government or remake <b>state</b> <b>programs.</b> On such an emergency timetable, there's just time for cuts.” He also proposed cuts in state expenditures for Medicaid, the government program providing {{health care for the}} poorest state residents. The cuts included caps in payments to medical providers (one example being through limiting payments for hospital stays to 20 days, no matter how sick the patient), increased stringency of the criteria for Medicaid eligibility, and rationing of access to higher-priced medications for Medicaid patients. Some 36,000 Massachusetts residents lost their Medicaid eligibility. The 2003 emergency budget revision proposal also included funding cuts affecting public colleges and universities, treatment for schizophrenic and other mentally ill patients, and various other social services.|$|E

The payment included $1.3 billion in criminal penalties for felony violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and $1 billion to settle allegations it had illegally promoted the drugs for uses that were not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and caused false claims to be submitted to Federal and <b>State</b> <b>programs.</b> The criminal fine was the largest ever assessed in the United States up to that time. Pfizer has entered an extensive corporate integrity agreement (CIA) with the Office of Inspector General and {{will be required to}} make substantial structural reforms within the company, and maintain the Pfizer website (www.pfizer.com/pmc) to track the company's post marketing commitments.

25|$|As noted previously, {{prior to}} SWANCC, {{virtually}} all US wetlands were, at least theoretically, subject to regulation under section 404. As federal jurisdiction is diminished, {{the responsibility to}} protect affected wetlands falls on states primarily and local governments, which also regulate some wetlands. State and local wetlands regulatory programs focus primarily upon navigable waters, tributaries, and adjacent wetlands. They supplement but do not substitute for federal jurisdiction. According to the Association of State Wetland Managers (ASWM), 14 states {{have some form of}} regulatory program for freshwater wetlands, but they are quite variable. Differences exist in part because freshwater wetland types vary greatly across the nation and because of differing state preferences. Some of the <b>state</b> <b>programs</b> are very comprehensive, but regulations in many of the 14 states are limited by wetland size, mapping requirements, and exemptions for specified activities. According to ASWM, state regulations do not generally apply to federal lands. Some of the states with the largest isolated wetland acreages provide little or no state protection, including Alaska, Louisiana, Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Nebraska, Kansas, and Mississippi.|$|E
