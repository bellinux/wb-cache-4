5|$|Due to the {{failures}} of the ratings agencies, European regulators obtained new powers to supervise ratings agencies.

Credit-ratings companies have to comply with the new standards or will be denied operation on EU territory, says ESMA Chief Steven Maijoor.|$|E
5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Authority</b> of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E

5|$|On 29 September 2008, it was {{announced}} that Glitnir would be nationalised. However, subsequent efforts to restore faith in the banking system failed. On 6 October, the Icelandic legislature instituted an emergency law which enabled the Financial <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Authority</b> (FME) to take control over financial institutions and made domestic deposits in the banks priority claims. In the following days, new banks were founded to take over the domestic operations of Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir. The old banks were put into receivership and liquidation, resulting in losses for their shareholders and foreign creditors. Outside Iceland, {{more than half a million}} depositors lost access to their accounts in foreign branches of Icelandic banks. This led to the 2008–2013 Icesave dispute, that ended with a ESA ruling that Iceland was not obliged to repay Dutch and British depositors minimum deposit guarantees.|$|E

25|$|Banking in Switzerland is {{regulated}} by the Swiss Financial Market <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Authority</b> (FINMA), which derives its authority {{from a series of}} federal statutes. The country's tradition of bank secrecy, which dates to the Middle Ages, was first codified in the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks, colloquially known as the Banking Law of 1934. The regime of bank secrecy that Swiss banks are famous for came under pressure {{in the wake of the}} UBS tax evasion scandal and the 1934 banking law was amended in 2009 to limit tax evasion by non-Swiss bank clients.|$|E

25|$|Iceland {{had been}} hit {{especially}} hard by the Great Recession that began in December 2007, because {{of the failure of}} its banking system and a subsequent economic crisis. Before the crash of the country's three largest banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, their combined debt exceeded approximately six times the nation's gross domestic product of €14billion ($19billion). In October 2008, the Icelandic parliament passed emergency legislation to minimise the impact of the Financial crisis. The Financial <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Authority</b> of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. Icelandic officials, including central bank governor Davíð Oddsson, stated that the state did not intend to take over any of the banks' foreign debts or assets. Instead, new banks were established to take on the domestic operations of the banks, and the old banks will be run into bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|In his new role, Robinson {{exercised}} unprecedented {{control over}} the Navy Department bureau system. For over eighty years, the various bureaus - Ordnance, Supplies and Accounts, Medicine and Surgery, etc. - had functioned more or less autonomously, and the decentralized bureau system had acquired a reputation for parochialism and inefficiency. Bureau chiefs reigned supreme within their own domains, reporting only to the secretary or undersecretary of the Navy, and jealously guarded their statutory prerogatives against repeated attempts to consolidate uniformed authority {{in the person of}} the chief of naval operations. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the two-ocean Navy, by now scheduled to arrive in 1944, suddenly was needed immediately. To maximize construction speed, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox created a new Office of Procurement and Material and placed Robinson at its head. The new office worked through the existing bureaus to coordinate all Navy procurement, giving Robinson <b>supervisory</b> <b>authority</b> over all the bureau chiefs, a change in Navy Department governance as sudden and sweeping as the simultaneous consolidation of line authority {{in the hands of the}} commander in chief of the United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest J.

25|$|A further 21 six-car Class C vehicles, {{designated}} as C2, were ordered from Siemens Mobility in November 2010. The C2 vehicles can ferry 940 passengers (as opposed to 912 by C1), have brighter lighting, monitors for passenger information, upholstered seats and coloured LEDs {{on the doors}} which signal opening and closing of the doors. As of May 2015, none of the C2 carriages had entered either limited or regular service. C2 had not obtained the operating certification due to technical defects, which have largely been addressed. In addition, numerous changes in federal and state law had caused some confusions and problems with preparing the necessary documentations for the certification process. In June 2016, one Class C2 vehicle was permitted to operate on {{the northern part of}} U6 line between Kiefrngarten and Garching Forschungzentrum as a trial run for the Technical <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Authority</b> (Technischen Aufsichtsbehörde i.e. TAB) of the Oberbayern government to make their assessment.
