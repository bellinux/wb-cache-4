5|$|The {{majority}} of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a <b>small</b> <b>packet</b> of sperm {{on top of}} a gelatinous cone, on the substrate either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, Hynobiidae and Cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.|$|E

Romaine had been involved in stealing the body of Alexander T. Stewart three months earlier and was demanding a ransom from his widow Cornelia. In several signed letters to Jones, Romaine offered the return of Stewart's body for $250,000 and was instructed to contact him through personal ads in the New York Herald. He also received a <b>small</b> <b>packet,</b> express delivered from Canada, which included the knobs and two of the silver handles from Stewart's casket as well as a small strip of velvet and triangular piece of paper. Jones immediately reported the incident to the NYPD Chief of Police George W. Walling and, after a meeting with Walling and Henry Hilton, Jones agreed to proceed in the negotiations.|$|E

Most of the characters' situations remain the same, e.g. Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is still being transported in custody of U.S. Marshal Edward Mars (Fredric Lehne); Dr. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) is transporting his deceased father; and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is still paralyzed. [...] However, there are some differences as well, e.g. Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) is returning to Los Angeles without his stepsister; Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) claims to be the luckiest man alive; Locke claims to have participated in his walkabout; Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) is a passenger and Rose Henderson (L.

During the flight, Jack is called upon to save Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), who has asphyxiated while attempting to swallow a <b>small</b> <b>packet</b> of heroin. Jack, with the help of Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), resuscitates him; Charlie is arrested for drug possession.

50|$|Error {{concealment}} is {{a technique}} used in signal processing that aims to minimize the deterioration of signals caused by missing data, called packet loss.

30|$|<b>Small</b> <b>packets</b> {{can cause}} a lot of overhead, {{especially}} when in tunnels, where each packet will get an additional tunnel header. Aggregating a number of <b>small</b> <b>packets</b> in a larger packet can give some performance gain. SCTP allows to bundle multiple 'chunks' into a larger packet. However, this results in some extra delay, since an aggregated packet will have to be composed before it can be sent. The appropriate caution should be taken to ensure that this happens only with traffic flows which do not need timely delivery.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The TCP-Friendly Rate Control for <b>small</b> <b>packets</b> (TFRC-SP) {{protocol}} {{was designed for}} applications including streaming audio and Voice over IP which send <b>small</b> <b>packets.</b> The long round trip delay of a satellite link could degrade the performance of such applications including streaming audio and VoIP that use TFRC-SP. In this paper, we analyze the performance of TFRC-SP carrying live streaming audio and VoIP over networks that include satellite paths. We also propose using the Quickstart algorithm along with TFRC-SP to improve the performance of these applications over a satellite link. I...|$|R

Around 20 years of research on VoIP, some Quality of Service (QoS) problems of VoIP are still remaining. The newly emerging wireless mesh network has fundamental difficulties in supporting VoIP applications due to the MAC overheads introduced by huge amounts of <b>small</b> <b>packets.</b> Packet aggregation is a promising application to mitigate these overheads.

40|$|IP {{multicast}} is an e#cient point-to-multipoint distribution mechanism. However, {{there are}} a number of scenarios in which a reverse, multipoint-to-point aggregation mechanism is highly desirable. We introduce a programmable mechanism, called gathercast, to support the aggregation of packets without altering any of the routing or forwarding mechanisms of the Internet. Gathercast is based on active services framework and can be deployed incrementally. It works well within the current IP multicast model. We have implemented it in our own network. One of the aggregation mechanisms that we study in this paper is the combination of <b>small</b> <b>packets</b> using gathercast. <b>Small</b> <b>packets</b> constitute a large fraction of packets in today's Internet. Every packet requires a routing table lookup and incurs the same performance cost irrespective of the size of the packet. Gathercast allows creation of an Internet HOV (car pool) lane, in which multiple <b>small</b> <b>packets</b> to the same destination are combined into a [...] ...|$|R
