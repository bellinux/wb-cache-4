5|$|A Bengali folk-tale about Shashthi {{tells of}} the {{youngest}} of seven daughters-in-law in a prosperous household who was a glutton that used to secretly steal food and then blame a black cat, which was thrashed as punishment. The black cat {{happened to be the}} vahana (mount) of Shashthi and complained about the mistreatment to the goddess, who pledged to avenge it. When the youngest daughter-in-law gave birth to a son, the cat stole the child in the night and gave it to the goddess, and did the same for her next six sons. The neighbours accused the young mother of carelessness and began to believe <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> witch who ate her own children. Finally, when a daughter was born, the young mother decided to remain awake the whole night to resolve the mystery. She managed to catch the cat in the act of robbery and wounded it with her bracelet, but the cat escaped with the child, leaving a trail of blood. The mother followed this trail to the abode of Shashthi. There she saw her sons playing around Shashthi as the goddess held the mother's infant daughter in her arms. Shashthi explained the reason for the mother's ordeal and told her to ask pardon of the cat. The mother asked the cat's pardon, which was granted, and then she promised the goddess that she would offer worship in a ritual dedicated to her, which would {{come to be known as}} the Jamai-Shasthi Vrata. The mother returned home with her children and spread the worship of the goddess, who blessed her family with children, wealth and happiness.|$|E

Blunt then {{attempts}} to rape her {{based on his}} new contempt for women ("be revenged on one whore {{for the sins of}} another"). Frederick enters, also convinced that Florinda is a prostitute, and joins Blunt. Florinda gives them a diamond ring and asks them to consult Belvile. Frederick fears that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lady of some worth and asks Blunt to wait. Blunt is still sceptical but agrees. Frederick locks Florinda in a room.|$|E

25|$|The British called Demasduit Mary March {{after the}} month {{when she was}} taken. Officials later took her to St. John's, Newfoundland. The colonial {{government}} hoped to make Demasmaduit comfortable while she was with the English, so that one day <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bridge {{between them and the}} Beothuk. Demasduit learned some English and taught the settlers about 200 words of the Beothuk language. In January 1820, Demasduit was released to rejoin her kin, but she died of tuberculosis while making the trip back to Notre Dame Bay.|$|E
500|$|Like James, Anne later {{supported}} a Catholic match for both their sons, and her correspondence {{with the potential}} bride, the Spanish Infanta, Maria Anna, included a request that two friars be sent to Jerusalem to pray for her and the King. The papacy itself was never quite sure where Anne stood; in 1612, Pope Paul V advised a nuncio: [...] "Not considering the inconstancy of that Queen and the many changes she had made in religious matters and that even if it might be true that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Catholic, one should not take on oneself any judgement." ...|$|E

Rock music critic Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph named it the fifth best James Bond theme song, describing [...] "Die Another Day" [...] as an electro R workout which was [...] "expressively weird, brutally modern, satisfyingly original and evocative of the dark heart of Bond. Plus, Madonna actually looks as if <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> match for Bond in either bed or battlefield. Or both." [...] Rolling Stone listed it as the seventh best Bond song in the magazine's list of [...] "The top 10 James Bond Theme Songs".|$|E
