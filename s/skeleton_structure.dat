25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War and the {{consequent}} reduction {{of the threat of}} a conventional warfare in Europe brought the refocus of the Portuguese Army. From the beginning of the 1990s, the Army started a process of deep transformation, evolving from a mainly conscript army organized as <b>skeleton</b> <b>structure</b> oriented to support the raising of operational units through mobilization to a much smaller professional army organized with permanent operational units. This change implied a rationalization of the forces that included the deep reduction of personnel, the disbandment of a number of regiments and bodies (including the Commando Regiment) and the transference of the Parachute Troops from the Air Force to the Army.|$|E

The facade is designed with a rhythmic pattern; it comprises two types of facade designs ("a" [...] and [...] "b") that are ordered laterally in an a-b-a-a-b-a arrangement. The house is topped with a two-tier roof. Kazuo Shinohara's 1954 house at Kugayama is remarkably similar in its design, although it is built with steel and has a simpler rhythm in its facade.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to present recent {{achievements}} in field of <b>skeleton</b> <b>structures.</b> The aim of this work is to show results of searching for mechanically and technologically advantageous micro- and macrostructures. Methods of microstructure controlling were described. Most important parameters of the manufacturing process were identified. Design/methodology/approach: The influence of internal topology to stress distribution was described with the use of computer simulations. Simulations of the mold filling processes were also carried out. Real experiments were performed to prove the simulation results. The Qualitative and quantitative metallographic analysis were also carried out. Findings: It was found that the octahedron shape of internal cell causes best stress distribution and that the skeleton castings are a good alternative for cellular materials such as metal foams, lattice structures and sandwich panels. Their structured arranged topology allows precise design of properties. Research limitations/implications: Casting methods used to manufacture materials such as described skeleton castings confirmed their usefulness. Not well known and used yet rheological properties of liquid metals allow obtaining shape complicated structures near to metallic foams but structured arranged. Practical implications: Technological parameters of the skeleton castings manufacturing process were developed. Without use of advanced techniques there is a possibility to manufacture cheap <b>skeleton</b> <b>structures</b> in a typical foundry. With use of advanced technology like 3 D printing there are almost unlimited possibilities of the skeleton castings internal topologies. Originality/value: Three dimensional cast <b>skeleton</b> <b>structures</b> with internal topology of octahedron confirmed their usefulness as elements used for energy dissipation. Obtaining the homogenous microstructure in the whole volume of complicated shape castings can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Al 2 O 3 /Cu (with 30 wt% of Cu) {{composites}} {{were prepared}} using a combined liquid infiltration and spark plasma sintering (SPS) method using pre-processed composite powders. Crystalline structures, morphology and physical/mechanical {{properties of the}} sintered composites were studied and compared with those obtained from similar composites prepared using a standard liquid infiltration process without any external pressure. Results showed that densities of the Al 2 O 3 /Cu composites prepared without applying pressure were quite low. Whereas the composites sintered using the SPS (with a high pressure during sintering in 10 minutes) showed dense structures, and Cu phases were homogenously infiltrated and dispersed with a network from inside the Al 2 O 3 <b>skeleton</b> <b>structures.</b> Fracture toughness of Al 2 O 3 /Cu composites prepared without using external pressure (with a sintering time of 1. 5 hours) was 4. 2 MPa·m 1 / 2, whereas that using the SPS process was 6. 5 MPa·m 1 / 2. These toughness readings were increased by 18 % and 82 %, respectively, {{compared with that of}} pure alumina. Hardness, density and electrical resistivity of the samples prepared without pressure were 693 HV, 82. 5 % and 0. 01 Ω•m, whereas those using the SPS process were 842 HV, 99. 1 %, 0. 002 Ω•m, respectively. The enhancement in these properties using the SPS process are mainly due to the efficient pressurized infiltration of Cu phases into the network of Al 2 O 3 <b>skeleton</b> <b>structures,</b> and also due to high intensity discharge plasma which produces fully densified composites in a short time...|$|R

Large benthic foraminifera, dwelling in warm shallow coral reefs, harbor several microalgae of dinoflagellates, diatoms, red algae, {{and others}} as symbionts (Lee and Anderson 1991). Many scleractinian corals that inhabit tropical/subtropical oceans belong to the class Anthozoa of the phylum Cnidaria.

They maintain a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellate. However, young polyps are not born with dinoflagellate; rather, they obtain algae from the surrounding water column and local sediment.|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{extrusion}} of arbitrary polygon meshes is introduced. This method {{can be applied}} to model a large class of complex 3 -D closed surfaces. It consists of defining a (typically small) set of connected polygons in 3 -D that form a skeleton of the final object, and assigning extrusion distances to all polygons. The two sides of a polygon may have different extrusion distances. An automatic extrusion algorithm constructs a closed 3 -D polygon mesh around the skeleton, making use of the indicated extrusion distances. We call this process inflating the polygons of the skeleton. Unlike traditional extrusion, the method works for non-planar skeleton configurations, and it also supports branching <b>skeleton</b> <b>structures</b> (i. e. edges with more than two incident polygons). © 1997 by John Wiley 2 ̆ 6 amp; Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|<b>Skeleton</b> <b>structures</b> {{of objects}} {{are used in}} a wide variety of {{applications}} such as shape analysis and path planning. One of the most widely used skeletons is the medial axis, which is a thin structure centered within and homotopy equivalent to the object. However, on piecewise linear surfaces, which are one of the most common outputs from surface reconstruction algorithms, natural generalizations of typical medial axis definitions may fail to have these desirable properties. In this paper, we propose a new extension of the medial axis, called the medial residue, and prove that it is a finite curve network homotopy equivalent to the original surface when the input is a piecewise linear surface with boundary. We also develop an efficient algorithm to compute the medial residue on a triangulated mesh, building on previously known work to compute geodesic distances. ...|$|R
