5000|$|After {{reassembly}} at the Naval Dockyard in Alexandria, McClean, Alec Ogilvie, Horace Short and {{the expedition}} mechanic Gus Smith flew the 255 mi to Cairo on 2 January 1914. This was {{the limit of}} the aircraft's range, and Spottiswoode had to establish a set of fuel dumps at 120 mi intervals along the planned route. Once this had been done the party set off for Upper Egypt, arriving at Aswan on 15 January. [...] Problems were encountered with overheating of the rear row of cylinders, and on taking off from Aswan the performance fell off so badly that after forty miles McClean returned to Aswan, taxiing most of the way. On reaching Aswan {{it was found that}} four cylinders needed to be replaced. After these had been sent from Paris the expedition resumed on 16 February, when the 192 mi flight to Wadi Halfa was made. After two days rest they started the next stage, which followed the course of the Nile round the Great Bend in order to see the second, third and fourth cataracts: this was interrupted by an encounter with a violent dust-storm, which forced McClean to land, damaging one wingtip. After this was repaired the flight continued to Merowe and then to Abu Hamed. On leaving Abu Hamed an oil-pump failed: a landing was made on the river and the aircraft was taxied to Shereyk, where the party waited until a <b>spare</b> <b>pump</b> could be sent. However, soon after leaving Shereyk both oil-pumps failed, and in the resulting emergency landing near Gananita Island a float and the tail-booms were damaged. A ten-day delay followed, and on 14 March they flew to Atbara: the next day Kabushia was reached, where a connecting rod broke, extensively damaging the engine, which was sent back to the railway workshops at Atbara. The repaired engine was fitted by 22 March, when the final stage to Khartoum was completed. After a day of giving joy-rides the aircraft was then dismantled and sent back to England.|$|E
40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) United States Orbital Segment (USOS) Oxygen Generation System (OGS) has {{accumulated}} {{almost a year}} of operation at varied oxygen production rates within the US Laboratory Module (LAB) since it was first activated in July 2007. It was operated intermittently through 2009 and 2010, due to filter clogging and acid accumulation in the recirculation loop. Since the installation of a deionizing bed in the recirculation loop in May of 2011 the OGA has been operated continuously. Filters in the recirculation loop have clogged and have been replaced. Hydrogen sensors have drifted apart, and a power failure may have condensed water on a hydrogen sensor. A pump delta pressure sensor failed, and a replacement new <b>spare</b> <b>pump</b> failed to start. Finally, the voltage across the cell stack increased out of tolerance due to cation contamination, and the cell stack was replaced.

40|$|This report {{provides}} an independent evaluation {{of information for}} a Windows based Human Machine Interface (HMI) to replace the existing DOS based Iconics HMI currently used in the Data Acquisition and Control System (DACS) used at Tank 241 -SY- 101. A fundamental reason for this evaluation {{is because of the}} difficulty of maintaining the system with obsolete, unsupported software. The DACS uses a software operator interface (Genesis for DOS HMI) that is no longer supported by its manufacturer, Iconics. In addition to its obsolescence, it is complex and difficult to train additional personnel on. The FY 1997 budget allocated $ 40 K for phase 1 of a software/hardware upgrade that would have allowed the old DOS based system {{to be replaced by a}} current Windows based system. Unfortunately, budget constraints during FY 1997 has prompted deferral of the upgrade. The upgrade needs to be performed at the earliest possible time, before other failures render the system useless. Once completed, the upgrade could alleviate other concerns: <b>spare</b> <b>pump</b> software may be able to be incorporated into the same software as the existing pump, thereby eliminating the parallel path dilemma; and the newer, less complex software should expedite training of future personnel, and in the process, require that less technical time be required to maintain the system...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{some basic}} techniques of reliability modelling and quantitative evaluation in repairable systems. The Markov approach is utilized {{to analyze the}} heat transport pump sub-system in the Bruce generating station of Ontario Hydro and the required state space models under the various assumptions are constructed by a computer program. The system availabilities {{and the value of}} <b>spare</b> <b>pumps</b> are evaluated from these models. The effects of permanent and temporary failures on the reliability indices are also examined. The Markov approach cannot be applied directly if the distributions associated with all the system contingencies are not exponentially distributed. Reliability evaluation of a non-Markovian system is usually much more complicated tan that of a Markovian system. A practical non-Markovian technique, the method of stages, is discussed in this thesis and characteristics of several basic stage combinations are presented. The method is applied to a practical system and the results are compared with those of other techniques. The simulation method, which is also popular in reliability evaluation, is illustrated by application to various practical problems. The efficiency of simulation can be improved by developing an accelerated simulation method and an example of this method is presented in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|A site-wide steam {{modeling}} and optimization program (Visual Mesa) was implemented at the Bayou Cogen plant in Bayport, Texas in 1997 {{and has been}} in use continuously since that time. This program optimizes steam production among four cogen units and three boilers, compressor turbine extraction/condensing, <b>spared</b> <b>pump</b> (turbine/motor) operation, as well as the monitoring of the entire steam system. The program is also facilitates the costing of gaseous and liquid products through the use of offline case studies which can be used to optimize production of these products on our industrial gas pipelines. The program is used for both day-to-day site optimization, outage forecasting, and long-term site planning. In this presentation, we will discuss who the main users of the program are and how they and the plant derive benefits from its use. The primary users are the Bayou shift operators, Bayou shift supervisor, the OCC duty control engineer and the OCC product supply manager. The Bayou shift operator is given optimal production targets to achieve from Visual MESA Online writing to the plants SCADA system. The OCC duty control engineer monitors Bayou?s operations and the online Visual MESA model and also runs offline models to analyze potential equipment configuration changes to further optimize the system...|$|R

60|$|Then {{the troubled}} beating of the gong carried {{the order to}} take up {{everything}} and bear it beyond high-water mark, and the flare-lamps broke out by the hundred between the webs of dull iron as the riveters began a night's work racing against the flood that was to come. The girders of the three centre piers--those that stood on the cribs--were all but in position. They needed just as many rivets as could be driven into them, for the flood would assuredly wash out the supports, and the ironwork would settle down on the caps of stone {{if they were not}} blocked at the ends. A hundred crowbars strained at the sleepers of the temporary line that fed the unfinished piers. It was heaved up in lengths, loaded into trucks, and backed up the bank beyond flood-level by the groaning locomotives. The tool-sheds on the sands melted away before the attack of shouting armies, and with them went the stacked ranks of Government stores, iron-bound boxes of rivets, pliers, cutters, duplicate parts of the rivet-machines, <b>spare</b> <b>pumps</b> and chains. The big crane would be the last to be shifted, for she was hoisting all the heavy stuff up to the main structure of the bridge. The concrete blocks on the fleet of stone-boats were dropped overside, where there was any depth of water, to guard the piers, and the empty boats themselves were poled under the bridge down-stream. It was here that Peroo's pipe shrilled loudest, for the first stroke of the big gong had brought aback the dinghy at racing speed, and Peroo and his people were stripped to the waist, working for the honour and credit which are better than life.|$|R

40|$|Investigations {{of energy}} {{efficiency}} of 25 pumps showed wire-to-water efficiencies ranging from 30 % to 60 %, {{with an average}} of 47 %. Raising the efficiency of just 7 pumps to the realistic target of 60 % would require an initial investment of 126 k€ and represent a net present value (profit) of 446 k€ over a 10 -year pump lifetime, saving 8. 6 kt of CO 2 emissions. The primary measures for raising efficiency are in order of priority: 1) improving pre-filtration of raw water to prevent rapid mechanical wear due to suspended particles during monsoon, 2) providing training, improved working conditions, and better tools and <b>spare</b> parts among <b>pump</b> operators and 3) replacing aging, oversized pumps with properly sized pumps operating close to peak efficiency. As of January 2014 the results have been confirmed by a Bureau of Energy Efficiency-certified energy auditor and the extent and funding of efficiency measures implementation is in planning...|$|R
40|$|Background. Leukocyte {{depletion}} {{recently has}} been introduced for cardiac surgical patients to attenuate leukocyte-mediated inflammation and organ reperfusion injury. We evaluated the feasibility of a new leukocyte depletion method in which systemic leukocyte depletion is achieved through the venous side of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit under low blood flow. Methods. Forty cardiac surgical patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were allocated randomly to a leukocyte depletion group (n = 20) and a control group (n = 20). In the depletion group, leukocyte filtration was achieved with two filter sets located between the venous drainage and the venous reservoir, Leukocyte filtration was commenced {{after the start of}} rewarming but before the release of the aortic cross-clamp, and it was driven by a <b>spare</b> roller <b>pump</b> of the heart-lung machine. Results. All the episodes of filtration went smoothly within a period of 10 minutes and with a blood now rate of 400 mL/min. The mean leukocyte removal rate calculated at the end of filtration was 69 %. Circulating leukocytes were reduced by 38 % in the depletion group compared with the control group at the moment of crossclamp release (4. 3 x 10 (9) /L versus 6. 8 x 10 (9) /L, p < 0. 05). The postoperative inflammatory response also was reduced as indicated by less production of interleukin- 8 (p < 0. 05). Clinically, {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups in postoperative Pao(2) or pulmonary hemodynamics. Conclusions. It is technically feasible to deplete circulating leukocytes through the venous side of the cardiopulmonary bypass-circuit with a low blood now rate. Future studies should focus on the duration and timing of leukocyte depletion to optimize the methodology of leukocyte depletion for cardiac surgical patients.

40|$|Hypotonicity {{produces}} a marked {{activation of the}} Na+ pump in frog sartorius muscle. The increase in net Na+ efflux under hypotonic conditions occurs despite the reductions in [Na+]i that are due to fibre swelling and Na+ loss. The pump density (ouabain binding) increases not only upon reduction of the medium osmotic pressure (π) from its normal value (π= 1) to one-half (π= 0. 5), but also in muscles that are returned to π= 1 after equilibration in π= 2 medium. The equilibration in π= 2 medium does not affect pump density. Ouabain-binding increments cannot be ascribed to {{a rise in the}} Na+–K+ exchange rate of a fixed number of pumps: they also occurred in the continued presence of a saturating concentration of ouabain (50 μm). Under those conditions, the π= 1 →π= 0. 5 transfer produced a 43 % increase in pump sites, while the π= 2 →π= 1 transfer induced a rise of 46 %. Actinomycin D did not alter the stimulation of Na+ extrusion elicited by hypotonicity, suggesting that de novo synthesis of pumps was not involved in the increase of the apparent number of pump sites. Disruption of microtubules by colchicine (100 μm) and intermediate filaments by acrylamide (4 mm) did not alter the hypotonic effect. Likewise, genistein (100 μm), a specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, did not affect significantly the hypotonic response. Microfilament-disrupting agents like cytochalasin B (5 μm) and latrunculin B (10 μm) reduced the increase in Na+ efflux induced by π= 1 →π= 0. 5 transfer by about 35 % and 72 %, respectively. Latrunculin B reduced the increases in pump density generated by π= 1 →π= 0. 5 and π= 2 →π= 1 transfers by about 79 % and 91 %, respectively. The results suggest that the membrane stretch due to hypotonic fibre volume increase would promote a microfilament-mediated insertion of submembranous <b>spare</b> Na+ <b>pumps</b> in the sarcolemma and, consequently, the rise in active Na+ transport...|$|R
6000|$|Disko {{kept them}} busy {{fiddling}} with the sails; and when those were flattened like a racing yacht's, Dan had to wait on the big topsail, which was put over by hand every time she went about. In <b>spare</b> moments they <b>pumped,</b> for the packed fish dripped brine, which does not improve a cargo. But {{since there was no}} fishing, Harvey had time to look at the sea from another point of view. The low-sided schooner was naturally on most intimate terms with her surroundings. They saw little of the horizon save when she topped a swell; and usually she was elbowing, fidgeting, and coaxing her steadfast way through grey, grey-blue, or black hollows laced across and across with streaks of shivering foam; or rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of some bigger water-hill. It was as if she said: [...] "You wouldn't hurt me, surely? I'm only the little 'We're Here'." [...] Then she would slide away chuckling softly to herself till she was brought up by some fresh obstacle. The dullest of folk cannot see this kind of thing hour after hour through long days without noticing it; and Harvey, being anything but dull, began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wave-tops turning over with a sound of incessant tearing; the hurry of the winds working across open spaces and herding the purple-blue cloud-shadows; the splendid upheaval of the red sunrise; the folding and packing away of the morning mists, wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors; the salty glare and blaze of noon; the kiss of rain falling over thousands of dead, flat square miles; the chilly blackening of everything at the day's end; and the million wrinkles of the sea under the moonlight, when the jib-boom solemnly poked at the low stars, and Harvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook.|$|R
