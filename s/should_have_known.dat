5|$|Marie {{noted that}} Dempsey was {{disappointed}} in the lack of tactical flair shown by Brigadier Hinde throughout the battle and that the British <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better than to attempt an armoured advance unsupported by infantry in the bocage. The British fought an uncoordinated infantry and tank battle during {{the morning and the}} Germans did much the same throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|Bound for a London {{show from}} Liverpool, The Beatles escape {{a horde of}} fans ("A Hard Day's Night"). Once they are aboard the train and trying to relax, various interruptions test their patience: after a dalliance with a female passenger, Paul's {{grandfather}} is confined to the guard's van and the four lads join him there to keep him company. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr play a card game, entertaining some schoolgirls before arriving at their desired destination ("I <b>Should</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Known</b> Better").|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Polly backed rather faint-heartedly, but Aunt Larkins {{was not to}} be denied. Having {{hugged and}} kissed her nephew resoundingly she gripped him by the wrists and scanned his features. She had a round, sentimental, {{freckled}} face. [...] "I <b>should</b> <b>'ave</b> <b>known</b> 'im anywhere," [...] she said with fervour.|$|R

You are so much thinner than when I saw you last; but your eyes have not changed, nor your smile. Of course your hair having got gray makes a difference, and--and--" [...] and she stopped.|$|R
5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{returned}} {{to file a}} lawsuit in Tennessee state court in October 2003 {{on behalf of the}} victims of two teenage stepbrothers who had pleaded guilty to reckless homicide, endangerment, and assault. Since the boys told investigators they were inspired by Grand Theft Auto III, Thompson sought $246 million in damages from the publisher, Take-Two Interactive, along with PlayStation 2 maker Sony Computer Entertainment America and retailer Wal-Mart. The suit charged that the defendants knew or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that the game would cause copycat violence. On October 22, 2003, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Two days later, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, and the case was closed.|$|E

Derosier went on to add that in fact, the evidence pointed to evolution. That is not explicit in the article, but Derosier is known as an evolution proponent, so Behe <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> since he quotes Derosier seemingly as in agreement, that Derosier disagreed with him regarding whether the bacterial flagellum points to evolution or Intelligent Design.|$|E
25|$|The picture target {{experiments}} that {{were conducted by}} Krippner and Ullman were criticized by C. E. M. Hansel. According to Hansel there were weaknesses {{in the design of}} the experiments in the way in which the agent became aware of their target picture. Only the agent <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed, however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) discovers he has {{forgotten}} his wallet, containing his ID, at home. He blames Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) for not packing it, although Cameron {{points out that}} Mitchell never specifically {{asked him to do}} so. Phil (Ty Burrell) convinces Mitchell that he can drive him home and back in time to make the flight. This annoys Claire (Julie Bowen) who believes her husband <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> how nervous flying makes her and he should stay with her. She visits the airport bar to calm her nerves, where she sees Jay and reassures him that Gloria loves him.|$|E
25|$|After an {{adjournment}} {{of three}} weeks, Collingwood presented his summation on 12–16 December 1949. He said that perpetrators {{of war crimes}} could not be absolved of guilt by claiming that they were only following orders when such orders were unlawful under international law. He stated that it was immaterial whether or not Manstein {{was aware of the}} mass killings in his area; he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> and he should have tried {{to put a stop to}} it. He remarked that the testimony of Manstein's fellow soldiers was not corroborated by independent observers, and thus should not be relied upon too heavily. Regarding Manstein's use of the scorched earth tactic, Collingwood pointed out that it was not done out of any military necessity, but had been planned and ordered well in advance. The court adjourned until 19 December to consider the verdict.|$|E
25|$|T had conceded {{before the}} trial that Mrs Hancock's and Mr Margereson's {{illnesses}} were caused by asbestos from the factory, but any compensation depended on proving that the company knew or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> the dangers the dust could cause. Three months after the hearing ended Mr. Justice Holland handed down a written judgment, finding for the plaintiffs, and awarded damages of £65,000 to June Hancock and £50,000 to Evelyn Margereson. The judge ruled that the defendant was liable {{on the grounds that}} the risks of asbestos dust exposure had been known by the defendant since 1933 and it was foreseeable that children allowed to play in the vicinity of the factory would be exposed to the risk of pulmonary disease. This was a landmark decision, extending as it did the duty of care beyond factory employees to those outside a factory's walls.|$|E

25|$|By 11pm the patrols {{reached a}} main road heading east to Barce {{and they went}} on with their {{headlights}} full on, pretending to be an Axis convoy. At the top of an escarpment leading to the Barce plains they came across two L3 tankettes parked guarding {{each side of the}} road. The LRDG vehicles opened up with heavy machine gun fire as they raced through. The tankettes were caught unprepared, although the crews <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that night traffic had been forbidden. By midnight the LRDG were at the crossroads outside Barce and the two patrols separated to carry out their tasks. They were allocated two hours by Major Easonsmith who, with his two HQ jeeps, would proceed independently around Barce, looking for suitable targets. Major Peniakoff and the Guard's wireless truck stayed at the crossroads to deal with any attempts at stopping the LRDG's withdrawal.|$|E

He commented on his past experiences that [...] "It can't be a hindrance, having done it before, but it doesn't make it any less tense. It makes it a very long season.

500|$|In September 2007, it was {{discovered}} that the Bow Ridge fault line ran underneath the facility, hundreds of feet east of where it was originally thought to be located, beneath a storage pad where spent radioactive fuel canisters would be cooled before being sealed in a maze of tunnels. The discovery required several structures to be moved several hundred feet further to the east, and drew criticism from Robert R. Loux, then head of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects, who argues that Yucca administrators <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> about the fault line's location years prior, and called the movement of the structures “just-in-time engineering.” ...|$|E
500|$|On February 26, 2010, the Ethics Committee {{issued its}} report. [...] It {{determined}} that Rangel had violated House gift rules, by accepting reimbursement for his {{travel to the}} conferences. [...] It found {{that he had not}} known of the contributions, but concluded that he was still responsible for them and was required to repay their cost. [...] Five other members were cleared of having violated rules, but were also required to repay their trips. [...] Rangel disagreed with the committee's finding, saying: Because they were my staff members who knew, one of whom has been discharged, [...] that I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known.</b> Common sense dictates that members of Congress should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoing, or mistakes, or errors of staff.|$|E
500|$|Boyd met Harrison {{during the}} filming of The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night in 1964. [...] She was cast as a schoolgirl in that film. Her only line in the film was asking [...] "Prisoners?", but she later {{appeared}} in the [...] "I <b>Should</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Known</b> Better" [...] segment. Boyd was in a serious relationship with photographer Eric Swayne during this time, and so declined a date proposal from Harrison. Several days later, after ending her relationship with Swayne, {{she went back to}} work on the film, and Harrison asked her out on a date for a second time; she said [...] "yes". The couple went to a private gentlemen's club called the Garrick Club, chaperoned by the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein. According to Boyd {{one of the first things}} Harrison said to her on the film set was: [...] "Will you marry me? Well, if you won't marry me, will you have dinner with me tonight?" ...|$|E
