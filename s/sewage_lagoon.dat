40|$|Nesting {{structures}} for ground-nesting waterfowl {{may be an}} effective technique for increasing nesting success in regions in which nest success is below the 15 % threshold needed to maintain a stable population. We studied the occupancy rate of artificial nesting structures called hen housesTM by Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) nesting in two different wetland habitats, beaver ponds and <b>sewage</b> <b>lagoons,</b> in eastern Ontario during 1999 - 2001. We hypothesized that, because natural cover was sparse on <b>sewage</b> <b>lagoons,</b> Mallards would occupy hen houses {{at a higher rate}} on <b>sewage</b> <b>lagoons</b> than on beaver ponds. However, of the 248 hen houses distributed between beaver ponds and <b>sewage</b> <b>lagoons,</b> none was occupied by waterfowl. Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula) were the only avian species that nested in hen houses. However, Mallards successfully nested directly under several structures (n = 6) when water levels were low enough to expose the ground beneath them. Mayfield daily nest survival estimates for Mallards nesting in natural cover were similar on <b>sewage</b> <b>lagoons</b> and beaver ponds for all years (mean = 0. 99) and were higher than most published estimates. Factors such as nesting cover, predation pressures, and structure design and material may influence the use of artificial hen houses and should be considered when planning a hen house program outside of the Prairie Pothole Region...|$|R

A September 1999 corrective action investigation identified the only contaminant of concern above preliminary action levels at this CAU (i. e., total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel-range organics). During this same investigation, three Corrective Action Objectives (CAOs) were identified to prevent or mitigate exposure to subsurface debris and contaminated soil. Based on these CAOs, {{a review of existing}} data, future use, and current operations in Area 22 of the NTS, three CAAs were developed for consideration: Alternative 1 - No Further Action, Alternative 2 - Closure in Place with Administrative Controls, and Alternative 3 - Excavation and Removal.

Alternative 3 was chosen on technical merit as the preferred alternative for CAU 230 / 320.
