40|$|Hybrid {{zones are}} natural {{experiments}} that expose the forces maintaining species differences. But for cases where a trait {{of one of}} the hybridizing pair appears shifted into the range of the other, the underlying mechanism can be difficult to infer. For example, hybridization between hermit warbler (Dendroica occidentalis) and Townsend's warbler (Dendroica townsendi) is restricted to narrow hybrid zones in Washington and Oregon, yet hermit mtDNA can be found in phenotypically pure Townsend's populations up to 2000 â€Škm north along the Pacific coast. This could reflect introgression of selectively favoured hermit mitochondria north across the hybrid zones, or a neutral genetic wake left behind following <b>southern</b> zone movement. <b>Hermit</b> mitochondrial haplotypes in populations of coastal Townsend's exhibit relatively high genetic diversity and significant divergence from those found in populations of hermit warblers. This contradicts the predictions of selective introgression, but is consistent with a northern population of hermits diverging in a glacial refugium before being replaced by Townsend's via aggressive hybridization. Previous field studies showing Townsend's males to be competitively superior to hermit males support this scenario, and suggest that the extreme hybrid zone movement evidenced by the hermit mitochondrial wake represents an extinction in progress...|$|R
