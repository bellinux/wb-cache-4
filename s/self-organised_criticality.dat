40|$|The Landsat programme, {{which started}} in 1972, {{initiated}} an era of space-based Earth observation relevant {{to the study of}} large river systems through the provision of spatially continuous, synoptic and temporally repetitive multi-spectral data. Free access to the Landsat archive from mid- 2008 has enabled the scientific community to reconstruct the Earth’s changing surface and, in particular, to reconstruct the planform dynamics of the world’s largest rivers. The present research reconstructs the planform dynamics in the lower reaches of one of the Asian mega-rivers, the River Ganga-Padma (Ganges), from 1972 - 2010 using the Landsat archive. The research based on sequential river planform maps generated from the time series revealed a periodic pattern of evolution of the river system over the study period which began by means of meandering at four locations. The meander bends increased in sinuosity until chute cut-offs were triggered, returning the river to a state similar to that {{at the beginning of the}} sequence. This periodic pattern is constrained by natural and artificial hard points, and by the Farakka Barrage, meaning that the observed cyclic pulsing is likely to continue into the future. The characteristics and dynamics of meandering rivers have been the subject of extensive research, though the mechanisms involved are still not completely understood. Presently, availability of archival satellite sensor data at regular and frequent intervals for almost four decades presents a great potential for increasing our understanding of the natural processes of meander growth. Though early research indicates that meander growth can be explained by instability of alternate bars in a straight channel, but research based on field data and simulation models have shown that instability of river meanders is an inherent property and the meanders reach a critical value of sinuosity when cut-offs occur and then the complex system undergoes an self-adjusting process. The meander dynamics of the lower reaches of the Ganga-Padma system has been studied in the context of threshold response of a complex system. A conceptual model was developed based on spatial information from the sensor data and quantitative information on river metrics to explain the behaviour of the river system including evidence for <b>self-organising</b> <b>criticality</b> and the attempts of the river to reach dynamic equilibrium. The meandering channel pattern with a tendency of braiding of the river Ganga-Padma were explained based on existing empirical models as well as models based on mobility number and channel stabilization criterion. The threshold for chute cut-off was explored and subsequently the conditions for soft avulsion / branching were studied which showed that the condition for chute cut-off in the Ganga-Padma system is not due to bankfull flow velocity and the super elevation of flow at the centreline of channel but may be due to lack of vegetation stabilization on the Ganga-Padma floodplain. The effect of tectonics and meandering in the moderately paced avulsion of the Ganga-Bhagirathi system to the present Ganga-Padma system was modelled in the present research. It was found that gradient advantage and bend upstream of bifurcation does not result in modelled avulsion as observed in small and medium rivers and large rivers in tectonically inactive regions. A tectonic uplift results in a modelled avulsion period consistent with historical observations. It was found that backwater effect and high sediment mobility keep both bifurcated channels active to attain an anabranching pattern. The backwater effect was found to play an important role for sustaining the anabranch planform of many of the largest rivers of the world.

40|$|The {{brain is}} a complex system par excellence. Its {{intricate}} structure has become clearer recently, {{and it has been}} reported that it shares some properties common to complex networks, such as the small-world property, the presence of hubs, and assortative mixing, among others. These properties provide the brain with a robust architecture appropriate for efficient information transmission across different brain regions. Nevertheless, how these topological properties emerge in neural networks is still an open question. Moreover, in the last decade the observation of neuronal avalanches in neocortical circuits suggested the presence of <b>self-organised</b> <b>criticality</b> in neural systems. The occurrence of this kind of dynamics implies several benefits to neural computation. However, the mechanisms that give rise to critical behaviour in these systems, and how they interact with other neuronal processes such as synaptic plasticity are not fully understood. In this thesis, we study <b>self-organised</b> <b>criticality</b> and neural systems in the context of complex networks. Our work differs from other similar approaches by stressing the importance of analysing the influence of hubs, high clustering coefficients, and synaptic plasticity into the collective dynamics of the system. Additionally, we introduce a metric that we call node success to assess the effectiveness of a spike in terms of its capacity to trigger cascading behaviour. We present a synaptic plasticity rule based on this metric, which enables the system to reach the critical state of its collective dynamics without the need to fine-tune any control parameter. Our results suggest that retro-synaptic signals could be responsible for the emergence of <b>self-organised</b> <b>criticality</b> in brain networks. Furthermore, based on the measure of node success, we find what kind of topology allows nodes to be more successful at triggering cascades of activity. Our study comprises four different scenarios: i) static synapses, ii) dynamic synapses under spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), iii) dynamic synapses under node-success-driven plasticity (NSDP), and iv) dynamic synapses under both NSDP and STDP mechanisms. We observe that small-world structures emerge when critical dynamics are combined with STDP mechanisms in a particular type of topology. Moreover, we go beyond simple spike pairs of STDP, and implement spike triplets to assess their influence on the dynamics of the system. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that implements this version of STDP in the context of critical dynamics in complex networks...|$|E

This paper {{argues that}} the {{pervasive}} distributions of closely-spaced stress-aligned fluid-saturated microcracks in almost all rocks are a critical system close to fracture criticality and loss of shear strength. New evidence includes three examples in which observations and modelling directly imply non-linear interactive critical systems with some form of <b>self-organised</b> <b>criticality</b> (SOC).

These new results from three very different fields strongly suggest that the earth's crust is a critical interactive non-linear system with <b>self-organised</b> <b>criticality</b> (SOC). Some effects are subtle and easily ignored. Others are so common and familiar that we have developed one-off explanations in terms of conventional deterministic physics to describe their behaviour and occurrence. We suggest that the identification of the sub-critical physical processes is one reason for the success of APE-modelling. Recognition of (crack) criticality leads to a new understanding of low-level (pre-fracturing) deformation that has massive implications for almost all dynamic processes in the crust. These include reservoir characterisation, hydrocarbon recovery, monitoring the progress of fluid-fluid fronts, and the build-up of stress before fracturing, faulting, and earthquakes, and the movement of magma before volcanic activity. The implications will be discussed and the arguments presented. ...|$|E

Not only did he miss a key model (Ecolab [2, 3]) that has a clear self-organised critical mechanism, but also Newman’s model exhibits the same mechanism that gives rise to power law behaviour as does Ecolab. I would argue that this mechanism should be described as self-organised critical. In this paper, I have also implemented Newman’s model using the Ecolab software, removing the restriction that the number of species remains constant. It turns out that the requirement of constant species number is non-trivial, leading to a global coupling between species that is similar in effect to the species interactions seen in Ecolab. In fact, the model must selforganise to a state where the long time average of speciations balances that of the extinctions, otherwise the system either collapses or explodes. In view of this, the real contribution of Newman’s model is to provide a simple, almost analytic model that can used to understand more sophisticated models such as Ecolab. In this paper, I derive analytically the power law distribution of species lifetimes, and show that the exponent is expected to be precisely- 2 for Newman’s model. In the Ecolab model the exponent is expected to be- 2 for small times, but increasing to- 1 at larger times.
