40|$|This study {{investigated}} the strategies which first-year <b>Saudi</b> <b>university</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>students</b> used to derive the meaning of unfamiliar words while reading English texts. Using cluster sampling method, participants chosen {{to be included in}} the study consisted of six male and six female classes (120 male and 120 female students) of the preparatory year deanship students at King Saud University, 2009 - 2010. Following the administration of a vocabulary test as the instrument, descriptive statistics and ANOVA tests were used to analyze the collected data. Results revealed that the students were weak in using the right strategies in guessing the meaning of unknown vocabulary. The use of a combination of two or more strategies was found to result in a better correct guessing rate, but few students tended to use this technique. The results support the importance of practical training in when and how to use various strategies: students need to be given regular practice in order to learn how to use them most effectively. Highlighting the main strategies which students use to correctly derive the meaning of words, the findings indicate EFL teachers should train their students in the use of a variety of strategies for guessing the meaning of unfamiliar words. </p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship between composition exercises and oral interaction amongst <b>Saudi</b> <b>university</b> students while working in groups, with a particular focus on the methods that develop writing skills. The participants, 50 in all, were <b>Saudi</b> <b>university</b> <b>EFL</b> first year <b>students</b> belonging to three different groups according to their English proficiency. The data came from two research instruments: 1) written responses to open-ended questions regarding students’ experiences and attitudes towards writing, and 2) transcripts of audiotaped interactions between students. The findings suggested that integrating writing and oral interaction enabled students to realize the way writing works, and that there are, in the first place, many different strategies available to aid in the process of composition. Students were able to look at the process of writing more comprehensively rather than focusing on particular points of grammar, spelling, or punctuation. In addition to this, by building on the structure of group work, students acquired interpersonal skills vital for learning: listening, speaking, personal organization, and providing constructive feedback. Teachers should note some problems associated with oral discussions, including the quality of discussion, the time consumed in talking, and intermittent lapses into the mother tongue.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{longitudinal}} exploratory research is to investigate the influence of four factors: proficiency levels, text types, times, and learning environments on the writing complexity, accuracy, and fluency of Saudi students majoring in the English language. Specifically, the study seeks to determine how and when the CAF constructs and sub-constructs of low- and high-proficiency Saudi EFL undergraduates in three learning contexts: traditional learning context (TLC), blended learning context (BLC), and online learning contexts (OLC), are affected longitudinally across two writing tasks (classification and argumentative) that differed in their level of complexity. Also, it intends to specify when and which of the three learning contexts: TLC, BLC, and OLC, {{will lead to the}} most/least increases or decreases in the CAF constructs and sub-constructs of the low- and high-proficiency Saudi EFL undergraduates across the two composition tasks. To answer such questions, 75 <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>university</b> <b>students</b> were recruited from the pool of two proficiency levels (low and high). Six groups of equal number of students were generated from dividing randomly the 45 Low-proficiency participants and the 30 high-proficiency participants. Each of these groups was exposed to one of the previously mentioned learning contexts and undertook three tests: pre-test, mid-term test, and post-test. The 450 students’ writings were analyzed according to 45 measures of CAF constructs and sub-constructs and by using two statistical tests: t-test and ANOVA. For the first question, the t-test results showed that the similarities and differences of effect on CAF constructs between the two writing tasks were observed to be group-specific as they were based on the proficiency levels, learning contexts, and timescales (i. e., short term and long term). In other words, depending on whether a construct in the two text types was influenced similarly or differently, such influence did not generally occur in a systematic way and across the same number and types of metrics for the same group, or even across the groups of the same or different proficiency levels in the short term and long term. The findings only lent partial support to Skehan and Foster’s Limited Attentional Capacity Model and Robinson’s Multiple Attentional Resources Model since some constructs increased (e. g., accuracy, lexical variation, and syntactic complexity) or decreased (e. g., lexical density, lexical sophistication, lexical variation, syntactic complexity, and fluency). There were many other cases which were beyond the predictions of the aforementioned researchers and their explanations on how the students’ attention is deployed while performing the complex task(s). For instance, altering task complexity led some constructs to remain unaffected (e. g., syntactic complexity, lexical density, lexical sophistication, lexical variation, accuracy, and fluency), equal increases and decreases or only increases (e. g., fluency), increases more than decreases (e. g., lexical variation), less increases (e. g., accuracy), or less/more decreases (e. g., syntactic complexity and lexical sophistication). In terms of the second question, the ANOVA test results indicated mixed findings because each of the three learning environments resulted in benefits in some ways. In the two proficiency levels, the TLC, BLC, and OLC had the same level of success/unsuccess in enhancing all the measures of some CAF constructs in both writing tasks in the short term and long term. Nevertheless, in the other CAF constructs, there was no uniform linear development or deterioration of all measures across the six groups. In each of these constructs, the differences between these groups emerged from one or more measures, but not from all measures. Each of these learning contexts stood alone in being the most or least successful in increasing some constructs. Nonetheless, this was dependent on the participants’ proficiency levels, text types, and timescales. This study provides several pedagogical implications and recommendations for academic research, EFL writing instructors at pre-university and university levels, and task-based investigators...|$|R

The educational {{importance of}} the connection between self-efficacy beliefs for self-regulated learning and perceived responsibility for learning has been widely recognized in the literature in recent years. However, the relationship between these two constructs has not been specifically investigated in an English as a foreign language (EFL) context. Taking this gap as an impetus, this study aimed to explore the extent to which Turkish <b>university</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>students</b> feel efficacious in regulating their English learning {{and the extent to which}} they assume responsibility for their English learning processes, and how these two constructs relate to each other. The study was conducted at Yıldız Technical University, School of Foreign Languages, with the participation of 503 students from four different English proficiency levels (i. e. elementary, pre-intermediate, intermediate, and advanced). The data were collected through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Analysis of the quantitative data revealed that Turkish <b>university</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>students</b> were moderately self-efficacious in regulating their English learning and perceived themselves to be slightly more responsible than their teachers for their English learning processes. It was also revealed that there is a positive correlation between these two constructs. Analysis of the qualitative data contributed to the study by revealing that there might be other constructs than self-efficacy beliefs that relate to students‟ perceptions of responsibility, such as motivation and interest. This study implied that Turkish <b>university</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>students</b> need to be provided with educational opportunities that promote their self-efficacy to regulate their English learning and their sense of control over their English learning.

Lastly, students‘ attitudes toward audio books were also investigated in the study. This study was conducted over three weeks, with the participation of 82 students from four classes at elementary and intermediate levels at Anadolu University School of Foreign Languages. One of the classes at each level was selected as the control group and the other class was designated as the experimental group. The control group students were assigned to read three graded readers, one book per-week, while the experimental group students were assigned to read the same books and listen to the accompanying audio CDs outside the classroom. In order to investigate {{the effectiveness of}} audio books on the reading comprehension of <b>university</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>students,</b> reading comprehension tests, which were prepared for each book separately, were administered to the control and the experimental group students after each one-week reading period. In order to address the first research question, the mean values and standard deviations were calculated and compared between the control and experimental groups. The test results of the elementary and the intermediate level students were compared to explore any difference in the effectiveness of audio books on reading comprehension according to their proficiency levels. Following each reading comprehension test, the experimental group students were administered a questionnaire with the intent to find out their attitudes toward using audio books. Analysis of the test data revealed that audio books are effective in the text comprehension of <b>university</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>students,</b> and they appeared to have a greater effect on students at intermediate level than they did at elementary level.

40|$|An {{educational}} {{challenge that}} many <b>university</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>students</b> face is {{the production of}} written academic arguments {{as part of their}} required essays. Although the importance of argumentative writing in education is uncontested, and research shows that <b>EFL</b> <b>students</b> find difficulties in producing such texts, it is not adequately dealt with for the L 1 Arabic writer. In this paper, an explicit instructional approach in teaching the academic argument in required essays in an advanced EAP course is described. The approach is based on the thesis-support element of argumentation and organizational plans operationalized through a teaching/learning cycle. The instruction of the academic argument in the essay is scaffolded through five steps of the cycle: building the context, modeling and deconstructing texts, constructing texts jointly, constructing texts independently and linking related texts. Qualitative analysis of a few student sample essays indicated improved argumentative structure and transfer of acquired argumentative writing skills to new topics. Although the improvements can not be generalized, it is considered a successful attempt in providing needed explicit instruction for L 1 Arabic <b>students</b> in an <b>EFL</b> environment and which also could be used with <b>students</b> in any <b>EFL</b> context.

40|$|AbstractThe {{nature of}} silence in {{classroom}} is complex with different students possessing distinct beliefs, social norms, and cultural backgrounds. There are several {{factors that contribute}} to students’ reluctance to speak up and participate in classroom activities, such as linguistic, psychological, and sociocultural (Harumi, 2010) issues. Awareness of sources of silence on the part of EFL instructors may decrease misinterpretations regarding students’ level of engagement in language classrooms. Despite the available literature on Asian students’ silence (e. g., Littlewood, 2000), studies in the context of Iran are scarce and have mainly focused on exploring teachers’ perspectives in this regard. To help bridge this gap, we interviewed 28 <b>university</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>students</b> exploring their perceptions of the nature of reticence in classroom, its causes, and its consequences. Thematic analysis of the data yielded mixed results. Regarding its causes, silence might be because of students’ personality type and even a legitimate form of classroom participation. In some other cases, {{it seems to be the}} result of teachers’ emotionally negative feedback to questions and mistakes or, at a more general level, their authoritarian approach to students. In terms of its outcomes, student reticence was found to sometimes contribute to and sometimes hinder deeper mental engagement in classroom process.

This study also explores how the Taiwanese L 2 learners’ identities might affect their use of L 2 discourse norms within their narratives. The findings show that within the three sets of narratives, past experiences, in general, are recounted in chronological order and the organisation of narratives follows the sequential order defined by Labov (1972). In terms of orientation, there is some cultural variance. The TM and TEFL narratives underscore {{the importance of family}} values in Taiwanese society and underline the role of teachers in these students’ worlds. However, the data shows some variance with Labov’s (1972) results in terms of the relationship between complicating action, resolution and evaluation. In terms of external evaluation, the British narrators use much more evaluation in directly addressing their listeners. In terms of internal evaluation, there is significant variance within the three sets of narratives i. e. stress usage, adverb usage, and repetition. The findings suggest that there is no major difference in tellership and tellability in the three sets of narratives. In terms of learner identity, although some Taiwanese <b>EFL</b> <b>students</b> demonstrate high levels of integrative motivation, they have difficulty using L 2 discourse norms in their narratives.

The post-course survey reveals that most students altered their attitudes towards the effi cacy of peer review, and that most students would be willing to continue using peer review in future writing classes. However, this study suggests tha...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of genre-based {{instruction}} {{on the process of}} teaching summary-response writing to <b>EFL</b> <b>university</b> <b>students</b> at an advanced level of language proficiency. A quasi-experimental research design (one-group pre- and post-test) was followed and quantitative and qualitative methods to collect and analyse the data were employed. The participants were one instructor, two raters and an intact group of 46 <b>EFL</b> <b>students</b> attending the fourth year of five-year Teacher Training, Licentiate and Translation Studies Programmes in an Argentinian university. The subjects were administered a pre-test requesting them to write a summary-response before instruction. After a ten-week period of instruction following the genre-based approach, a post-test was administered. Two independent raters scored students’ summary-responses using an analytic scoring scale designed for this study. The quantitative data collected from the tests were analysed using two statistical tests, namely, Cohen’s Simple Unweighted Coefficient and Wilcoxon Rank Sums (matched pairs). Results indicated that the difference in means between pre- and post-test scores was statistically significant. The information gathered was triangulated with the analysis of summary-response writing strategies carried out by the researcher, the data provided by pre- and post-study questionnaires and self-assessment checklists administered to the students, and interviews held with the instructor. The results provided by these measures support the hypothesis that genre-based instruction is an effective pedagogical tool to teach summary-response writing to <b>EFL</b> <b>university</b> <b>students</b> at an advanced level of language proficiency...|$|R

The results show the presence of some small gender differences related to the higher frequency of use of emotion lemmas and, additionally, a more psychological orientation in the display of emotion lemmas by females. Moreover, a comparative analysis of emotion vocabulary use was performed between a group of native speakers of English and the <b>EFL</b> <b>students.</b> The results indicate that the <b>EFL</b> <b>students</b> produced comparatively less emotion lemmas than the native English sample; however, no gender differences between the participants were observed in this comparison. The findings suggest that individual psychological features and vocabulary size are more relevant factors in emotion vocabulary use than gender...|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{investigates the}} {{validity}} of the motivational L 2 self system tripartite model as to explaining the L 2 motivational behaviours of a sample of Arab <b>university</b> level <b>EFL</b> <b>students</b> in southern Saudi Arabia. Dörnyei’s L 2 Motivational Self System (2009) is used as the theoretical framework. A survey was designed and administered to about 400 Saudi male undergraduate students majoring in English. The obtained data were coded and analysed. The results upheld {{the validity of}} the of the L 2 Self System model’s core components of Ideal L 2, Ought-to L 2 and learning experiences of English, as well as their relevance in the Saudi context. The findings indicated high significance levels and strong contributions from the Ideal L 2 and Language Learning Experiences to the learners’ reported efforts in learning English as the criterion measure. Both components make stronger contributions to explaining the variance than Ought-to L 2 component...|$|R
40|$|Autonomy in {{language}} learning has gained prominence {{due to the}} preference for learner-centred styles. An implementation of autonomy in learning should be preceded by an investigation of learners’ readiness for autonomous learning, {{taking into account the}} cultural differences of different communities. This article reports findings about the perceived learning autonomy among <b>EFL</b> <b>university</b> <b>students</b> in Yarmouk University in Jordan. 154 students taking English proficiency based courses and five lecturers teaching these courses took part in the research. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to conduct the research. A 43 -item questionnaire adapted from Chan, Spratt & Humphreys (2002) was used to collect the quantitative data while semi-structured interviews were conducted with the students and their lecturers. The findings revealed that teaching of English is still highly teacher-centred in Jordanian university classrooms. In relation to the autonomy construct, the results show that although Jordanian <b>EFL</b> <b>university</b> <b>students</b> feel that they are, somehow responsible for autonomous learning, they do not possess the ability to act autonomously nor do they embark on engaging in any autonomous activities. The implications {{of this study suggest that}} policy makers in Jordan need to pay more attention to the process of teaching English in Jordanian universities...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learner listening strategies. The study was conducted in two phases. Phase I was a survey of the difficulties encountered and the strategies used by Thai <b>university</b> <b>EFL</b> learners in listening to the main points of three types of TV texts (news, lifestyle programs, and commercials). This was conducted with two groups of the students in class, using assessment–practice–assessment procedures. Open-ended questions were used to gain the data, and quantitative data analysis was employed for the findings. Speed and vocabulary were the key difficulties, and inferencing was the main strategy category reported in the two assessment sessions. After the practice sessions, the final assessment indicated that students improved their listening performance with TV lifestyle programs and commercials. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the first and the final assessments of the main points listening performance for TV news. In Phase II, a listening program for developing more effective strategies with TV news was presented and evaluated. The Structured Listening Program (SLP) was undertaken with a group of six upper-intermediate/advanced Thai <b>university</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>students.</b> The main purpose of using the SLP was to retain the characteristics of authentic English texts and assist the learners to make the input comprehensible. The focus was on the explicit teaching of listening strategies targeted at English language TV news. The learners were trained to use listening strategies, moving from directed listening, to facilitated listening and eventually to independent listening. The findings from Phase II demonstrated that the learners became more aware of listening strategies. The SLP encouraged the students to seek more opportunities to listen to a variety of 'real' English outside the classroom Use, Reflection, and Control were three levels of strategy awareness applied in listening to TV news. Students' motivation and confidence in listening to authentic English in natural contexts increased. Students' confidence—not only in listening but also in speaking—was gradually built up during the SLP. The findings are discussed, and the implications and limitations of the study are documented in the dissertation...|$|R
