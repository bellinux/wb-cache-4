This version is reproduced {{with the permission of}} publisher. High rate electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve using stimulus intensities well above the clinical limits can induce a significant reduction in the excitability of the auditory nerve as measured by a decrement in the amplitude of the electrically evoked auditory brainstem response (EABR). Two potential mechanisms may be associated with this stimulus induced reduction in activity: 1) stimulus induced prolonged neuronal hyperactivity; and 2) the generation of adverse electrochemical productions from the electrode surface. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess the extent to which adverse electrochemical damage contributes to the stimulus induced reduction in auditory nerve excitability. Twenty-six adult guinea pigs anaesthetized with ketamine (40 mg/kg i. p.) and xylazine (4 mglkg i. p.), were bilaterally implanted and unilaterally stimulated for two hours using a stimulus intensity of two or four times EABR threshold.

40|$|Objective: To assess intracochlear trauma {{using two}} {{different}} round window-related cochleostomy tech-niques in human temporal bones. Methods: Twenty-eight human temporal bones {{were included in}} this study. In 21 specimens, co-chleostomies were initiated inferior to the round win-dow (RW) annulus. In seven bones, cochleostomies were drilled anterior-inferior to the RW annulus. Limited cochlear implant electrode insertions were performed in 19 bones. In each specimen, promontory anatomy and cochleostomy drilling were photograph-ically documented. Basal cochlear damage was as-sessed histologically and electrode insertion proper-ties were documented in implanted bones. Results: All implanted specimens showed clear <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>electrode</b> placements regardless of co-chleostomy technique. All 21 inferior cochleostomies were atraumatic. Anterior-inferior cochleostomies resulted in various degrees of intracochlear trauma in all seven bones. Conclusion: For atraumatic opening of the scala tympani using a cochleostomy approach, initia-tion of drilling should proceed from inferior to the round window annulus, with gradual progression to-ward the undersurface of the lumen. While cochleos-tomies initiated anterior-inferior to the round win-dow annulus resulted in scala tympani opening, many of these bones displayed varying degrees of intracochlear trauma that may result in hearing loss.

These sounds are attributed to the motile responses of outer hair cells (OHCs). The EEOAE has characteristic amplitude, phase, and fine structure. Multicomponent analysis of the EEOAE shows short (SDC) and long delay components (LDC) that are thought to originate from OHCs near the AC stimulating site and from OHCs at more remote locations, respectively. We measured the effects of various loud noise exposures on the EEOAE and the cochlear whole-nerve action potential (CAP) in animals chronically implanted with a <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>electrode.</b> Noise exposures that produced permanent (PTS) or temporary threshold shifts (TTS) were associated with frequency-specific changes in CAP thresholds, EEOAE fine structure, and reductions in the amplitude of the LDC.

The simulation results support the view that the two waveform components originate from dendritic or axonal processes and implies that the shape of the response waveform may provide information about the degree of neural survival in the stimulated cochlea.

This {{study was}} designed to evaluate the pathophysiological response of the cochlea following long-term intracochlear electrical stimulation using a poorly charge-balanced stimulus regime, leading to direct current (DC) levels > 0. 1 µA. Four normal-hearing adult cats were bilaterally implanted with <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>electrode</b> arrays and unilaterally stimulated for periods up to 2200 h. Stimuli consisted of 50 µs monophasic current pulses presented at 2000 pulses per second (pps) per channel, and resulted in DC levels of 0. 4 - 2. 8 µA. Both acoustic and electrical (EABR) evoked potentials were periodically recorded during the stimulation program. Frequency-specific stimuli indicated that an extensive and widespread hearing loss occurred over the 4 - 24 KHz region in all stimulated cochleae, although the 2 KHz region exhibited thresholds close to normal in some animals, despite long-term implantation and chronic stimulation. Longitudinal EABRs showed a statistically significant increase in threshold for three of the four animals. Histopathological evaluation of the cochleae revealed a highly significant reduction in ganglion cell density in stimulated cochleae compared with their controls. Spiral ganglion cell loss was significantly correlated with the degree of inflammation, duration of electrical stimulation, and the level of DC.

Indeed, there was no statistically significant difference in the ganglion cell density adjacent to the stimulating electrodes when compared with a similar population in implanted control cochleas. In addition, hair cell loss, which was restricted to regions adjacent to the electrode array, was not influenced by the degree of electrical stimulation. These histopathological findings were consistent with the evoked potential recordings.

This version is reproduced {{with the permission of}} publisher. The Melbourne/Cochlear auditory prosthesis uses an intracochlear electrode array containing 22 circumferential full-band electrodes mounted on a Silastic carrier. It could be hypothesized that half-band electrodes, oriented towards the modiolus, would produce lower stimulus thresholds than conventional full-band electrodes. This hypothesis {{is based on the assumption}} that, compared with full-band electrodes, half-band electrodes would produce an electrical field in which a greater proportion of the current would excite a defined group of neurons. In order to verify this hypothesis we recorded electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABRs) for both full- and half-band electrodes inserted in the scala tympani of deafened cats. EABR thresholds for half-band electrodes oriented towards the modiolus were not significantly different from thresholds evoked using full-band electrodes (p> 0. 05, paired t-test), whereas thresholds evoked using half-band electrodes oriented towards the outer scala wall were significantly higher (p< 0. 01) than either the modiolar half-band or the full-band electrodes. These physiological results suggest that the electrical field generated within the auditory nerve by modiolar oriented half-band electrodes does not differ significantly from that produced by full-band electrodes. On the basis of these results, together with the fact that half-band electrodes would have higher current densities and electrode impedances, and would require careful orientation during implantation, we consider that there is no benefit in incorporating half-band electrodes in the design of <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>electrode</b> arrays.

Each animal was injected with 2 -DG, and electrically stimulated using bipolar electrodes located either distal or proximal to the round window. The contralateral- ear was stimulated with acoustic tone pips at frequencies that matched the electrode place. Stimulation of both distal and proximal bipolar electrodes at 3 X EABR threshold, evoked localized 2 -DG labelling in both ipsilateral cochlear nucleus (CN) and the contralateral inferior colliculus (IC), which was very similar in orientation and breadth to labelling evoked by the contralateral tone pips. The cochleotopic position of labelling to proximal stimulation was located in the 24 - 26 kHz region of each structure, whereas the distal labelling was located around 12 kHz. Distal stimulation at 10 X EABR threshold produced very broad 2 -DG labelling in IC centered around the 12 kHz place. The present 2 -DG results clearly illustrate cochleotopic selectivity using multichannel bipolar scala tympani electrodes. The extent of this selectivity is dependent on electrical stimulus levels.

Study Design: In vitro laboratory and in vivo animal studies Methods: The antibacterial activity of three concentrations of ciprofloxacin/Healon (7. 5, 75, and 750 µg/mL) was examined over 5 weeks at both ambient temperature (23 °C) and body temperature (37 °C). Thirty-six rats (18 implanted with ciprofloxacin [750 mg/mL]/Healon-coated electrode array and 18 without the coating) were infected with S. pneumoniae 4 weeks after implantation by way of three different routes of infection (hematogenous, middle ear, and inner ear) and observed for the development of meningitis. Results: The antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin/Healon was maintained over 5 weeks at both 23 °C and 37 °C. The implanted rats with the ciprofloxacin/Healon-coated electrode array were protected from meningitis when the bacteria were given by way of the hematogenous route (Fisher’s exact test, P =. 008) but not when the bacteria were inoculated directly into the middle or inner ear. However, the time to develop meningitis was significantly longer in rats implanted with a coated array, irrespective of the route of inoculation (P <. 05, log rank test).

Following completion of the stimulation program cochleae were prepared for histological examination. EABRs exhibited relatively stable thresholds for both stimulated and implanted, unstimulated control cochleae for the stimulus duration. While the growth in response amplitude as a function of stimulus current remained stable for the bipolar control and monopolar stimulated cochleae, the five cochleae chronically stimulated using bipolar electrodes exhibited a moderate to large increase in response amplitude. These increases were associated with a more widespread fibrous tissue response which may have altered the current distribution within these cochleae.

Auditory brainstem responses to both acoustic (ABR) and electrical (EABR) stimuli were periodically recorded throughout the chronic stimulation program. At completion of the program the cochleas were prepared for histological examination. While all animals exhibited an increase in acoustic thresholds following surgery, click evoked ABR's returned to near normal levels in half the animals.

Under general anaesthesia (ketamine (20 mg/kg. i. m.) and xylazine (3. 8 mg/kg. i. m)), eight normal hearing cats were bilaterally implanted with two channel platinum <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Each animal was stimulated unilaterally for 500 to 2200 h using 50 μs monophasic current pulses. The stimuli were delivered at rates of 500 or 2000 pulses per channel continuously at mid-dynamic range intensities. Electrically-evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABR) were periodically recorded to monitor the status of the auditory nerve and to ensure stimulus intensity remained above threshold. At a stimulus rate of 500 pulses/s, electrode shorting effectively reduced DC levels to ≤ 0. 3 µA. Longitudinal EABR's recorded from these animals, remained relatively stable over the stimulus duration. These cochleae showed minimal tissue response and there was no statistically significant difference in spiral ganglion cell density when compared with controls (p= 0. 21, Mann-Whitney U-test). Chronic stimulation at 2000 pulses/s resulted in increased DC levels (0. 6 - 2. 8 µA). These cochleae exhibited a highly significant reduction in spiral ganglion cell density when compared with controls (p< 0. 0001), and their EABR's typically displayed an elevation in threshold as a function of stimulus duration. The present findings indicate that continuous non-charge balanced stimuli at rates of 2000 pulses/s can result in significant loss of spiral ganglion cells, presumably as a result of increased DC levels. 27 - 30 JanuaryOpen Acces...|$|R

This version is reproduced {{with the permission}} of the publisher. Speech processing strategies based on high rate electrical stimulation have been associated with recent improvements of speech perception among cochlear implant users. In the present study we investigated the effects of chronic monopolar stimulation using very high rates (14493 pulses). Under general anaesthesia (ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (3. 8 mg/kg) i. p.) six normal hearing cats were implanted bilaterally with a three channel platinum (Pt) <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>electrode</b> array, while a return Pt-electrode was placed outside the bulla. Chronic electrical stimulation using charge-balanced biphasic current pulses was delivered unilaterally via a transcutaneous leadwire connected to a backpack-stimulator for up to 2000 h. The animals hearing status was periodically monitored using acoustically evoked compound action potentials (CAP's) and brainstem responses (ABR's). In addition the electrically evoked ABR (EABR) was also recorded to ensure that the chronic stimulus was above threshold. Stimulus current and electrode voltage waveforms were monitored twice daily and access resistance (Ra) and electrode impedance (Zc) calculated. ABR and CAP thresholds were elevated immediately following implantation, but generally showed evidence of partial recovery (0 - 40 dB). Further deterioration of thresholds on the stimulated side (10 - 30 dB) was subsequently observed, while control-thresholds remained more stable. Ra (1. 3 - 1. 8 kΩ) and Zc (2. 2 - 3. 8 Ω) typically increased in the first few weeks of electrical stimulation up to Ra: 5. 6 kΩ and Zc: 8. 1 kΩ, before decreasing slightly to a constant plateau. These initial results indicate changes in the electrode-tissue interface and tissue growth within the cochlea. They also indicate that chronic stimulation at these high rates may decrease residual hearing. 27 - 30 JanuaryOpen Acces...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{functional}} status of central auditory structures is important when estimating possible benefits of cochlear implantation in the congenitally deaf. Thus far {{the performance of}} prelingually deaf adults following cochlear implantation has been disappointing. We have used congenitally deaf cats {{as a model for}} prelingual deafness. These animals are deaf from an early age as shown by longitudinal recordings of auditory brainstem responses. They were studied as adults (age 2 years). Under general anaesthesia the cochleae were electrically stimulated using the NUCLEUS- 22 banded <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>electrode</b> array. Recordings were made from the contralateral auditory cortex and inferior colliculus. Gross potentials, together with multi� and single-unit activities were recorded. Here we confine ourselves to gross potential recordings from the auditory cortex. The skull was opened over the auditory area and the cortex photographed. A computer-controlled 3 -axes microdrive provided precise and reproducible positioning of the monopolar recording electrode. Gross potentials were evoked by electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve using bipolar electrodes 1 / 2, 7 / 8 or 1 / 8 (electrode 1 being the most apical). These potentials were recorded from both the cortical surface and at depths of up to 4 mm, amplified and band pass filtered (10 Hz to 10 kHz). The stimuli (0. 2 ms biphasic pulses) evoked middle latency responses (10 - 20 ms) over the primary and secondary auditory areas. Thresholds were lowest using electrodes 1 / 8 (- 24 dB re. 1 mApp). Narrower electrode configurations (1 / 2 and 7 / 8) were up to 15 dB less effective. The potentials evoked were mono-, bi- or triphasic in shape, depending on recording site. We observed little evidence of tonotopic cortical mapping of stimulation site (1 / 2 vs. 7 / 8). If present at all, potentials were considerably smaller when the recording electrode was placed outside the auditory areas. Moreover, threshold currents were far higher (40 dB). It is concluded that the auditory cortex of congenitally deaf animals receives specific information via stimulation of the auditory nerve. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|This is an {{abstract}} {{of a paper}} from Proceedings of the Australian Neuroscience Society 1999 published by Australian Neuroscience Society. This version is reproduced {{with the permission of}} publisher. Electrical stimulation using high surface area (HiQ) platinum (Pt) electrodes exhibit a lower electrode impedance, polarisation and direct current (DC) in vitro compared with standard (ST) Pt electrodes of the same geometric size. In the present study we investigated whether HiQ electrodes maintain these advantages in vivo. This could be important for the development of new arrays with an increased number of smaller electrodes. Under general anaesthesia (Ketamine 20 mg/kg and Xylazine 4 mg/kg i. p.) five normal hearing cats were implanted bilaterally with a two-channel Pt <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>electrode</b> array (4 HiQ, I ST array). Chronic electrical stimulation using charge balanced biphasic current pulses was delivered unilaterally via a transcutaneous leadwire connected to a backpack-stimulator for periods of up to 2400 hours. DC, stimulus current and electrode voltage waveforms were monitored twice daily and access resistance (Ra), electrode impedance (Zc) and polarisation (Zc-Ra) calculated (kΩ). Mean HiQ data were compared to ST data using Students t-test (*=p< 0. 05, **=p< 0. 001). Immediately following implantation both HiQ and ST-electrodes exhibited low impedance values (Ra: 1. 06 vs 1. 00, Zc: 1. 24 vs 2. 12 *, and Zc-Ra: 0. 18 vs 1. 08 **). Subsequently impedance increased, largely due to a rise in Ra (5. 35 vs 6. 8 : Zc: 6. 96 vs 9. 80, and Zc-Ra: 1. 61 vs 3. 00 *). At the end of the experiment the array was explanted and tested in saline (Ra: 0. 63 vs 0. 74 *, Zc: 0. 73 vs 1. 90 **, Zc-Ra: 0. 10 vs 1. 16 **). These initial results suggests that intracochlear tissue growth increased the access resistance of both electrode designs. However, HiQ electrodes maintained not only a significantly lower polarisation, they also showed a lower average residual DC (23 vs 130 nA**) throughout the experiment. 31 January - 3 FebruaryOpen Acces...|$|E
40|$|Cochlear {{implantation}} is a maximally invasive {{surgical procedure}} aimed at overcoming human inaudibility and providing {{the sensation of}} sound to thousands of severely deaf recipients worldwide. Specialists require extensive training to perform the surgery, yet traditional approaches such as cadaver dissection and device insertion can prove costly. Alternative training schemes have not been developed, however surgical simulators that offer force feedback during anatomical model manipulation may provide the answer. In the work, a novel approach to medical education is presented. It combines haptic technology and computer visualisation to recreate cochlear implantation in a virtual environment. The surgical simulator provides visual and haptic rendering during cochlear implant insertion into a virtual model of the human <b>Scala</b> <b>Tympani.</b> As the user inserts the sub-sampled array into a three-dimensional, reproducible representation of the <b>Scala</b> <b>Tympani,</b> collisions between the <b>electrode</b> and <b>Scala</b> <b>Tympani</b> walls are detected. In response, real-time forces are delivered back through the haptic device in a closed loop control system. Insertion studies {{are performed to evaluate}} the cochlear implant insertion process. Electrode array trajectories and output forces are monitored during device insertion into a synthetic model of the <b>Scala</b> <b>Tympani.</b> The force, torque and position data produced from the experiments are used in the final stage of work for simulator validation. A three-dimensional, surface description of the human <b>Scala</b> <b>Tympani</b> is derived from measured data and parameterised for future reproduction. It is visualised in a virtual environment, the Reachin Application Programming Interface, where visual and haptic rendering is implemented to make the insertion process interactive. Algorithms are produced and program optimisations performed to enable real-time, dynamic manipulation of the environment. Real world physical attributes are added to the <b>Scala</b> <b>Tympani</b> surfaces and <b>electrode</b> carrier to make the scene more realistic. System validation is performed by statistical and qualitative comparisons between the force profiles produced from the simulation and experimentation. The results are presented and evaluated in terms of overall system performance. The thesis offers unique approaches for simulator design, development and validation. The significant contributions of the work are reported, as are the benefits, with recommendations for future system enhancements...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{temporal}} {{patterns of}} electrical stimulation {{may provide a}} better simulation of the acoustic input. Currently {{little is known about}} the physiological or psychophysical responses to variations of the time intervals between pulses and their relative amplitudes. This knowledge could lead to a new generation of speech processing strategies. In this investigation we are examining physiological responses of neurons in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus to electrical stimulation using the Melbourne/Cochlear <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> banded <b>electrode</b> array. Two stimulus paradigms are being investigated: (I) a 50 ms burst of charged balanced biphasic electrical pulses delivered at constant rates with varying amplitudes; and (2) pulse pairs with varying interpulse intervals. The synchrony and the effectiveness in eliciting neural responses under both stimulus conditions is determined with extracellular and intracellular recordings. The amplitude of depolarising potentials recorded intracellularly is being plotted as a function of electrical stimulus pulse rate. In neurons where depolarising potentials are shown to be excitatory postsynaptic potentials, the latency of the evoked response is examined in order to determine whether they are of mono or polysynaptic origin. Neurons in this nucleus are also morphologically characterised and correlated with their physiological response properties. Discharge synchrony and entrainment are shown to be inversely proportional to stimulus pulse rate. Discharge synchrony is dependent on interpulse interval between the pulse pair. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} whether the electrical field created by a cochlear implant electrode is more focussed in a perimodiolar than in a medial position, voltages at non-stimulated electrodes were collected from the Clarion 1. 2 implant before and after insertion of the Clarion Electrode Positioning System. The positioner is inserted lateral to the electrode array and is intended to bring the array close to the medial wall of the <b>scala</b> <b>tympani.</b> These intracochlear <b>electrode</b> voltages (IEVs) were collected in 9 surgeries with the HiFocus I electrode array with positioner. Stapedius reflex thresholds were decreased after insertion of the positioner on 20 out of 22 electrodes. Electrode impedances did not increase significantly. IEVs increased slightly for all stimulated electrodes. However, the positioner did not significantly affect {{the slope of the}} IEVs for any of the stimulated electrodes. Individual differences between patients in the mean IEV amplitude were considerable; 2 patients deafened by otosclerosis showed particularly low amplitudes. Thus, IEVs provided no evidence of a focussing of the electrical field by introducing the positioner. Possible benefits of a perimodiolar position regarding efficiency and channel separation are discussed in terms of a reduced distance between electrodes and neural elements...|$|R
