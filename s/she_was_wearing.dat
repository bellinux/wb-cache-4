5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1851, women in several states were wearing the dress in public. In March, Amelia Bloomer, editor of the temperance {{newspaper}} The Lily, announced that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> it and printed a description of her dress along with {{instructions on how to}} make it. Soon, newspapers had dubbed it the “Bloomer dress”, and the name stuck.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Mickie James and Trish Stratus for the WWE Women's Championship. The match had {{escalated}} outside the ring. When Stratus delivered punches to Mickie, {{who was on}} the second turnbuckle, Mickie threw her over the top rope, causing Stratus to land on her right arm. Afterwards, Mickie choked Stratus with a wristband <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> that fell off during the match, therefore giving the win to Stratus by disqualification, but per WWE regulations, a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission therefore Mickie retained the Championship.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E

5|$|When Saldívar {{became a}} {{business}} associate, their relationship began to deteriorate. In September 1994, Selena met Ricardo Martinez, {{a doctor who}} lived in Monterrey, Mexico. Selena wanted to expand the number of boutiques by opening a Selena Etc. store in Monterrey. Martinez said he had contacts in Mexico who could help her grow her business. Martinez became a business adviser to Selena, though her family said he was simply a fan who posed in several pictures with her. Saldívar became envious of Selena's dependency on Martinez. He began sending flowers to Selena's hotel room. Saldívar warned the singer that Martinez might have unprofessional intentions. Selena began visiting Monterrey more frequently, often in disguise. Sebastian D'Silva, Martinez's assistant, would pick up Selena at the airport; he said he noticed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> wigs and using her husband Chris Pérez's surname so others would not identify her. According to Martinez, he had lent several thousand dollars to Selena because she was short on cash.|$|E
5|$|During her pre-war New York – Antwerp sailings, Kroonland carried {{some notable}} and {{interesting}} passengers. On 1 August 1904, {{one of the}} ship's passengers arrived in New York as somewhat of a mystery woman. She recounted that she had gone out for dinner in Antwerp and awakened to find herself at sea with only the white silk evening gown <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing.</b> Having no money or luggage, she was barred from entering the United States and was compelled to remain on board the ship. After her predicament was reported in The New York Times, she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story and a letter of credit eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane. Later the same month The New York Times reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for their dogs and the conditions in the kennel aboard the liner. One passenger was determined to have her dog in her state room, and after others joined her in removing canine companions from the kennel, Kroonlands crew took all the dogs back to the kennel. Many of the dog owners refused {{to speak to the}} others involved {{for the duration of the}} voyage.|$|E

25|$|On 18 April 2010, Lisa Hose was {{crowned with}} The Biggest Loser 2010. Earning {{the grand prize}} of $185,000, but due to the double {{bracelet}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing,</b> this prize money increased to $370,000. She is also the first female winner of The Biggest Loser.|$|E
25|$|She {{took with}} her the dress <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing,</b> a sturdy overcoat, several changes of underwear, {{and a small}} travel bag {{carrying}} her toiletry essentials.

25|$|The hero plundered Oechalia and overthrew {{its walls}} while Iole threw herself {{down from the}} high city wall to escape. It {{turned out that the}} garment <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing,</b> opened up and acted like a {{parachute}} which ensured her soft and safe descent. Heracles captured and took Iole unwillingly as captive. His wife, Deianira did not like Iole to become Heracles' concubine but she forebore to object and tolerated it temporarily.|$|E
25|$|Having {{made his}} way into Freyja's chambers, Loki looked around {{to be sure that}} no one was awake, and found that Freyja was asleep. He landed on her bed and noticed that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> the necklace, the clasp turned downward. Loki turned into a flea and jumped onto Freyja's cheek and there bit her. Freyja stirred, turning about, and then fell asleep again. Loki removed his flea's shape and undid her collar, opened the bower, and {{returned}} to Odin.|$|E

25|$|No {{physical}} remains {{have been}} found for over a thousand victims of the attacks at the Trade Center, but the family still hopes that they might find yet some remnant of Philip. Her minnu, which they believe <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> {{at the time of}} the attacks, could have survived in the freshly collapsed buildings. They have sent pictures of it to the city property clerk's office in the event it can be matched to several hundred other unmatched personal items recovered from the ruins.|$|E
25|$|Anthony {{embarked}} on her career of social reform with energy and determination. Schooling herself in reform issues, {{she found herself}} drawn to the more radical ideas of people like William Lloyd Garrison, George Thompson and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Soon <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> the controversial Bloomer dress, consisting of pantaloons worn under a knee-length dress. Although it was more sensible than the traditional heavy dresses that dragged the ground, she reluctantly quit wearing it after a year because it gave her opponents the opportunity to focus on her apparel rather than her ideas.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, President Chen was re-elected to {{a second}} {{four-year}} term after an assassination attempt which occurred {{the day before the}} election. Two shots were fired, one bullet grazing the President's belly after penetrating the windshield of a jeep and several layers of clothing, the other bullet penetrated the windshield and hitting the vice president's knee cast (<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> a knee cast due to an earlier injury). Police investigators have said that the most likely suspect {{is believed to have been}} Chen Yi-hsiung, who was later found dead. Their injuries were not life-threatening, but the incident is believed by Pan-Blue to have gained them enough sympathy to influence the result.|$|E

25|$|Twelve {{people were}} killed outright, and another two died over the {{following}} days and weeks. Thirteen of the fourteen victims were women, including one who was nine months pregnant. One young {{woman who had been}} beside the bomb car was decapitated; the only clue to her sex was the pair of brown platform boots <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing.</b> Several others lost limbs and a man was impaled through the abdomen by an iron bar. Several bodies lay in the street for half an hour as ambulances struggled to get through traffic jams. At least four bodies were found on the pavement outside Guineys. The bodies of the victims were covered by newspapers until they were removed from the scene.|$|E
25|$|Sobhraj and Chowdhury {{committed}} {{their first}} (known) murders in 1975. Most {{of the victims}} had {{spent some time with}} the duo before their deaths and were, according to investigators, recruited by Sobhraj and Chowdhury to join the pair in their crimes. Investigators state that the victims had threatened to expose Sobhraj, which was his motive for murder. The first victim was a young woman from Seattle. Teresa Knowlton (named Jennie Bollivar in the book Serpentine) was found drowned in a tidal pool in the Gulf of Thailand. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> a flowered bikini. It was only months later that Knowlton's autopsy, as well as forensic evidence, proved that her drowning, originally believed to be a swimming accident, was murder.|$|E
25|$|The {{album cover}} {{contributed to the}} image of Jones as a stylish beret-wearing beatnik. Jones had said the {{inspiration}} of it was from a photo of her father (an aspiring musician and waiter) in a similar pose, lighting a cigarette while sitting on a beach towel at a Chicago beach along Lake Michigan, near where the family lived. Although Donna Summer had already been wearing berets and singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell wore one for the album cover of her 1976 album Hejira, it was Jones Parisian-boho jazz sensibility that finally popularized it, propelling as a mainstay of hipster chic and (perhaps unintentionally) branding her image in the process. Despite Jones' beautiful looks and street gamine wildness, she would recall that people seemed to only recognize her in public when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> the beret. The album cover photography and design was by Norman Seeff.|$|E
