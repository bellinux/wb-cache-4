40|$|AbstractThe submicrosecond bending {{dynamics}} of duplex DNA were measured {{at a single}} site, using a site-specific electron paramagnetic resonance active spin probe. The observed dynamics are interpreted {{in terms of the}} mean <b>squared</b> amplitude of <b>bending</b> relative to the end-to-end vector defined by the weakly bending rod model. The bending dynamics monitored at the single site varied when the length and position of a repeated AT sequence, distant from the spin probe, were changed. As the distance between the probe and the AT sequence was increased, the mean <b>squared</b> amplitude of <b>bending</b> seen by the probe due to that sequence decreased. A model for the sequence-dependent internal flexural motion of duplex DNA, which casts the mean <b>squared</b> <b>bending</b> amplitudes in terms of sequence-dependent bending parameters, has been developed. The best fit of the data to the model occurs when the (AT) n basepairs are assumed to be 20 % more flexible than the average of the basepairs within the control sequence. These findings provide a quantitative basis for interpreting the kinetics of biological processes that depend on duplex DNA flexibility, such as protein recognition and chromatin packaging...|$|R

In particular a two-degree-of-freedom system is considered which is excited by a non-stationary input and which possesses a general type of viscous damping. Several typical engineering problems involving stochastic processes are considered. In {{the case of}} fatigue it is shown that a criterion for fatugue failure in multi-degree-of-freedom systems may be established using Miner's cumulative damage hypothesis {{and the number of}} zero crossings per second.

The isolation problem is considered and the concept of the "white spectrum fragility curve" is established as a criterion for adequate isolation.

The development of the pressure driven secondary motion is more rapid for laminar flow: the maximum cross stream component measured was 60 percent of the bulk velocity in contrast to 40 percent for turbulent flow. The streamwise isotachs show that, for laminar flow, large velocities are found progressively nearer to the outer radius of the bend and along the sidewalls. For turbulent flow, the isotachs move towards the inner radius until about 60 deg around the bend where strong secondary motion results in a similar redistribution.

For the modelling of turbulence, the Launder and Sharma low-Re k – model and a recently produced variant of the cubic non-linear low-Re k – model have been employed. In this paper, developing turbulent ow through two di erent 90 ◦ bends is examined: a <b>square</b> <b>bend,</b> and a rectangular bend with an aspect ratio of 6. The numerical results indicate that for the <b>bend</b> of <b>square</b> cross-section the curvature induces a strong secondary ow, while for the rectangular cross-section the secondary motion is con ned to the corner regions. For both curved ducts, the secondary motion persists downstream of the bend and eventually slowly disappears.

40|$|Due {{to their}} limited speed and high power {{dissipation}} copper wires {{can no longer}} {{meet the demands of}} future high speed computing devices. While many different approaches are being tried to overcome the challenge, the one based on a high-speed optical link looks promising. By using photons to transfer information one is able to eliminate the bottlenecks associated with electronic based interconnects. Where optical alternatives usually suffer from high costs and a cost effective approach that is also capable of high volume production is required. In this regard, silicon photonics offers a solution due to its CMOS compatibility. Over the last decade remarkable {{progress has been made in}} the field of silicon photonics where photodetectors, optical sources (lasers) and modulators have been the focus of the study. The electro-optic modulator, which converts electrical signal into optical signal, is a fundamental building block of silicon photonics. Designers have previously concentrated more on optimizing the optical design of the modulator but the modulator’s bandwidth can significantly improve if its electrode design is optimized. The aim of the project was to optimize the modulator electrode to maximize the bandwidth performance of the electrode. Each element of the electrode has been studied separately. These include bends, tapers and two different dimensions of the coplanar line. Simulation results of <b>square</b> <b>bend,</b> mitred bend, round bend, exponential taper, Klopfenstein taper, triangular taper and two different dimensions of the coplanar line losses are presented. The fabrication process, analysis of aluminium surface morphology and etching techniques are discussed. As a result, characterization of different types of bends, tapers and electrodes are shown where discontinuities like bends and tapers reveal insignificant added loss between 0 GHz and 67 GHz. The final characterized electrode for a 0. 5 mm long modulator has a 3 dB point above 67 GHz whereas previous designs were limited to 42. 8 GHz. Since velocity mismatch between optical and electrical signals also limits the modulator’s performance, an effective technique to slow the electrical signal to match its velocity to that of the optical signal for slow wave modulators has successfully been demonstrated with the potential to achieve very high slowing down factors. The slow wave structure for electrode consisted of silicon dioxide and floating metal strips. The characterised slow wave modulator with slow wave electrode confirms a slowing down factor of 2. Not only will the slow wave structure slow down the electrical signal to reduce the mismatch with optical signal velocity, it will also reduce the substrate loss. This shows the potential of slow wave modulator bandwidth to double if optimized further...|$|R

Ak-s model, adopting a modelling of the turbulent transport {{not based on}} the eddy viscosity, has been written in generalised coordinates and solved with a finite volume approach, using both a GMRES solver and a direct solver for {{the solution of the}} linear systems of equations. The results presented show that the modification adopted for the modelling of'the turbulent transport also provides a more accurate value of the physical diffusion and, as a consequence, improves the increase in accuracy when using higher-order convection schemes. A simple non-linear modelling of the Reynolds stresses has been designed introducing an additional term, quadratic in the main strain rate, to the basic Boussinesq's form; the corresponding constant has been evaluated through comparison with experimental data. The computational procedure is implemented for the flow analysis in a 90 ° <b>square</b> section <b>bend</b> and the obtained results show that with the non- linear modelling a much better agreement with the measured data is obtained, both for the velocity and the pressure. The importance of the convection scheme is also discussed, showing how the effect of the non-linear correction added to the Reynolds stresses is effectively hidden by the additional numerical diffusion introduced by a low- order convection scheme as the first-order Upwind, thus making necessary the use of higher-order schemes. Some results for centrifugal turbo machinery are also presented, giving some initial indications on the effects of the proposed modification in the modelling of the turbulent diffusion on the prediction of the flow in rotating passages...|$|R

Short crack specimens are shown to exhibit increased toughness at the initiation of ductile tear-ing and decreased brittle-to-ductile transition temperatures. Numerical analyses for the two a/W ratios reveal large differences in stress fields ahead of the crack tip at identical CTOD levels which verify the experimentally observed differences in critical CTOD val-ues.

30|$|Based on the {{previous}} research of Bliss [1], the best constant and a family of the best functions of the Sobolev inequality are first obtained independently by Aubin [2] and Talenti [3]. They mainly used the functional analysis technique to compute the best constant of the Sobolev inequality. On the other hand, we have computed the best constant of the Sobolev inequality by using the Green function corresponding to a boundary value problem. This is a new method quite {{different from that of}} the functional analysis. The Green function is the reproducing kernel for suitable set of Hilbert space and inner product. As an application, the best constant of the corresponding Sobolev inequality is expressed as the maximum value of the diagonal of the Green function. References [4 – 6] are related to the early studies based on these facts. The engineering meaning of the Sobolev inequality becomes that the <b>square</b> of maximum <b>bending</b> of a string (M= 1) or a beam (M= 2) is estimated from above by the constant multiple of the potential energy [7, 8]. We have already obtained the best constant of each Sobolev inequality which corresponds to clamped-free, Dirichlet and periodic boundary value problems for (- 1)^M(d/dx)^ 2 M [9 – 11]. Further, in [12], we consider a time-periodic boundary value problem of nth order ordinary differential operator which appears typically in Heaviside cable and Thomson cable theory. In this problem, the physical meaning of a Sobolev type inequality becomes that the square of maximum of the absolute value of AC output voltage is estimated above by the constant multiple of the power of input voltage. The purpose of the present paper is to derive a Sobolev inequality which corresponds to free boundary value problem for (- 1)^M(d/dx)^ 2 M and obtain the best constant by using some properties as the reproducing kernel of the Green function.|$|R
