40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} porous media deformation on water-table wave dispersion in an unconfined aquifer using a numerical model which couples Richards’ equation to the poro-elastic model. The study was motivated by the findings of Shoushtari et al. (J Hydrol 533 : 412 – 440, 2016) who were unable to reproduce the observed wave dispersion in their sand flume data with either numerical Richards’ equation models (assuming rigid porous media) or existing analytic solutions. The water-table wave dispersion is quantified via the complex wave number extracted from the predicted amplitude and phase profiles. A sensitivity analysis was performed to establish {{the influence of the}} main parameters in the poro-elastic model, namely Young’s modulus (E) and Poisson’s ratio (ν). For a <b>short</b> <b>oscillation</b> period (T[*]=[*] 16. 4 s), the phase lag increase rate (ki) is sensitive to the chosen values of E and ν, demonstrating an inverse relationship with both parameters. Changes in the amplitude decay rate (kr), however, were negligible. For a longer oscillation period (T[*]=[*] 908. 6 s), variations in the values of E and ν resulted in only small changes in both kr and ki. In both the short and long period cases, the poro-elastic model is unable to reproduce the observed wave dispersion in the existing laboratory data. Hence porous media deformation cannot explain the additional energy dissipation in the laboratory data.

40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} of hysteresis on water table dynamics in an unconfined aquifer was examined using a numerical model to solve Richards’ unsaturated flow equation. The model was subject to simple harmonic forcing across a sloping boundary with a seepage face boundary condition. Time series from both hysteretic and non-hysteretic models were subject to harmonic analysis to extract the amplitude and phase profiles for comparison with existing sand flume data (Cartwright et al., 2004). The results from both model types show good agreement with the data indicating no influence of hysteresis at the oscillation period examined (T = 348 s). The models were then used to perform a parametric study {{to examine the relationship}} between oscillation period and hysteresis effects with periods ranging from 3 min to 180 min. At <b>short</b> <b>oscillation</b> periods, (T ≈ 180 s) the effects of hysteresis were negligible with both models providing similar results. As the oscillation period increased, the hysteretic model showed less amplitude damping than the non-hysteretic model. For periods greater than T = 60 min, the phase lag in the non-hysteretic model is greater than for the hysteretic one. For periods less than T = 60 min this trend is reversed and the hysteretic model produced a greater phase lag than the non-hysteretic model. These findings suggest that consideration of hysteresis dynamics in Richards’ equation models has no influence on water table wave dispersion for short period forcing such as waves (T ≈ 10 s) whereas for long period forcing such as tides (T ≈ 12. 25 h) or storm surges (T ≈ days) hysteresis dynamics should be taken into account.

40|$|Abstract. Series of <b>short</b> {{baseline}} neutrino <b>oscillation</b> experiments provided unexpected results, and {{now they}} are called short baseline anomalies, and all indicates an existence of sterile neutrinos with a mass scale around 1 eV. The signals of short baseline anomalies are reported from 4 different classes of experiments. However, at this moment, there is no convincing theoretical model to explain such sterile neutrinos, and a single experiment to confirm 1 eV sterile neutrinos may be challenging. In this short note, we describe classes of <b>short</b> baseline neutrino <b>oscillation</b> experiments and their goals. Classification of <b>short</b> baseline neutrino <b>oscillation</b> experiments The <b>short</b> baseline anomalies come from 4 different classes of experiments [1]. Based on this, we can classify <b>short</b> baseline neutirno <b>oscillation</b> experiments into following 5 groups; (i) test of LSND signal, (ii) test of MiniBooNE signal, (iii) test of reactor antineutrino anomaly, (iv) test of Gallium anomaly, and (v) others. We discuss each of the above group in following sections. The last group is all other experiments, they are mainly experiments motivated by 1 eV sterile neutrinos and not short baseline anomalies themselves. Therefore many experiments in (v) are not <b>short</b> baseline <b>oscillation</b> experiments. The <b>short</b> baseline anomalies are unsolved mysteries in this community, and they attract many theorists and experimentalists. The search of 1 eV sterile neutrino is one of the big branches of the neutrino experiment community [2]. Therefore, it is rather impossible to cover all experiments in this note, however, we try to cover most of experiments planned in the near future. a...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a model study of the interannual variability of high salinity shelf water (HSSW) properties in the Ross Sea.

At least part of the strong decrease of HSSW salinities deduced from observations for the period 1963 – 2000 is shown to be an aliasing artefact due to an undersampling of the periodic signal. While sea ice formation is responsible for the yearly salinity increase that triggers the formation of HSSW, interannual variability of net freezing rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of large-amplitude internal {{waves in the}} Strait of Gibraltar is a widely known phenomenon. Those waves are produced by the interaction of barotropic tidal flow with the main sill (Camarinal Sill) topography and the stratified water column. That interaction primarily causes internal tides that evolve, by non-linear processes, into large-amplitude (more than 100 m) internal waves exhibiting much <b>shorter</b> <b>oscillation</b> periods than those related to the basic tidal variability. Recent observations have shown that on many occasions large-amplitude internal wave generation {{is dependent on the}} state of the subinertial flows, which are basically driven by the atmospheric pressure fluctuations over the Mediterranean. Therefore, depending on the meteorological situation over the Mediterranean, internal wave events may be inhibited or activated. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We {{employed}} simultaneous {{field potential}} recordings from CA 3, subiculum and entorhinal cortex in an in vitro brain slice preparation {{to understand the}} involvement of these limbic areas in the generation of the field potential oscillations that are induced by bath application of the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol. Regularly spaced oscillations that mainly presented at theta frequency range (5 - 12 Hz) occurred synchronously in all three structures {{in the presence of}} carbachol. These oscillations, which disappeared when slices were perfused with pirenzepine or with glutamatergic receptor antagonists, were categorized as short (4 s) with short events oscillating at higher frequencies than long events. Field oscillations were highly synchronized between regions and latency analysis revealed that they often initiated in the entorhinal cortex later than in the other two structures. Blocking GABAA receptors modified the activity patterns of both <b>short</b> and long <b>oscillations</b> and decreased their coherence in the theta frequency range. Finally, blocking KCC 2 activity disclosed a pattern of recurrent <b>short</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Our results suggest that in the presence of carbachol both subiculum and CA 3 most often drive theta generators in the entorhinal cortex and that these oscillations are influenced but not abolished by altering GABAA receptor signaling...|$|R

We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} radiation and magnetic fields on the formation, structure, and stability of the axisymmetric shock and settling flow produced by accreting gas initially directed towards a non rotating stellar surface from a polar column with free-fall speed. We perform one dimensional reference calculations {{as well as two}} dimensional calculations with zero, weak and strong magnetic fields. In the one dimensional case and weak magnetic field case in two dimensions, we verify the existence of the cooling over-stability for low accretion rates, finding that the flow is stabilized if the accretion rate exceeds 5 × 10 16 gr s − 1 onto a solar mass white dwarf of radius 10 9 cm.

The results strongly support an RKKY-type mechanism as the microscopic origin of this coupling behavior.
