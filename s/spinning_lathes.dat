50|$|Cue lathes {{function}} {{similarly to}} turning and <b>spinning</b> <b>lathes,</b> allowing a perfectly radially-symmetrical cut for billiard cues. They {{can also be}} used to refinish cues that have been worn over the years.|$|E
50|$|Woodturning {{and metal}} <b>spinning</b> <b>lathes</b> {{do not have}} cross-slides, but rather have banjos, which are flat pieces that sit {{crosswise}} on the bed. The position of a banjo can be adjusted by hand; no gearing is involved. Ascending vertically from the banjo is a tool-post, {{at the top of}} which is a horizontal tool-rest. In woodturning, hand tools are braced against the tool rest and levered into the workpiece. In metal spinning, the further pin ascends vertically from the tool rest and serves as a fulcrum against which tools may be levered into the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|Matthew J. Staunton (1888-1966) {{came from}} a long line of silversmiths going back to the Huguenots, who brought their skills to Ireland in the 1600s. Matt, as he was known to his friends, served his time under the renowned Dublin silversmith, Edmond Johnson, who made the Liam MacCarthy Hurling Cup in 1921.The 1928 Sam Maguire Cup is a {{faithful}} copy of the Ardagh Chalice. The bowl was not spun on a <b>spinning</b> <b>lathe</b> but hand-beaten from a single flat piece of silver. Even though it is highly polished, multiple hammer marks are still visible today, indicating the manufacturing process.|$|R
50|$|Michael Hersey {{began an}} {{apprenticeship}} in 1954 aged 15 as a silver spinner at William Comyns & Sons Limited, in Soho, London. He later joined C.J. Vander Limited, {{which at the}} time was England's most preeminent Silversmith firm. Buying himself a <b>spinning</b> <b>lathe,</b> he later set up as a Silversmith under his own name, working from his garage at his home in New Malden, Surrey. As the business expanded, he moved the business to new workshop in Clerkenwell Green, London, home to many small silversmiths' workshops. In 1971 he joined with David Mills and opened a workshop in Clerkenwell. They supplied the retail jewellery trade with spun sterling silver items such as candlesticks, napkin rings and wine coasters. Continuing expansion of the business lead to their move in 1974 from Clerkenwell to Church Street, Twickenham, Middlesex and their first combined manufacturing premises and retail shop.|$|R
50|$|It {{was fairly}} plain, {{except for some}} ridges or raised panels on the cheekpieces. It was {{globular}} or hemispherical in shape (some were <b>spun</b> on a <b>lathe</b> rather than hammered to shape) with a turned or cast soldered- or riveted-on crest knob.|$|R
50|$|A {{lathe tool}} is a {{woodworking}} chisel designed to cut wood {{as it is}} <b>spun</b> on a <b>lathe.</b> These tools have longer handles for more leverage, needed to counteract the tendency of the tool {{to react to the}} downward force of the spinning wood being cut or carved. In addition, the angle and method of sharpening is different; a secondary bevel would not be ground on the tool.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Sheet metal {{spinning}} {{is one of}} the metal forming processes, where a flat metal blank is rotated at a high speed and formed into an axisymmetric part by a roller which gradually forces the blank onto a mandrel, bearing the final shape of the spun part. The aim is to design the workpiece parameters, process parameters, tooling parameters to reduce failure of the workpiece, wrinkling failure, material deformation in metal <b>spinning</b> for general <b>lathe.</b> with the help of these three parameter improve the mechanical property and quality of product. Index Terms- Tooling parameters, process parameters, workpiece parameters...|$|R
50|$|Production of {{the several}} {{different}} parts of the chair required a different set of tools than other chairs popular during the 18th century in colonial America like the Windsor chair and formal sidechairs. Creating the cylindrical pieces of a ladder-back chair, such as the legs, occasionally the uprights, or the spindles, were most easily created using a turner's chisels and gouges as the wood <b>spun</b> on a <b>lathe.</b> Meanwhile, the slats along {{the back of the chair}} required several different sizes of saws and a plane. The ladderback chair's seat was formed using a drawknife when the seat was made of wood, otherwise, it was woven using cane or rush.|$|R
5000|$|Edward Lluyd (1660?-1709) {{knew the}} Cornish verb troillia - to twist, twirl, whirl, spin round. Edward Veale of Pentire, Newquay used the noun troil in the 1880s to {{describe}} a Cornish céilidh in Newquay. Robert Morton Nance collected the noun troyl in the 1920s. He classified the word as a 'Cornish dialect survival', and knew the similar Welsh noun which has the same Brittonic root. [...] "Troyll" [...] appeared in Robert Morton Nance's 1938 Cornish English dictionary with the meanings - circuit, spiral, <b>spin,</b> turn and <b>lathe.</b> Since the Cornish Dance Revival of the 1980s the noun Troyl has been consistently used to denote a Cornish céilidh.|$|R
5000|$|The Keshcarrigan bowl is {{considered}} one of the finest classic early medieval cast bronze cups, or drinking vessel. Made of bright-yellow metal, it was discovered [...] during the building of the [...] "Ulster Canal". The bowl is a fine golden bronze only 14 cm wide and 1 mm in thickness, being cast or beaten into shape before being finished and polished by being <b>spun</b> on a <b>lathe.</b> The neck was finished off against an internal mould. The principal decorative feature of the bowl is its cast bronze zoomorphic handle, following the graceful shape of a bird-beast head of a somewhat nondescript appearance influenced by the flamboyant ornamentation of its time, soldered to the body of the vessel at the base and loosely connected to the vessel neck. The ridge at the front of the bird-head, the 'shield' below, and impression of a beak turning-backward, are all characteristic of the male-Shelduck.|$|R
40|$|An {{optical fiber}} is a {{cylindrical}} waveguide of visible (or near visible) light composed of silica doped with germanium oxide (Ge 02). The guiding {{is accomplished by}} varying the level of Ge 02 in the fiber to create an index of refraction in the fiber that varies with the radius of the fiber. The fiber is manufactured by creating a large cane with a radius {{on the order of}} centimeters that goes through a sequence of heatings and extrusions until it reaches the finished size, which has a radius on the order of microns. To assess the quality of optical fibers during their manufacture, it is common to measure the index of refraction of a cane during an intermediate step of the process. The index of refraction varies with the radius of the cane, and is written n(r). The desired profile varies depending on the future use of the optical fiber, but a standard profile is a simple parabola. The actual profile in an optical fiber does not match the desired profile due {{to the way in which}} optical fibers are manufactured. A glass blank is <b>spun</b> on a <b>lathe</b> while a flame that is fed an appropriate level of silica and Ge 02 moves rapidly back and forth along the cane. Soot from the flame is deposited on the spinning blank. Naturally the deposition will create spiral patterns of doping on the cane. This creates oscillations in the level of Ge 02, and therefore in the desired refractive index. Because soot is being deposited at a constant volumetric rate, the wavelength of the oscillation decreases as the radius of the cane increases. The flame travels up and back along the cane in each layer, so the layer structure has two local maxima in each full oscillation. Because the oscillatory behavior of n(r) is unimportant in the final product, Corning asked to determine a way to remove the noise in the measurements of n(r) caused by the oscillations, and determine the background profile...|$|R
