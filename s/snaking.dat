5|$|At {{the eastern}} end, Highway3 turns south onto Centennial Road and then east onto Talbot Line, {{following}} the historic Talbot Trail to east of Aylmer. This mostly straight and rural portion passes through several small villages before the Talbot Trail splits from it to follow Elgin/Norfolk County Road38 through Straffordville. Highway3 meanwhile curves northeast and passes through Tillsonburg, encountering Highway19. It then curves east and travels {{parallel to the}} St. Thomas and Eastern Railway to Courtland, remerging with the Talbot Trail and <b>snaking</b> towards Delhi, now within Norfolk County.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is divided}} into three {{horizontal}} sections, and architects considered the rivers and other natural characteristics of the St. Louis area when designing the park. The northern limestone wall represents the Mississippi River bluffs, while the southern <b>snaking</b> meander wall stands is inspired by the region's waterways. Between the two zones are the rain gardens, larger trees, and larger sculptures, an area that meant to represent a floodplain. The main paths of the park were plotted to match the locations of alleyways that park designers saw in a 1916 Sanborn map.|$|E
5|$|Altan Khan {{eventually}} {{made peace with}} China when it opened border cities for trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure the frontier, brought a period of relative peace along the border. However, minor raids still happened {{from time to time}} when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the frontier around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall <b>snaking</b> over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E

25|$|It was an {{all-metal}} aircraft with a {{tricycle undercarriage}} and conventional low, straight wings with mid-mounted turbojet engines and a high-mounted tailplane {{clear of the}} jet exhaust. The Meteor F.1 exhibited some problematic flying characteristics typical of early jet aircraft; it suffered from stability problems at high transonic speeds, large trim changes, high stick forces and self-sustained yaw instability (<b>snaking)</b> caused by airflow separation over the thick tail surfaces. The longer fuselage of the Meteor T.7, a two-seater trainer, significantly reduced the aerodynamic instability that the early Meteors were known for.|$|E
25|$|The VC and NVA made {{extensive}} use of such international sanctuaries during their conflict, and the complex of trails, way-stations and bases <b>snaking</b> through Laos and Cambodia, the famous Ho Chi Minh Trail, was the logistical lifeline that sustained their forces in the South. Also, the United States funded a revolution in Colombia {{in order to take}} the territory they needed to build the Panama Canal. Another case in point is the Mukti Bahini guerrilleros who fought alongside the Indian Army in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 against Pakistan that resulted {{in the creation of the}} state of Bangladesh. In the post-Vietnam era, the Al Qaeda organization also made effective use of remote territories, such as Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, to plan and execute its operations.|$|E
25|$|In health, the dorsal {{surface of}} the tongue is covered in tuft like {{projections}} called lingual papillae (some of which are associated with taste buds), which give the tongue an irregular surface texture and a white-pink color. Geographic tongue is characterized by areas of atrophy and depapillation (loss of papillae), leaving an erythematous (darker red) and smoother surface than the unaffected areas. The depapillated areas are usually well demarcated, and bordered by a slightly raised, white, yellow or grey, serpiginous (<b>snaking)</b> peripheral zone. A lesion of geographic tongue may start as a white patch before the depapillation occurs. In certain cases there may be only one lesion, but this is uncommon; the lesions will typically occur in multiple locations on the tongue and coalesce over time to form the typical map-like appearance. The lesions usually change in shape, size and migrate to other areas, sometimes within hours. The condition may affect {{only part of the}} tongue, with a predilection for the tip and the sides of the tongue, or the entire dorsal surface at any one time. The condition goes through periods of remission and relapse. Loss of the white peripheral zone is thought to signify periods of mucosal healing.|$|E
500|$|Each {{racing craft}} {{contains}} air brakes for navigating tight corners {{by using the}} control stick and shoulder buttons. Afterwards, the game's physics modeling give vehicles setup with high acceleration a boost of acceleration. Players can easily exploit this on a wide straight stretch of a circuit to generate serpentinous movements. This technique called [...] "snaking" [...] delivers a massive increase in speed, but it is best used on the easier tracks, when racing alone in Time Trial, and with heavy vehicles with a high grip rating and given high acceleration. According to Nintendo, the <b>snaking</b> technique was an intentional addition to F-Zero GXs gameplay.|$|E

500|$|Flows from Hawaiian eruptions are basaltic, and can {{be divided}} into two types by their {{structural}} characteristics. Pahoehoe lava is a relatively smooth lava flow that can be billowy or ropey. They can move as one sheet, by the advancement of [...] "toes," [...] or as a <b>snaking</b> lava column. A'a lava flows are denser and more viscous than pahoehoe, and tend to move slower. Flows can measure [...] thick. A'a flows are so thick that the outside layers cools into a rubble-like mass, insulating the still-hot interior and preventing it from cooling. A'a lava moves in a peculiar way—the front of the flow steepens due to pressure from behind until it breaks off, after which the general mass behind it moves forward. Pahoehoe lava can sometimes become A'a lava due to increasing viscosity or increasing rate of shear, but A'a lava never turns into pahoehoe flow.|$|E

500|$|The video {{opens with}} Ciara and Timberlake face to face, caressing seductively. The camera cuts to Ciara who appears almost {{impervious}} to gravity. Dressed in lingerie, she maneuvers around a horizontal dance pole; background dancers are veiled in vibrant color schemes and alternating strobe lights. The video then cuts to Ciara in a leotard, posing in abstract and flexible poses. Ciara is then seen {{dressed in a}} tiger-striped catsuit performing solo dance moves on a stage. Timberlake performs his verse seated onstage while Ciara performs intricate tricks, such as <b>snaking</b> under his legs. Then the two begin to lightly move to the track before Ciara forms her body as an armrest as he leans on her. Ciara and the dancers perform choreography and cabaret-style moves on the pole. The bridge of the song puts Timberlake {{on the ground and}} Ciara, standing over him, turns and performs her signature [...] "Matrix" [...] over him as he guides her body toward his with his right hand. The two perform and as Ciara gets up, Timberlake smacks her side as she pops to the beat. The video then cuts to a scene with Ciara in the catsuit portraying a tiger in a cage. In the final scene, Ciara and the dancers perform, dressed in 1970s-inspired tuxedos and colored afros. The video ends with clips of Ciara's multiple performance scenes from throughout the video.|$|E

Initial trials revealed serious handling difficulties on the ground, the aircraft <b>snaking</b> while taxiing, necessitating aft {{movement of the}} mainwheels to correct the bad tracking. In flight tests, the Type 432 was unable to be landed in a standard [...] "three-point" [...] stance resulting in {{the replacement of the}} Irving-type ailerons with new Westland types along with an alteration of tail settings. The estimated maximum speed of 435mph (700km/h) at 28,000ft (8,535m) was never attained as the Merlin 61 engines did not run satisfactorily above 23,000ft (7,010m).|$|E

2500|$|On 6July 1576, a minor Mongol raid {{broke through}} a small gap in the Wall and {{resulted}} {{in the death of}} several high ranking border officials in the vicinity of Simatai, [...] east of Gubeikou. After this incident and starting in 1577, the Ming became committed to closing all gaps along the frontier around Beijing whilst strengthening the walls. As a result, the earthen defences around Beijing were torn down and replaced by ones built with stone bricks and sanhetu (三合土), an early sort of concrete made of lime, clay tiles, and sand. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall <b>snaking</b> over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next-generation}} Meteor F.4 prototype first flew on 17 May 1945, {{and went}} into production in 1946 when 16 RAF squadrons were already operating Meteors.

She was often photographed wearing her collection, those of African inspiration and neckpieces of wooden cubes, which paid homage to the concepts of Cubism. At first considered the bohemian affectation of an eccentric heiress, the fashion world came to legitimize this style as avant-garde, dubbing it the [...] "barbaric look."

2500|$|The hymns of Rigveda declare {{him to be}} the [...] "king {{that moves}} and moves not", the friend of mankind who holds the {{different}} tribes on earth together. In one interpretation by Oldenberg, the hymns are referring to the <b>snaking</b> thunderstorm clouds that gather with bellowing winds (Vritra), Indra is then seen as the storm god who intervenes in these clouds with his thunderbolts, which then release the rains nourishing the parched land, crops and thus humanity. In another interpretation by Hillebrandt, Indra is a symbolic sun god (Surya) and Vritra is a symbolic winter-giant (historic mini cycles of ice age, cold) in the earliest, not the later, hymns of Rigveda. The Vritra is an ice-demon of colder central Asia and northern latitudes, who holds back the water. Indra is the one who releases the water from the winter demon, an idea that later metamorphosed into his role as storm god. According to Griswold, this is not a completely convincing interpretation, because Indra is simultaneously a lightning god, a rain god and a river-helping god in the Vedas. Further, the Vritra demon that Indra slew is best understood as any obstruction, whether it be clouds that refuse to release rain or mountains or snow that hold back the water.|$|E

It presents a very private and industrial front, with stone and glass, and a ramp path to the door, like a conveyor belt in a factory. The back view exemplifies use of the building's twelve exterior doors, many of them stone and glass, and opens up to a wider view of the back, which is more spacious with trees and in harmony with nature because of the local fieldstone that echoes the surrounding rocky landscape. There is little ornamental decoration, it is simply constructed with industrial materials in keeping with Breuer and Gropius's idea of [...] "unit construction" [...] or the bringing together of [...] "standard units to create a technologically simple but functionally complex whole," [...] and the use of new materials to create art design that reflected the age of industry. With Harrison's use of steel and glass, as well as the industrial conveyor-belt like ramp to the house's front door, Harrison used new materials to reflect the age of industry, and its simple forms of stone sections form a composite, complex stone entirety. Gropius and Breuer designed Gropius's own house in ppLincoln, Massachusetts]], which used both fieldstone and wood painted white, re-establishing [...] "New England traditionalism in modern terms." [...] With his use of fieldstone in the Street residence, Harrison was even incorporating some of the same materials as the Modernist architects of his time, Gropius and Breuer.|$|E
