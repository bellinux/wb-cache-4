40|$|Genetic tools have a {{long history}} in fishery management, with the use of genetic “tags ” to {{distinguish}} hatchery and wild trout described more than 20 years ago (Taggart and Ferguson 1984). More recently, the use of genetic stock identification (GSI) techniques have been used to elucidate ocean migration patterns and to estimate <b>stock</b> <b>proportions</b> in a mixed stock fishery context (e. g. Teel et al. 2004). Such GSI for estimation of <b>stock</b> <b>proportions</b> can occur either post-season or in-season. An in-season GSI system requires a facility with dedicated staff and can typically produce <b>stock</b> <b>proportion</b> estimates from fishery or port samples within approximately one day of delivery (Beacham et al. 2004). Such stock composition estimates can then be used to adaptively focus fishery effort to avoid stocks of conservation concern, or to best target abundant stocks. Because of the current and potential future utility of GSI methods to assist in fishery management, the Pacific Salmon Commission has recently funded a collaborative effort to develop a coastwide genetic database for GSI of Chinook salmon. This $ 1. 1 million effort has resulted in an unprecedented database of 13 microsatellite loci, which have been standardized across most major Pacific salmon genetics labs, typed in over 105 Chinook salmon population...|$|R
40|$|Estimating the <b>stock</b> <b>proportions</b> of mixed-stock fishery samples {{by means}} of genetic stock {{identification}} has {{played an important role}} in the management of salmon fisheries. In addition, stock identification of individual fish has applications for population studies, forensic cases, and management issues. We examined 11 microsatellite DNA loci in 84 populations of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch sampled at 78 locations from southern British Columbia to northern California to construct a database of microsatellite allele frequencies. We then evaluated the applicability of the database for estimating <b>stock</b> <b>proportions</b> in a mixed fishery and assigning individuals to their regions of origin. The loci were highly polymorphic: observed heterozygosity ranged from 0. 754 to 0. 943. Using genetic distance calculations, we identified six major geographic regions and 15 smaller subregions into which the populations grouped. Computer simulations and a sample of 143 coho salmon with known origins showed that the database was sufficient to make accurate <b>stock</b> <b>proportion</b> estimates to the 15 subregions. For the sample of fish with known origins, individual assignments to region of origin were 82. 5 % accurate for all samples and 97. 8 % accurate for those where P was greater than 0. 95. We used the database to estimate <b>stock</b> <b>proportions</b> and densities of 2, 344 coho salmon sampled over eight summers in a juvenile marine ecology study conducted off the coasts of Washington and Oregon. Columbia River juveniles were caught at higher densities than coastal fish throughout the summer. Fish from Columbia River and coastal sources were captured both north and south of their points of sea entry in early summer and at higher densities than in late summer. September catch of Columbia River juveniles was correlated with adult abundance in the following year, indicating that year-class strength for this stock is largely set during the first summer in the ocean...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze {{deterministic}} maturity guarantees. Such guarantees are embedded in modern individual pension products {{in order to protect}} the customer from downside investment risk. In particular, we focus on four issues: guarantee pricing, shortfall risk analysis, solvency requirements, and expected return. Other risk sources, such as mortality, early contract cancelation, or other problems such as hedging are left to further research. The first main contribution of this thesis is the implementation of a model with a stochastic volatility of the return rate of risky assets backing the guarantee. This constitutes the main difference to previous papers, which usually assume that the risky asset underlying the guarantee follows the geometric Brownian motion. We decided to use the Markov regime switching model introduced by Hamilton (1989) as it outperforms the linear and GARCH models. The use of the Markov switching model implies the incompleteness of the financial market. To address this issue we chose the Esscher martingale measure, which is well-known in actuarial science, in order to price the guarantee. This is the second main contribution of this thesis. Third, we proposed measuring the risk of the guarantee with several lower partial moments and conditional lower partial moments. In order to quantify the solvency capital, we proposed the mean excess loss. Furthermore, we have shown how risk managers can control the price and risk associated with a guarantee by making a suitable choice among several risk factors such as guarantee level, <b>stock</b> <b>proportion,</b> and time/contract term, or use a suitable investment strategy. Last, we have shown how to construct the so-called zero-bond investment strategy, which provides a costless/riskless guarantee...|$|R

The business performance of banks is the overall reflection of competence; however, the performance of Chinese banking industry is still weaker. According to some theoretical basis of capital structure, capital structure affects overall business performance by influencing the corporate governance of corporations. The capital structure of commercial banks also plays a vital role in achieving the financial goals and moderate operation. Thus this study aims to research how commercial banks’ capital structure affects business performance in China, and gives the recommendation to optimize the banks’ capital structure and improve business performance. This study employs penal data set in a sample of 14 Chinese listed commercial banks from 2005 to 2009. There are two indictors to measure the business performance: return on equity (ROE) and non-performing loan ratio (NPR). Considering the specificity of the banking industry, the study mainly focuses the effects of ownership structure (which includes ownership concentration, nature of owner and circulation <b>stock</b> <b>proportion),</b> supplementary capital and capital adequacy level on business performance. The results for return on equity indicate that proportion of top five shareholders (CR 5) which is fairly significantly correlates with ROE positively. But the holding proportion of largest shareholder (CR 1) is negative but no significantly affects ROE. Capital adequacy level negatively affects ROE. The results for non-performing loan show that CR 1 and CR 5 do not significantly affect NPR. The characteristic of the largest shareholder correlates with neither ROE nor NPR, the <b>proportion</b> of circulating <b>stock</b> affects business performance significantly.
