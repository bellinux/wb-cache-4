5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chest and right knee.|$|E
5|$|Mike was in {{character}} the entire time. He and Madonna {{really had a}} great chemistry together. This video shows her absolutely hysterical sense of humour, and it's great {{for everyone to see}} that <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> This was by far the most fun I've ever had making a video.|$|E
5|$|Hiram Berry (Jeff Goldblum) and Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) {{attempt to}} devise a last-minute scheme to derail the wedding. Rachel is {{reluctant}} to start without Quinn, who has driven home {{to pick up her}} bridesmaid's dress, and texts Quinn to find out where she is. Quinn is responding to Rachel's text when a truck crashes into the driver's <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> car.|$|E

5|$|On September 4, 2016, it was {{announced}} that Holiday had previously been diagnosed with a brain tumor during her pregnancy. Her husband chose to take a leave of absence to care for her. The tumor, which was benign, was found on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brain in late June 2016. Holiday gave birth to Jrue Tyler Holiday, a baby girl in September 2016, and the tumor was successfully removed in October.|$|E
5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Quinn advises Rachel {{to refuse}} Finn's {{marriage}} proposal {{and leave her}} past behind. Quinn has done so, {{and she has been}} accepted at Yale. Quinn asks to allow her to rejoin the Cheerios, but Sue refuses. However, following Regionals, she changes her mind. Quinn also changes her mind about Finn and Rachel's marriage and supports it. Rachel is reluctant to start the subsequent wedding without Quinn, and texts Quinn. Quinn is responding to Rachel's text when a truck crashes into the driver's <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> car.|$|E
50|$|Lacey: Saw two {{different}} <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and {{felt in the}} end the bad side would take over.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Misedashi, a {{day when}} a girl becomes maiko. Notice two {{dangling}} kanzashi on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hairstyle.|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that she}} has 2 sets of ears, human normal {{position}} and feline on the top <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|R
5|$|She {{has several}} tattoos, {{including}} {{a black and}} pink nautical star {{on the back of}} both of her elbows; a pink and red dragon surrounding kanji lettering that translates to 'Trust No One' going down the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> torso; symbols on the small of her lower back; and a butterfly on her right hip. She also has several piercings, including a 'Monroe' (a piercing near the upper lip that resembles a beauty mark) and 'Snakebites' (a piercing {{on each side of the}} lower lip).|$|E
5|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mark IX guns {{in single}} mounts. For {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) defence, Diana {{had a single}} 12-pounder AA gun between her funnels and two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bridge. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.|$|E
5|$|Gromoboi {{suffered}} 87 {{dead and}} 170 wounded; {{far more than}} Rossias 44 dead and 156 wounded. This was attributable to Rossias captain's policy of ordering the gun crews for his quick-firing guns on the engaged side to lie down and those on the unengaged side to go below, {{in contrast to the}} Gromoboi keeping her light guns manned at all times. Gromoboi was hit fifteen times on the starboard <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull and seven times on her port side, plus other hits in her funnels, boats and decks. She also suffered a fire caused by the ignition of excess propellant charges. Despite this number of hits, she was not badly damaged because her waterline belt was not penetrated. She was repaired within two months by the rudimentary facilities available at Vladivostok.|$|E
50|$|Through Lotta Kim, Rachel Alexandra is a {{fourth-generation}} {{descendant of}} Mr. Prospector. Northern Dancer is in both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pedigree.|$|R

5|$|On 11 January 2006, Venerable Ho died peacefully in {{her sleep}} at the Man Fut Tong Nursing Home, at about 9:30pm, just one month before turning 98. Until being {{hospital}}ised in November 2005, she had cooked for and looked after herself and played {{an active role in}} running both the temple and the nursing home. During her hospital stay, she suffered a stroke, which affected her speech and paralysed the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body. Discharged in December 2005, she was recuperating well at the nursing home until she developed a chest infection and breathing difficulties a few days before she died.|$|E
5|$|The Tomozuru Incident of 12 March 1934, {{in which}} a top-heavy torpedo boat capsized in heavy weather, caused the IJN to {{investigate}} the stability of all their ships, resulting {{in a number of}} design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength. Ryūjō, already known to be only marginally stable, was promptly docked at the Kure Naval Arsenal for modifications that strengthened her keel and added ballast and shallow torpedo bulges to improve her stability. Her funnels were moved higher up the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull and curved downward to keep the deck clear of smoke.|$|E
5|$|The coroner of Park County, Sharon Morris, {{confirmed}} that the body of Morrison (which had four bullet wounds, three non-fatal from police and one fatal shot from his own gun) {{was still in the}} second-floor classroom as of 6:00 p.m. An autopsy report later revealed that Morrison suffered two gunshot wounds to the head (including the fatal one fired from his gun), two additional in the right shoulder, and a graze wound to his right hand, while Emily Keyes died of a single gunshot wound to the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head. District officials stated that both the high school and Fitzsimmons Middle School would be closed for September 28 and September 29; a counseling center set up at a local church would open at 7:00 a.m. for students.|$|E
60|$|The smile deepened slightly. Little lines {{appeared}} at the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes. So far from being annoyed, {{he could see that}} she was laughing.|$|R
5000|$|Lili is {{an elderly}} female with brown fur {{and has a}} face on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head. She is the {{chairman}} of the Brigadoon Central Assembly.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him doubtfully. Her eyes were very blue and he looked into them steadfastly. By degrees the lines at the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth began to quiver.|$|R
5|$|Tirpitz was {{rendered}} {{unfit for}} combat by Operation Paravane. The Tallboy bomb that struck the battleship {{passed through the}} foredeck and hull, and exploded in the water on the starboard <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bow. This damage wrecked the bow, and left the battleship's forward compartments flooded with 2,000 tons of water. The explosions of several other Tallboys in the water near Tirpitz also buckled some of her hull plates and bulkheads. The battleship's casualties were not heavy, with five men killed and fifteen wounded. The damage was assessed as needing nine months' worth of work to repair. After reporting on the damage, Tirpitzs commanding officer, Kapitän zur See Wolf Junge, recommended to the German Navy's high command that the battleship be removed from service.|$|E
5|$|Declan {{begins to}} spend time with Bridget Parker and they go joyriding together. Bridget is banned from seeing him after they are pursued by the police, but she sneaks out to meet Declan. They argue and Bridget leaves. She is then hit by a car and is paralysed down one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body. Declan becomes a suspect and he hides at Lassiter's Hotel. He is kidnapped by Nick Thompson (Marty Grimwood) and Laura Davidson (Jodi Flockhart), who want money from Paul. Laura {{eventually}} frees Declan and he is found by Rebecca, Paul and Oliver. Bridget believes Declan cannot handle her disability and she starts dating Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). At an illegal dance party, Bridget, Josh and Declan become trapped when the roof falls in. Declan manages to carry Josh out before coming back for Bridget. He tells her that he does not have a problem with her disability and they start a relationship. Bridget discovers that she is pregnant and when she tells Declan, he runs away. He is arrested and kisses a football groupie, but he later returns and commits to Bridget and the baby. When Declan tries to rescue Elle Robinson's (Pippa Black) cat, he receives an electric shock. This makes him think about his life and he proposes to Bridget, who accepts. A few months later, Declan and Bridget marry in front of their friends.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February, Kroonland, {{continuing}} to sail for the American Line, returned to New York – Liverpool service after {{an absence of}} 18 months. As a ship of the still-neutral United States sailing in a war zone, Kroonland had her name painted in large letters on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull. The name was flanked on either side by large American flags and kept illuminated at night. In June, she carried US$1,500,000 of Argentine gold from London for deposit with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. On late 1916, a cook aboard Kroonland was arrested for smuggling feathers, wings, and heads of birds of paradise and crowned pigeons. The man, who was paid $300 for each load of feathers, smuggled {{in at least three}} loads of the avian contraband before his arrest. In January 1917, a jumble sale held in the saloon on Kroonland raised £73 15s 11d for The Times Fund, {{for the benefit of the}} British Red Cross and the Order of St. John.|$|E
5000|$|Eileen is a {{girl who}} has three eyes and doesn't have arms on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body, but she has four tentacles on the lower half <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body instead <b>of</b> legs. She is voiced by Michelle Horn.|$|R
5000|$|No. 1 {{was sent}} to Carlsbad, New Mexico and put on display in between Park Drive and E. Riverside Drive and sports the bold {{lettering}} of [...] "U.S. Potash" [...] on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> tender.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Owens made {{paintings}} {{based on}} World War II-era newspaper stereotype plates she discovered underneath the shingle <b>siding</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> Los Angeles home. Like much <b>of</b> <b>her</b> recent work, the paintings combined traditional oil paint with screen printed images digitally manipulated in Adobe Photoshop.|$|R
5|$|Rossia {{suffered}} only 44 {{dead and}} 156 wounded; {{far less than}} Gromobois 87 dead and 170 wounded. This was attributable to Rossias captain's policy of ordering the gun crews for his quick-firing guns on the engaged side to lay down and those on the unengaged side to go below, {{in contrast to the}} other ship keeping her light guns manned at all times. Rossia had been hit nineteen times on the starboard <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull and nine on her port side, plus other hits in her funnels, boats and decks. She had half of her guns knocked out and a fire caused by the ignition of excess propellant charges. Despite this number of hits, she was not badly damaged because her waterline belt was not penetrated by any hit. She was repaired within two months by the rudimentary facilities available at Vladivostok. Rossia made no further effort to interfere with Japanese shipping during the war.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{arrived at}} Pearl on 10 June and {{remained}} {{for several days}} before departing for Bremerton to begin an overhaul scheduled to last several months. Captain Cassady was relieved by Captain Thomas Sisson on 22 June although he was only briefly in command before Captain Lucian A. Moebus assumed command on 31 July. Saratoga completed her post-refit sea trials on 13 September and arrived at the Naval Air Station Alameda on 16 September to begin loading 85 aircraft, 1500 passengers and cargo bound for Pearl Harbor. She departed San Francisco two days later and arrived on 24 September. The ship was assigned to Carrier Division 11 which was tasked to train night fighter pilots and to develop night tactics and doctrine. Rear Admiral Matthias Gardner made Saratoga his flagship on 10 October. Four days later, the ship was accidentally rammed by her plane guard destroyer , gashing the port <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull. Operations were immediately cancelled and she returned to port for temporary repairs. Permanent repairs were made during a brief refit {{during the first week}} of November. Carrier qualification and other training continued through most of January 1945.|$|E
5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E
60|$|In {{one place}} in the Autobiography she claims both the {{language}} and the ideas; but when this witness is testifying, one must draw the line somewhere, or she will prove both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> case-nine <b>sides,</b> if desired.|$|R
2500|$|... {{wears an}} elegant, black dress. Its {{simplicity}} {{is a testament}} to the austerity of the Spanish court; however, her high hair is quite fashionable, as well as the mass of curls on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face c. 1635.|$|R
60|$|She {{raised her}} eyes to his. Her courage seemed to be {{returning}} at the note of battle in his tone. Her small, well-shaped head was thrown back. The hands which grasped the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chair ceased to tremble.|$|R
