At the ALS end of the spectrum, the model closely resembles the German version of the Franco-German model, with paramedics working with and {{under the direction of}} a physician.

For the balance, the model much more closely resembles the Anglo-American model, with EMTs making their own treatment decisions based upon local guidelines, albeit at a basic life <b>support</b> <b>level,</b> or at best, with the limited skill set of an EMT-I.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{in order to examine}} the relationship between organizational support perceptions and self-sufficiency levels of logistics sector employees and to determine whether organizational support perceptions and self-sufficiency levels of employees differ according to some specification. The questionnaire form consisting of perceived organizational support scale in accordance with the purpose, general self-sufficiency scale and personal information form, was applied to 124 employees of 3 separate logistics firms operating in Istanbul. The data obtained from the questionnaire were analyzed using SPSS 17. 0 statistical software package on computer. In the assessment of data, descriptive characteristics of employees were determined by frequency and percentage statistics and the self-sufficiency and perceived organizational <b>support</b> <b>levels</b> by the mean and standard deviation statistics. The t test, Tukey test and one-way Anova tests were utilized in determining employees' self-sufficiency and perceived organizational <b>support</b> <b>levels</b> differentiation according to descriptive characteristics, and correlation analysis was utilized in determining the relationship between self-sufficiency and perceived organizational <b>support</b> <b>levels</b> of employees. In conclusion, it was determined that there was statistical relationship between organizational <b>support</b> and self-sufficiency <b>levels</b> perceived by logistics sector employees. Accordingly, when employees' perceived organizational <b>support</b> <b>levels</b> increase then self-sufficiency levels also increase, and when perceived organizational <b>support</b> <b>levels</b> decrease then self-sufficiency levels also decrease. </p...|$|R
