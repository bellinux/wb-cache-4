50|$|As {{well as the}} {{mechanisms}} that limit immune cell entry and induce immune suppression, the eye also contains active immune cells that act upon the detection of foreign antigens. These cells interact with the immune system to induce unusual suppression of the systemic immune system response to an antigen introduced into the eye. This is known as Anterior Chamber Associated Immune Deviation (ACAID). Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare disease which results from {{the isolation of the}} eye from the systemic immune system. Usually, trauma to one eye induces the release of eye antigens which are recognized and picked up by local antigen presenting cells (APC) such as macrophages and dendritic cells. These APC carry the antigen to local lymph nodes to be sampled by T cells and B cells. Entering the systemic immune system, these antigens are recognized as foreign and an immune response is mounted against them. The result is the sensitization of immune cells against a <b>self-protein,</b> causing an autoimmune attack on both the damaged eye and the non-damaged eye.|$|E
40|$|Negative {{selection}} of CD 8 single positive thymocytes {{is based on}} the presentation through the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway of peptides derived from degradation of <b>self-proteins</b> by the constitutive proteasome and the immunoproteasome in the thymus. Then naive CD 8 + T-cells can be primed by mature dendritic cells. In mature dendritic cells peptides presented by MHC class I molecules are derived from degradation of endogenous <b>self-proteins</b> or through the process of cross-presentation from degradation of exogenous proteins by the immunoproteasome. In the absence of infection, peripheral cells display peptides on MHC class I molecules derived from degradation of endogenous <b>self-proteins</b> by the constitutive proteasome. The pool of peptides derived from protein degradation by the constitutive proteasome differs from the pool peptides derived from protein degradation by the immunoproteasome. Thus the probability of an autoreactive naive CD 8 + T-cell that escaped negative selection, and converted by a mature dendritic cell to autoreactive cytolytic T-cell, to kill a normal cell in the periphery, is reduced.

40|$|Determining how an {{autoimmune}} response is initiated {{is essential to}} understanding the mechanisms of autoimmunity. Self-reactive T cells, <b>self-protein,</b> and a failure of tolerance to that <b>self-protein</b> are all involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease; yet {{it is not clear}} how self-reactive T cells find the target <b>self-protein</b> to initiate an {{autoimmune response}}. Although a variety of self-proteins have been shown to be presented on both class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, the relationship of these self-proteins to autoimmune disease has not been established. To explore this further, we generated a T-cell hybridoma that recognizes mouse cardiac myosin, the <b>self-protein</b> that induces murine autoimmune myocarditis. Using this hybridoma as a probe to detect myosin-class II MHC complexes, we isolated a class II MHC+/CD 45 + residential antigen-presenting cell (APC) population directly from the hearts of normal mice and looked for evidence of endogenous processing of cardiac myosin by these APC. In this report we show that myosin-class II MHC complexes are found on residential APC in the normal mouse heart. Induction of autoimmune myocarditis increased the expression of myosin-class II MHC in the heart and enhanced their APC functions. This result is a direct demonstration that epitopes of a self-antigen involved in initiating an autoimmune disease are endogenously processed and presented within the target organ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Background - Exposure to viral antigens {{that share}} amino acid {{sequence}} similar with self- antigens might trigger autoimmune diseases in genetically predisposed individuals, and the molecular mimicry theory suggests that epitope mimicry between the virus and human proteins can activate autoimmune disease. Objective - The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the possible sequence similarity between the {{amino acid sequence}}s of thyroid <b>self-protein</b> and hepatitis C virus proteins, using databanks of proteins and immunogenic peptides, to explain autoimmune thyroid disease. Methods - Were performed the comparisons between the amino acid sequence of the hepatitis C virus polyprotein and thyroid <b>self-protein</b> human, available in the database of National Center for Biotechnology Information on Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. Results - The sequence similarity was related each hepatitis C virus genotype to each thyroid antigen. The similarities between the thyroid and the viral peptides ranged from 21. 0 % (31 identical residues out of 147 amino acid in the sequence) to 71. 0 % (5 identical residues out of 7 amino acid in the sequence). Conclusion - Bioinformatics data, suggest a possible pathogenic link between hepatitis C virus and autoimmune thyroid disease. Through of molecular mimicry is observed that sequences similarities between viral polyproteins and self-proteins thyroid could be a mechanism of induction of crossover immune response to self-antigens, with a breakdown of self-tolerance, resulting in autoimmune thyroid disease...|$|E

It was thought of interest to investigate the immunogenicity of nitrated poly L-tyrosine vis-à-vis its possible role in the induction of antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Commercially available poly L-tyrosine was exposed to nitrating species and the damage was monitored by UV spectroscopy and alkaline gel electrophoresis.

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} HIV {{patients}} have reported autoantibodies to several human proteins, including erythropoietin (EPO), interferon-α (IFN-α), interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), and HLA-DR, as potential mediators of anemia or immunosuppression. The etiology of these autoantibodies has {{been attributed to}} molecular mimicry between HIV epitopes and <b>self-proteins.</b> Here, the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS) was used to investigate the presence of such autoantibodies in HIV-infected adults. High levels of antibodies to HIV proteins such as capsid (p 24), matrix (p 17), envelope (gp 41), and reverse transcriptase (RT) were detected using LIPS in both untreated and anti-retroviral-treated HIV-infected individuals but not in uninfected controls. LIPS readily detected anti-EPO autoantibodies in serum samples from subjects with presumptive pure red cell aplasia but not in any of the samples from HIV-infected or uninfected individuals. Similarly, subjects with HIV lacked autoantibodies to IFN-α, IL- 2, HLA-DR and the immunoglobulin lambda light chain; all purported targets of molecular mimicry. While molecular mimicry between pathogen proteins and <b>self-proteins</b> is a commonly proposed mechanism for autoantibody production, the findings presented here indicate such a process is not common in HIV disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{immune system}} is {{designed}} to protect the host from infection and injury. However, when an adaptive immune response continues unchecked in the brain, the proinflammatory innate microglial response leads to the accumulation of neurotoxins and eventual neurodegeneration.

Indeed, the antigen in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an aberrant <b>self-protein,</b> although the adaptive immune responses are remarkably similar in a range of diseases. Ingress of lymphocytes and chronic activation of glial cells directly affect neurodegeneration. With this understanding, new therapies aimed at modulating the immune system’s response during PD could lead to decreased neuronal loss and improved clinical outcomes for disease...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{and more}} {{recently}} nasal tolerance have attracted attention as potential treatments of autoimmune disease. Arthritis induced by bovine type II collagen (CII) is a widely used animal model of rheumatoid arthritis, which is here used to investigate the efficacy of nasal treatment by a short peptide. The peptide spans residues 707 – 721 (designated p 707), an epitope of mouse CII that is most strongly recognized after immunization of mice with this <b>self-protein.</b> The treatment was partially effective, but almost only when the peptide was administered in large doses over a prolonged period. Mice immunized with bovine CII respond mainly to other peptides, located in the CB 11 fragment around amino acid residues 256 – 270.

40|$|SummaryMajor {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) restriction is the cardinal feature of T cell antigen recognition and {{is thought to}} be intrinsic to αβ T cell receptor (TCR) structure because of germline-encoded residues that impose MHC specificity. Here, we analyzed αβTCRs from T cells that had not undergone MHC-specific thymic selection. Instead of recognizing peptide-MHC complexes, the two αβTCRs studied here resembled antibodies in recognizing glycosylation-dependent conformational epitopes on a native <b>self-protein,</b> CD 155, and they did so with high affinity independently of MHC molecules. Ligand recognition was via the αβTCR combining site and involved the identical germline-encoded residues that have been thought to uniquely impose MHC specificity, demonstrating that these residues do not only promote MHC binding. This study demonstrates that, without MHC-specific thymic selection, αβTCRs can resemble antibodies in recognizing conformational epitopes on MHC-independent ligands...|$|E

40|$|It is {{now clear}} that helper T cells {{recognize}} a bimolecular ligand composed of a foreign protein frag-ment bound to an Ia molecule on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell (APC) (for review, see Schwartz 1985; Unanue and Allen 1987). The demon-stration of the direct binding of an immunogenic pep-tide to an Ia molecule has greatly simplified our think-ing as {{to the nature of the}} ligand of the T-cell receptor (TCR) (Babbitt et al. 1985; Buus et al. 1986). How-ever, it has also raised several other important ques-tions, including the capacity of Ia molecules to dis-tinguish self from foreign molecules. We and other investigators have in vitro evidence showing that major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules could not distinguish between foreign and self-peptides, but there was no direct proof that in vivo this was occurring (Babbitt et al. 1986; Lakey et al. 1986). The major difficulty in examining the processing and presentation of <b>self-proteins</b> was the lack of an experimental system by which one could directly examine in-vivo-processed <b>self-proteins.</b> We have recently developed a unique experimental system by which we were able to directly detect self-antigen/Ia complexes that were formed in vivo...|$|R

40|$|MHC-restriction is {{the unique}} feature of T cell antigen recognition, but its basis remains controversial. Currently, MHC-specificity {{is thought to}} be germline-encoded. That {{conclusion}} was based on structural analyses of αβT cell antigen receptors (αβTCRs) from T cells that had undergone MHC-specific thymic selection. Here, for the first time, αβTCRs from T cells that have not undergone MHC-specific thymic selection are analyzed. In contrast to conventional pMHC-specific αβTCRs, receptors that underwent thymic selection in the absence of MHC resemble antibodies in recognizing glycosylation-dependent conformational epitopes on a native <b>self-protein,</b> CD 155, with high affinity and independently of MHC. Furthermore, CD 155 recognition is mediated by the αβTCR combining site and involves specific CDR 2 -encoded amino acids previously thought to uniquely impose MHC specificity, contradicting the fundamental premise of the germline concept. Therefore, in the absence of MHC-specific thymic selection, αβTCRs resemble antibodies in recognizing conformational epitopes on MHC-independent ligands, revealing that MHC-specificity is not an intrinsic property of all αβTCRs. ...|$|E

40|$|Autoantigenic {{peptides}} {{resulting from}} <b>self-proteins</b> such as proinsulin are important {{players in the}} development of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 D). <b>Self-proteins</b> can be processed by cathepsins (Cats) within endocytic compartments and loaded to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules for CD 4 (+) T cell inspection. However, the processing and presentation of proinsulin by antigen-presenting cells (APC) in humans is only partially understood. Here we demonstrate that the processing of proinsulin by B cell or myeloid dendritic cell (mDC 1) -derived lysosomal cathepsins resulted in several proinsulin-derived intermediates. These intermediates were similar to those obtained using purified CatG and, to a lesser extent, CatD, S, and V in vitro. Some of these intermediates polarized T cell activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from T 1 D patients indicative for naturally processed T cell epitopes. Furthermore, CatG activity was found to be elevated in PBMC from T 1 D patients and abrogation of CatG activity resulted in functional inhibition of proinsulin-reactive T cells. Our data suggested the notion that CatG plays a critical role in proinsulin processing and is important in the activation process of diabetogenic T cells...|$|R

From this pool, we identified several identical peptide epitopes in the T and B cell repertoire derived from common endogenous proteins as well as novel endogenous epitopes with promiscuous binding.

These mice have impaired antibody responses to Tag, show diminished Tag-specific T-cell proliferation, and evidence an inability to generate Tag-specific cytotoxic T cells. The existence of systemic tolerance toward a beta-cell-specific protein motivated examination of transgene expression in the thymus. Indeed, low levels of Tag mRNA were detected intrathymically. Remarkably, this expression is a valid property of the insulin gene regulatory region, since insulin RNA was also expressed in the thymus of nontransgenic mice. RNA for other pancreatic genes was also detected in the thymus, thus raising the possibility that many tissue-specific genes could be expressed intrathymically during immunological development and induction of self-tolerance.

In this work, we investigated the potential of silicone oil microdroplets to act as an adjuvant to elicit immune responses against formulations containing foreign or <b>self-protein</b> in vivo. First, we tested the immunogenicity of formulations that contained a foreign protein and silicone oil microdroplets. A foreign model protein, ovalbumin (OVA), was added to emulsions of silicone oil microdroplets. Antibody responses in mice to subcutaneous injections of protein formulations that contained silicone oil microdroplets were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These responses were compared against responses to oil-free protein formulations and to protein formulations that contained microparticulate aluminum hydroxide (alum), the common vaccine adjuvant. When administered with silicone oil microdroplets, OVA formulations elicited robust anti-OVA IgG 1 and IgG 2 a antibody responses in mice relative to oil-free OVA formulations. These responses were equivalent to those observed when alum microparticles were added to OVA formulations, indicating that silicone oil can act as a potent adjuvant against proteins containing foreign epitopes. Mice were also injected with similar formulations wherein recombinant murine growth hormone (rmGH), a recombinant <b>self-protein,</b> was substituted in place of OVA. In this study, we found that immunological tolerance was broken in mice when formulations of rmGH that contained silicone oil microdroplets were administered daily. Thus, silicone oil microdroplets can promote a breakage in immunological tolerance and induce antibody responses against recombinant self-proteins. Furthermore, we investigated the capacity of silicone oil microdroplets to induce antibody responses against a model protein known to form agglomerates and undergo structural perturbations in the presence of silicone oil microdroplets, hen egg lysozyme (HEL). Silicone oil microdroplets elicited robust antibody responses against HEL in non-transgenic mice where HEL was recognized as foreign, but silicone oil microdroplets did not promote a break in tolerance in immune tolerant transgenic mice.

A major epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), p 87 – 99 (VHFFKNIVTPRTP), induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). VHFFK contains the major residues for binding of this self-molecule to T cell receptor (TCR) {{and to the}} major histocompatibility complex. Peptides from papilloma virus strains containing the motif VHFFK induce EAE. A peptide from human papilloma virus type 40 (HPV 40) containing VHFFR, and one from HPV 32 containing VHFFH, prevented EAE. A sequence from Bacillus subtilis (RKVVTDFFKNIPQRI) also prevented EAE. T cell lines, producing IL- 4 and specific for these microbial peptides, suppressed EAE.

40|$|Despite its efficacy, {{including}} {{in the prevention of}} vertical transmission, the antiretroviral nevirapine is associated with severe idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity and skin rash. The mechanisms underlying nevirapine toxicity are not fully understood, but drug bioactivation to reactive metabolites capable of forming stable protein adducts is thought to be involved. This hypothesis is based on the paradigm that drug reactive metabolites have the potential to bind to <b>self-proteins,</b> which results in drug-modified proteins being perceived as foreign by the immune system. The aim of the present work was to identify hemoglobin adducts in HIV patients as biomarkers of nevirapine haptenation upon bioactivation. The ultimate goal is to develop diagnostic methods for predicting the onset of nevirapine-induced toxic reactions. All included subjects were adults on nevirapine-containing antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 month. The protocol received prior approval from the Hospital Ethics Committees and patients gave their written informed consent. Nevirapine-derived adducts with the N-terminal valine of hemoglobin were analyzed by an established liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method and characterized on the basis of retention time and mass spectrometric fragmentation pattern by comparison with adduct standards prepared synthetically. The nevirapine adducts were detected in 12 / 13 patient samples, and quantified in 11 / 12 samples (2. 58 ± 0. 8 fmol/g of hemoglobin). This work represents the first evidence of nevirapine-protein adduct formation in man and confirms the ability of nevirapine to modify <b>self-proteins,</b> thus providing clues to the molecular mechanisms underlying nevirapine toxicity. Moreover, the possibility of assessing nevirapine-protein adduct levels has the potential to become useful for predicting the onset of nevirapine-induced adverse reactions...|$|R
