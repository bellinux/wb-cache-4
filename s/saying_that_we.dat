25|$|His first {{consideration}} {{is that the}} existence of God has to be demonstrated philosophically, besides the theological reasons for belief, particularly if we consider to make a demonstration for the non-believers. Moreover, the believers could be accused of making a circular reasoning, when <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must believe in God because of the Scriptures, and in the authority of the Scriptures because they have been inspired by God. He further indicates how the very Scriptures say that the mind of man is sufficient to discover God.|$|E

It was criticised by the new Sports minister Kate Hoey, who suggested the club were treating its supporters in a [...] "shabby way". Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson however replied that United had been pressurised to make the decision, which aimed to solidify England's 2006 FIFA World Cup bid: [...] "The Government are <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should be in the FA Cup, but they are the very people that were saying originally that {{we have to go to}} Brazil. They could tell us quite clearly: 'Do not bother about the World Cup bid, leave that to us. It should not be Manchester United's responsibility.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Excited at the prospect, Åkerfeldt agreed without {{consulting}} his bandmates or record label. While his bandmates {{liked the idea}} of recording two separate albums, Åkerfeldt had to convince the label: [...] "I had to lie somewhat... <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could do this recording very soon, it won't cost more than a regular single album." [...] With most of the material written, the band rehearsed just once before entering Nacksving Studios in 2002, and again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman. Under pressure to complete both albums simultaneously, Åkerfeldt said the recording process was [...] "the toughest test of our history." [...] After recording basic tracks, the band moved production to England to first mix the heavy album, Deliverance, with Andy Sneap at Backstage Studios. [...] "Deliverance was so poorly recorded, without any organisation whatsoever," [...] Åkerfeldt claimed, that Sneap [...] "is credited as a 'saviour' in the sleeve, as he surely saved much of the recording." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Mohamed Ali {{released}} a statement indicating that the military operation would help firm up on regional security. However, he later reportedly disowned any pact that the Somali authorities had with the Kenyan government {{to cross the border}} into Somalia, stating that [...] "We do not have agreement with Kenya. We understand that we need to defend against the militants but there is no proof <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> agreed with Kenya". He dismissed media reports suggesting he disagreed with the President. The two issued a joint statement on 27 October denying any agreement between the TFG and the Kenyan government to allow the Kenyan incursion into Somalia.|$|E
2500|$|Three days later, in {{response}} to the prediction of the [...] "increasing Asianisation" [...] of Australia made by Labor's Immigration Minister Stewart West, Blainey argued: [...] "I do not accept the view, widely held in the Federal Cabinet, that some kind of slow Asian takeover of Australia is inevitable. I do not believe that we are powerless. I do believe that we can with good will and good sense control our destiny.... As a people, we seem to move from extreme to extreme. In the past 30 years the government of Australia has moved from the extreme of wanting a white Australia to the extreme of <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will have an Asian Australia and that the quicker we move towards it the better".|$|E

2500|$|After he was {{reported}} in the press as saying homosexuals should [...] "repent and be changed", he made further comments in which he clarified his remarks. He stated that he had initially said to the journalist from the Telegraph {{that he was going to}} say in his sermon that all people, particularly churches and Christians, should repent, because there was a need [...] "to refocus on the faith of the church from down the ages and an authentic mission to the nations." [...] When asked specifically about whether this included homosexuals, he had said that yes, it included everybody and went on to give his interpretation of the Christian view of human sexuality, marriage and the family, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were all sinners and in continual need of repentance for our shortcomings.|$|E

[...] Adam Woodward of Little White Lies panned {{the film as}} [...] "an arrogant vanity project rendered laughable by its kitschy sycophancy." [...] Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy described the film as [...] "impeccably turned out with exquisite costume design", but felt it is [...] "barely enough to disguise its wildly inconsistent tone, chop-change visual style and snoozy performances." [...] Dan Carrier of Camden New Journal gave the film {{one out of five}} stars, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>W.E.</b> is [...] "a horrible film to watch" [...] and that Madonna [...] "should never be allowed to go anywhere near a director’s camera again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} appointment, he {{announced}} his intention to reform land law, to enshrine customary ownership of lands, and ensure that lands could not be leased {{without the consent of}} their collective traditional owners. This would be achieved by drawing inspiration from the Australian Northern Territory’s Northern Land Council, which is designed to safeguard Aboriginal customary land ownership. Describing himself as a “notorious critic” of free trade and foreign ownership of lands, he added: [...] "New Zealand, Australia and the World Bank are <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need to get away from , but I totally disagree. We need to enshrine it so that cultural land-owning groups or land-stewarding groups never lose control of the resource". He suggested that the government should encourage and support an agriculture-based economy, empowering customary land-owners.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the fourth}} day, Robert Croft and Darren Thomas held Warwickshire briefly at bay with a {{partnership}} of 75, but this wasn't enough as Glamorgan succumbed for 323. Warwickshire captain, Nick Knight, said, [...] "Once they were bowled out for 198 on that pitch {{they were always}} going to struggle. They then put down three catches, which proved to be decisive.

[...] John Derrick, Glamorgan's coach, said, [...] "Although we batted much better second time around, we made it difficult for ourselves by not scoring enough first innings runs.

Samuelson made of 'anti-intellectualism' [...] 'Intellectual' to me means thoughtful. The problem with the U.S. News rankings is that they are not 'intellectual.' They are, as some higher education experts label them, lame science. Mr. Samuelson also missed the point in suggesting nonparticipating colleges are trying to censor U.S. News. The magazine is of course free to continue its rankings, as are others. We are simply <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will not participate in an exercise that, in our view, misleads prospective students more than it helps and drives up college costs by encouraging spending in pursuit of rankings on a fictional prestige ladder invented by U.S. News." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 14 April, in the Commons, Powell claimed [...] "it is {{difficult}} to fault the military and especially the naval measures which the Government have taken". He added: [...] "We are in some danger of resting our position too exclusively upon the existence, the nature and {{the wishes of the}} inhabitants of the Falkland Islands... if the population of the Falkland Islands did not desire to be British, the principle that the Queen wishes no unwilling subjects would long ago have prevailed; but we should create great difficulties for ourselves in other contexts, as well as in this context, if we rested our action purely and exclusively on the notion of restoring tolerable, acceptable conditions and self-determination to our fellow Britons on the Falkland Islands.... I do not think that we need be too nice about <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> defend our territory as well as our people. There is nothing irrational, nothing to be ashamed of, in doing that. Indeed, it is impossible in the last resort to distinguish between the defence of territory and the defence of people".|$|E

The property owners will come over to our side. Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discretely and circumspectly ... It goes without <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall respectfully tolerate persons of other faiths and protect their property, their honor, and their freedom with the harshest means of coercion. This is another area in which we shall set the entire world a wonderful example ... Should there be many such immovable owners in individual areas , we shall simply leave them there and develop our commerce in the direction of other areas which belong to us", Herzl's draft of a charter for a Jewish-Ottoman Land Company (JOLC) gave the JOLC the right to obtain land in Israel by giving its owners comparable land elsewhere in the Ottoman empire.|$|E
2500|$|Instances of this {{behavior}} {{have been found}} in the Bible. In a cave painting from at least 8000 BC in the Northern Italian Val Camonica a man is shown about to penetrate an animal. Raymond Christinger interprets that as a show of power of a tribal chief, and so we do not know if this practice was then more acceptable, and if the scene depicted was usual or unusual or whether it was symbolic or imaginary. The Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art says the scene may be humorous, as the penetrating man seems to be waving cheerfully with his hand at the same time. Potters seem to have spent time depicting the practice, but this may be because they found the idea amusing. Dr [...] "Jacobus X", said to be a nom-de-plume for a French author, said this was clearly [...] "before any known taboos against sex with animals existed." [...] Marc Epprecht states that authors such as Jacobus X do not deserve respect because their methodology is based on hearsay, and was designed for voyeuristic titillation of the reader. Masters said that since pre-historic man is prehistoric it goes without <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know little of his sexual behaviour, depictions in cave paintings may only show the artist's subjective preoccupations or thoughts.|$|E
