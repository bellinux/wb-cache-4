A systematic study, with empha-sis on the modeling and forecasting aspects, thus, becomes imperative, so that efficient measures can be promptly undertaken to cushion the effect of such an unforeseen calamity. The present work intends to discover a suitable ARIMA model using dust storm data from northern China from March 1954 to April 2002, provided by Zhou and Zhang (2003), thereby extending the idea of em-pirical recurrence rate (ERR) developed by Ho (2008), to model the temporal trend of such sand dust storms. In particular we show that the ERR time series is endowed with the following charac-teristics: 1) it is a potent surrogate for a point process, 2) {{it is capable of}} taking advantage of the well developed and powerful time series modeling tools and 3) it can generate reliable forecasts, with which we can retrieve the corresponding mean number of <b>strong</b> <b>sand</b> dust storms.

40|$|The casting {{of metals}} and alloys is very often {{performed}} into molds made of sands bonded by polymers. Resins based on, for instance, phenol–formaldehyde build bonding bridges between the sand grains, establishing a macroporous tight and <b>strong</b> <b>sand</b> form having a shape mirroring the workpiece to be cast. Any cavity in a casting is mapped by so-called cores, which are also made of polymeric-bonded sands. Organic aerogels can replace conventional polymers and {{offer a variety of}} advantages due to their nanostructure and composition, especially for cores. The development of these organic aerogels for lightmetal and nonferrous heavy metal casting is described, their properties elaborated and compared with conventional ones. Transforming especially resorcinol–formaldehyde aerogels into carbon aerogels allows bonding sand grains by amorphous, nanostructured carbon with special advantages. New developments {{in the last few years}} are described, revealing that inorganic and organic aerogels in a granular form can replace a part of any sand used in foundries, leading to improved cast parts. In contrast to polymeric aerogels, silica-based ones have been used for more than a decade in solidification engineering to study fundamental aspects of metal solidification and casting.

This {{was with the}} aim of determining their suitability for casting of intricate shapes. To achieve this, various compositions of starch bonded sand cores {{were produced}}. Standard core samples were produced and tested for green and baked compressive strength. The determination of green and baked compressive strengths was carried out on a large number of cores containing 6 – 12 % water and 4 – 12 % cassava starch. Core baking was carried out at temperature between 90 and 200 oC for 60 – 150 minutes. From the results obtained, appropriate baking conditions and optimum core mixtures were established for cassava starch bonded core. The major results in the research showed that good cores can be produced using cassava starch as binder. Optimum core mixture for this purpose was found to be that containing 10 % starch and 10 % water and at appropriate baking temperature and time were 180 oC and 2 hours respectively. The green compressive strength was 290 N/mm 2 and that of baked compressive strength was 4122 N/mm 2.

40|$|Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. ] {{is grown}} {{worldwide}} in areas affected by wind erosion, but no data on associated damage to millet are available. Laboratory wind tunnel experiments {{were conducted to}} determine the kind and extent of damage to millet caused by wind, sandblasting, and burial. In Exp. 1, millet was exposed for 15 min to wind (8, 11, or 14 m s− 1) or wind + sand (8. 3, 25. 0, or 41. 7 g m− 1 s− 1 sand abrader flux) at 8 and/or 16 d after emergence (DAE). Viable leaf area, leaf net photosynthesis, and NO 3 content were measured through 21 DAE and dry matter production through 57 DAE. In Exp. 2, millet was seeded as three single seeds or in tufts, exposed to 25 g m− 1 s− 1 sand flux for 15 min at the 1 -, 2 -, or 3 -leaf stage, and then manually covered by 15 mm sand. Survival was monitored weekly; dry matter was determined 70 DAE. In Exp. 1, survival was uniformly 100 %. Wind alone or low sand flux {{had no effect on}} viable leaf area. High sand flux decreased viable leaf area by 74 % at 2 d after the 8 -DAE exposure and 42 % at 5 d after the 16 -DAE exposure. Photosynthesis of the remaining leaf area was reduced up to 88 % immediately after exposure compared with the control, and NO 3 content of sandblasted millet was increased up to six times. Dry weight was reduced 40 % at 21 DAE by the highest sand flux, but 9. 7 % at 57 DAE. In Exp. 2, burial decreased millet survival and dry weight. Buried tufts had a higher survival rate and 35 % more dry weight than buried single plants. Millet buried at the 1 -leaf stage had 28 % higher survival than plants treated later. Sandblasting reduced dry matter of buried millet only. Regression analyses between calculated total kinetic effects and growth parameters showed low r 2 values.

40|$|Sand sculptures are an {{inspiration}} source for an environmentally friendly building material, consisting only of sand, clay and water. The art of sand sculpting is generally dealt with low technical consideration. There {{is a need}} of comprehensive technical look on this topic {{in order to make}} standards for sand-sculpting. This study involves literature and experimental investigation to find out the optimal sand-clay mixture for sand sculpting with focus on the best preparation method, optimal water content, highest strength and the development of strength over time. Four sand clay mixes were prepared, 100 % sand, 95 % sand – 5 % clay, 90 % sand – 10 % clay and 85 % sand – 15 % clay. Standard Proctor compaction tests were carried out to find the water content, at which the soil achieved the highest dry density for standard compaction energy. It was expected that the highest dry density corresponds with the maximum strength. On this water content, cubes of 3, 5 cm on all sides were constructed. These cubes were tested on ultimate unconfined compressive strength (UCS), after oven drying (at 0 % water content). Also the strength development over the drying time at room temperature was tested using the UCS. The optimal preparation method was found to be to soak the clay in the water for 24 hours in small cubes to get the clay as liquid as possible. Then the sand can be mixed through without the presence of clay lumps. With the proctor tests {{it was found that the}} dry density increases with increasing clay content. The optimum water content decreases with increasing clay content and values ranged between 11 % and 17 %. Additionally, UCS values were found to be increasing with increasing clay content. The highest value of 1, 2 MPa was recorded for 85 % sand. 1, 0 MPa was recorded for 90 % sand and a significantly lower value of 0, 4 MPa for 95 % sand. The strength after a drying time of 3 days was found to be the same as for oven drying 1, 2 MPa for 85 % sand, 1, 0 MPa for 90 % sand and 0, 5 MPa for 95 % sand. However, these values are lower for a drying time of 8 days. This suggests there might be an optimum water content, that is higher than the equilibrium moisture content. The results of this report indicate that a properly prepared mixture consisting of 15 % clay and 85 % sand at an optimum water content is suitable for an artist to make a <b>strong</b> <b>sand</b> sculpture on the beach.

40|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} a way of {{reducing}} the cost of energy. Deep geothermal energy systems extract heat from very deep soil layers where the temperatures are very high. Shallow geothermal energy systems are about 150 metres deep and they are used to store heat in the soil, to extract it later and use it for space heating. These shallow geothermal systems are generally embedded in a borehole, but they can also be cast into structures, which are called thermo-active foundations. An example of such a foundation is the energy pile, a foundation pile with a heat exchanger embedded in it, connected to a heat pump. There is no need to drill an extra hole in the ground, but the downside {{is that it is not}} well known how the bearing capacity of the pile is affected by the heating/cooling cycles. An energy pile experiment is planned to investigate the thermo-mechanical behaviours of the pile and the goal of this thesis is a numerical investigation of the pile. It serves as an estimate of the pile and soil behaviour prior to installation and the results will be used to confidently design the experiment. The model was built with DIANA FEA software, that is capable of coupling thermo-mechanical behaviour. Firstly an experiment in London clay was recreated in order to verify and validate the model and modelling approach. The experiment in Delft was modelled using site investigation that was done at the location where it will be built. Along with old Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data the subsurface was mapped and soil parameters used in the material model were chosen. The thermal cycle that was imposed on the pile was chosen on the basis of preliminary modelling done at different temperature increments. The temperatures were chosen such that the pile was affected to a significant degree of its capacity. It was cooled for three weeks to 0 °C and then heated to 24 °C for three weeks, this was repeated for 6 years. The research focussed on finding which thermo-mechanical effects can be expected and what the scale of those effects could be. The effect directly linked to an increase in temperature is thermal strain. Materials tend to expand and contract with the temperature at different rates and so do the pile and the soil. The gradient of the heat flow is also an important factor as the pile is subjected to the temperature before the soil is. The pile will expand first and this will be resisted by the soil, the strain that is resisted by the soil is called the restrained strain and that is responsible for the change in stress in the pile. A pile that is heated will have more stress than with just a mechanical load and a pile that is cooled will see a reduction in stress. The pile will expand vertically around a null-point somewhere along the pile, this is the point that does not move. In principle, an unrestrained pile will have a null-point in the centre of the pile, but because some soil layers resist the pile movement more than others the null-point is closer to the stronger layers. In the Delft experiment model the null-point was halfway down the pile at first, but as the amount of cycles progressed it moved down. This is due to a decrease in resistance from the weaker layers and an increase in resistance in the <b>strong</b> <b>sand</b> layer on which the pile is based. The amount of stress that is generated is also less in these later cycles as the resistance of the soil became less. With that reduced resistance an increase in settlement is also seen. This can lead to differential settlements of structures that are built on such a pile, possibly damaging them. The results of the modelling are used to give an advice on the experiment details, such as geometry, thermal cycle and pile layout. An advice to the layout of the sensors is included as well as a prediction of the results...|$|E

50|$|The ionic {{surface of}} {{bentonite}} has a useful property {{in making a}} sticky coating on sand grains.

40|$|Copyright © 2006 Australian Society of Exploration GeophysicistsAbstract Image logs {{from the}} deep intra-Latrobe and Golden Beach Subgroups of the West Tuna area in the Gippsland Basin reveal that {{wellbore}} failure is restricted to fast, cemented sandstone units and does not occur in interbedded shales. Triaxial testing and analysis of empirically derived, wireline-log based strength equations reveals uniaxial compressive strengths of 60 MPa in sandstones and 30 MPa in shales in the West Tuna area. Conventional analysis of wellbore failure assumes constant stresses in the shales and adjacent sandstones and that breakout is focused in the weaker units. We propose that the flat lying, strong, cemented sandstone units in the West Tuna area act as a stress-bearing framework within the present-day stress regime that is characterised by very high horizontal stresses (SHmax > Shmin = Sv). Stress focusing in strong sandstone units can result in high stress concentrations at the wellbore wall and account for the restriction of wellbore failure to the strong sandstone units. Finite element methods were used to investigate the stress distribution in horizontal, interbedded ?<b>strong?</b> <b>sands</b> and ?weak? shales subject to a high present-day stress state such as exists in the West Tuna area (SHmax > Sv ~ Shmin). Modelling using the present-day stress tensor and estimated elastic properties for the sandstones and shales indicates that the present-day stress is ?partitioned? between ?strong? inter-bedded sandstones and ?weaker? shales, with high stress being focussed into the strong sandstones. The stress focusing causes borehole breakout in the sands despite their higher strength. Conversely, stresses are too low to generate wellbore failure in the weaker shales...|$|R

Annually, the fate of these trees was determined and newly recruited trees were noted. More than 300 downed trees have been recorded. Recruitment varied across landforms with more constrained reaches having greatest mortality. Total tree mortality varied substantially across years.
