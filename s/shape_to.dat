Skin & Bone was {{originally}} intended to be entirely improvised, but {{after a year of}} filming Lewis decided to script some of it to add <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> the story. The film alternates between black and white and color, marking shifts between depictions of a character's fantasy and reality.|$|E

5|$|In the past, {{oligonucleotide}} synthesis {{was carried}} out manually in solution or on solid phase. The solid phase synthesis was implemented using, as containers for the solid phase, miniature glass columns similar in their <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> low-pressure chromatography columns or syringes equipped with porous filters.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there exist}} {{polynomial}} time algorithms {{to find a}} matrix having given row and column sums, the solution may be far from unique: any submatrix {{in the form of}} a 22 identity matrix can be complemented without affecting the correctness of the solution. Therefore, researchers have searched for constraints on the <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> be reconstructed that can be used to restrict the space of solutions. For instance, one might assume that the shape is connected; however, testing whether there exists a connected solution is NP-complete. An even more constrained version that is easier to solve is that the shape is orthogonally convex: having a single contiguous block of squares in each row and column.|$|E
5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow {{nanotubes}} 4–20nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> carbon nanotubes, and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube. In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property.|$|E

5|$|Gimsa et al. (2015) {{suggest that}} the dorsal sail of Spinosaurus was {{homologous}} to the dorsal fins of sailfish and served a hydrodynamic purpose. Gimsa and others point out that more basal, long-legged spinosaurids have otherwise round or crescent-shaped dorsal sails, whereas in Spinosaurus, the dorsal neural spines form a shape that is roughly rectangular and similar in <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> the dorsal fins of sailfish. They therefore argue that Spinosaurus used its dorsal neural sail {{in the same manner}} as sailfish, and that it also employed its long narrow tail to stun prey like a modern thresher shark.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, shutters and {{the speed of the}} photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus's <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> determine if it is differentiated. Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to determine that its shape, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster {{at some point in}} the recent past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that the density of the core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E

5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> a degree that would be {{necessary}} to accomplish what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E
5|$|Russula emetica {{produces}} a white to yellowish-white spore print. Spores are roughly elliptical to egg-shaped, with a strongly warted and partially reticulate (web-like) surface. They have dimensions of 8.8–11.0 by 6.6–8μm, and are amyloid, {{meaning that they}} will stain blue, bluish-grey, to blackish in Melzer's reagent. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 32.9–50 by 9.0–11.6μm. Cystidia located on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are somewhat cylindrical to club-shaped or somewhat spindle-shaped, and measure 35–88 by 7.3–12.4μm. They are yellowish, and contain granular contents. Cheilocystidia (found {{on the edges of}} the gills), which are similar in <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> the pleurocystidia, are thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 14–24 by 4.4–7.3μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{elongate}} organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including certain caterpillars (which do so to escape danger), tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, Armadillidiidae, and Mount Lyell salamanders. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily {{to protect their}} bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in pangolins, wheel spiders, hedgehogs, armadillos, Armadillo girdled lizards, isopods, and fossilized trilobites. Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> generate a propulsive force.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{results can}} be {{extended}} from closed curves to unbounded curves satisfying a local Lipschitz condition. For such curves, if {{both sides of the}} curve have infinite area, then the evolved curve remains smooth and singularity-free for all time. However, if one side of an unbounded curve has finite area, and the curve has finite total absolute curvature, then its evolution reaches a singularity in time proportional to the area on the finite-area side of the curve, with unbounded curvature near the singularity. For curves that are graphs of sufficiently well-behaved functions, asymptotic to a ray in each direction, the solution converges in <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> a unique shape that is asymptotic to the same rays.|$|E
5|$|The Lānai hookbill is {{only known}} to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe. The type {{specimen}} was caught while feeding on the plant, and its berries were subsequently discovered in its stomach. It is considered likely that the hookbill additionally ate akoko fruits due to their similarity in size and <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> those of the ōpuhe. However, the hookbill's unique bill is considered unlikely to have evolved if the species was purely frugivorous, and {{it has been suggested that}} the hookbill specialized in eating snails. The species was very active while searching for food, constantly flying from tree to tree. While perched it shifted restlessly.|$|E
5|$|The White House, {{originally}} {{dating back}} to 1750, is timber framed and was extended in 1830 {{and again in the}} 1960s.

5|$|The series {{tells the}} story of the {{citizens}} of Kurōzu-cho, a fictional city which is plagued by a supernatural curse involving spirals. The story for Uzumaki originated when Ito attempted to write a story about people living in a very long terraced house, and he was inspired to use a spiral <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> achieve the desired length. Ito believes the horror of Uzumaki is effective due to its subversion of symbols which are normally positively portrayed in Japanese media, and its theme of protagonists struggling against a mysterious force stronger than themselves.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is similar}} in <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> that of M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the front part of the braincase is higher. The second and third upper premolars (P2 and P3) are tiny and pressed against the upper canine (C1) and fourth premolar (P4). The canine is less {{well-developed}} than in M.mystacinus. There is a clear cusp present {{on the side of}} the P4. The accessory cusp known as the protoconule is present on each of the upper molars when they are unworn. M.mystacinus lacks the P4 cusp and the protoconules on the molars, but M.brandtii has an even larger cusp on P4.|$|E
5|$|They {{are named}} after Franz Reuleaux, a 19th-century German {{engineer}} who pioneered {{the study of}} machines for translating one type of motion into another, and who used Reuleaux triangles in his designs.

Other applications of the Reuleaux triangle include giving the <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> guitar picks, pencils, and drill bits for drilling square holes, as well as in graphic design in the shapes of some signs and corporate logos.|$|E
