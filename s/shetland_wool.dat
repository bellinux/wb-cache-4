500|$|In November 2011, <b>Shetland</b> <b>wool</b> {{produced}} in the Shetlands gained protected geographical status with a {{protected designation of origin}} (PDO) classification as [...] "Native Shetland Wool". It was the first non-food product in the UK to receive this status.|$|E
500|$|The wool {{produced}} by the Shetland has historically been a valuable commodity. Shetlands produce numerous shades of wool colours (see below), and this variety was commercially important to the wool industry of the Shetland Isles, where natural wools are often used undyed.

50|$|When World War II {{broke out}} in 1939, Peal was {{stationed}} on the Shetland Islands. During this time he supplied his store with sweaters knitted from the <b>wool</b> of <b>Shetland</b> sheep. As <b>wool</b> was being rationed during wartime Peal was able to harness the demand for high quality knitwear in Britain.|$|R

6000|$|On another {{occasion}} ... we mustn't {{forget that the}} ship had crossed the line and was adding up south latitude every day by then--on {{another occasion}}, about seven in the evening, Powell on duty, heard his name uttered softly in the companion. The captain was on the stairs, thin-faced, his eyes sunk, on his arm a <b>Shetland</b> <b>wool</b> wrap.|$|E
6000|$|The Tout.--Ladies and Gentlemen, I {{have the}} honour to {{announce}} a sale of many interesting, beautiful, rare, quaint, comical, and necessary articles. Here you will find objects of taste, such as Babies' Shoes, Children's Petticoats, and <b>Shetland</b> <b>Wool</b> Cravats; objects of general usefulness, such as Tea-cosies, Bangles, Brahmin Beads, and Madras Baskets; and objects of imperious necessity, such as Pen-wipers, Indian Figures carefully repaired with glue, and Sealed Envelopes, containing a surprise. And all {{this is not to}} be sold by your common Shopkeepers, intent on small and legitimate profits, but by Ladies and Gentlemen, who would as soon think of picking your pocket of a cotton handkerchief as of selling a single one of these many interesting, beautiful, rare, quaint, comical, and necessary articles at less than twice its market value. (He sounds another flourish.) ...|$|E
6000|$|So Miss Ailie {{could be}} brave, {{but what a}} poltroon she was also! Three calls did she make on dear friends, ostensibly to ask how a cold was or to {{instruct}} them in a new device in <b>Shetland</b> <b>wool,</b> but really to announce {{that she did not}} propose keeping school {{after the end of the}} term--because--in short, Mr. Ivie McLean and she--that is he--and so on. But though she had planned it all out so carefully, with at least three capital ways of leading up to it, and knew precisely what they would say, and pined to hear them say it, on each occasion shyness conquered and she came away with the words unspoken. How she despised herself, and how Mr. McLean laughed! He wanted to take the job off her hands by telling the news to Dr. McQueen, who could be depended on to spread it through the town, and Miss Ailie discovered with horror that his simple plan was to say, [...] "How are you, doctor? I just looked in to tell you that Miss Ailie and I are to be married. Good afternoon." [...] The audacity of this captivated Miss Ailie even while it outraged her sense of decency. To Redlintie went Mr. McLean, and returning next day drew from his pocket something which he put on Miss Ailie's finger, and then she had the idea of taking off her left glove in church, which would have announced her engagement as loudly as though Mr. Dishart had included it in his pulpit intimations. Religion, however, stopped her when she had got the little finger out, and the Misses Finlayson, who sat behind and knew she had an itchy something inside her glove, concluded that it was her threepenny for the plate. As for Gavinia, like others of her class in those days, she had never heard of engagement rings, and so it really seemed as if Mr. McLean must call on the doctor after all. But [...] "No," [...] said he, [...] "I hit upon a better notion to-day in the Den," [...] and to explain this notion he produced from his pocket a large, vulgar bottle, which shocked Miss Ailie, and indeed that bottle had not passed through the streets uncommented on.|$|E
5000|$|Altmann also {{produced}} clothes in <b>Shetland</b> <b>wool,</b> vicuna and a lambswool/fur fibre blend called [...] "Bernamere". A 1960s advertising tagline {{for the company}} ran: [...] "The Legend of a Great Knitter." ...|$|E

50|$|In 2010 {{the company}} {{launched}} the Real <b>Shetland</b> <b>Wool</b> Flatweave Collection, made using British wool. The company became {{a supporter of}} HRH The Prince of Wales' Campaign for Wool The company's wool carpets have been praised as eco-friendly because wool is biodegradable.|$|E
50|$|Up {{until the}} mid-1970s the method was rarely used for {{commercial}} clothing production. It was used domestically, to overdye old, worn and faded clothes, {{and also by}} resellers of used or surplus military clothing. The first notable industrial use of the technique was made by Benetton, which garment dyed its <b>Shetland</b> <b>wool</b> knitwear.|$|E
5000|$|In general, {{there is}} little risk of {{unravelling}} the sweater with a steek cut if the sewn or crocheted line has been done with wool yarn that is not superwash. They can be further strengthened by using a sticky hairy animal yarn (<b>Shetland</b> <b>wool,</b> the traditional choice, is a good example), and using frequent color changes (such as a 1x1 rib or a check pattern) to secure the yarn. In addition, {{the sides of the}} steek can be reinforced by crocheting or sewing.|$|E

5000|$|Writing in The Guardian, Alison Adburgham said: [...] "There {{is nothing}} homely about the hand-knits". She {{described}} a revival both of traditional crafts and patterns - its 'wedding ring' (cobweb) shawls, so fine {{they could be}} pulled through a ring, {{were made in the}} Outer Hebrides using single-ply <b>Shetland</b> <b>wool</b> and some took over six months to make. Most of the creators of these cobweb shawls were elderly women - younger knitters lacked the patience - and patterns were said to be based on lace designs worn by survivors of the Spanish Armada washed up on the islands. At {{the other end of the}} scale, its chunky men's knits included not only Arans, but also traditional English patterns such as a Northumberland Seahouses design, based on a traditional fisherman's guernsey sweater and sourced from authorities on traditional patterns.|$|E
5000|$|However, when Captain Brown {{moves to}} town, he {{challenges}} the women's rules of politeness. First, he openly admits his own poverty. This is particularly awful to Miss Deborah Jenkyns, whom Brown also offends by finding Charles Dickens a better writer than Jenkyns' preferred [...] "Dr. Johnson" [...] (Samuel Johnson). Nevertheless, Brown’s warm manner subdues his detractors’ contention of his supposed social awkwardness; therefore, they {{allow him to}} bypass custom and visit before noon. Brown also has two daughters: Miss Brown, a sickly, ill-tempered woman with hardened features, and Miss Jessie, who has an innocent face and, like her father, is naive to Cranford’s social mores. For instance, Miss Jessie boasts that her uncle, a shop-keeper, can provide her with large amounts of <b>Shetland</b> <b>wool.</b> When aristocratic Miss Jenkyns overhears, she takes exception to Miss Jessie's openness about her uncle's un-genteel occupation, and worries that the local lady of the manor, The Honorable Mrs. Jamison, will be offended by {{being in the same}} social circle as a shopkeeper's niece.|$|E
30|$|When {{the project}} ended, NICE wanted to {{continue}} its research and use the heritage and technology it had discovered to develop further consumer demand for Norwegian wool and create a label of provenance, similar to Harris Tweed, called the Nordic Swan Ecolabel. As part of this research, they chose to visit Shetland where fleece is gathered from over 700 crofters to produce <b>Shetland</b> <b>wool.</b>|$|E
40|$|Biodegradation of Ryeland and <b>Shetland</b> <b>wool</b> by Bacillus subtilis W 3 and Streptomyces albidoflavus were investigated. The {{effect of}} {{treating}} raw wool with Rhamnolipid was also studied. It is {{shown that the}} wool surface morphology is improved with effective displacement of surface contaminants revealing a smooth outer cuticle layer after just 2 days. These results have important practical implications {{for the establishment of}} a quick and easy biodegradable process for wool scouring finishing in textile industry or for the pre-treatment of keratinous waste materials before degradation by bacteria or fungi. This methodology provides an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional chemical pre-treatments...|$|E
