50|$|In 1938 Eastwoods Ltd {{established}} a cement works near South Ferriby, west of Ferriby Sluice. The initial plant {{consisted of a}} single 61 by 2.5 m rotary kiln with an output of around 200t per day by the wet process. Chalk was supplied from a quarry, Middlegate quarry, south east of South Ferriby, which was crushed at the quarry and transported to the cement plant by aerial ropeway, whilst clay was supplied from west adjacent west of the plant. In 1962 the plant became part of Rugby Portland Cement Co. Ltd. In 1967 a <b>semi-dry</b> <b>process</b> rotary kiln was installed and the first kiln ceased operating. In 1974 the excavations at the chalk quarry were extended below the chalk through a relatively thin layer of red chalk and carrstone to the underlying clay, which was also extracted {{for use in the}} process - a conveyor belt system was installed to transport the materials to plant; the clay extraction west of the plant then ceased. A second rotary kiln was added in 1978. Ownership passed to Rugby Group (1979), RMC (2000), and then to CEMEX 2005.|$|E

According to the results, higher effective calcium oxide content in lime contributes to faster heating {{rate of the}} semi-dry system and better effects of <b>semi-dry</b> <b>process.</b> Sludge at the moisture content of 45 %- 55 % after the <b>semi-dry</b> <b>process</b> can be well balled while that at the moisture content of 35 % can easily get collapsed and has hard surface. Mechanical design parameters are determined by experiments. The optimum stirring time is 5 - 10 mins when well stirred and the stirring rate should be slow.

40|$|Urea-{{formaldehyde}} (UF) resin is {{a common}} binder in many fibre- and particleboards today. However, formaldehyde is a fairly reactive compound with many negative affects on health and environment. This paper describes a process to make thin high density fibreboards without use of conventional resin such as UF. Initially we found that wood particles such as ones used in particle board had, when activated with hydrogen peroxide and iron catalyst, self-bonding capability when hot-pressed into boards. Low swelling board, although at somewhat higher density than conventional glued ones, could be formed by pressing activated wood particles at 170 oC in a laboratory press. We found that the activation technique was applicable to dry or <b>semi-dry</b> board <b>processes</b> and {{was considered to be}} well suited for fibreboards from refined wood fibers especially as their specific (contact) area is high. Activated wood fibres were produced at Metso Panelboards Pilot-refiner in Sundsvall and mats were also formed and pressed into boards 50 x 60 cm 2 at fairly conventional pressing conditions. At a hydrogen peroxide charge of 4 % boards made from birch fibres with good mechanical properties (in terms of bending strength and internal bonding) were produced. Thickness swelling in water was low (TS 24 h., 15 - 20 %). At lower hydrogen peroxide charges (< 2 %) the swelling was higher. Development of the process to also include other wood species than birch is in our interest. Furthermore, properties of the boards were strongly dependent on the moisture content of fibres; at low moisture content (MC< 8 %) thickness swelling increased. We see a high potential in the process as the glue-free technique is estimated to reduce production cost of boards as well as give environmental advantages.

The {{goal of the}} project is to develop cost {{effective}} analysis tools and techniques for demonstrating and evaluating low NOx control strategies and their possible impact on boiler performance for boilers firing US coals. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) is providing co-funding for this program. Using the initial CFD baseline modeling of the Gavin Station and the plant corrosion maps, six boiler locations for the corrosion probes were identified and access ports have been installed. Preliminary corrosion data obtained appear consistent and believable. In situ, spectroscopic experiments at BYU reported in part last quarter were completed. New reactor tubes have been made for BYU's CCR that allow for testing smaller amounts of catalyst and thus increasing space velocity; monolith catalysts have been cut and a small reactor that can accommodate these pieces for testing is in its final stages of construction. A poisoning study on Ca-poisoned catalysts was begun this quarter. A possible site for a biomass co-firing test of the slipstream reactor was visited this quarter. The slipstream reactor at Rockport required repair and refurbishment, and will be re-started in the next quarter.

40|$|This is the Final Report for DOE Cooperative Agreement No: DE-FC 26 - 00 NT 40753. The goal of {{the project}} was to develop {{cost-effective}} analysis tools and techniques for demonstrating and evaluating low-NOx control strategies and their possible impact on boiler performance for boilers firing US coals. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) provided co-funding for this program. This project included research on: (1) In furnace NOx control; (2) Impacts of combustion modifications on boiler operation; (3) Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst testing and (4) Ammonia adsorption/removal on fly ash. Important accomplishments were achieved in all aspects of the project. Rich Reagent Injection (RRI), an in-furnace NOx reduction strategy based on injecting urea or anhydrous ammonia into fuel rich regions in the lower furnace, was evaluated for cyclone-barrel and PC fired utility boilers. Field tests successfully demonstrated the ability of the RRI process to significantly reduce NOx emissions from a staged cyclone-fired furnace operating with overfire air. The field tests also verified the accuracy of the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modeling used to develop the RRI design and highlighted the importance of using CFD modeling to properly locate and configure the reagent injectors within the furnace. Low NOx firing conditions can adversely impact boiler operation due to increased waterwall wastage (corrosion) and increased soot production. A corrosion monitoring system that uses electrochemical noise (ECN) corrosion probes to monitor, on a real-time basis, high temperature corrosion events within the boiler was evaluated. Field tests were successfully conducted at two plants. The Ohio Coal Development Office provided financial assistance to perform the field tests. To investigate soot behavior, an advanced model to predict soot production and destruction was implemented into an existing reacting CFD modeling tool. Comparisons between experimental data collected in a pilot scale furnace and soot behavior predicted by the CFD model showed good agreement. Field and laboratory tests were performed for SCR catalysts used for coal and biomass co-firing applications. Fundamental laboratory studies were performed to better understand mechanisms involved with catalyst deactivation. Field tests with a slip stream reactor were used to create catalyst exposed to boiler flue gas for firing coal and for co-firing coal and biomass. The field data suggests the mechanisms leading to catalyst deactivation are, in order of importance, channel plugging, surface fouling, pore plugging and poisoning. Investigations were performed to better understand the mechanisms involved with catalyst regeneration through mechanical or chemical methods. A computer model was developed to predict NOx reduction across the catalyst in a SCR. Experiments were performed to investigate the fundamentals of ammonia/fly ash interactions with relevance to the operation of advanced NOx control technologies such as selective catalytic reduction. Measurements were performed for ammonia adsorption isotherms on commercial fly ash samples subjected to a variety of treatments and on the chemistry of dry and <b>semi-dry</b> ammonia removal <b>processes.</b> This work resulted in the first fundamental ammonia isotherms on carbon-containing fly ash samples.

40|$|Gas {{cleaning}} {{systems of}} MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) incinerators are characterised {{by the process}} employed to remove acid gases. The commonly used technologies for acid gas removal are: (1) dry treatment with Ca(OH) 2 or (2) with NaHCO 3, (3) <b>semi-dry</b> <b>process</b> with Ca(OH) 2 and (4) wet scrubbing. In some recent plants beside a wet cleaning system, a dry neutralization with Ca(OH) 2 is used. The goal {{is to reduce the}} amount of acid to be removed in the wet treatment and the liquid efﬂuents produced. The inﬂuence of these different technologies on the electrical efﬁciency was investigated by a detailed simulation of a WTE (Waste To Energy) plant with a capacity of about 100, 000 t/y of MSW. The effects of the different gas cleaning systems on electrical efﬁciency were signiﬁcant. The difference of efﬁciency between the most advantageous technology, which is dry treatment with NaHCO 3, and the least advantageous technology which is semi-dry treatment, is about 0. 8 %.

40|$|The <b>semi-dry</b> <b>process</b> for the {{manufacture}} of gypsum-bonded particleboards was suggested by Kossatz. This process offers besides the use of wood particles as additives the possibility of employing annual plants.

Besides phase-analytical investigations regarding the characterization of the binders also the efficacy of various retardants {{as well as the}} influence of the different plant substances on the hydration were determined. Test boards of varying formulas and density were manufactured from annual plants in order to evaluate the suitability of same. The considerably retarded hydration of the gypsum plaster induced by different extracellular substances does not necessarily lead to boards with low strength properties as well as a moderate impairment compulsorily leads to boards with high strength properties.

40|$|In {{response}} to the third Clean Coal Technology Program solicitation, AirPol Inc. submitted a proposal for the design, installation and testing of the Gas Suspension Absorption (GSA) system at Tennessee Valley Authority`s (TVA) Shawnee Test Facility (STF). This low-cost retrofit project will demonstrate the GSA system {{which is expected to}} remove more than 90 % of the SO{sub 2 } from coal-fired flue gas, while achieving a high utilization of reagent lime. The host site facility will be the STF located at the Shawnee Fossil Plant in West Paducah, Kentucky. Over the past 15 years, the STF has served as a testground for flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems. At the present time a <b>semi-dry</b> <b>process</b> employing 10 MW capacity spray dryer is being tested at the facility. Upon completion of the current spray dryer test, the GSA system will be tested for a period of eleven months. The GSA system brings coal combustion gases into contact with a suspended mixture of solids, including sulfur-absorbing lime. After the lime absorbs the sulfur pollutants, the solids are separated from the gases in a cyclone device and recirculated back into the system where they capture additional sulfur pollutant. The cleaned flue gases are sent through a dust collector before being released into the atmosphere. The key to the system`s superior economic performance with high sulfur coals is the recirculation of solids. Typically, a solid particle will pass through the system about one hundred times before leaving the system. Another advantage of the GSA system is that a single spray nozzle is used to inject fresh lime slurry...|$|E
40|$|Cationic starch ethers {{prepared}} by the chemical reaction of starch with a quaternary ammonium reagent are commercially important derivatives. Cationic potato starch derivatives were produced under pilot-scale conditions, employing four different principles. Wet cationisation {{was carried out by}} the slurry and paste processes, in which the cationic reagent and catalyst are added to the starch. Besides being {{prepared by}} these more commonly used processes, cationic starches were also produced by dry cationisation and by adding the cationic reagent during extrusion of starch. The cationic reagent used was 2, 3 epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride. Derivatives with three graded degrees of substitution (DS) between 0. 03 and 0. 12 were prepared by each process. The physical properties of the derivatives were analysed by the following methods: polarised light microscopy, X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), solubility and swelling behaviour, and High-Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography-Multiangle Laser Light Scattering (HPSEC-MALLS). The degree of substitution was determined by high resolution C- 13 -NMR spectroscopy after hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid. The properties of the cationic starch derivatives were highly dependent on the derivatisation method. The granular structure of the starch was not visibly affected by the slurry process. Products from the semi-dry reaction showed some granular damage, which was particularly evident after suspension of the granules in water. In the paste and extrusion processes, the starch granules were completely destroyed. Swelling temperatures and enthalpies can be determined only for starch derivatives that still retain a granular structure. As a result, samples from the paste and extrusion reactions exhibited no swelling endotherm in DSC. The samples from the slurry process showed a shift in the swelling temperature range towards lower temperature and a decrease in swelling enthalpy both as compared to native potato starch and also with increasing DS. Similar behaviour was found for the samples from the <b>semi-dry</b> <b>process.</b> The swelling temperature region was comparable to that of the slurry samples for the same DS but the swelling enthalpy was distinctly lower, indicating that the granular structure of the starch was altered far more by the semi-dry than the slurry process. Swelling in excess water and solubility were affected primarily by the cationisation process, while the influence of DS was of minor importance. The extrusion products had pronounced cold-water solubility, the semi-dry products showed increasing told-water solubility with increasing DS, the paste products were highly swollen in cold water and the slurry products were insoluble in cold water. All products were soluble in hot water but the state of dissolution was different. The molar mass distributions of the samples were determined after dissolution by pressure cooking. The different derivatisation methods resulted in characteristic molar mass distributions. The average molar mass decreased in the order slurry, semi-dry-, paste and extrusion process...|$|E
