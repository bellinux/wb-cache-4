40|$|In recent years, the {{increasing}} interest in energy production from {{renewable energy sources}} has led to photovoltaic elements being placed on greenhouse coverings. The shading of crops by these elements can, however, cause problems regarding {{the normal course of}} agricultural activity. All studies thus far on the application of photovoltaic (PV) panels as a greenhouse covering material have focused on flat roof structures. Tunnel greenhouses, due to their curved shape, do not lend themselves easily to accommodating PV panels on even part of the cover. In this study, we analysed the shading variation inside a tunnel greenhouse that was produced by applying flexible and transparent PV panels in a checkerboard arrangement. The transparent flexible PV panels are manufactured using monocrystalline silicon cells, with an efficiency of 18 %, incorporated into polymers with high resistance. The PV panel dimensions are 1. 116 × 0. 165 m. The simulation software Autodesk® Autocad 2010 ® was used for this study. The variation and distribution of the <b>shading</b> <b>percentage</b> of PV panels were analysed in relation to the surface area affected by the photovoltaic roof, the total area of the greenhouse and the section of the greenhouse. In particular, we studied the variations in the percentage of shading {{and the size of the}} shaded area on the twenty-first day of each month of the year. The results show some regularity in the <b>shading</b> <b>percentage,</b> mainly due to the curvilinear shape of the section of the greenhouse. From mid-March to mid- September, the shading in the middle of the day is almost always inside the greenhouse. In the other months of the year, it is partly inside and partly outside the tunnel greenhouse. With the photovoltaic arrangement adopted, the percentage of shading during the year never exceeds 40 %...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop coefficients (Kc) of tropical forest seedlings over a 135 -day cycle, in the climatic conditions of the Cerrado-Amazon transitional region (11 º 51 &# 8217; 08 &# 8220;S; 55 º 30 &# 8217; 56 &# 8221; W; altitude of 371 m). Five native species (Tabebuia impetiginosa, Tabebuia roseoalba, Handroanthus chrysotrichus, Parkia pendula and Parkia platycephala) and one exotic species (Adenanthera pavonina) were evaluated in seven shading conditions: 35, 50 and 80 % black nets (Polyolefin); green Frontinet®, red ChromatiNet® and blue ChromatiNet® of 50 % shading; and full sun. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was obtained by the Penman-Monteith FAO- 56 method and the crop evapotranspiration of the seedlings (ETc) was given by daily weighing. The Kc values were obtained by dividing ETo by ETc. At 135 DAT, destructive analysis was performed to determine the leaf area. In full sun conditions, ETc varied from 3. 9 (P. pendula) to 5. 0 mm d- 1 (T. roseoalba). The increase in the <b>shading</b> <b>percentage</b> promotes reduction in leaf area, ETc and Kc.

30|$|Studies {{completed}} in the literature to assess the effects of partial shading conditions (PSC) in PV systems take on many different forms. In some studies {{the position of the}} PV modules and obstacles in the environment with respect to the position of the sun at the time of interest are used to map shadows onto the panels [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Other approaches involve using artificial shading conditions to explore the impact of PSC on the PV characteristics [15, 16, 17]. In mapping the shadow onto the modules, some authors [8, 14] consider the effects of direct and diffuse irradiance. Defining obstacles by linear functions and a transmission factor for non-opaque objects is suggested by [10]. The 3 D mapping of shadows can be achieved using the sun’s position and simplified ray tracking with the irradiance on the cell being the averaged shaded and non-shaded irradiance [12]. A PV systems installers guide [11] recommends that close objects provide more direct shading, and therefore a more significant reduction in irradiance, than objects that are far away. The light generated current can be expressed {{as a function of the}} shaded area, photo-current density and shadow transmittance to develop PSC [15]. Shading is represented by a shading strength and <b>shading</b> <b>percentage</b> (representing what portion of the system is shaded) by [16], and as a simple percentage by [17]. The shading impacts can also be assessed by considering how the configuration of modules in a system can reduce the effect of shading from obstacles [18] or due to cloud transients [19]. A recent study into the effect of PSC on PV modules has defined five statements which define typical behaviours of PSC [20]. These statements lead to two hypotheses for predicting the number of local maximum power points (MPPs). Other recent work has combined a sky map with a sensitivity map for PV modules that have reflectors to estimate incident irradiance composed of reflected light, direct light and scattered light [21]. These results show good prediction of incident irradiance, however the method has greater complexity than the method adopted in this paper.|$|E

40|$|Trees cast shade on {{homes and}} buildings, {{lowering}} the inside temperatures and thus reducing demand for power to cool these buildings during hot {{times of the}} year. Drawing from a large sample of residences in Auburn, Alabama, we develop a statistical model that produces specific estimates of the electricity savings generated by shade-producing trees in a suburban environment. This empirical model links residential energy consumption during peak summer (winter) months to average energy consumption during non-summer/non-winter months, behaviors of the occupants, and the extent, density, and timing of shade cast on the structures. Our estimates reveal that tree shade generally is associated with reduced (increased) electricity consumption in the summertime (wintertime).

40|$|Aquatic macrophytes are the {{flowering}} plants and larger algae growing submerged in or emerging from water. Macrophytes are {{an essential component}} of riverine ecosystems: they produce oxygen, filter out sediments and pollutants and provide habitat and food sources for invertebrates, fish and mammals. The Macquarie and South Esk Rivers in Tasmania are the largest rivers of the northern central plain, and are unique in Tasmania in having long stretches of relatively stable and abundant macrophytic vegetation along their mid- to lower reaches. The macrophyte communities of the mid- to lower reaches of the two rivers are described by classification into groups with similar species composition. Significant environmental variation between groups is determined. Depth, substrate type and distance upstream are the environmental factors most strongly associated with variation between the distribution of individual species/species assemblages. Distance upstream, <b>percentage</b> <b>shading,</b> river form, stream width, substrate type and bank height are the factors most strongly associated with variation between groups of sites. Bank vegetation type, distance upstream, <b>percentage</b> <b>shading,</b> level of stock damage and stream width are found to be the environmental factors most strongly associated with differences in richness and diversity. <b>Percentage</b> <b>shading</b> and bank vegetation type are the factors most strongly associated with differences in cover.

40|$|Nowadays cattle {{are often}} used in landscaping. Because cattle are {{sensitive}} to thermal discomfort, {{it is important to}} protect them if necessary. Legislation on this matter is however blurry and the knowledge on the relationship between shelter and climate conditions is limited. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate if cattle grazing in nature reserves in weather conditions that could potentially cause thermal discomfort, look for shade more or make use of specific areas on the terrain. The study took place in a nature reserve of 18. 74 ha, between August and November. Thirteen animals of a local double purpose breed (Kempisch Roodbont) were included in the study. Observations were carried out by a single observer between 8 am and 8 pm. Animal behavior was individually observed according to a scan sampling procedure, and the place of each animal was registered for every scan. The amount of <b>shade</b> <b>percentage</b> of the grazing location was estimated by the observer at the start of each observation, and weather conditions (temperature, humidity, temperature-humidity-index or THI) were registered on each observation day. When THI was lower, cattle grazed in areas with short grass (P < 0. 001), when THI rose they grazed in wetter areas and when THI was highest, they looked up wet wooded areas (P = 0. 027). When THI was higher, they also stood in the shade more (P < 0. 001). As a conclusion, cattle used the opportunity to either look up the shade or go to wetter areas of the nature reserve when THI rose. It is therefore important to provide shaded and/or wetter areas when they are kept outdoors (e. g. for landscaping) during warm weather conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of the Thesis {{consists}} of a research on topics related to Solar Energy, PV technologies and Materials used as part of active solar structures (from the active materials to substrates) as well as their integration in the form of custom shapes. The analysis of these topics reveals the potential of new and emerging PV technologies, which combine very lightweight and flexible characteristics, with a very good performance in partial shading and diffuse light conditions, but most importantly a very high price reduction potential due to specific fabrication methods and materials. In a next step a (four phase) Methodology is developed in order to observe how the process of shaping a three dimensional PV structure in order to increase its surface area per facade space can lead to performance advantages compared to conventional flat and rigid PV structures. This part consists of a first phase, where possible light control/shading systems are compared according to specific requirements related to shading efficiency but more importantly to PV integration potential and PV surface increase potential. The second phase is a shape research in terms of Surface Area Potential and a comparison between 3 d shapes using parametric tools. Thereby the ability of different shapes with various folding or curvature patterns to increase their surface for predefined total dimensions is evaluated. The results lead to structures which can provide much more active PV area for a given facade area. The third phase is a solar analysis of 56 of the three dimensional shapes tested and compared in phase 2. Thereby the real average solar radiation reaching the surface of various prismatic or corrugated 3 d patterns is calculated and graphically presented. Incident Solar Energy values and partial <b>shading</b> <b>percentages</b> within every shape clearly illustrate which 3 d shapes have the highest potential for making maximum use of solar radiation. The relation between surface area increase through denser folding or curving patterns and total received solar energy constitutes the most important finding of this phase. In a fourth phase Laboratory tests are performed at the PV-LAB of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering TUDelft. Different 3 d shape versions are tested using flexible Thin Film solar panels. The fact that solar cells performance (output) does not decrease linearly proportional to partial shading and total incident solar energy changes makes real Lab Tests an import- ant verification of the solar analysis results. Finally the best performing shapes are used as the basis to create design proposals {{in the form of a}} light control/shading device.

40|$|A control {{decision}} rule for European chafer, Rhizotrogus (Amphimallon) majalis (Razoumowsky), larvae infesting turfgrass was developed {{using data from}} 317 residential sites. Larvae were often abundant enough to cause damage to turf in portions (patches) of properties when average density over an entire site was much less than a damage threshold of 5 - 10 grubs per 950 cm 2. To account for this, an empirical relationship between {{the size of the}} largest patch of European chafer larvae at a site and site-wide density was used {{in the development of the}} {{decision rule}}. Properties with a patch of grubs in excess of ≍ 30 m 2 were deemed to require insecticide treatment. Site characteristics (lawn age, <b>shade,</b> and <b>percentage</b> of Kentucky bluegrass) were related to site-wide density and this relationship was used to formulate a risk assessment system. This system is used to determine whether a site should be sampled or not. Properties that are not sampled are not to be treated. Other treatment decisions are based on the outcome of sampling. The relationship between site-wide density and patch size did not allow clear identification of a density that could be used as a threshold in a sampling program. Therefore, several sampling plans were constructed that classified density according to different threshold values. Operating characteristic functions were used in combination with the aforementioned relationship between density and patch size to calculate two types of errors for each sampling plan: the probability of not treating when treatment was necessary and the probability of treating when treatment was not required. Based on these error functions, a threshold of 0. 25 grubs per ll-cm diameter turf plug was advocated.

We compare species ricliness of birds, fruit-feeding {{butterflies}} and ground-foraging ants along a coffee intensification gradient {{represented by a}} {{reduction in the number of}} species of <b>shade</b> trees and <b>percentage</b> of <b>shade</b> cover in coffee plantations. We sampled the three taxa in the same plots within the same period of time. Two sites were selected in the Soconusco region of the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Within each site four habitat types were selected and within each habitat type four points were randomly selected. The habitat types were forest, rustic coffee, diverse shade coffee, and intensive coffee (low density of shade). We found different responses of the three taxa along the intensification gradient. While ants and butterflies generally decrease in species richness with the decrease of shade cover, birds declined in one site but increased in the other. Ant species richness appears to be more resistant to habitat modification, while butterfly species richness appears to be more sensitive. Bird species richness was correlated with distance from forest fragments but not with habitat type, suggesting that scale and landscape structure may be important for more mobile taxa. For each of these taxa, the rustic plantation was the one that maintained species richness most similar to the forest. We found no correlation between the three taxa, suggesting that none of these taxa are good candidates as surrogates for each other.

Factors consisted of cattle being fed in facilities with or without wind barriers and with or without shade. Steers were fed dry-relied corn-based diets (1. 43 Mcal/ kg, NEg). Mean starting date and days on feed were June 26 and 79, respectively. I;I unshaded areas, temperature and humidity averaged 21. 6 degrees C and 77. 9 %, and the blackglobe-humidity index (BGHI) at 1500 averaged between 84. 0 and 89. 1. Each of four 6. 1 - x 6. 1 -m structures (mean height = 3. 4 m) with white steel roofs provided shade (2. 65 m(2) /steer) for two pens. In facilities with wind barriers provided, airflow was reduced {{from the north and}} northwest by a 25 -m-wide shelterbelt containing six rows of trees. For cattle fed in pens with wind barriers, shade increased(P <. 05) gain from 0 to 56 d and decreased (P <. 05) DMI/ADG from 0 to 28 d. Differences (P <. 05) in performance were not found between shaded and unshaded cattle in any portion of the feeding period for cattle fed in the pens without wind barriers and over the entire feeding period in either type of facility. The shade response in pens with wind barriers seemed to be greater the Ist yr than in subsequent years. Differences in weather patterns among years, especially air temperature, humidity, and solar radiation, may partially explain this interaction. Also, in yr I, cattle tended to have greater fat thickness at finish than in yr 2 and 3. Correlations between BGHI and DMI tended to be greater during the early portion of the trial(0 to 28 d) than over the entire trial. Correlations between the difference in BGHI under shade vs no <b>shade</b> and <b>percentage</b> of <b>shade</b> use had the greatest magnitude and were significant only in the first 28 d vs over the entire feeding period. Although no heat-related cattle deaths occurred in this study, results suggest that shade improves cattle performance in the summer when they are fed in facilities with winter wind protection available and have not become acclimated to hot conditions. Once cattle are acclimated or hot conditions subside, compensation by unshaded cattle offsets much of the initial benefits of providing shade...|$|R
40|$|While {{there has}} been much focus in {{biodiversity}} conservation that transcends place, few studies transcend time. Yet an appreciation of vegetational and hydrological succession is essential for maintaining a habitat that has been created with the aim of conserving a particular group of organisms. This is a study of changes in a dragonfly assemblage over a period of 13 years at a biodiversity-rich, southern hemisphere reservoir. A total of 30 dragonfly species were recorded in this study, compared to 12 species before the reservoir was constructed in 1988, and 26 species in 1993, with 25 species resident in both 1993 and 2001. Two of these are local endemics. One other endemic was lost to succession in 1993 but reappeared in 2001. Three other species never reappeared after succession in 1993, yet six other species appeared after this date. Multivariate analyses identified structural and compositional vegetation, especially marginal forest, percentage vegetation cover, <b>percentage</b> <b>shade,</b> as the most important environmental variables determining dragonfly species composition. Other important environmental variables were grasses of tall, medium and short height categories, submerged vegetation, water flow and amount of open water. Not surprisingly, successional changes in vegetation physiognomy and in water conditions significantly increased Odonata species richness and diversity over the years. More importantly, the study shows that to maintain both high species richness, including endemics, it is essential to maintain a variety of biotopes using selective management of the marginal vegetation without allowing succession to proceed to a point where overgrowth of the bank and silting of the bottom begin to impoverish the fauna. © Springer 2005.

40|$|We compare species {{richness}} of birds, fruit-feeding butterflies and ground-foraging ants along a coffee intensification gradient {{represented by a}} {{reduction in the number of}} species of <b>shade</b> trees and <b>percentage</b> of <b>shade</b> cover in coffee plantations. We sampled the three taxa in the same plots within the same period of time. Two sites were selected in the Soconusco region of the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Within each site four habitat types were selected and within each habitat type four points were randomly selected. The habitat types were forest, rustic coffee, diverse shade coffee, and intensive coffee (low density of shade). We found different responses of the three taxa along the intensification gradient. While ants and butterflies generally decrease in {{species richness}} with the decrease of shade cover, birds declined in one site but increased in the other. Ant species richness appears to be more resistant to habitat modification, while butterfly species richness appears to be more sensitive. Bird species richness was correlated with distance from forest fragments but not with habitat type, suggesting that scale and landscape structure may be important for more mobile taxa. For each of these taxa, the rustic plantation was the one that maintained species richness most similar to the forest. We found no correlation between the three taxa, suggesting that none of these taxa are good candidates as surrogates for each other. We discuss the implications of these results for the conservation of biodiversity in coffee plantations, in particular, the importance of distinguishing between different levels of shade, and the possibility that different taxa might be responding to habitat changes at different spatial scales...|$|R
40|$|Awareness in {{the eyes}} of the public is {{important}} for involving the wider community in conservation. A dragonfly awareness trail was developed and implemented in the year 2000 at a national botanical garden in South Africa. Such a trail is not likely to always have the same number of dragonfly species either throughout the year or from one year to the next. The aim was to assess dragonfly assemblage changes that occurred along the trail over 3 years, so as to fine-tune expectations that the public may have as regards species to be seen at any particular time. A cumulative species variance for species and speciesenvironmental relations, strongly indicated that certain measured site variables were responsible for the main variation in dragonfly species patterns over time. Habitat requirements of an odonate species may be defined primarily in terms of marginal grasses, floating and submerged vegetation, marginal herbs, sedges and reeds, and pH. Additional variables were <b>percentage</b> <b>shade,</b> exposed rock, marginal forest and water flow characteristics. Both dragonfly species richness and abundance changed over the 3 years. One of the reasons for this was a single, major disturbance, in the form of dredging the reservoir site to reverse ecological succession in 2002. Despite an impact such as this, and after accounting for vagrancy, there were in all 24 'core resident species' still to be seen along the trail from January to May. Another 11 species, including two migrants and one species lost temporarily to dredging disturbance, can be considered only as 'possibilities' on any one visit. Assurance that the 24 core species can be seen in the summer months (although only three in winter) is essential for maintaining the bona fide of such a trail, and hence conservation awareness, {{in the eyes}} of the public. © 2006 Springer.

40|$|Elevation {{and climate}} are interrelated {{variables}} {{which have a}} profound affect on biota. Flying insects such as dragonflies can rapidly disperse and optimal habitat conditions at appropriate elevations. Such behaviour {{is likely to be}} especially important in geographical areas which are subject to major climatic events such as El Niño. Accordingly, we studied dragonflies and environmental variables in a series of reservoirs over an elevational range of 100 – 1350 m a. s. l. at the same latitude on the eastern seaboard of South Africa. The aim was to determine how elevation and climate (as regional processes), as well as local factors, influence species assemblage variability, habitat preference and phenology. Certain environmental variables strongly explained the main variation in species assemblage. These included local factors such as pH, marginal grasses, <b>percentage</b> <b>shade,</b> exposed rock, marginal forest and to a lesser extent, marshes and flow. Different species showed various tolerance levels to these variables. Elevation and climate as regional processes had very little influence on dragonfly assemblages in comparison with these environmental factors. These odonate species are essentially sub-tropical, and are similar to their tropical counterparts in that they have long flight periods with overlapping generations. Yet they also have temperate characteristics such as over-wintering mostly as larvae. These results indicate evolutionary adaptations from both temperate and tropical regions. Furthermore, most were also widespread and opportunistic habitat generalists. The national endemics Pseudagrion citricola and Africallagma sapphirinum only occurred at high elevations. However, the endemic Agriocnemis falcifera was throughout all elevations, suggesting regional endemism does not necessarily equate to elevational intolerance. Overall, the results suggest that many millennia of great climatic variation have led to a highly vagile and elevation-tolerant dragonfly assemblage which readily occupies new water bodies. Such an assemblage is likely to be highly tolerant of global climate change, so long as there is sufficient water to keep the reservoirs at a constant level...|$|R

40|$|Os transtornos psicoticos, de um modo geral, e em especial a esquizofrenia, exercem um impacto patente na qualidade de vida do individuo com estes sintomas, afetando seu bemestar, sua ocupacao profissional e sua relacao com a comunidade. Quanto mais cedo se inicia o tratamento, mais breve pode ocorrer a reintegracao dessa pessoa na sociedade, porem sua eficacia depende do diagnostico precoce para que seja possivel a intervencao caso a caso. O estudo do Rorschach, como instrumento de investigacao da personalidade, pode auxiliar neste processo devido ao seu amplo escopo de aplicacoes. A maior parte dos estudos sobre as pessoas com sintomas psicoticos trata da esquizofrenia, porem poucas publicacoes pesquisaram os pacientes ainda proximos ao surto e com efeito minimo da medicacao, alem de poucos estudos estabelecerem a comparacao com um grupo de individuos normais. A presente pesquisa propos-se a enfocar estes dois aspectos: o estudo de individuos proximos ao surto psicotico que os levou a procurar pela primeira vez uma instituicao de saude e sua comparacao com um grupo controle. Assim, o grupo {{experimental}} foi composto de vinte pessoas que procuraram uma instituicao de saude entre maio de 2004 e marco de 2005 e que moravam ha pelo menos 6 meses na area delimitada pelo projeto. Os participantes do grupo controle foram pareados individualmente por vizinhanca, faixa etaria e sexo; desta forma concentrando-os em regioes geograficas relevantes e demograficamente representativas para a comparacao. A coleta de dados foi realizada em duas entrevistas, a primeira para familiarizacao do participante com a pesquisadora e a segunda para a aplicacao do Rorschach. A analise dos dados se deu quantitativamente, segundo o Sistema Frances. O Metodo de Rorschach mostrou-se sensivel a diferencas entre os dois grupos estudados. Os resultados obtidos com os sujeitos do grupo experimental, em relacao ao grupo controle, foram significativos quanto ao menor percentual de respostas de forma bem vista, menor quantidade de respostas de tonalidade e menor percentual de respostas de conteudo animal. A analise destes indices em conjunto com outros fatores do Rorschach sugeriu uma dificuldade maior das pessoas com sintomas psicoticos no contato com os outros decorrente da introjecao inadequada de estereotipos sociais, da nao diferenciacao entre realidade interna e externa e de um processo de identificacao fragilizado permeado pela angustia de desintegracao. Este projeto esta associado a um projeto maior intitulado Estudos de Casos Incidentes (Primeiro Contato com Servicos de Saude) de Psicoses Funcionais no Brasil, que esta sendo realizado por equipe do Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo (HC FMUSP), na tentativa de caracterizar, acompanhar e comparar os casos de transtornos psicoticos na cidade de Sao Paulo com um estudo semelhante feito em Londres, Reino UnidoThe psychotic disorders, as a whole, and specially schizophrenia, inflict an evident {{impact upon}} oneś life quality with such symptoms, affecting his well-being, professional affairs and {{relationship with the}} community. The earlier treatment starts, the sooner this person can be reintegrated into society, albeit itś effectiveness depends upon early diagnosis for intervention to be possible {{on a case by}} case basis. The study of Rorschach as an instrument for personality assessment can help on this process due to its wide scope of applications. Most researches about individuals with psychotic symptoms are about schizophrenia, however only few publishings have studied patients still near the psychotic episode and under minimal medication, and few researches established a comparative study between afflicted population and healthy one. The current research aim was twofold in the study of individuals near the psychotic episode which resulted in his first-admission in a mental health care facility and comparison with control group. Thus, experimental group consisted of twenty individuals that were first admitted to a mental health care service between may (2004) and march (2005), that have lived in the research delimited area for at least 6 months. Control group participants were likened by neighborhood, age range and gender; this way concentrating them on both demographically representative and relevant geographic regions for comparison. Data was obtained by means of two interviews, being the first one in order to familiarize participant and researcher, and the second one to administer Rorschach test. Only quantitative analysis was performed, scored according to the French System. Rorschach Method presented sensibility to discrepancies among both researched groups. There was statistically significant differences between experimental group and comparison group with regard to lower percentage of good quality form responses, lower scores of <b>shading</b> responses, lower <b>percentage</b> of animal responses. The analisys of those three items along with other Rorschach scores suggests that people with psychotic symptoms present greater difficulties to relate with others due to introjection of inadequate social stereotypes, no differentiation from internal and external reality, and weakened identification process permeated by desintegration anguish. This project is associated to a larger project entitled Estudos de Casos Incidentes (Primeiro Contato com Servicos de Saude) de Psicoses Funcionais no Brasil, which is being conducted by the Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo (HC FMUSP) research team, in an attempt to profile, study and compare psychosis affliction cases in Sao Paulo city with similar studies being carried in London, United Kingdo...|$|R
