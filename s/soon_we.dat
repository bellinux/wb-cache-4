As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E

500|$|The United Kingdom did {{not have}} the {{manpower}} or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart and was dwarfed by it.

500|$|This disastrously {{affected}} British {{efforts as}} they lacked manpower, facilities, equipment and materials. Tube Alloys therefore fell {{behind in the}} race with the Manhattan Project.

By the time Great Britain realised it, the position had worsened; Bush decided that outside help for the Manhattan Project was no longer needed. The Military Policy Committee (MPC) supported Bush's arguments and restricted access to the classified information which Britain could utilise to develop its atomic weapons programme, even if it slowed down the American efforts.|$|E

500|$|Yet the United Kingdom did {{not have}} the {{manpower}} or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart and was dwarfed by it. Britain was spending around £430,000 per year on research and development, and Metropolitan-Vickers was building gaseous diffusion units for uranium enrichment worth £150,000; but the Manhattan Project was spending £8,750,000 on research and development, and had let construction contracts worth £100,000,000 at the fixed wartime rate of four dollars to the pound. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised [...] the prime minister, Winston Churchill, that: [...] "We must face the fact that... pioneering work... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped.

500|$|Following the match, Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{claimed that}} the gesture he made had been {{intended}} for the media and not Liverpool fans: [...] "The signal of close your mouth was not for them but for the press, they speak too much and in my opinion they try to do everything to disturb Chelsea. Wait, don't speak too <b>soon.</b> <b>We</b> lost two matches and in my opinion you (the media) try to take confidence from us and put pressure on us." [...] Mourinho was happy that Chelsea had won but said the victory was not special: [...] "It's just one more. I had a few before this, I'm very happy to win. It's important for the fans, for the club and especially for the players." [...] Striker Eiður Guðjohnsen said Chelsea's victory was down to their hard work ethic: [...] "It was a very intense and even game {{and it was hard}} to break them down, but hard work pays off in the end." ...|$|E

Turlington said of the album: I went to friends first, as I did with the first CD. Bono and Chris Martin were great supporters of the project the first time around, and when I knew I wanted to include men on this album they were obvious choices. They are also both fathers to daughters.

500|$|Chelsea manager Mourinho was {{primarily}} concerned with the fitness of his squad {{in the aftermath of}} the match, in particular Ballack, who was substituted with an injury early in the match: [...] "He had a kick in the muscle and he couldn't run but I hope he will be back <b>soon,</b> <b>we</b> have quite a few players not in condition and we need players back, so I hope it's not a big deal." [...] He felt that the fitness of the two squads was the decisive factor in the match: [...] "Today our bench was not very good, with some kids, Liverpool could inject fresh blood at the same time as some of my players became really tired. They were broken. They were in better condition than us, you could see the difference between Frank Lampard and Sissoko." [...] Mourinho was also unconcerned about his team's form heading into the start of the season: [...] "Liverpool had more intensity and pace, qualities that make a team better. They had that and we didn't. We had a big percentage of the ball possession, but Liverpool defended with intensity and looked dangerous when they counter-attacked. I keep saying they are a difficult team to beat and they can go to every game with an ambition to win. They are a good team but over 10 months of competition we will be there." ...|$|E
500|$|The British and Americans {{exchanged}} nuclear {{information but}} did not initially combine their efforts. Britain rebuffed attempts by Bush and Conant in 1941 to strengthen cooperation with its own project, codenamed Tube Alloys, because it was reluctant to share its technological lead and help the United States develop its own atomic bomb. An American scientist who brought a personal letter from Roosevelt to Churchill offering {{to pay for all}} research and development in an Anglo-American project was poorly treated, and Churchill did not reply to the letter. The United States as a result decided as early as April 1942 that if its offer was rejected, they should proceed alone. The British, who had made significant contributions early in the war, did not have the resources to carry through such a research program while fighting for their survival. As a result, Tube Alloys soon fell behind its American counterpart. and on 30 July 1942, Sir John Anderson, the minister responsible for Tube Alloys, advised Churchill that: [...] "We must face the fact that... pioneering work... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' <b>Soon</b> <b>we</b> shall have little or none." [...] That month Churchill and Roosevelt made an informal, unwritten agreement for atomic collaboration.|$|E
500|$|By 2001, {{the project}} had become {{stranded}} in development hell. In a Q panel at Comic-Con 2007, Gaiman remarked, [...] "I'd rather see no Sandman movie made than a bad Sandman movie. But I {{feel like the}} time for a Sandman movie is coming <b>soon.</b> <b>We</b> need someone who has the same obsession with the source material as Peter Jackson had with Lord of the Rings or Sam Raimi had with Spider-Man." [...] That same year, he stated that he could imagine Terry Gilliam as a director for the adaptation: [...] "I would always give anything to Terry Gilliam, forever, so if Terry Gilliam ever wants to do Sandman then as far as I'm concerned Terry Gilliam should do Sandman." [...] In 2013, DC President Diane Nelson said that a Sandman film would be as rich as the Harry Potter universe. David S. Goyer announced in an interview in early December that he would be producing an adaptation of the graphic novel, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Neil Gaiman. Jack Thorne was hired to write the script. On October 16, 2014, Gaiman clarified that while the film was not announced with the DC slate by Warner Bros., it would instead be distributed by Vertigo and announced with those slate of films. Goyer told Deadline.com in an interview that the studio was very happy with the film's script. According to Deadline.com, the film was to be distributed by New Line Cinema. In October 2015, Goyer revealed that a new screenwriter was being brought on board to revise the script by Jack Thorne and stated that he believed the film would go into production the following year. In March 2016, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Eric Heisserer was hired to rewrite the film's script. The next day, Gordon-Levitt announced that he had dropped out due to disagreements with the studio over the creative direction of the film. On November 9, 2016, i09 reported that Heisserer had turned in his draft of the script but left the film, stating that the film should be an HBO series instead.|$|E
