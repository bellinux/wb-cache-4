5|$|At 05:30 on 22 May, the Anglo-Egyptian advance continued, but {{the nature}} of the country, which {{consisted}} mainly of rolling low level sand-hills, with plenty of concealed ground and scattered bushes, reduced visibility down to just a few hundred yards. From the start, large groups of Fur camaliers and cavalry were observed. <b>So</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> sending out his scouts Kelly formed an advance guard of the mounted infantry, a camel company and four Maxim machine guns. At 10:30, the Fur troops were observed in a strong entrenched position around the village of Beringia.|$|E
5|$|Building {{began in}} 1909, using oak from the estate, {{metalwork}} from local blacksmiths, and stone quarried locally, {{brought to the}} site by a private railway line. Barnsley insisted that no machines would be used, <b>so</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> using a saw powered by steam engine, the wood was hand-sawn in a saw pit. The east wing was completed by 1915, and the Biddulphs moved into them, with the reception rooms finished around the same time. Despite {{the grandeur of the}} building, the Biddulph's lived in some small rooms and fitted the large reception rooms for community use. Biddulph also built some cottages {{at the site of the}} old manor house at Rodmarton around the same time.|$|E
5|$|One of Duigan's most {{significant}} changes {{resulted in the}} downsizing of the Territorial Force (TF), which was already {{in a state of}} decline. Current recruitment was insufficient to support the theoretical infantry division and three mounted rifle brigades that the TF mobilisation plans called for. Duigan downsized the division to a brigade group and three lots of fortress troops centred around Auckland, Wellington, and Lyttelton. Many infantry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted as battalions, while the mounted regiments were each reduced {{to the size of a}} squadron. Several senior officers were placed in retirement as well. The morale of the TF declined as the remaining senior officers raised concerns—disregarded by Duigan—over the state of the army. Four TF colonels publicly protested the reforms in the press in what became known as the Four Colonels' Revolt. This was a breach of military regulations, which prohibited military personnel from communicating with journalists unless they had permission to do <b>so.</b> <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> a court-martial, which he feared would generate public sympathy for the colonels, Duigan placed all four officers on the retired list as punishment. The revolt did result in greater public awareness of the poor state of New Zealand's military but little was done to rectify the situation.|$|E

5|$|The Earl of Oxford, {{commanding}} {{the right wing}} of the Neville army, broke the opposing Yorkist line, under William, Lord Hastings, early in the battle. Oxford's men proceeded to chase the fleeing soldiers, and ended up looting away from the battlefield. Oxford managed to regroup his men, but, returning to the battlefield, as James Ross has put it, 'disaster struck.' In the time he and his force had been absent, the line of battle had shifted almost ninety degrees, <b>so</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> returning to attack Edward's rear, he crashed into Montagu's section. The fog prevented identification, and Oxford's men fought with Montagu's. Montagu may, one chronicler suggests, have mistakenly seen Oxford's 'Streaming star' banner as the king's 'Sunne in splendour,' and thus believe that the Earl had gone over to York. Recently though, one historian has pointed out that, in fact, Oxford had never previously used such a cognizance, and it was more prosaically just a case of men confused by fog.|$|E

Hamilcar won several minor victories, shrugged off failures and with his immunity to defeat, kept the Carthaginian cause alive. After six years of harassment, the bankrupt and near exhausted Roman state borrowed money from its citizens to create a fleet and defeated the Carthaginians at sea to end the First Punic War.|$|E

25|$|For Major League baseball, the Metrodome {{was widely}} {{thought of as}} a hitter's park, with a low (7ft) left-field fence (343ft) that favored {{right-handed}} power hitters, and the higher (23ft) but closer (327ft) right-field Baggie that favored left-handed power hitters. Because the roof is very nearly the same color as a baseball, and transmits light, the Metrodome had a far higher error incidence than a normal stadium during day games, <b>so</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> losing a fly ball in the sun, as is common for non-roofed stadiums, fly balls could easily get lost in the ceiling.

The restarts offered constitute the mechanisms available for recovering from error; the selection of restart by the condition handler supplies the policy.|$|E
25|$|The VPN, however, were deterred {{from attacking}} Namyit Island {{because they had}} lost the element of surprise, {{as well as the}} strong {{presence}} of several RVN frigates surrounding that island. <b>So,</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> attacking Namyit, the North Vietnamese selected Sand Cay as their next target. On the night of April 24, under the observation of the Taiwanese military, VPN transport ships sailed in a single column passed the Taiwanese-occupied island of Itu Aba towards their next objective. Again, following the same pattern of operation, the ships anchored near Sand Cay and prepared for their assault. At 1.30am on April 25, 1975, three platoons from the 126th Battalion successfully landed on Sand Cay. One hour later, they opened their attack and the ARVN were easily defeated, suffering 2 deaths and 23 captured.|$|E

In 1552 Kamran Mirza {{attempted to make}} a pact with Islam Shah, Sher Shah's successor, but was apprehended by a Gakhar. The Gakhars {{were one of the}} minority of tribal groups who had consistently remained loyal to their oath to the Mughals. Sultan Adam of the Gakhars handed Kamran Mirza over to Humayun. Humayun was inclined to forgive his brother. However he was warned that allowing Kamran Mirza's repeated acts of treachery to go unpunished could foment rebellion amongst his own supporters. <b>So,</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> killing his brother, Humayun had Kamran Mirza blinded which would end any claim by the latter to the throne. Humayun sent Kamran Mirza on Hajj, as he hoped to see his brother thereby absolved of his offences. However Kamran Mirza died close to Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula in 1557.|$|E
25|$|After {{the clash}} at Boitzenburg, Hohenlohe {{knew that the}} French were on the Berlin highway, which went {{northeast}} from Zehdenick to Prenzlau. <b>So</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> continuing on the Lychen-Boitzenburg-Prenzlau road, which intersected with the Berlin highway, he veered northeast to Schönermark-Nordwestuckermark. At 4:00 AM on 28 October and the column reached Schönermark, only eight kilometers from Prenzlau. Hohenlohe held a council of war at which the officers argued whether to march east to Prenzlau or to go north to Pasewalk. A cavalry vedette reported that Prenzlau was clear of the French at 6:00 AM, so the march continued, though three hours were wasted before getting underway. It {{was very difficult to}} get the column moving again and angry protests were heard from the starving soldiers. Schwerin led the column with a cuirassier regiment and a battery of horse artillery. The bulk of the infantry trailed behind Schwerin's vanguard and Oberst Prince Augustus of Prussia led the rear guard, which consisted of a cavalry regiment and an infantry battalion. Two dragoon regiments protected the right flank.|$|E
25|$|Problematic point(s): the {{resulting}} very long words {{are difficult to}} comprehend, <b>so</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> rephrasing them, people tend to write them separately. In addition, it is debated whether these forms occasionally written in one word should be allowed, because this form only shows the highest relationship {{at the expense of}} an easy-to-read overview of the other parts. (One of the OH. authors, Attila Mártonfi noted: the inscription forgalmi rend változás ‘change in traffic regulations’ is easier to read if written in three words rather than the regular form created with the mobility rules, forgalmirend-változás.) Sometimes this rule is ignored even in the title of linguistic books, such as Magyar nyelvtörténet (‘Hungarian historical linguistics,’ lit. “Hungarian language history”), which should be written Magyarnyelv-történet, to reflect that it is not historical linguistics in Hungarian language, but the historical linguistics of the Hungarian language. It may also cause problems when the involved elements are proper names, such as Nap–Föld-távolság ‘Sun–Earth distance,’ because the dashes and hyphens follow a different rule in this case (see the part on punctuation).|$|E

25|$|The fixed JG wage {{provides}} an in-built inflation control mechanism. Mitchell (1998) called {{the ratio of}} JG employment to total employment the buffer employment ratio (BER). The BER conditions the overall rate of wage demands. When the BER is high, real wage demands will be correspondingly lower. If inflation exceeds the government’s announced target, tighter fiscal and monetary policy would be triggered to increase the BER, which entails workers transferring from the inflating sector to the fixed price JG sector. Ultimately this attenuates the inflation spiral. <b>So</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> a buffer stock of unemployed being used to discipline the distributional struggle, the JG policy achieves this via compositional shifts in employment. Replacing the current non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), the BER that results in stable inflation is called the non-accelerating inflation buffer employment ratio (NAIBER) (Mitchell 1998). It is a full employment steady state JG level, which is dependent {{on a range of}} factors including the path of the economy. There is an issue about the validity of an unchanging nominal anchor in an inflationary environment. The JG wage would be adjusted in line with productivity growth to avoid changing real relativities. Its viability as a nominal anchor relies on the fiscal authorities reining in any private wage-price pressures.|$|E
25|$|The {{victory of}} Nagysalló, brought with itself serious results. It {{opened the way}} towards Komárom, {{bringing}} its relieving to {{just a couple of}} days distance.

He also wrote that the spirit of the imperial troops is very low, and because of this they cannot fight another battle for a while, without suffering another defeat. So the next day he ordered the evacuation of Pest, leaving an important garrison in the fortress of Buda, to defend it against the Hungarian attacks. He ordered to Jelačić to remain for a while in Pest, and than to retreat towards Eszék in Bácska where the Serbian insurgents, allied with the Austrians were in a grave situation after the victories of the Hungarian armies led by Mór Perczel and Józef Bem.|$|E
25|$|Görgey {{who after}} the battle of Győr {{installed}} his headquarters in the city, at 11 April gave order to the III. corps of Damjanich, at the 12th to Klapka's I. corps to advance towards Léva. Their place in Vác {{was taken by the}} VII. corps under András Gáspár, than after they too departed on the same way, their place in Vác was taken by the division of György Kmety. At 15–17 April the Hungarian army consisting of the I. corps led by General György Klapka, III. corps led by General János Damjanich, and two divisions of the VII. corps led by General András Gáspár arrived to the Garam river, under the overall leadership of General Artúr Görgei. Here, on 19 April, at Nagysalló, they met with the troops of Lieutenant General Ludwig von Wohlgemuth with the new imperial troops gathered in the following Habsburg Hereditary Lands: Styria, Bohemia, Moravia and the capital Vienna, and strengthened with the Jablonowski division (which participated 10 days before in the Battle of Vác).
