In order to be independent on the clamp that can guarantee the exact position of drill bit blade for photography, and reduce the cost of the AOI system, an image registration method is used to align the drill bit blade, which can also make the feature extraction much easier.

40|$|The Indian Deepsea Experiment (INDEX) was intiated in 1995, {{with the}} {{objective}} of predicting the environmental impact of nodule mining, in the Central Indian Basin. More than 20 scientists and technical staff of the National Institute of Oceanography have undertaken multi-disciplinary research on geological, biologica, physical and chemical parameters in 5 preselected areas leading to determination of the baseline conditions and selection of 2 areas as test and reference areas. Temperature and currents in the water column were also measured for different seasons from deepsea moorings deployed in the area. A benthic disturbance was simulated with a hydrautic device in an area of 3000 x 200 m over a period of 9 days during August 1997, resuspending more than 6000 cu m. of sediment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore navigational and image-making methods in a context where maps and formal address systems have been minimally consulted in recent years. This investigation is approached by way of a research-based art project on subjective cartography, which was carried out from 2009 to 2010 during a Fulbright fellowship to Amman, Jordan. The project examines the mutability of a specific location as well as its relationship between obsolescence in cartographic resources and the photographic medium. By reaching out to Ammani residents for informal tours of the city, selected guides were asked to narrate their experiences of navigating the city by memory and then directed to point out key landmarks during this process. Later, these tours were re-memorized and landmarks were photographed as a representation of the afterimage to capture high-quality still images {{through the use of a}} large-format <b>photographic</b> <b>device.</b> These afterimages are not intended to serve as documents or memorials of Amman but rather as ruminations on the faculties of memory in an ever-changing environment.

40|$|Description of the subject. Alginate beads that release {{semiochemical}} compounds {{are interesting}} biological control devices used {{to attract the}} natural enemies of aphids in infested crops. Little information, however, is available {{about the impact of}} climatic factors on the release of semiochemicals from this diffusive system. Objectives. The objective of this scoping study was to investigate the impact of temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, on the release of E-β-caryophyllene from alginate beads. Method. The impact of the three climatic factors on the release of E-β-caryophyllene from alginate beads was evaluated using a Box-Behnken experimental design and a laboratory scale volatile collection system. The influence of relative humidity on bead water content and size, with and without this semiochemical, was also investigated using a gravimetric method and an easy-to-use <b>photographic</b> <b>device,</b> respectively. Results. The results showed that an increase in temperature caused {{a significant increase in the}} E-β¬-caryophyllene release rate. Neither relative humidity nor airflow, however, had a significant effect on the release of this semiochemical when relative humidity and wind speed ranged from 33 % to 75 % and from 6. 61 x 10 - 4 m. s- 1 to 2. 05 x 10 - 2 m. s- 1, respectively. The isotherm curves obtained were characteristic of food products and biopolymer materials. The isotherm shapes were not modified by the incorporation of the semiochemical into alginate beads, and showed an important increase in water content when relative humidity values exceeded 85 %. Fortunately, this water content increase did not affect bead size, which facilitates the calculation of E-β-caryophyllene release. Conclusion. The present study shows for the first time the impact of the three main climatic factors on the release of E-β-caryophyllene from alginate beads. It allows learning more about how these biological control devices operate in order to optimize future field trials. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Early human fetuses {{have the}} ability to heal wounds by {{completely}} regenerating tissues, leaving no evidence of scarring. However in the adult scarring is the inevitable endpoint of the wound healing process. Sometimes these scars can be pathological in nature causing both functional and aesthetic problems to those affected. Every year {{millions of people around the}} globe acquire problematic or pathological scars either whilst undergoing surgery or from traumatic injuries and at present there remain a severely limited number of pharmacological treatment options to offer these patients. Importantly currently there exists no treatment that can either eliminate or reliably reduce acquired scars. Not only is the treatment of acquired scars problematic but also the clinical assessment of scars is largely subjective in nature and frequently relies on assessment scales that show large amounts of inter-rater variation and lack quantification. Especially subjective is the measurement of scar colour, which can be markedly different from the surrounding skin and cause significant distress to the patient. Without an objective assessment framework clinicians cannot reliably examine scars nor gauge responses to any treatment. The aim of this thesis is thus two-fold. Firstly a new anti-scarring treatment in the form of insulin will be tested in a randomised, double blind, intra-patient, placebo controlled trial where patients undergoing elective bilateral breast surgery will have low-dose insulin injected subcutaneously to one breast and placebo to the other at the time of surgery. Patients will be followed up for 12 months and their scars compared to examine the therapeutic effect of insulin upon scars.

40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of papillary deficiencies adjacent to dental implants or teeth presents an esthetic {{concern for the}} dental team and patients. Purpose: The aim of this pilot project is to evaluate a new method for reducing or eliminating small papillary deficiencies. The use of a commercially available gel was evaluated as a possible method for enhancing deficient papillae. Materials and Methods: Eleven patients, seven females and four males, {{with an average age}} of 55. 8 years (ranging from 25 to 75 years) with 14 treated sites are included in this pilot study. Patients had a minimum of one papillary deficiency in the esthetic zone. Prior to treatment photographs were either taken at a 1 : 1 ratio or converted to a 1 : 1 ratio using a commercially available program. A standardization <b>photographic</b> <b>device</b> was not used. After administration of a local anesthetic, a 23 -gauge needle was used to inject less than 0. 2 mL of a commercially available and Food and Drug Administration-approved gel of hyaluronic acid 2 – 3 mm apical to the coronal tip of the involved papillae. Patients were seen every three weeks and treatment was repeated up to three times. Patients were followed from 6 to 25 months after initial gel application. A computer program measured changes in pixels between initial and final treatments. A formula was derived to determine percentage change in the negative space between initial and final examinations. Results: Each site was individually evaluated. Three implant sites and one site adjacent to a tooth had 100 % improvement between treatment examinations. Seven sites improved from 94 to 97 %, three sites improved from 76 to 88 %, and one site adjacent to an implant had 57 % improvement. Conclusion: Results from this pilot study are encouraging and present evidence that small papillary deficiencies between implants and teeth can be enhanced by injection of a hyaluronic gel. Improvements were maintained for a range of 6 to 25 months...|$|R
