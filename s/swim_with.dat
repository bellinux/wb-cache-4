40|$|Title Comparison of {{the loading}} rate during <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> the load of various upthrust. Objective Comparison of {{physical}} intensity during <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> the load of high upthrust and low upthrust. Methods The Method {{used in this}} work was quantitativ research in the pool with counterflow (Flum, FTVS UK). There were 7 people tested. The loading rate was observed by heart rate monitor with chest strap. It is randomized study with crossed design and the method of data eleboration was comparative analysis. Results The results compare physical intensity during <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> high upthrust load and very low upthrust load. It shows the differences in intensity between <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> various types of load. It was found, that <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> the load of high upthrust causes lower physical intensity than <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> the load of very low upthrust. <b>Swimming</b> <b>with</b> the load by pulling is just a bit preferable than pushing. The heart rate by pulling is lower about 2 - 7 bpm than pushing. Keywords Military swimming, upthrust of the load, heart rate, <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> load...|$|R

5|$|Some species, such as {{electric}} eels, {{can produce}} powerful electric currents, {{strong enough to}} stun prey. Other fish, such as knifefish, generate weak varying electric fields to detect their prey; they <b>swim</b> <b>with</b> straight backs to avoid distorting their electric fields. These currents are produced by modified muscle or nerve cells.|$|E

5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers <b>swim</b> <b>with</b> a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men <b>swim</b> <b>with</b> their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|Commercial 'dolphin encounter' {{enterprises}} and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film The Cove documents how dolphins are captured {{and sold to}} some of these enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals <b>swim</b> <b>with</b> and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists have claimed that the dolphins do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld (backed by different scientists), counter that the dolphins are properly cared for, have lots of environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.|$|E

5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They <b>swim</b> <b>with</b> their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any time of year. Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people <b>swim</b> <b>with</b> them without being attacked.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{use their}} baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, {{out of the}} water; {{there are two types}} of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders <b>swim</b> <b>with</b> an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{aimed to explore}} the psychological effects for humans of <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> dolphins as opposed to swimming in the ocean without dolphins. It was hypothesized that people <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> dolphins would experience significantly greater levels of well-being and reduced levels of anxiety than those who swam without dolphins. Participants were sampled from Perth's UnderWater World marine park and at the Bunbury Dolphin Discovery Centre, Australia. Participants completed well-being and anxiety measures before and after their swim. Well-being was greater in participants who <b>swam</b> <b>with</b> dolphins than in those who did not, {{both before and after}} their swim. However, well-being increased to the same extent in both groups. In contrast, anxiety decreased for participants <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> dolphins but not in those who swam without dolphins. The findings suggest that anticipation of a new and exciting experience, and swimming, itself increase well-being. In addition, <b>swimming</b> specifically <b>with</b> dolphins may lower anxiety. Whether these effects are responsible for the therapeutic benefits associated with human-dolphin interactions requires further investigation...|$|R
5|$|Crustaceans {{exhibit a}} number of larval forms, of which the {{earliest}} and most characteristic is the nauplius. This has three pairs of appendages, all emerging from the young animal's head, and a single naupliar eye. In most groups, there are further larval stages, including the zoea (pl. zoeæ or zoeas). This name was given to it when naturalists believed {{it to be a}} separate species. It follows the nauplius stage and precedes the post-larva. Zoea larvae <b>swim</b> <b>with</b> their thoracic appendages, as opposed to nauplii, which use cephalic appendages, and megalopa, which use abdominal appendages for swimming. It often has spikes on its carapace, which may assist these small organisms in maintaining directional swimming. In many decapods, due to their accelerated development, the zoea is the first larval stage. In some cases, the zoea stage is followed by the mysis stage, and in others, by the megalopa stage, depending on the crustacean group involved.|$|E
5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a jet {{of water}} from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and <b>swim</b> <b>with</b> the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.|$|E
5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may <b>swim</b> <b>with</b> dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E
