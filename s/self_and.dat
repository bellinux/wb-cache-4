5|$|Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is {{a symbol}} of {{shedding}} the social <b>self</b> <b>and</b> its constraints to then embrace the freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to embrace her animal <b>self</b> <b>and</b> learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns something about the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having not learned something new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the direct and indirect role of <b>self</b> esteem <b>and</b> procrastination in the relation between fear of failure <b>and</b> <b>self</b> worth. The participants were 279 students who study different major fields at the Faculty of Education in Pamukkale University. Age range varied from 19 to 34. In this study, Tuckman Procrastination Inventory, Rosenberg Self Esteem Inventory, Activate <b>and</b> Success Based <b>Self</b> Worth Scale, Concern over Mistakes Scale and Personal Information Sheet were used to gather data. Results showed that procrastination had partial mediating effect in relation to fear of failure; performance based <b>self</b> worth, <b>and</b> <b>self</b> worth vulnerability. In other words, the effect of fear of failure on the performance based <b>self</b> worth <b>and</b> <b>self</b> worth vulnerability was decreased when procrastination was added the equation. The results also showed that self esteem had partial mediating role in relation to fear of failure-procrastination, fear of failure- performance based <b>self</b> worth, <b>and</b> <b>self</b> worth vulnerability. In other words, the effect of fear of failure on the procrastination, performance based <b>self</b> worth, <b>and</b> <b>self</b> worth vulnerability was reduced, when self esteem was added the equation. Finally, results showed that self esteem had full mediating role in the relation to procrastination; performance based <b>self</b> worth, <b>and</b> <b>self</b> worth vulnerability.
