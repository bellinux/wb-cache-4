25|$|MD 414 was {{expanded}} to a divided highway from MD 458 {{south to the}} center of Marlow Heights east of Temple Hill Road in 1971; the MD 5MD 414 interchange opened the same year. The portion of the highway through Phelps Corner and the Capital Beltway interchange {{was expanded}} to a divided highway in 1983. Both MD 414 and the county-maintained portion of Oxon Hill Road immediately to the west of MD 210 were expanded to a divided highway during construction of the <b>S-ramps</b> directly connecting MD 210 with I-295 in 1989. MD 414 was reassigned to the portion of Oxon Hill Road between MD 210 and Oxon Hill Manor in 2004. MD 414 in Oxon Hill was included in the highway expansion construction associated with the construction of the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge starting in 2006. The state highway was relocated for the reconstruction of MD 210's interchange with the Beltway. This project the opening of several new or reconstructed ramps between the Beltway and MD 414 and the construction of the MD 414MD 210 interchange in 2007.|$|R
50|$|SOA Repository Artifact Model & Protocol (<b>S-RAMP)</b> is a {{specification}} of SOA repository released by HP, IBM, Software AG, TIBCO, and Red Hat. The SOA repository provides environments for designing, running and monitoring services. The repository manages artifacts like schemas (e.g. XML Schema or RELAX NG), service descriptions (e.g. WSDL), business process definitions (e.g. BPEL) and policies (e.g. WS-Policy). The SOA Repository Artifact Model and Protocol (<b>S-RAMP)</b> defines a common data model for SOA repositories {{as well as}} an interaction protocol to facilitate the use of common tooling and sharing of data. This ATOM binding specifications documents the syntax for interaction with a compliant repository for create, read, update, delete and query operations. The <b>S-RAMP</b> specification promotes interoperability of SOA Repositories. The <b>S-RAMP</b> specification is one of the SOA standards.|$|E
50|$|The <b>S-RAMP</b> binding {{specification}} details how artifacts {{are represented}} in ATOM (standard) format, {{as well as how}} to perform create, retrieve, update, delete operations against the data in an <b>S-RAMP</b> compliant repository. The use of an existing REST based format such as the ATOM facilitates integration with existing products using ATOM feeds.|$|E

50|$|The current {{version is}} 1.0. <b>S-RAMP</b> is {{supported}} by a Technical Committee at OASIS.|$|E
50|$|<b>S-RAMP</b> {{defines a}} {{hierarchical}} classification {{system based on}} the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and a query language based on XPath 2.0.|$|E
5000|$|Document Artifact: {{correspond}} to a physical document {{stored in the}} repository. Several important document types are pre-defined and have special support in <b>S-RAMP</b> (such as XML Schema or WSDL documents) ...|$|E
5000|$|Derived Artifact: {{correspond}} to data derived by the <b>S-RAMP</b> server from {{the content of}} an artifact. Derived content is read-only and provide detailed information about the artifact. This information is standard {{through the use of}} the Logical Models defined in the specification.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>S-RAMP</b> {{specification}} is a specification for a SOA Repository it {{does not}} actually specify much about the repository itself. Instead the specification is written to promote interoperability across all portions of the service lifecycle between Design Time, Run Time and Monitoring systems and tooling. The design adheres to design goals {{such as the use}} of existing standards, vendor neutrality and it is driven by use cases. The specification separates out the data model from the bindings that describe the interaction APIs clients use to interact with the repository.|$|E

These disciplines included solar physics in the International Solar Cycle Study (ISCS) program, middle atmosphere physics in the Planetary Scale Mesopause Observing System (PSMOS) program, and equatorial {{regions in the}} Equatorial Processes Including Coupling (EPIC) program. During the 1998 – 2002 period, the SCOSTEP sought to further the objectives of STEP through its STEP—results, application, and modeling phase (<b>S-RAMP)</b> program. For example, an event-oriented, multi-regional study {{referred to as the}} Space Weather Month (September 1999) was conducted by <b>S-RAMP</b> and the study employed the array of ISTP satellites that were still operational.|$|E

The interaction between the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the geomagnetic field at the dayside magnetopause leads to transfer of momentum and energy which changes the magnetospheric configuration, but only after a certain time. In this study we quantify this time, to advance {{our understanding of the}} causes for the delayed response of the magnetosphere. We study the response and reconfiguration time of the inner magnetosphere to IMF By reversals. A superposed epoch analysis of magnetic field measurements from four Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite spacecraft at different local times both for negative to positive IMF By reversals and for positive to negative reversals is presented. The magnetospheric response time at geosynchronous orbit to the sudden change of IMF By is less than 15 (∼ 10) min from the bow shock (magnetopause) arrival time, while the reconfiguration time is less than 46 (∼ 41) min. These results are consistent with a By component induced on closed magnetic field lines due to the asymmetric loading of flux following asymmetric dayside reconnection when IMF By≠ 0. Our results also confirm our earlier studies that nightside reconnection is not required for generating a By component on closed field lines. his study was supported by the Research Council of Norway/CoE under contract 223252 /F 50.
