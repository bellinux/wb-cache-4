5|$|They live {{throughout}} rainforest, dry sclerophyll (Eucalyptus) forest, open woodland, Pandanus thickets, paperbarks, mangroves, watercourses, and wetter {{areas of}} semi-arid regions, {{as well as}} parks, gardens, and golf courses in urban areas. The understory in eucalypt-dominated woodland where the blue-faced honeyeater is found is most commonly composed of grasses such as Triodia, but sometimes it {{is made up of}} shrubs or small trees such as grevilleas, paperbarks, wattles, Cooktown ironwood (Erythrophleum chlorostachys) or billygoat plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana). One study in Kakadu National Park found that blue-faced honeyeaters inhabited mixed <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> eucalypts and Pandanus but were missing from pure <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> either plant.|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} <b>of</b> <b>stands</b> is a {{very important}} aspect for establishing the principles of forest planning and of its durable managing. In order to ensure the necessary stability for the stands, in different stages of development, it is necessary to set a corresponding thickness <b>of</b> these <b>stands</b> that determines the best spacing. For quantifying the thickness, density, spacing and implicitly the stability <b>of</b> <b>stands</b> it is necessary to determine some synthetic indicators afferent to the studied stands and respectively to compare them to the reference indicators. Key words: <b>stands,</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>stands,</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>stands,</b> density <b>of</b> <b>stands,</b> spacing the <b>stands,</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>stands,</b> synthetic indicators, silvic-technical analysis...|$|R

5|$|Ann Arbor {{was founded}} in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders and the <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> Bur Oak trees. The University of Michigan moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city grew at a rapid rate {{in the early to}} mid-20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a {{reputation}} as a center for left-wing politics. Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as various student movements.|$|E
5|$|Any future {{renovation}} to {{the stadium}} will involve replacing the old North Stand of the former National Stadium with a new one similar to the three existing <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> the new Millennium Stadium. This will make the stadium bowl-shaped and will increase its capacity to around 80,000. It will resolve the existing problems of deteriorating concrete quality on the old structure in the north stand.|$|E
5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E

5|$|Greece: The {{species has}} been {{recorded}} in the Pindus and Rhodopi Mountains of central and northern Greece. Here, M.alcathoe is usually found in <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> plane or alder trees next to small streams in ravines. The bat hunts close to the trees, within the stand. It is often found together with the lesser horseshoe bat and with M.mystacinus.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, {{with the}} United States now embroiled World War II, Arthur Compton {{concentrated}} the Manhattan Project's various teams working on plutonium at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. Zinn used athletes to build Fermi's increasingly large experimental configurations under the <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> the disused Stagg Field. In July 1942, Fermi measured a k = 1.007 from a uranium oxide lattice. This raised hopes that pure uranium would yield a suitable value of k.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{has four}} {{ecological}} provinces: Prairie Parkland, {{in the southwestern}} and western parts of the state; the Eastern Broadleaf Forest (Big Woods) in the southeast, extending in a narrowing strip to the state's northwestern part, where it transitions into Tallgrass Aspen Parkland; and the northern Laurentian Mixed Forest, a transitional forest between the northern boreal forest and the broadleaf forests to the south. These northern forests are a vast wilderness of pine and spruce trees mixed with patchy <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> birch and poplar.|$|E
5|$|The South <b>Stand</b> <b>of</b> the rugby ground {{formed a}} {{complete}} unit with the North <b>Stand</b> <b>of</b> the National Stadium. Now the same structure <b>of</b> the South <b>Stand</b> <b>of</b> the rugby ground is also physically {{attached to the}} North <b>Stand</b> <b>of</b> the Millennium Stadium. This section is known colloquially as Glanmor's Gap, after Glanmor Griffiths, former chair and President of the WRU. This came about because the WRU were unable to secure enough funding to include the North Stand in the Millennium Stadium, and the National Lottery Commission would not provide any additional funds {{to be used for}} the construction of a new ground for Cardiff RFC. The Millennium Stadium was therefore built with the old reinforced concrete structure of the National Stadium (North Stand) and the new steel Millennium Stadium structure built around it.|$|R

5|$|The {{coastline}} is {{well known}} for its colourful flowers including sea aster, sea squill, sea thrift, common sea-lavender, bell and common heather. The Scottish primrose is found only on the coasts of Orkney and nearby Caithness and Sutherland. Although <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> trees are generally rare, a small forest named Happy Valley with 700 trees and lush gardens was created from a boggy hillside near Stenness {{during the second half of}} the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} {{prevalent}} in most woodland types in its range, {{and also in}} more open country with scattered trees. Eurasian sparrowhawks prefer to hunt the edges of wooded areas, but migrant birds {{can be seen in}} any habitat. The increased proportion of medium-aged <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> trees created by modern forestry techniques have benefited Accipiter nisus, according to a Norwegian study. Unlike its larger relative the northern goshawk, it can be seen in gardens and in urban areas and will even breed in city parks.|$|E

5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, Douglas fir, and a few <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E
