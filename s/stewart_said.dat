25|$|Magic Town (1947), {{a comedy}} film {{directed}} by William A.

He completed Rope (1948) directed by Alfred Hitchcock and Call Northside 777 (1948), and weathered two box-office disappointments with On Our Merry Way (1948), a comedic musical ensemble in which Stewart and Henry Fonda were paired as two jazz musicians, and You Gotta Stay Happy (1949), for which the posters depicted Stewart being kissed on one cheek by Joan Fontaine and on the other by a chimpanzee. In the documentary film James Stewart: A Wonderful Life (1987), hosted by Johnny Carson, <b>Stewart</b> <b>said</b> that he went back to Westerns in 1950 in part because of the string of flops.|$|E

500|$|Japanese game company Square Enix {{acquired}} Eidos in April 2009, restructuring Eidos into Square Enix Europe. Crystal Dynamics {{remained the}} developer of the Tomb Raider games. Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light introduced co-operative gameplay to the series, {{a move that}} brand director Karl <b>Stewart</b> <b>said</b> was meant to [...] "show [...] as a more humanistic character" [...] by placing her {{in a situation that}} differed from previous instalments.

500|$|Former world {{champion}} Niki Lauda {{said that he}} did [...] "not understand this completely wrong decision", adding [...] "It's unbelievable how the best driver in yesterday's race makes no mistakes and only gets sixpoints". He called for the formation of permanent race stewards, instead of the temporary steward system currently in place. He called it [...] "the worst judgement in the history of F1", saying, [...] "It's absolutely unacceptable when three influence the championship like this". Three-time {{world champion}} Jackie <b>Stewart</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "F1 attracts the largest capital investment in sport, but it's being overseen by people who are not doing it full-time and we get inconsistent decisions".|$|E
500|$|Despite his injury, <b>Stewart</b> <b>said</b> {{he hoped}} to {{participate}} in a planned two-day test session at Phoenix International Raceway. He also said he was worried about his crash because his legs and hips were tingling and his lower back was in pain. <b>Stewart</b> <b>said</b> the crash scared him and the tingling in his legs had improved after leaving the infield care center. Kurt Busch's crew chief Pat Tryson stated that he and the Penske Racing South team were relieved that the driver emerged uninjured after his crash on lap 256, and that they would do better at the next weekend's race. Gordon said his crash on lap 264 was [...] "probably the hardest hit I've ever taken" [...] and admitted fault for causing the crash. According to Kenseth, [...] "I {{knew he was going to}} get a run on me, so I laid back a little bit...We came off [...] 2 and I was up as high as I thought I could, and Jeff just came across. Whether it was on purpose or not, it just kind of wiped us out." [...] Gordon said he hoped Speedway Motorsports chairman and chief executive Bruton Smith (the owner of Las Vegas Motor Speedway) would install SAFER barriers along the inside retaining walls around the track. Biffle said there should have been no open gaps in the circuit barriers and that all NASCAR tracks should have SAFER barriers installed. After consultation with NASCAR officials, construction crews installed a [...] long SAFER barrier along the inside backstretch wall in August 2008.|$|E

500|$|As films {{featuring}} prurient elements {{performed well}} at the box office, after the crackdown on crime films, Hollywood increased its production of pictures featuring the seven deadly sins. In 1932, Warner Bros formed an official policy decreeing that [...] "two out of five stories should be hot", and that nearly all films could benefit by [...] "adding something {{having to do with}} ginger." [...] Filmmakers (including the shrewd Mae West) began putting in overly suggestive material they knew would never reach theaters in hopes that lesser offenses would survive the cutting-room floor. MGM screenwriter Donald Ogden <b>Stewart</b> <b>said</b> [...] " [...] wouldn't want to take out too much, so you would give them five things to take out to satisfy the Hays Office—and you would get away with murder with what they left in." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Butterflies" [...] was {{recorded}} by Michael Jackson in 2001 for his tenth studio album, Invincible, which was released the same year.

Jackson first met Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart, who {{is also a member of}} Floetry, through John McClain, who is DreamWorks's senior urban executive and Jackson's manager. <b>Stewart</b> <b>said</b> she was surprised that Jackson invited her and Ambrosius to a studio and asked for their input on the recording of the track. She recalled in an interview with LAUNCH magazine, [...] "It was incredible because he asked, he continually asked, 'Marsh, what's the next harmony? Girls, does this sound right? What do you think?

Levine and crew could be blue-eyed-soul godheads, the 21st-century Hall and Oates. But they need to loosen up first." [...] Leah Greenblat of Entertainment Weekly also spotted the Def Leppard influence on [...] "Hands All Over". Writing for the Bay of Plenty Times, Tamlyn <b>Stewart</b> <b>said</b> that the song is sexy and funky and is similar to the band's works on their second studio album It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007).

500|$|In Formula One, Rindt {{had several}} {{friendly}} {{relationships with other}} drivers, most notably Jackie Stewart. They met at a Formula Two event in 1964 and soon became friends, often going on holiday together and living near each other in Switzerland. Until his death, they were sometimes accompanied by Jim Clark. Rindt became involved in Stewart's fight for increased safety in Formula One, {{being one of the}} leading figures of the GPDA. For his role in the safety campaign, Rindt was criticised by fellow drivers and the press alike; reporters derogatively called Stewart, Rindt and Joakim Bonnier the [...] "Geneva connection", due to their residence in Switzerland. <b>Stewart</b> <b>said</b> that it took Rindt some time to understand the graveness of the situation but after that, he was a [...] "good ally". After Rindt's death, his wife Nina stayed close with the Stewarts and can be seen visiting them at the 1971 Monaco Grand Prix in the Roman Polanski-produced film Weekend of a Champion.|$|E
500|$|Harvey and <b>Stewart</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} fatwa was a {{departure}} from the previous legal opinions among Islamic scholars, which typically emphasised the obligation to emigrate from any country where proper religious observance was not possible. Notably, the Maliki scholar al-Wansharisi, the leading living authority on the issue, was among the proponents of this view. Stewart contended that, while the fatwa's text did not mention any opponent, it was intended as a rebuke against the views of al-Wansharisi. Recipients of this fatwa would be able to stay put, outwardly conforming to Christianity and not see themselves as abandoning their faith. The fatwa addressed the recipient as [...] "al-guraba", a word that means [...] "outsiders" [...] or [...] "those living abroad", but this word also appears in several hadiths (sayings of Muhammad) and evokes a spiritual meaning of heroic Muslims loyal to their faith in spite of great suffering. The sympathy shown by the author, as well as his acknowledgement of the Muslims' loyalty and suffering, is in contrast with the predominant opinion such as al-Wansharisi's which saw them unfavourably.|$|E

Originally scheduled {{to be released in}} 2009, Tricky Stewart explained the delay, saying [...] "we just got our label deals done, so the reason why some of these projects got delayed had to do with technicalities and things of that nature". The album has been furthered delayed because of Milian's marriage to The-Dream and her pregnancy. In January 2010, Milian said that she was going back into the studio in the summer to record more material. Although the album had already been finished when Milian took a break for her pregnancy, she wanted to [...] "go back and re-do some of the music and make some new songs and find my new inspiration".

500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, {{if you give them}} a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. <b>Stewart</b> <b>said</b> in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E

Liev Schreiber, who portrayed Sabertooth in X-Men Origins: Wolverine said in February 2016 that he was in talks to reprise his role in the sequel.

On February 27, after returning to Los Angeles, Cooper learned that he was dying. He later told his family, [...] "We'll pray for a miracle; but if not, and that's God's will, that's all right too." [...] On April 17, Cooper watched the Academy Awards ceremony on television and saw his good friend James Stewart, who had presented Cooper with his first Oscar years earlier, accept on Cooper's behalf an honorary award for lifetime achievement—his third Oscar.

A writer from the Western Mail said that the Branning/Mitchell Feud makes Abi and Jay feel like [...] "Walford's answer to Romeo and Juliet". Two writers from the Daily Mirror mocked the storyline where Abi turns down the trip to Costa Rica. One said, [...] "An extreme case of soap agoraphobia as brilliant Abi sensibly turns down the chance to spend eight weeks in the tropical paradise of Costa Rica. But in the tiny micro-world of EastEnders, even the three-mile odyssey from Walford to the West End is considered an epic journey. So Central America is simply out of the question" [...] with another saying, [...] "Abi {{was a little girl}} arranging tearful funerals for her pets. But now she's a young teenager, secretly engaged to boyfriend Jay and planning to run away together. He then gives Abi an ultimatum: him or her trip to Costa Rica. Best pass her the suncream, then". However, Abi, along with the younger members of the cast were thought to be the blame of declining ratings for the show; [...] "In the last two months, viewers have seen lots of Lauren, Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Fatboy (Ricky Norwood), Ben Jay, Abi and Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas) - but not nearly so much of the classic characters". Inside Soap noted that Abi and Jay's relationship was popular with viewers.|$|E
500|$|Following their collision, Hamilton and Rosberg were {{summoned to}} the {{stewards}} after the race but neither received a penalty, as the stewards rated their crash as a racing incident, with no driver in particular to blame. It emerged that Rosberg had chosen the wrong engine mode for the start, being down on power which led to Hamilton going for a passing manoeuvre. However, Rosberg remained convinced {{that he had done}} nothing wrong, saying: [...] "I made it very clear I wasn't going to leave any space on the inside and I was very surprised he went for the gap". While Hamilton apologised to the team after the incident, he refused to accept blame for it. Opinions about the incident varied: While Mercedes's executive chairman Niki Lauda blamed Hamilton for the crash, former F1 driver Anthony Davidson said on Sky Sports F1 that Rosberg's move was [...] "very aggressive". Three-time world champion Jackie <b>Stewart</b> <b>said</b> after the race that Mercedes should fine Hamilton for the crash: [...] "Hamilton is to blame. Rosberg was allowed to protect himself. You don't go for it on the first lap." [...] Mercedes's head of motorsport Toto Wolff stressed after the race that the team would continue to let their drivers race against each other freely, a decision praised by former world champion Alain Prost. While Rosberg said after the race that he contemplated having a talk with Hamilton about the situation, Mercedes later decided that they did [...] "not need clear-the-air talks". However, it later emerged that the pair did have a conversation about the incident before the next race in Monaco, which, according to Hamilton, was marked by [...] "pure respect". It was Mercedes's first double retirement since the 2011 Australian Grand Prix, and the first time they failed to score a point since the 2012 United States Grand Prix, ending a 62-race long streak, the third longest in Formula One history.|$|E
