5000|$|Cougar Ridge {{development}} included <b>storm-water</b> <b>sewer</b> and {{sanitary sewer}} lines that run down {{and across the}} Paskapoo Slopes and its major ravines fragmenting the natural area. During the fall of 2000, an extensive archaeological study {{was performed on the}} significant sites located along the storm and sanitary utility corridor for the Cougar Ridge Community. This trunk now runs down the Paskapoo Slopes. Before it was installed, these digs were completed ...|$|E
50|$|The Village Homes {{development}} is situated on a sixty-acre parcel in suburban Davis, California. While home lots {{are smaller than}} the average for Davis, clusters of eight homes share common green spaces accessible from private backyards. In addition to these courtyards, Village Homes residents share two large parks, two vineyards, and numerous small orchards and community gardens. Gardens are irrigated by naturally-flowing creeks, which also serve as natural filters that {{eliminate the need for}} an expensive <b>storm-water</b> <b>sewer</b> system. Residents enjoy environmental and aesthetic benefits from their shared spaces, and the increased sense of community is evident; Village Homes residents on average know 40 neighbors, compared to an average of 17 acquaintances reported in a nearby traditional suburban development.|$|E
50|$|There {{is in the}} UK a legal {{difference}} between a storm sewer and a surface water sewer. You {{do not have a}} right of connection to a <b>storm-water</b> overflow <b>sewer</b> under section 106 of the Water Industry Act.|$|R
40|$|Just {{as natural}} river {{networks}} {{are known to}} be globally self-similar, recent research has shown that human-built urban networks, such as road networks, are also functionally self-similar, and have fractal topology with power-law node-degree distributions (p(k) = a k). Here we show, for the first time, that other urban infrastructure networks (sanitary and <b>storm-water</b> <b>sewers),</b> which sustain flows of critical services for urban citizens, also show scale-free functional topologies. For roads and drainage networks, we compared functional topological metrics, derived from high-resolution data (70, 000 nodes) for a large US city providing services to about 900, 000 citizens over an area of about 1, 000 km 2. For the whole city and for different sized subnets, we also examined these networks in terms of geospatial co-location (roads and sewers). Our analyses reveal functional topological homogeneity among all the subnets within the city, in spite of differences in several urban attributes. The functional topologies of all subnets of both infrastructure types resemble power-law distributions, with tails becoming increasingly power-law as the subnet area increases. Our findings hold implications for assessing the vulnerability of these critical infrastructure networks to cascading shocks based on spatial interdependency, and for improved design and maintenance of urban infrastructure networks...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{of surface}} and {{subsurface}} geology {{as well as}} geotechnical properties is fundamental to the planning and development of transportation systems. Through dynamic linkage of readily available spatial geographic information system data and subsurface borehole data stored in a relational database, we have created a spatially referenced, digital catalog of borehole data for two pilot areas in Rhode Island. The borehole database is populated with data from Rhode Island Department of Transportation geotechnical reports and supplemental data from the U. S. Geological Survey groundwater site inventory system {{as well as local}} <b>storm-water</b> and <b>sewer</b> projects. Most of these data were previously stored in paper format, making historical or inter-project data comparisons very difficult, if not impossible. Consolidation of these data in a single relational database yields two primary benefits: Historical data are readily accessible for review and, therefore, can be easily incorporated into the planning stages of new projects, and sophisticated analysis of the region becomes possible with access to data from multiple projects with both spatial and temporal layers. Geologic data include bedrock geology, surface outcrops, unconsolidated materials, soil type, topographic and orthophotographic base maps, and location of boreholes and wells. Subsurface data include land-surface elevation, depth to water table, depth to bedrock, and presence or absence of fill, high and low blow-count zones, and organic sedi...|$|R
