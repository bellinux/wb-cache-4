5|$|While {{the venom}} {{of a few}} species is {{dangerous}} to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides. <b>Spider</b> <b>silk</b> provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and <b>spider</b> <b>silk</b> genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these {{can be used as}} silk factories.

40|$|Spider silks exhibit {{remarkable}} properties, surpassing {{most natural}} and synthetic materials in both strength and toughness. Orb-web <b>spider</b> dragline <b>silk</b> {{is the focus}} of intense research by material scientists attempting to mimic these naturally produced fibres. However, biomechanical research on <b>spider</b> <b>silks</b> is often removed from the context of web ecology and spider foraging behaviour. Similarly, evolutionary and ecological research on spiders rarely considers the significance of silk properties. Here, we highlight the critical need to integrate biomechanical and ecological perspectives on <b>spider</b> <b>silks</b> to generate a better understanding of (i) how silk biomechanics and web architectures interacted to influence spider web evolution along different structural pathways, and (ii) how silks function in an ecological context, which may identify novel silk applications. An integrative, mechanistic approach to understanding silk and web function, as well as the selective pressures driving their evolution, will help uncover the potential impacts of environmental change and species invasions (of both spiders and prey) on spider success. Integrating these fields will also allow us {{to take advantage of the}} remarkable properties of <b>spider</b> <b>silks,</b> expanding the range of possible silk applications from single threads to two- and three-dimensional thread networks. 15 page(s...|$|R

Our laboratory has shown that the strength products, such as fibers, produced with other silk proteins correlates with the size of the silk protein. The aciniform silk (AcSp 1), has been shown to produce the thinnest and strongest fibers of all the natural <b>spider</b> <b>silks.</b> Aciniform silk is composed of a nonrepetitive amino-terminal region, 14 repeats of approximately 200 amino acids each, and a nonrepetitive carboxy-terminal region.

25|$|One {{approach}} {{that does not}} involve farming spiders is to extract the <b>spider</b> <b>silk</b> gene and use other organisms to produce the <b>spider</b> <b>silk.</b> Working under the trademark BioSteel, in 2000 Canadian biotechnology company Nexia successfully produced <b>spider</b> <b>silk</b> protein in transgenic goats that carried the gene for it; the milk produced by the goats contained significant quantities of the protein, 1–2grams of silk proteins per litre of milk. Attempts to spin the protein into a fibre similar to natural <b>spider</b> <b>silk</b> resulted in fibres with tenacities of 2–3grams per denier.

25|$|They used <b>spider</b> <b>silk</b> fibers {{to create}} a nerve conduit with Schwann cells and acellularized xenogenic veins. The Schwann cells formed columns along the silk fibers in {{a short amount of}} time, and the columns were similar to bands of Bungner that grow in vivo after PNS injury. <b>Spider</b> <b>silk</b> has not been used in tissue {{engineering}} until now because of the predatory nature of spiders and the low yield of silk from individual spiders. It has been discovered that the species Nephila clavipes produces silk that is less immunogenic than silkworm silk; it has a tensile strength of 4 x 109 N/m, which is six times the breaking strength of steel. Because <b>spider</b> <b>silk</b> is proteolytically degraded, there is not a shift in pH from the physiological pH during degradation. Other advantages of <b>spider</b> <b>silk</b> include its resistance to fungal and bacterial decomposition for weeks {{and the fact that it}} does not swell. Also, the silk's structure promotes cell adhesion and migration. However, silk harvest is still a tedious task and the exact composition varies among species and even among individuals of the same species depending on diet and environment. There have been attempts to synthetically manufacture <b>spider</b> <b>silk.</b> Further studies are needed to test the feasibility of using a <b>spider</b> <b>silk</b> nerve conduit in vitro and in vivo.|$|E

40|$|Stress/strain {{characteristics}} and biochemical correlates of <b>spider</b> <b>silks</b> Abstract of proposal: Spider orb webs are high energy absorbing nets, {{and their ability}} to function well depends not only on the structural properties of web design but also on the material properties of the silk. A study using state of the art computer analysis and modelling will show how the spider's web absorbs the high kinetic energy imparted by wind load and prey impact. One important constraint for the spider is its building material, the silk, a biopolymer with very interesting mechanical properties.

The formation process of the nano-SiO 2 /TPU fibers was simply described as three main stages, and the second stage, such as the adding of the ethanol solvents and nano-SiO 2 in different diameters, was thought to be very crucial for the final external and inner microstructures of the prepared fibers. For example, the adding of the ethanol and the nano-SiO 2 spheres in diameter of 10 nm resulted in the existence of many TPU-self-assembled microspheres mostly spaced apart by the nano-SiO 2 aggregates in the nano-SiO 2 /TPU fibers, while the adding of the ethanol and the nano-SiO 2 spheres in diameter of 100 nm resulted in the existence of the nano-SiO 2 spheres, instead of the TPU-self-assembled microspheres, distributed in the nano-SiO 2 /TPU fibers...|$|R

Durability of AFM tips were also studied by measuring the change in tip radius of the AFM tips and also utilized the atom probe tomographic (APT) techniques to examine the AFM tips. The measure of change in tip radius indicates the wear resistance of the tips.
