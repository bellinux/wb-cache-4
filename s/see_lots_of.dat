500|$|Lemmings {{has also}} been called a {{predecessor}} of the modern real-time strategy (RTS) video game genre. A 1991 Amiga Power article claimed that Lemmings [...] "was the first major game to introduce the 'indirect-control' concept," [...] an element that is now common in many RTS games. Blizzard Entertainment developer Bob Fitch said {{that part of the}} inspiration for the first Warcraft game, , was based on developing a competitive multiplayer RTS that combined elements of The Lost Vikings (which he had worked on) and Lemmings; Fitch said [...] "We just went, 'Oh it's so cool when you <b>see</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> Lemmings all over the place. Why don't we have lots of Vikings all over instead, and then the Vikings can fight each other." [...] Lemmings introduction of RTS elements has been noted by fantasy author Terry Pratchett; in his novel Interesting Times, an army of golems is controlled in a fashion reminiscent of the Lemmings user interface. When readers asked if this was deliberate, Pratchett responded: [...] "Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can't imagine how anyone thought that... Not only did I wipe Lemmings from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldn't get it back." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. You will <b>see</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> them here, Bob. They {{come across}} from Ceuta, {{and there are}} some of them {{established}} here, as traders.

6000|$|... "'Now, you see,' said Baxter, 'this grass {{here is not}} smooth green turf, {{fresh from}} the lawn-mower. It is natural grass, with wild flowers in it here and there. Nearly {{all of it was}} brought from a meadow about a mile away from here. But now step inside a minute.

60|$|And now purple {{is being}} worn. You notice {{it on the}} streets. Of course other colors are quite stylish as well--in fact, I saw a lovely thing {{the other day in}} olive green albatross, with a triple-lapped flounce skirt trimmed with insert squares of silk, and a draped fichu of lace opening over a shirred vest and double puff sleeves with a lace band holding two {{gathered}} frills--but you <b>see</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> purple too. Oh, yes, you do; just take a walk down Twenty-third street any afternoon.|$|E

60|$|PICKERING. You've {{never been}} broken in {{properly}} {{to the social}} routine. [Strolling over to the piano] I rather enjoy dipping into it occasionally myself: {{it makes me feel}} young again. Anyhow, it was a great success: an immense success. I was quite frightened once or twice because Eliza was doing it so well. You <b>see,</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> the real people can't do it at all: they're such fools that they think style comes by nature to people in their position; and so they never learn. There's always something professional about doing a thing superlatively well.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>see</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> them--I'll {{be frank}} about it--that I {{should like to}} grab, to sling over my {{shoulder}} and carry away with me; or, what is the same thing, allowing for modern conditions, have an express man carry them. I notice them at Atlantic City, I see them in Fifth Avenue--yes, everywhere. But would they come? That's the deuce of it. Would they come right along, like the cave-woman, merely biting off my ear as they came, or are they degenerate enough {{to bring an action}} against me, indicting the express company as a party of the second part? ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, Wilcox, {{will you}} and Mr. Joyce get the cocoa-nuts, {{and while you}} are doing it I will creep round this {{clearing}} and get bananas. I can <b>see</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> their broad leaves over there. As I get them I will bring them to this corner, {{and by the time}} you have got a store of nuts, I shall have a pile of bananas. I think you had better go four or five hundred yards away before you cut the nuts, for they come down with such a thump that any native who is awake here might very well hear them.” ...|$|E
60|$|JAMES. [Brushing {{the remark}} aside] I've <b>seen</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> those fellows in my time. No doing {{anything}} with them except to keep 'em out of harm's way. They've got a blind spat.|$|R

6000|$|Among {{the objects}} of beauty and {{interest}} now beginning to appear quite plentifully in this secluded spot, I notice the humming-bird, the dragon-fly with its wings of slate-color'd guaze, and many varieties of beautiful and plain butterflies, idly flapping among the plants and wild posies. The mullein has shot up out of its nest of broad leaves, to a tall stalk towering sometimes five or six feet high, now studded with knobs of golden blossoms. The milk-weed, (I see a great gorgeous creature of gamboge and black lighting on one as I write,) is in flower, with its delicate red fringe; and there are profuse clusters of a feathery blossom waving in the wind on taper stems. I <b>see</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> these and much else in every direction, as I saunter or sit. For the last half hour a bird has persistently kept up a simple, sweet, melodious song, from the bushes. (I have a positive conviction {{that some of these}} birds sing, and others fly and flirt about here for my special benefit.) ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have written}} to Han, {{and sent her}} George's last two letters from Kentucky; one I got last week from Mount Sterling. I write to George and send him papers. Sam Beatty is here in Washington again. I saw him, {{and he said he}} would write to George. Mother, I have not got any new clothes yet, but shall very soon I hope. People are more rough and free and easy drest than your way. Then it is dusty or muddy most of the time here. Mother dear, I hope you have {{comfortable}} times--at least as comfortable as the law allows. I am so glad {{you are not going to}} have the trouble of moving this 1st of May. How are the Browns? Tell Will I should like to see him first rate--if he was here attached to the suite of some big officer, or something of that kind, he would have a good time and do well. I <b>see</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> young fellows not half as capable and trustworthy as he, coming and going in Washington, in such positions. The big generals and head men all through the armies, and provosts etc., like to have a squad of such smart, nimble young men around them. Give my respects to Mr. and Mrs. Brown.|$|E

50|$|There {{is a sort}} {{of double}} voicing in Yesi’s poems, {{multiple}} layers of meaning. In the poem Bittermelon: he says:You're not worn-out or beaten-down,you're just resting.The loudest song's not necessarily passionate;the bitterest pain stays in the heart.Is it because you've <b>seen</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> false sunlight,too much thunder and lightning, hurt and hurting...The narrator not only converses with objects and places but also to the reader. He asks “is it because you've <b>seen</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> false sunlight…too many indifferent and temperamental days” that you have stopped talking about your sufferings? The questions give us a feeling that the narrator sympathizes with us, the readers, and gently inquires as to our situations. Instead of readers reading the poem, the poem seems to read us as well.|$|R
