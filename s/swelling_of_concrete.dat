40|$|Several {{chemical}} reactions {{are able to}} produce <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> for decades after its initial curing, a problem that affects {{a considerable number of}} concrete dams around the world. Principia has had several contracts to study this problem in recent years, which have required reviewing the state-ofthe-art, adopting appropriate mathematical descriptions, programming them into user routines in Abaqus, determining model parameters on the basis of some parts of the dams’ monitored histories, ensuring reliability using some other parts, and finally predicting the future evolution of the dams and their safety margins. The paper describes some of the above experience, including the programming of sophisticated nonisotropic swelling models, that must be compatible with cracking and other nonlinearities involved in concrete behaviour. The applications concentrate on two specific cases, an arch-gravity dam and a double-curvature arch dam, both with a long history of concrete swelling and which, interestingly, entailed different degrees of success in the modelling effort...|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of magnesium sulphate attack on concretes containing rice husk ash (RHA, 20 wt% of the cementitious materials) with various average particle sizes was investigated. The total cementitious materials were 390 kg and the water-to-binder ratio (W/B) was 0. 53 for all mixtures. Specimens were initially cured {{in water for}} 7 d and then immersed in the 3 wt% magnesium sulphate solution for up to 111 d of exposure. The specimens were subjected to drying-wetting cycles to accelerate sulphate attack. In addition to the visual monitoring of the specimens, the concrete specimens were subsequently tested for compressive strength, dynamic modulus of elasticity, and length and mass changes. The {{results show that the}} specimens exposed to sulphate attack exhibit higher strength and dynamic modulus than those kept in water. The length change is negligible and {{can be attributed to the}} normal <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> On the other hand, concretes suffers mass loss and surface spalling and softening; the fine RHA-concrete results in a better resistance. For the accelerated sulphate attack method used in this study, mass change and visual monitoring are recommended for assessing the deterioration degree and the effectiveness of supplementary cementitious materials to resist sulphate attack...|$|E
5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the concrete. AAR results in <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>concrete,</b> which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|R

In particular, this model is adopted to examine the durability <b>of</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> structures exposed to a marine environment. At least three aggressive agents in sea water can cause deterioration <b>of</b> the reinforced <b>concrete</b> structures: chloride, sulfate and alkali ions. The specific aggressive action of each aggressive agent is examined: corrosion of the metallic bars caused by chloride ions, damage of the cement paste carried out by sulfate attack, and <b>swelling</b> disruption <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> if alkali-reactive aggregates {{are present in the}} concrete. In order to prevent the damage <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> structures exposed to a marine environment the following measures should be adopted: to reduce the water-cement ratio by using superplasticizers; to employ cementitious binders based on the combination of portland cement with mineral addition such as fly ash and/or blast furnace slag...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> structures {{affected by}} alkali–silica reaction (ASR) {{is a complex}} problem due to the multiscale nature of this long-term phenomenon.

Due to this multiscale nature of the phenomenon, the problem is studied by various researchers in numerous manners. In this paper, a literature review of the main modelling approaches for ASR in concrete is presented within a new perspective.

40|$|The Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR) {{causes the}} <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> {{structures}} and creates microcrackings inside {{the concrete and}} macrocracks at the surface cracks mapping. This phenomenom affects the durability of structures and involves technical and economical issues for structure managers. Development of non-destructives methods, aiming at monitoring ASR evolution, would help managing the structures rehabilitation works. The scope of this thesis is to monitor the evolution of damages associated with ASR using non-destructives methods based on ultrasonic wave propagation and resonant frequencies of concrete specimens {{in order to establish}} criteria associated to each methods. However, {{it is not easy to}} measure ultrasonic properties variations due only to ASR. Indeed, non-destructives methods are sensitive to mixture proportions of concrete and to environmental conditions. In addition, it is difficult to monitor ASR evolution directly on structures because ASR is a very slow reaction (over ten years). In order to achieve this objectives two studies were carried out. The first was conducted in a laboratory. The ASR evolution was monitored with ultrasonic methods (pulse velocity, attenuation and resonant frequencies of concrete specimens) on reactive laboratory concrete specimens (100 x 200 mm or 75 x 75 x 300 mm) kept in accelerated conditions. Temperature and water content of these specimens varied in order to evaluate the effect of these parameters on non-destructives measurements. Mixtures of non-reactive specimens were batched with Limeridge limestone (metamorphic limestone from the Appalachia) and reactive specimens with Spratt limestone or Posdam sandstones. Both reactive aggregates have different reaction rate. Ultrasonic tests that were performed are based on the measure of pick-to-pick amplitudes, ultrasonic wave attenuation in spectral domain, centroid frequencies, rise time and resonant frequencies of concrete specimens. In this thesis we also have studied the ASR evolution was with electrical methods. Results showed that concrete proportion parameters and environmental conditions affect significantly the measurement of electrical resitivity. It is not relevant to use this method to monitor the ASR evolution. Results of electrical measurements are presented in this thesis in order shows the inapplicability of this method. The second study aims at evaluating the in-situ behaviour of some of the non-destructives methods used in the first study. Sonic attenuation topography was performed on a lock. The followings observations and recommendations are drawn: (1) In order to carry out laboratory tests, the study of longitudinal resonant frequencies on cylinders (100 x 200 mm) is the most relevant method for measuring ASR evolution. Furthermore, this method may assess the damage state of concrete, when water content of hardened concrete varied. (2) In the case of structures subjected to high humidity conditions, it is recommended to conduct attenuation tomography based on the inversion of centroid frequencies calculated from the output signal FFT. (3) Finally, if the structures is in a high temperature variation area (temperature less than 4 [degré] C or more than 40 [degré] C), it is recommended to carry out attenuation tomography based on the reverse of rise time calculated with Blair et Spathis method. It is also recommended to use a light weigh hammer (250 g to 450 g) to generate the signal. In order to compare ail the methods, a synthesis table is presented at the end of this thesis. The comparison is made with three criteria: sensitivity of methods to ASR, sensitivity of methods to environment conditions and quality of tomographies obtained with reverse of sonic parameters of each method. This synthesis will help for the planning of future tomography survey of ASR affected concrete structures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sulfate {{attack is}} one of several {{chemical}} and physical mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> deterioration. In actual situation, concrete structures always suffer from the coupled effects of multifactor such as wet-dry cycle and sulfate attack when exposed to tidal area or groundwater level change environment. Partial replacement of cement with mineral admixture {{is one of}} the efficient methods for improving concrete resistance against sulfate attack. In this regard, the resistance <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> with fly ash and slag to sulfate attack was investigated by wet-dry cycle method. The degree of sulfate attack on specimens after different cycles was observed using scanning electron microscopy. The results of compressive strength and percentage of compressive strength evolution factor at various cycling times show an increase in the sulfate resistance <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> with 60 % of fly ash and slag than that only with 40 % fly ash. The microstructural study indicates that the primary cause <b>of</b> deterioration <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> under wet-dry cycle condition is <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the sulfate crystal rather chemical attack...|$|R
40|$|This paper mainly {{discusses}} the deterioration <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> due to temperature rise in concrete {{as a result}} of heat of hydration <b>of</b> cement. When <b>concrete</b> is subjected to high temperature at early age, many physical and chemical changes <b>of</b> the hardened <b>concrete</b> can take place. Recently, severe cracking in some of the pile caps of bridge piers in southern highway project in Sri Lanka was reported. After extensive investigations, {{it was found that the}} main cause for cracking in those pile caps was due to an internal chemical reaction known as delayed ettringite formation (DEF). DEF is sometimes referred to as internal sulphate attack which is an internal <b>swelling</b> reaction <b>of</b> the <b>concrete</b> that occurs in the presence of water without any external ingress of sulphate. It is widely accepted that concrete subjected to high temperature at early age and exposed to moisture continuously or intermittently is likely to crack due to DEF. Experimental investigations also revealed that even when the concrete is subjected to high temperature over a short period during early age, there is a possibility of long term strength reduction and increase in permeability. Apart from maximum temperature rise, it is essential to control temperature gradient across thick concrete members like pile caps, deep beams, bridge piers, raft foundations and concrete dams to prevent cracking. There are many factors affecting early age temperature rise in concrete and subsequent cracking and other deterioration <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> Therefore it is a basic requirement to specify limiting temperatures for any major concrete construction and strictly adhering to the specification during construction in order to avoid expensive remedial actions to rectify damaged concrete due to thermal effects. Apart from controlling maximum temperature rise in <b>concrete</b> and composition <b>of</b> cement, use of fly ash or slag blended cement is effective inpreventing most of the problems associated with temperature rise in concrete...|$|R

The objective {{of this study is}} to develop a numerical model based on microstructural images <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> and fundamental material properties of each constituent <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> subjected to alkali-silica reaction (ASR). A microstructure-based finite element approach is employed directly to analyze the mechanical response <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> to ASR. The modeling work involves acquiring and processing of microstructural images of specimens suffering from ASR using scanning electron microscopy, and implementing finite element program to analyze the microstructural images. The formulation of this model is based on pressure caused by the ASR product and on properties such as Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. The {{finite element analysis}} program used to simulate structural behavior of structures attacked by ASR is object-oriented finite element developed at National Institute of Standards and Technology. The numerical results from this model are compared with experimental data, which have been measured using ASTM standard test C 1260.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{structures}} especially in high humidity environments are endangered by Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR). ASR is characterized by two processes: the first is gel formation resulting from contact between alkali and reactive silica in aggregate particles; the second is water imbibition into the formed basic gel which leads to progressive swelling behavior. In turn, <b>swelling</b> causes deterioration <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> internal structure inducing strength and stiffness loss. Many research efforts were directed towards the evaluation, modeling and treatment of these phenomena but a comprehensive computational model is still lacking. In this paper, the ASR effect is implemented {{within the framework of}} a mesoscale formulation, such as the one of the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), which simulates concrete heterogeneous character. The proposed formulation allows a precise and unique modeling of ASR effect including non-uniform expansions, expansion transfer and heterogeneous cracking. The model can replicate ASR cracking behavior even in free expansion tests. This is a capability that cannot be obtained within classical homogeneous and isotropic continuum based models. In addition, it reproduces reactive aggregate size and distribution effects on the ASR expansion considering temperature and stress state effects. The present model was validated based on the simulation of experiments for free and laterally passively restrained specimens under free expansion. The results showed good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
