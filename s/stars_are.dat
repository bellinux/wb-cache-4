5|$|Because the Moon is {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> occulted.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} a long-held {{assumption}} {{that the majority of}} stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> believed to be part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.|$|E

5|$|According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the {{background}} of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three. In the centre of the ensign is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle. The crescent and <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> taken from the national flag, although in the ensign the crescent appears underneath rather than {{to the left of the}} stars. According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil ensign is the same as that of the national flag. The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032.|$|E

5|$|<b>Stars</b> <b>are</b> {{believed}} to form {{as the result}} of a collapse of a low-temperature cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{main hub}} is the Comet Observatory, a {{spaceship}} which contains six themed domes that {{provide access to}} the 42 galaxies available in the game. Five of the domes end with a boss level in which {{the objective is to}} defeat Bowser or Bowser Jr., which then gives the player access to the next dome via acquiring a collectable called a Grand Star. The player only has access to a few galaxies when they begin the game; as more Power <b>Stars</b> <b>are</b> collected, more galaxies become available. The player is awarded the ability to play as Luigi after collecting 120 Power Stars as Mario. Once 120 Power <b>Stars</b> <b>are</b> collected with both characters, the player is rewarded one further challenge for Mario and Luigi to complete, which upon completion, awards the player with two commemorative pictures that can be sent to the Wii Message Board.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} produces an equatorial bulge due to centrifugal force. As <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> not solid bodies, they can also undergo differential rotation. Thus the equator of the star can rotate at a different angular velocity than the higher latitudes. These differences {{in the rate of}} rotation within a star may have {{a significant role in the}} generation of a stellar magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} {{period of}} each star {{can be measured}} by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines. The absolute rotational velocities of the two <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1±0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> also tidally braked. Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.|$|E
