5000|$|The {{measurement}} of gut mucosal carbon dioxide {{has been used}} to detect decreased blood flow. Accumulation of carbon dioxide is predominantly a result of hypoperfusion and not hypoxia. Because the introduction of a nasogastric tube is almost routine in critically ill patients, the {{measurement of}} gastric carbon dioxide can be an easy method to monitor tissue perfusion. The gastric mucosal pH is measured according to an equation that assumes that arterial bicarbonate is equal to intramucosal bicarbonate, an argument that is not always valid. Given that the gastric mucosal carbon dioxide is the directly measured value, whereas the gastric mucosal pH is the derived and possibly inaccurate value, studies that used gastric pH to monitor perfusion may be inherently flawed. Most studies have failed to effectively affect gastric pH and for this reason failed to produce improvements in outcome. One study, by Gutierrez and colleagues, has shown that therapeutic interventions guided by gastric tonometry improved survival in critically ill patients. In a direct comparison of splanchnic-oriented therapy as guided by gastric tonometry with conventional <b>shock</b> <b>management</b> of trauma patients, {{there was no difference in}} mortality rates, organ dysfunction rates, or length of stay.|$|E

40|$|Paediatric shock {{is still}} a common {{emergency}} of public health importance with an estimated 400, 000 â 500, 000 reported cases annually. Mortality due to paediatric shock has varied over the years. Data in 1980 s show that mortality rates due to septic shock in children were over 50 %; {{but by the end}} of the year 2000 data indicated that though a marked decline in mortality rates had been achieved, it had stagnated at about 20 %. Descriptions of paediatric shock reveal the lack of a common definition and there are important gaps in evidence-based management in different settings. In well-resourced healthcare systems with well-functioning intensive care facilities, the widespread implementation of <b>shock</b> <b>management</b> guidelines based on the Paediatric Advanced Life Support and European Paediatric Advanced Life Support courses have reduced mortality. In resource limited settings with diverse infectious causative agents, the Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment (ETAT) approach is more pragmatic, but its impact remains circumscribed to centres where ETAT has been implemented and sustained. Advocacy for common management pathways irrespective of underlying cause have been suggested. However, in sub Saharan Africa, the diversity of underlying causative organisms and patient phenotypes may limit a single approach to <b>shock</b> <b>management.</b> Data from a large fluid trial (the FEAST trial) in East Africa have provided vital insight to <b>shock</b> <b>management.</b> In this trial febrile children with clinical features of impaired perfusion were studied. Rapid infusion of fluid boluses, irrespective of whether the fluid was colloid or crystalloid, when compared to maintenance fluids alone had an increased risk of mortality at 48 â¯h. All study participants were promptly managed for underlying conditions and comorbidity such as malaria, bacteraemia, severe anaemia, meningitis, pneumonia, convulsions, hypoglycaemia and others. The overall low mortality in the trial suggests the potential contribution of ETAT, the improved standard of care and supportive treatment across the subgroups in the trial. Strengthening systems that enable rapid identification of shock, prompt treatment of children with correct antimicrobials and supportive care such as oxygen administration and blood transfusion may contribute to better survival outcomes in resources limited settings.

40|$|Introduction: Haemorrhagic <b>shock</b> <b>management</b> {{is aimed}} at {{improving}} end organ tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Until recently, studies have relied on global, surrogate markers of tissue oxygenation, or overall morbidity and mortality. Although important, these studies are complicated by multiple confounding variables, and do not look directly at the presumed site of the pathology-the end organ tissue itself. The development of combined microprobe technology and advanced multichannel monitoring provides {{us the opportunity to}} directly measure oxygenation and microvascular fl ow at the end organ tissue level. Objective: To directly assess the real-time changes in tissue oxygenation in key organs, whilst simultaneously assessing typical global markers of resuscitation in sheep being resuscitated from severe (class 4) haemorrhagic shock. To monitor the sustained effect of resuscitation with normal saline or albumin on haemodynamics, tissue oxygenation and perfusion indices in the post-resuscitation period. Methods: Under full anaesthesia, controlled haemorrhage of 30 % total blood volume was affected in 11 sheep. Mean arterial pressure was reduced to below 40 mmHg and this was maintained for 30 mins. Sheep were instrumented to allow monitoring of continuous cardiac output, central venous oxygenation and arterial blood gas status. Direct tissue oxymetry was measured directly and continuously monitored in the brain, skeletal muscle and renal cortex using combined tissue oxymeters and perfusion probes. Sheep were then resuscitated with either normal saline or albumin in equivalent volumes. They were then monitored for 4 hours post resuscitation. Findings: Graphic representation of: Renal perfusion and oxygenation, brain perfusion and oxygenation, skeletal muscle perfusion and oxygenation with minutely vitals/cardiac output, oxygen delivery etc/tissue O 2 from 15 min before haemorrhage to half hour post transfusion for each group (saline and albumin) Conclusions: Saline is at least as effective as albumin in improving end organ oxygenation and perfusion in haemorrhagic <b>shock</b> <b>management...</b>|$|E

High-fidelity simulation-based training is a new teaching technology in our faculty which may improve the performance of medical students in the resuscitation process. However, since the efficacy of this training method in our institute is limited, we organized an extra class for this evaluation. Purpose: The aim was to evaluate the effect on medical students’ knowledge and confidence levels after the high-fidelity medical simulation training in septic <b>shock</b> <b>management.</b> Methods: A retrospective study was performed in sixth year medical students during an internal medicine rotation between November 2015 and March 2016. The simulation class was a 2 -hour session of a septic <b>shock</b> <b>management</b> scenario and post-training debriefing. Knowledge assessment was determined by a five-question pre-test and post-test examination. At the end of the class, the students completed their confidence evaluation questionnaire. Results: Of the 79 medical students, the mean percentage score ± standard deviation (SD) of the post-test examination was statistically significantly higher than the pre-test (66. 83 %± 19. 7 % vs 47. 59 %± 19. 7 %, p< 0. 001). In addition, the student mean percentage confidence level ± SD in management of septic shock was significantly better after the simulation class (68. 10 %± 12. 2 % vs 51. 64 %± 13. 1 %, p< 0. 001). They also strongly suggested applying this simulation class to the current curriculum.

30|$|Testing for fluid {{responsiveness}} {{may help}} one {{to decide to}} administer fluid. However, equally important, testing for fluid responsiveness may help {{in the decision to}} stop fluid administration or not to administer fluids at all. The decision to stop fluid administration should be made on the disappearance of signs of circulatory failure, the appearance of signs of fluid overload and when the tests of preload responsiveness become negative [89]. Testing preload dependence may also be helpful in the de-escalation phase of <b>shock</b> <b>management.</b> At this stage, fluid removal is often undertaken, but the volume to be removed is difficult to estimate. In critically ill patients at the late phase of shock, our group recently showed that a PLR test performed before starting fluid removal predicts intradialytic hypotension with accuracy, especially with good specificity and positive predictive value [90]. This suggests that preload responsiveness should be assessed before starting fluid removal in order to avoid any haemodynamic deterioration.|$|E
