40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{the knowledge}} capabilities of industry incumbents affected the generation, development, {{and performance of}} “spin-outs ” (entrepreneurial ventures of ex-employees). Analyses of 1977 – 97 data from the disk drive industry supported our hypothesis that incumbents with both strong technological and market pioneering know-how generate fewer <b>spin-outs</b> than firms with strength in {{only one of these}} areas. Also, an incumbent’s capabilities at the time of a <b>spin-out’s</b> founding positively affect the <b>spin-out’s</b> knowledge capabilities and its probability of survival. In certain high-technology industries, spin-outs—a distinctive class of entrepreneurial entrants that inherit knowledge from industry incumbents through their founders—are not only legion, but are also major innovators. <b>Spin-outs</b> (entrepreneurial ventures by ex-employees of an incumbent firm) are widespread in industries such as semiconduc-tors (Braun & MacDonald, 1978), disk drive...|$|R

Examples include products developed by Swedish company , a technology <b>spin-out</b> from Saab Group. Another {{example is the}} products developed from the early University of Southampton prototypes by Perpetuum. These have to be sufficiently large to generate the power required by wireless sensor nodes (wsn)but in M2M applications this is not normally an issue.

40|$|Business {{start-up}} {{through the}} incubation process {{from the university}} sector is normally focused on the high-tech, potential high-growth end of the market. Successes from key centres worldwide include the excellent record of Stanford and MIT. Closer to home, the university and science park links at the University of Twente in Holland are often cited as good practice. Best practice universities appear to have some areas in common, for example, sources of funds, networking, mentoring and student recruitment. The Scottish university sector has been criticised {{in the past for}} not performing to the standards achieved elsewhere and the purpose of the exploratory research outlined in this paper is to determine how well the Scottish universities perform when compared with the best. Data gathered from the top universities in the USA illustrates that a number of key benchmarks are in operation. These include the number of <b>spin-outs,</b> the number of patents filed and the volume of sponsored research. For example, in 1997, the top 11 averaged nine <b>spin-outs,</b> 163 patents filed and $ 588. 5 m sponsored research. These figures are between three to four times greater than the average of the whole population included in the US survey. The averages from a sample of Scottish universities revealed three <b>spin-outs,</b> 14 patents filed and $ 49. 5 m in sponsored research. This paper explores the underlying data, examines the differences and presents arguments for a change in the policy direction for <b>spin-outs</b> and expectations from commercialisation of university incubator organisations...|$|R
40|$|University <b>spin-outs</b> are {{increasing}} in economic importance; yet {{the process by}} which these firms develop remains only partially understood. This is a study of four biotechnology <b>spin-outs</b> from the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. Their lack of resources curtails the extent of their growth. They cannot devote their limited resources to basic science. Moreover, they lack the resources to become involved in the sales and marketing of their products. They must operate in a valley, using scientific research conducted externally to develop commercially-viable products, then passing them off to other companies to distribute. For this reason, networks and alliances with other firms and organisations are essential for the successful growth and development of the university spin-off...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{entrepreneurship}} {{and corporate}} spin-offs have gained importance {{over the last}} decades. Corporate spin-offs play an increasingly {{important role in the}} development and growth of emerging, high-technology industries, thereby contributing to economic growth. While previous studies on corporate spin-offs have taken the established firm as a point of departure, a central issue concerns the locus of entrepreneurs. We adopt a bottom-up approach by considering those spin-offs that are created by employees, based upon an opportunity spotted while working for the parent company. Based upon the knowledge-based theory of the firm and the literature on opportunity identification, we develop a typology of corporate spin-offs. We identified three types of corporate spin-offs: Assisted <b>spin-outs,</b> Restructuring-driven <b>spin-outs</b> and Entrepreneurial Spin-offs. These types of corporate spin-offs differ from each other in terms of nature and formality of knowledge transfer; detection and implementation of opportunity identification; and performance. Based upon an in-depth analysis of 41 corporate spin-offs in Flanders, we found that Entrepreneurial Spin-offs outperform both Assisted and Restructuring-driven <b>spin-outs</b> on all four performance indicators. Our findings imply that parent companies often miss possibilities to capture value from opportunities that were originally developed in the parent company. ...|$|R
25|$|The University of Southampton Science Park {{contains}} approximately 50 {{businesses that}} either wish {{to work with}} the university or were established by the university itself and which use the surroundings of the park to grow. Originally established in 1983 as Chilworth Science Park, named after the manor house that is now a luxury hotel and conference centre, the park houses business incubator units to help these companies. The companies occupying the park range in expertise and fields including oil and gas exploration, pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology and optoelectronics, with the businesses being particularly effective with three of the twelve successful <b>spin-out</b> companies created since 2000 being floated on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) with a combined market capitalisation value of £160 million.

40|$|The role of new ventures for {{technology}} transfer from universities and research institutions to companies and between companies {{focused on the}} chemical and pharmaceutical industry are discussed in this article. Different aspects of this technology transfer approach like the maturity of the technology, the acquisition of additional resources and the technology transfer results have been analysed based on case studies from the chemical and pharmaceutical industry in Germany and Switzerland. Especially established industries like the chemical and pharmaceutical industry rely on effective and efficient technology transfer to maintain their global competitiveness. Academic spin-offs can help to transfer technologies to the industry if further research and development work is out of scope of the academic institutions. Corporate <b>spin-outs</b> are an alternative to closing operations should these no longer fit into the parent organization. For technology transfer, both spinoffs and <b>spin-outs</b> can be integrated into a new parent company or work as service provider. Internal start-ups were identified as a new approach for company internal technology transfer from research departments to business units focused on commercial operations to overcome innovation barriers within companies...|$|R

500|$|A crucial {{maneuver}} in Crash Team Racing is {{the power}} slide; the player executes the slide by holding {{down one of the}} shoulder buttons to perform a hop, and steering before the kart lands. While sliding, the [...] "Turbo Boost Meter" [...] on the lower-right corner of the screen fills up and goes from green to red. At the same time, the exhaust gas from the player's kart turns black. To get a speed boost, the player quickly presses the opposite shoulder button while the Turbo Boost Meter is red. The player can execute three speed boosts in a row during a power slide, with the third speed boost being more powerful than the previous two. If the player waits too long into the power slide for a boost, the kart back-fires and the chance for a speed boost is lost; power sliding for too long causes a <b>spin-out.</b> Aside from power slides, speed boosts can be obtained by gathering [...] when leaping over gaps in the track. The longer the player is in the air, the bigger the speed boost will be when the kart lands.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} a conceptual framework in order to inquire into the dynamic growth process of university <b>spin-outs</b> (hereafter referred to as USOs) in China, attempting to understand the configuration of capabilities that are necessary for dynamic growth. Based on the extant literature and empirical cases, the study attempts to address the following question: How do USOs in China build and configure the innovation capabilities {{to cope with the}} dynamic growth? This paper aims to contribute to the existing literature by providing a theoretical discussion on the USOs' dynamic entrepreneurial process, by investigating the interconnections between innovation problem-solving and the required configuration of innovation capabilities in four growth phases. Further, it takes particular interest in the integrative capabilities and their impact on the USOs' entrepreneurial innovation process, in terms of knowledge integration, alliance, venture finance and venture governance. To date, studies have investigated the dynamic development process of USOs in China and have recognized the heterogeneity of USOs.
