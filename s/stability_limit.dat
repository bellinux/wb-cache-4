40|$|Compared to the {{vehicles}} with conventional steering, the articulated frame steer vehicles (ASV) {{are known to}} exhibit lower directional and roll <b>stability</b> <b>limits.</b> Furthermore, the tire interactions with relatively rough terrains could adversely affect the directional and roll <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> of an ASV due to terrain-induced variations in the vertical and lateral tire forces. It may thus be desirable to assess the dynamic safety of ASVs {{in terms of their}} directional control and <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> while operating on different terrains. The effects of terrain roughness on the directional <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> of an ASV are investigated through simulations of a comprehensive three-dimensional model of the vehicle with and without a rear axle suspension. The model incorporates a torsio-elastic rear axle suspension, a kineto-dynamic model of the frame steering struts and equivalent random profiles of different undeformable terrains together with coherence between the two tracks profiles. The simulations are performed to determine the <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> of the ASV models while operating on different terrains, namely: a perfectly smooth surface, plowed field, pasture, gravel road, and the MVEE random course. The directional <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> are defined in terms of the static and dynamic rollover thresholds, rearward amplification ratio, and critical speed corresponding to snaking instability under steady and transient steering inputs. The results suggest that the tire interactions with the rough terrains affect the <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> of both the unsuspended and suspended vehicles in a highly adverse manner. The suspended vehicle responses, however, show less sensitivity to variations in the road roughness profile...|$|R

40|$|A digital {{distributed}} parameter {{model was}} used to {{study the effects of}} propellant-feed- system coupling and various hydraulic parameters on the analytical prediction of chugging instabilities. Coupling between the combustion chamber and feed system was controlled by varying the compliance of the injector-dome region. The coupling with the feed system above the pump was varied by changing the amount of cavitation compliance at the pump inlet. The <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> and chugging frequencies proved to be strongly dependent on the degree of feed-system coupling. The maximum stability condition occurred with intermediate coupling. Under conditions of a high degree of feed-system-combustor coupling, the <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> and chugging frequencies were primarily dependent on the feed-system characteristics; the responses were characterized by beating patterns. For the system analyzed, the pump suction line had little effect on the <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> or chugging frequencies. Beating, present under the condition of near zero injector -dome compliance, was eliminated when the suction line was decoupled by employing a sufficiently high value of pump-inlet compliance. Under conditions of maximum feed-system coupling, the magnitude and distribution of line losses in the discharge line had a significant effect on the <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> but had negligible effect on the chugging frequency and beating characteristics. Also, the length of the discharge line greatly affected the <b>stability</b> <b>limits,</b> chugging frequency, and beating characteristics. The length of the suction line, however, had little effect on the <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> and chugging frequency but did influence the beating pattern.

This paper studies the machining stability in milling of thin-walled plates and develops a three-dimensional stability lobe diagram of the spindle speed, tool position, and axial depth of cut. The workpiece-holder system is modeled as a 2 -degree-of-freedom system considering that the tool system is much more rigid than the thin-walled plate, and dynamic equations of motion described for the workpiece-holder system are solved numerically in time domain to compute the dynamic displacements of the thin-walled plate. Statistical variances of the dynamic displacements are then employed as a chatter detection criterion to acquire the stability lobe diagram. The experimentally obtained <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> correspond well with the predicted <b>stability</b> <b>limits.</b> In addition, influence of feed rate on <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> is also investigated. By performing frequency analysis of the measured cutting forces to judge if chatter occurs, it is found that feed per tooth has little influence on the <b>stability</b> <b>limits.</b> However, feed per tooth impacts the machined surface quality.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{aerodynamic}} stability {{of a proposed}} suspension bridge crossing the Sognefjord. Such a bridge will require a main span of approximately 3700 m, almost double the span length of the current record holder. For such a long span and slender suspension bridge its aerodynamic properties are highly important. A comparison of the aerodynamic <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> using three different configurations of a so-called vented or dual box girder has been done. The only difference in each configuration is the center-to-center distance between the individual box girders. The design of the individual girders and the cable system is kept constant. A modal approach to solving the equation of motion has been employed where the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes have been computed using a computer program called ALVSAT. The numerical calculations of <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> as well as dynamic response have been done using self-written MATLAB scripts based on well-established theory of bridge aerodynamics. Aerodynamic derivatives from wind tunnel tests have been obtained from {{a report on the}} similar cross section of the proposed Brusymfonien bridge.

50|$|Liquid {{sloshing}} strongly {{influences the}} directional dynamics and safety performance of highway tank vehicles {{in a highly}} adverse manner. Hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from liquid cargo oscillations in the tank under steering and/or braking maneuvers reduce the <b>stability</b> <b>limit</b> and controllability of partially-filled tank vehicles. Anti-slosh devices such as baffles are widely used in order to limit the adverse liquid slosh effect on directional performance and stability of the tank vehicles. Since most of the time, tankers are carrying dangerous liquid contents such as ammonia, gasoline and fuel oils; therefore stability of partially-filled liquid cargo vehicles is very important. Optimizations and sloshing reduction techniques in fuel tanks such as elliptical tank, rectangular, modified oval and generic tank shape have been performed in different filling levels using numerical, analytical and analogical analyses. Most of these studies concentrate on effects of baffles on sloshing while the influence of cross-section is completely ignored.|$|E

40|$|Key words Sun: {{magnetic}} fields – instabilities The stability of {{magnetic fields}} in the solar tachocline is investigated. We present <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> for higher azimuthal wave numbers and results on the dependence of the stability on the location of toroidal magnetic fields in latitude. While the dependence of the wave number with the largest growth rate on the magnetic field strength and the magnetic Prandtl number is small, the dependence on the magnetic Reynolds number Rm indicates that lowest azimuthal modes are excited for very high Rm. Upon varying the latitudinal position of the magnetic field belts, we find slightly lower <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> for high latitudes, and very large <b>stability</b> <b>limits</b> at latitudes below 10 ◦, with little dependence on latitude in between. An increase of the maximum possible field was achieved by adding a poloidal field.
