5|$|On 7 October 1800, off Sand Heads, near Calcutta, Confiance met the 40-gun East Indiaman Kent, of 824tons burthen, under Captain Robert Rivington. Kent had rescued {{the crew}} of another ship, the Queen, {{destroyed}} by fire, and therefore had an exceptionally large complement of 437 men, including her passengers; 300 of them were soldiers and sailors; Surcouf managed to board his larger opponent and, after over {{an hour and a}} half of battle across the decks of the ship, <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the Kent.|$|E

5|$|Waffen-SS units {{which had}} survived the summer campaigns were {{withdrawn}} from the front line to refit. Two of them, the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, did so in the Arnhem region of Holland in early September 1944. Coincidentally, on 17 September, the Allies launched {{in the same area}} Operation Market Garden, a combined airborne and land operation designed to <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the lower Rhine. The 9th and 10th Panzers were among the units that repulsed the attack.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{improved}} Parisian defences, Henry V of England captured Paris in 1420 and the Bastille was seized and garrisoned by the English {{for the next}} sixteen years. Henry V appointed Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, as the new captain of the Bastille. The English made more use of the Bastille as a prison; in 1430 there was a minor rebellion when some prisoners overpowered a sleeping guard and attempted to <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the fortress; this incident includes the first reference to a dedicated gaoler at the Bastille.|$|E
5|$|Duncan initiates {{the player}} into the Grey Wardens through a {{dangerous}} ritual called the Joining, which involves imbibing Darkspawn blood. The recipient is either killed or imbued with the powerful darkspawn essence, the Taint, granting them {{the ability to}} sense Darkspawn and a rudimentary connection into their hive mind. Afterwards, the player and fellow Grey Warden, Alistair, are tasked with lighting a beacon {{at the top of}} the fortress to signal Loghain's men into charging the horde's flank. However, upon arriving, Loghain abandons the battlefield with his army, leaving Cailan, Duncan, and their army to be overwhelmed and slain by the Darkspawn, who <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Ostagar and begin advancing into southern Ferelden.|$|E
5|$|Following his Macedonian triumph, Pyrrhus was {{approached}} by his officer Cleonymus. The Spartan convinced the Epiriote king to aid him in a scheme to <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> his homeland. Cleonymus' reasons for seeking to attack Sparta were twofold. Firstly, he was angry {{that he had been}} overlooked for the Agiad kingship of Sparta in favour of his nephew, Areus II. Plutarch ascribes Cleonymus' failure to secure the throne to his arbitrariness and violent nature. Furthermore, Cleonymus had become a target of ridicule in Sparta by the fact that his new wife, Chilonis, was engaging in an affair with Acrotatus, the son of Areus.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, Hess {{enrolled}} in the University of Munich, where he studied geopolitics under Karl Haushofer, a proponent {{of the concept of}} Lebensraum ("living space"), which later became one of the pillars of Nazi Party (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP) ideology. Hess joined the NSDAP on 1 July 1920, and was at Hitler's side on 8 November 1923 for the Beer Hall Putsch, a failed Nazi attempt to <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the government of Bavaria. Whilst serving time in jail for this attempted coup, Hess helped Hitler write his book, Mein Kampf, which became a foundation of the political platform of the NSDAP.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, the {{military}} {{committee of the}} Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party spent most of its time plannining to take power through a conventional military coup. The military committee decided it had to capture al-Kiswah and Qatana, two military camps, <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the 70th Armoured Brigade at al-Kiswah, the Military Academy {{in the city of}} Homs and the Damascus radio station. While the conspirators of {{the military}} committee were all young, the sitting regime had been slowly disintegrating and the traditional elite had lost effective political power.|$|E
5|$|In May 1923, {{the unit}} was renamed Stoßtrupp-Hitler ("Shock Troop-Hitler"). The unit was solely {{responsible}} for Hitler's protection. On 9 November 1923 the Stoßtrupp, along with the SA and several other paramilitary units, {{took part in the}} Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. The plan was to <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the city in a coup d'état and then challenge the government in Berlin. The putsch was quickly crushed by the local police and resulted in the death of 16 Nazi supporters and 4 police officers. In the aftermath of the failed putsch both Hitler, Schreck, and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated at Landsberg Prison. The Nazi Party and all associated formations, including the Stoßtrupp, were officially disbanded.|$|E

5|$|The LM {{sought to}} <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the LCL agenda by winning key {{positions}} on the state executive at the annual general meeting in September, but this was difficult as the malapportionment towards rural groups was entrenched at party level, and because the conservatives had anticipated the LM's plans. The LM President Alex Perryman challenged McLachlan for the party presidency and in a high-profile contest received 47% {{of the vote in}} a narrow defeat. He received around 90% among urban delegates and around 33% of the rural votes, the latter figure shocking the conservatives. The LM later generated more publicity by inquiring about alleged impropriety in the balloting process.|$|E
5|$|The clash {{began after}} rebel Serbs seized the town's {{police station and}} {{municipal}} building and harassed Croatian government officials. The Croatian government carried out a counterstrike against the rebels, sending Interior Ministry special police to re-establish control. Fighting broke out between the two sides. Despite an attempted intervention by the Yugoslav National Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA), the Croatian government reasserted its control over the town. After a standoff with the JNA, an agreement {{to pull out the}} special police and the JNA was reached, restoring the town to conditions before the Serb attempt to <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the police there.|$|E
5|$|The {{last great}} {{ruler of the}} Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III, allowed Semitic-speaking Canaanite {{settlers}} from the Near East into the delta region to provide a sufficient labour force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with severe Nile floods later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During this decline, the Canaanite settlers began to <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos.|$|E

5|$|Although Morton {{was able}} to keep the state united during {{the first phase of the}} war, once {{emancipation}} became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E
5|$|Castro stockpiled {{weapons for}} a planned {{attack on the}} Moncada Barracks, a {{military}} garrison outside Santiago de Cuba, Oriente. Castro's militants intended to dress in army uniforms and arrive at the base on July 25, the festival of St James, when many officers would be away. The rebels would seize control, raid the armory and escape before reinforcements arrived. Supplied with new weaponry, Castro intended to arm supporters and spark a revolution among Oriente's impoverished cane cutters. The plan was to then <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> a Santiago radio station, broadcasting the Movement's manifesto, hence promoting further uprisings. Castro's plan emulated those of the 19th century Cuban independence fighters who had raided Spanish barracks; Castro saw himself as the heir to independence leader and national hero José Martí.|$|E
5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one way or another.|$|E

5|$|In {{a three-part}} series {{published}} between February and May 1994, Brock attempts to save San Francisco {{as it is}} besieged by an army of goblins. Morbius the Living Vampire and the Demogoblin are magically transported from New York; Morbius joins Brock to defeat the goblins, led by criminal-turned-politician Charles Palentine (who wears a magic necklace which controls the goblins). Palentine uses fear of the goblin attacks to <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the city and convince its citizens to burn it down. Demogoblin takes the necklace, and the liberated goblins attack Palentine. Demogoblin then leads the goblins across the Golden Gate Bridge, ordering them to leap to their deaths. Demogoblin and Morbius then leave for New York. Of DCD's 300 bestselling issues of 1994, Venom: Enemy Within #2 was number 286; the remaining issues did not chart.|$|E
5|$|On 26 June, Iraqi {{government}} forces launched an airborne assault on Tikrit {{with three or}} four commando helicopters flown into a stadium at the University of Tikrit. One of the helicopters was shot down and crash-landed at the stadium, while another had to conduct an emergency landing after suffering a mechanical failure. The crew of the second helicopter, which included a Lebanese pilot, was then captured by insurgents. Fierce fighting then ensued around the university compound, while army snipers positioned themselves on tall buildings in the university complex. In {{the early hours of the}} assault, a helicopter gunship struck the city's hospital compound. By the next day, sporadic clashes continued at the university as Iranian-trained Shiite militiamen were dispatched and managed to <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> tall buildings in the university area.|$|E

He surrounded the home of General Khánh and Gia Long Palace, the residence of head of state Phan Khắc Sửu. The tanks were led by Colonel Dương Hiếu Nghĩa, a Catholic member of the Đại Việt. The country was still trying to find stability, with Phan Huy Quát being appointed prime minister just three days earlier. Khánh managed to escape and flee to Vũng Tàu. His plane lifted off from Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the country's military headquarters, just as rebel tanks were rolling in, attempting to block the runway. Thảo's men tried to capture the Saigon base of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, and its commander, Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, but were foiled, but they did capture a number of junta members at Tan Son Nhut.|$|E
