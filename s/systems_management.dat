5|$|Although {{the emperor}} held supreme power, he more often sought {{the advice of}} his cabinet and other ministers before making {{decisions}} and when revoking them. He often assembled leading officials for debates or discussions on policy, known as court conferences (tingyi 廷議). Various issues were debated at these gatherings, such as installment of new emperors, enfeoffment of nobles, the establishment of new ancestral temples, reforms to the state religion, the monetary or tax <b>systems,</b> <b>management</b> of government monopolies on salt and iron (when they existed during Western Han), the introduction of new laws or the repeal of old ones, complex lawsuits, or whether or not to declare war on a foreign country or accept peaceful negotiation. Although the emperor could reject the decisions reached by his court conference, he did so at the risk of alienating his leading ministers. More often than not, he was forced to accept the majority consensus of his ministers, whose individual opinions were equally tallied regardless of their standing or salary-rank.|$|E

40|$|<b>System</b> <b>management</b> {{is a very}} human-centric process, {{frequently}} {{requiring a}} system administrator to intervene to complete tasks. This is because the knowledge about what steps to take and which software to use lies with the administrator. To reduce the humancentric nature of <b>system</b> <b>management,</b> we present a new rules-based approach to <b>system</b> <b>management</b> called Honcho. Honcho uses a knowledge base to capture knowledge associated with performing <b>system</b> <b>management</b> tasks. Using this knowledge, Honcho automates <b>system</b> <b>management</b> tasks, thereby enabling administrators to focus on more challenging problems. We demonstrate that our approach results in a flexible and extensible system that can easily manage diverse heterogeneous platforms. 1...|$|R

His <b>systems</b> <b>management</b> experience served him well in his new post. In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
