5|$|The protoplasmodium, a microscopic, {{undifferentiated}} granular {{mass with}} a slime sheath, is transparent and colourless. A single sporangiophore (the fruiting structure) is produced from the <b>semispherical</b> protoplasmodium, which is approximately {{one and a}} half times the diameter of mature sporangia.

50|$|Nuclear pasta phases are theorized {{to exist}} in the inner crust of neutron stars, forming a {{transition}} region between the conventional matter at the surface, and the ultradense matter at the core. Towards the top of this transition region, the pressure is great enough that conventional nuclei will be condensed into much more massive semi-spherical collections. These formations would be unstable outside the star, due to their high neutron content and size, which can vary between tens and hundreds of nucleons. This <b>semispherical</b> phase is known as the gnocchi phase.|$|E

50|$|The 2-2.2 mm x 2-2.2 mm shell has a {{characteristic}} <b>semispherical</b> shape like a bee skep basket. The shell has 6 convex whorls which increase gradually in size. The sutures are deep.

These ribs function as a diffraction grating, giving the yellow shell a silky appearance.The apertural margin is simple and breaks easily. There are no folds inside the aperture. The umbilicus is narrow. Juveniles are paler with weaker ribs at the lower side, and the umbilicus relatively wider.|$|E
50|$|The silver relic-box is {{the oldest}} part of the item. It is {{contained}} in a removable golden frame and in the Middle Ages it was probably worn by the Bishop around his neck in processions or dangerous situations (e.g. the Battle of Dinkler). The peculiar, <b>semispherical</b> form of the box has no predecessor. The surface is decorated with an engraved Tree of Life, with gilding in the leaves. This decoration has parallels in the early ninth century. The box might therefore derive from the Carolingian court workshop of this earlier time. It is found even in the cathedral's oldest treasury records.|$|E
50|$|Species of Tanypezidae are {{relatively}} large, and have <b>semispherical</b> heads and stout bodies that are perched atop long, thin legs, {{the latter of}} which have sometimes allied them with the families Neriidae and Micropezidae. The head and thorax are also often very dark with contrasting silver- (sometimes golden-) haired stripes and spots. Furthermore, apical convergence of wing veins R4+5 and M1 occurs, and no vibrissae, setulae on the upper surface of vein R1, and a large, flat “ocellar disc behind the ocelli. Little is known of the biology of tanypezid species, but T. longimana is known from low vegetation in humid deciduous woodlands, often around running water.|$|E

50|$|Several Etruscan shields {{have been}} {{recovered}} from Etruscan grave sites. The shields are traditionally decorated bronze circular disks measuring around a yard across. Earlier Etruscan shields are flat and later examples have a slightly convex curve across {{the body of the}} shield. The later styles bear close resemblance to contemporary Greek models. There are several helmet designs found at Etruscan sites, the most distinctively Etruscan being the so-called “crested helm” variety. The crest is fashioned by joining two embossed plates (or laminae) into a high peak pointed crest. The high crest is frequently embossed with decoration. In addition to the Crested Helm a number of other varieties of helms have been found in Etruscan tombs. Often the design is a semi-spherical cap, with no decoration or with appliques. Another variation to the common <b>semispherical</b> cap is cheek guards attached by hinges.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the tourist}} attractions in and around Virajpet are the Ayyappa temple halfway up and the Shiva temple {{at the top of}} the Malethirike hill, a <b>semispherical</b> hill at Kakotuparambu which is about 8 km from Virajpet, St. Anne's church which is about 220 years old and has been built in Gothic {{architecture}} style.

The town is famous for its huge plantations of local coffee and spice crops. Virajpet is the largest honey producer in Asia. Ayyappa Temple and Shiva Temple on the top of Malethirike Hill, a semi-spherical hill at Kakotuparambu, are the prominent attractions that attract thousands of devotees.|$|E
50|$|Globidens was ~6 m (20 ft) {{in length}} and in {{appearance}} very much like other mosasaurs (streamlined body with flippers, a laterally flattened tail and powerful jaws). The teeth of Globidens differed from those of other mosasaurs in being globular, giving rise to its generic name. Generally, most mosasaurs had sharp teeth evolved to grab soft, slippery prey like fish and squid, which in some later species were modified to rend flesh, as well. While many other mosasaurs were capable of crushing the shells of ammonites, none were as specialized for dealing with armored prey as Globidens. Globidens had <b>semispherical</b> teeth with rounded nubbin-like points, which were much better suited for crushing tough armored prey like small turtles, ammonites, nautili, and bivalves. Like its larger relative, Mosasaurus, Globidens had a robustly built skull with tightly-articulating jaws. Such features no doubt played {{a large role in}} its ability to penetrate the armor of its shelled prey.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the pangolin, as it is {{difficult}} to study in the wild. Pangolins are solitary animals and only interact for mating. They dig and live in deep burrows made of <b>semispherical</b> chambers. These burrows are large enough for humans to crawl into and stand up. Although it is capable of digging its own burrow, the ground pangolin prefers to occupy those abandoned by warthogs or aardvarks or to lie in dense vegetation, making it even more difficult to observe. African pangolins such as the ground pangolin prefer burrows, while Asian pangolins sleep in hollows and forks of trees and logs. They are nocturnal animals. They mark their territory with urine, secretions, and by scattering their feces. When threatened, their defense mechanism is to curl into a ball with their scales outward, hiss and puff, and lash out with their sharp-edged tails. The scales on the tails are capable of a cutting action to inflict serious wounds. Pangolins are also capable of emitting noxious acid from glands near the anus, similar to a skunk, to ward off predators. The ground pangolin's main predators are leopards, hyenas, and humans. Young pangolins ride on the base of their mothers' tails and slip under the mother when she curls up for protection.|$|E

The <b>semispherical</b> microelectrodes are capable of producing strong electric field gradients, and in turn dielectrophoretic forces across a large area of channel cross-section. The <b>semispherical</b> shape of microelectrodes avoids the formation of undesired sharp electric fields along the structure and also minimizes the disturbance of the streamlines of nearby passing fluid. The advantage of <b>semispherical</b> microelectrodes over the planar microelectrodes is demonstrated {{in a series of}} numerical simulations and proof-of-concept experiments aimed toward immobilization of viable yeast cells...|$|E
