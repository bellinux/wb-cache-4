25|$|A <b>string</b> <b>trimmer</b> is a powered {{handheld}} device {{that uses a}} flexible monofilament line instead of a blade for cutting grass and trimming other plants near objects. It consists of a cutting head {{at the end of}} a long shaft with a handle or handles and sometimes a shoulder strap. String trimmers powered by an internal combustion engine have the engine on the opposite end of the shaft from the cutting head while electric string trimmers typically have an electric motor in the cutting head. Used frequently in lawn and garden care, the <b>string</b> <b>trimmer</b> is more popularly known by the brandnames Weedeater or Weedwhacker. The <b>string</b> <b>trimmer</b> was invented in 1971 by George Ballas of Houston, Texas.|$|E

5000|$|For over {{a century}} Gibson went {{to the ends of}} the Earth and into the deepest forests to obtain the finest wood on the planet to hand make their instruments. Generations of luthiers carried on the skills of their trade. As the guitar {{industry}} underwent the change to mass production more guitars were produced cheaper. The demand for old growth trees for premium specialty wood increased rapidly. Restoring a fine classic instrument to new, or better than new condition is by far a better environmental choice than buying a new guitar. Collectors want to keep their guitars as close to original as possible, however there are some popular modifications Victory owners have made without damaging the instrument. Change out those nylon inserts, they dampen sustain, Victories were engineered to ring like a bell. Look in to a Stetsbar tremolo system if your Victory does not have the original Kahler tremolo system. The Stetsbar tremolo system bolts right on to the original posts without any routing or drilling. Consider locking machine heads with automatic <b>string</b> <b>trim,</b> they are easy to do yourself and they keep your guitar in tune even better. If the frets on your Victory are worn out, have a luther re-fret your fret board with stainless steel fret wire, the frets will last forever and you will never find better ebony. Do you want more control over string height on your Victory? Install a string height adjustable brass nut, especially if you like to play slide and fret at the same time - you can get your string height perfect. Victories were built tough and stiff to easily handle the high tension of using much heavier string gauges for slide without fret buzz and without tuning down. Let those big ol' cables ring! Keep all of your original parts in a safe place. Exact match paint for your Victory can now be mixed with the use of a hand held [...] "Spectrophotometer" [...] at your local auto paint supply, just bring it in.|$|R
50|$|The Gay-Munroe House {{stands on}} the west side of Highland Avenue, in a {{residential}} area northwest of Auburn's central business district. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a roughly T-shaped plan that has a hip roof and cross gable projecting section, with a hip-roof ell extending to the rear. A square cupola with pyramidal roof stands atop the roof between brick chimneys. The building is clad predominantly in vinyl siding, but most of its 19th-century decorative trim elements have been preserved. The front facade consists of a single projecting bay, two stories in height, with a narrow gable-roof dormer projecting from the roof. The dormer is decorated with Stick style woodwork, a detail repeated in the larger projecting side gable section. A single-story porch stands in the corner made by that section, supported by turned posts and balustrade. <b>String</b> courses of <b>trim</b> band the building at the lintel and sill levels of the windows on both levels.|$|R
50|$|The former Allen Hotel {{building}} {{stands in}} downtown Pittsfield {{on the west}} side of Wendell Avenue Extension, just north of East Street (United States Route 7). It is a five-story steel and masonry structure, its exterior finished in buff yellow brick with marble trim. It is crowned by a flat roof with an extended cornice decorated with modillions and dentil moulding. The front facade is divided into three sections. The ground floor functions as a raised basement, with wide segmented-arch housing multipart windows flanking a deeply recessed entrance. A narrow <b>trim</b> <b>string</b> course runs at the base of the windows, with a wider one separating the first and second levels. The second through fourth levels each have paired sash windows in the center, sharing a common lintel, while the side bays have rectangular windows in an inverted Palladian form. Another string course separates the fourth and fifth floors, with three-part windows flanking central paired windows.|$|R
50|$|String {{trimmers}} can {{be dangerous}} tools {{due to the fact}} that they can cause debris, including rocks and stones, to go flying in several directions. For this reason, it is typical for the person who is using a <b>string</b> <b>trimmer</b> to wear either safety glasses or a visor to protect the face and particularly the eyes as a stone in the eye could cause a person to be blinded for life. This, however, does not offer any protection for passersby, or nearby people who may also be vulnerable to being hit by debris from a <b>string</b> <b>trimmer.</b> In addition to the safety risk posed to individual people, the debris from <b>string</b> <b>trimmer</b> also has the potential to cause damage to cars and buildings, with a particularly high risk of breaking glass on windows.|$|E

40|$|The working point, i. e., the {{fractional}} {{part of the}} betatron tunes, {{is one of the}} key parameters for machine operation. This paper reports on systematic studies in LEP on the dependence of beam sizes and beam lifetimes on betatron tunes. For these studies the horizontal and vertical tunes have been varied by an automatic measurement sequencer over the wide range 0. 1 to 0. 4 and beam sizes and lifetimes have been recorded in parallel. I. MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE During a tune scan the betatron tunes of LEP are changed by trimming the main quadrupole <b>strings.</b> The available <b>trim</b> range is #q h ##q v## 0 # 15 with a resolution of 0. 001. The maximum number of trim steps is 400 and the time interval between tune changes is 2 seconds, hence a complete scan takes about 12 minutes measurement time. Synchronous to the tune variations several beam parameters are recorded. The tunes themselves are tracked by the LEP q-meter in PLL mode [1]. The transverse beam dimensions are recorded from the UV-monito [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Ten {{families}} of subprograms are bundled {{together for the}} General-Purpose Ada Packages. The families bring to Ada many features from HAL/S, PL/I, FORTRAN, and other languages. These families are: <b>string</b> subprograms (INDEX, <b>TRIM,</b> LOAD, etc.); scalar subprograms (MAX, MIN, REM, etc.); array subprograms (MAX, MIN, PROD, SUM, GET, and PUT); numerical subprograms (EXP, CUBIC, etc.); service subprograms (DATE_TIME function, etc.); Linear Algebra II; Runge-Kutta integrators; and three text I/O {{families of}} packages. In two cases, a family consists of a single non-generic package. In all other cases, a family comprises a generic package and its instances for a selected group of scalar types. All generic packages {{are designed to be}} easily instantiated for the types declared in the user facility. The linear algebra package is LINRAG 2. This package includes subprograms supplementing those in NPO- 17985, An Ada Linear Algebra Package Modeled After HAL/S (LINRAG). Please note that LINRAG 2 cannot be compiled without LINRAG. Most packages have widespread applicability, although some are oriented for avionics applications. All are designed to facilitate writing new software in Ada. Several of the packages use conventions introduced by other programming languages. A package of string subprograms is based on HAL/S (a language designed for the avionics software in the Space Shuttle) and PL/I. Packages of scalar and array subprograms are taken from HAL/S or generalized current Ada subprograms. A package of Runge-Kutta integrators is patterned after a built-in MAC (MIT Algebraic Compiler) integrator. Those packages modeled after HAL/S make it easy to translate existing HAL/S software to Ada. The General-Purpose Ada Packages program source code is available on two 360 K 5. 25 " MS-DOS format diskettes. The software was developed using VAX Ada v 1. 5 under DEC VMS v 4. 5. It should be portable to any validated Ada compiler and it should execute either interactively or in batch. The largest package requires 205 K of main memory on a DEC VAX running VMS. The software was developed in 1989, and is a copyrighted work with all copyright vested in NASA...|$|R

It achieved {{a top speed}} of 30 miles per hour. The boat was marketed under the trade name [...] "Enforcer" [...] and sold by his company Warehouse Hobbies, Inc.

50|$|The head {{contains}} a safety shield on the user {{side and a}} rotating hub which may also be called a head or spool. Disadvantages of a gasoline-powered <b>string</b> <b>trimmer</b> include its greater weight and the significant vibration that carries throughout the device, both of which interfere with its maneuverability and contribute to muscle fatigue, {{as well as the}} requirement that motor oil be added to its fuel (if it is equipped with a two-stroke engine). Advantages of gasoline-powered trimmers include mobility (because they are not attached to a power outlet) and the higher maximum power.|$|E
50|$|A <b>string</b> <b>trimmer</b> {{works on}} the {{principle}} that a line that is turned fast enough is held out from its housing (the rotating reel) very stiffly by centrifugal force. The faster it turns the stiffer the line. Even round-section nylon line is able to cut grass and slight, woody plants quite well. Some monofilament lines designed for more powerful cutters have an extruded shape, like a star, that helps the line slash the material being cut; the line is thus able to cut quite large woody plants (small shrubs) or at least ring-bark them very effectively. These lines make disks less necessary for tough jobs.|$|E
50|$|Heavy infestations {{may make}} the land {{completely}} impenetrable and will require cutting first just to access the stems. The root systems will also be so pervasive that removing them would require digging up the entire area; doing this in woodland areas will cause unacceptable damage to the surface roots of trees and to flowering bulbs and should be avoided. In this case, chemical control using a selective weedkiller such as triclopyr to wet the photosynthesising bramble leaves is very effective if applied {{in accordance with the}} manufacturer's instructions. However, a heavily infested area of uncut brambles will require an inordinate amount of poison to wet the leaves; it is far cheaper, and more effective, to cut the area as close to ground level as possible in the spring, clear the debris into piles to reveal the ground surface and to accurately spot spray the shoots that will emerge two to three weeks later as soon as they have a small amount of new foliage. This will kill the plant back into its root system using {{a small fraction of the}} poison required to spray whole bushes. The area may first be cleared using a tractor-mounted rotary mower, motorised <b>string</b> <b>trimmer</b> or with a scythe. A short-bladed, 24 inch mm, scythe in good hands can be faster than using a <b>string</b> <b>trimmer,</b> leaves a neater cut close to the ground, avoids collateral damage to other plants that are desirable to keep, and deposits the cut debris aligned in swathes that are easier to remove and stack. The area must be cut and cleared at some point anyway and it is easier to clear the debris while green and flexible than dead and dry, so clearing when green then spraying a little is more efficient than spraying a lot then clearing when dry.|$|E
5000|$|Cars are {{powered by}} various sources. Electric models are powered by small but {{powerful}} electric motors and rechargeable nickel-cadmium, nickel metal hydride, or lithium polymer cells. There are also brushed or brushless electric motors.

These {{are referred to as}} [...] "nitro" [...] cars. Recently, exceptionally large models have been introduced that are powered by small gasoline engines, similar to <b>string</b> <b>trimmer</b> motors, which use a mix of oil and gasoline. Electric cars are generally considered easier for the novice to work with compared to fuel-driven models, but can be equally as complex at the higher budget and skill levels.|$|E
40|$|Commelina diffusa is a colonising {{species of}} banana orchard {{habitats}} in St. Vincent in the Windward Islands of the Caribbean. In the present study, the population dynamics of C. diffusa were investigated {{in response to}} mechanical weed management with either a rotary <b>string</b> <b>trimmer</b> or glufosinate in ruderal and banana habitats. The study focused on density and size distribution of the weed over time and their response to two weed management strategies. The population dynamics of C. diffusa differed between the two habitats. Seedling establishment {{appeared to be an}} important factor influencing the dynamics of C. diffusa in banana orchards as there was little recruitment of seeds with less flower production compared with ruderal habitats where plants produced more flowers. Plants of C. diffusa in the banana orchard habitat had a longer growth cycle. In the banana orchard habitat, the C. diffusa population was greater and the plants were shorter with mechanical management than in areas treated with glufosinate. The results suggest {{that it is possible to}} manipulate the dynamics of C. diffusa in banana orchards as there is less chance of seed recruitment. Further research is necessary to refine an IPM approach for the management of C. diffusa...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{stripping}} of burley {{tobacco is}} labor intensive and typically requires 50 to 75 worker hours per acre (wkr•hr/ac). The {{goal of the}} project was to reduce labor by optimizing leaf removal by <b>string</b> <b>trimmer</b> heads using combinations of strings lengths and motor speeds. In tests conducted on a single grade, all leaves outside the grade were removed by hand. Plants were run through the machine for sting lengths of 5, 7 and 9 inches and associated motor speeds which were monitored and recorded. Stripping efficiencies were calculated for each plant and collectively for each set of four plants. The machine was then tested for three grade stripping efficiency. Particle size analysis tests were run to determine potential losses due to leaf shredding. Efficiencies for single grade testing ranged from 93 to 96 % for optimal string length and speed combinations. Stripping three grades by machine resulted in an average of 97 % efficiency. Potential losses due to shredding accounted for 5. 6 % of the total weight mechanically removed. It is believed that this stripping concept, implemented on a full scale four grade basis, coul...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that over long periods of time, people who regularly operate hand tools powered by small internal-combustion engines can become affected by a debilitating set of clinically irreversible effects, collectively referred to as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). Although HAVS cannot be cured, the onset of the disorder can be delayed or, in fact, prevented, by restricting either the duration of the exposure, and/or the magnitude of the vibration transmitted from the tool to an operator's hands and arms (per ANSI and similar standards). In this paper, we’ve evaluated an approach for reducing the magnitude of transmitted vibration at the engine-side grip of one commercial- and one consumer-grade <b>string</b> <b>trimmer.</b> The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a set of simple, passive retrofits for these tools that will reduce the likelihood of HAVS in full-time grounds-maintenance workers.
