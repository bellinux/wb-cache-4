The payment card institute estimates {{there are more than}} one billion transaction payment cards in circulation in the US with about 10, 000 transactions occurring per second. High volumes <b>of</b> card based <b>transactions</b> require a complex and costly infrastructure designed to capture, authorize, transact, resolve, and manage payment reconciliation.
