This chapter aims to examine how structural capital assists <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> {{in the development and}} management of human capital in today's competitive environment. Based on 22 qualitative in-depth semi-structured interviews across 10 <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> and nonprofit organizations that perform social entrepreneurship in Australia, the findings suggest that structural capital helps <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> in facilitating human capital development and management for innovation. Thus, the study contributes to the literature by arguing that structural capital plays an essential role in <b>social</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Strategies should be developed for a more balanced development of intellectual capital if an intellectual capital-based view of the firm is to be fully integrated. ...|$|R

Based on insights from both in-depth interviews and a quantitative empirical study of <b>social</b> <b>enterprises,</b> this research examines the role of stakeholder relationships in supporting the process of social innovation within <b>social</b> <b>enterprises.</b> We find that <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> are adept at utilizing their relationships with stakeholders in the ideation stage of social innovation.

This research aims to investigate how to implement the cost effective marketing activities of (i) social media and (ii) networking {{in order to improve}} the marketing performance and business performance of <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> in Hong Kong. Five in-depth interviews were conducted to the social entrepreneurs or the marketing staff of <b>social</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Results reveal that social media is a low-cost channel that effectively increases public awareness and customer interest. However, it is also found that <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> have to compete with the enormous number of other organizations which also conduct similar marketing activities. In addition, networking appears to be an effective way to explore for potential business partnerships among <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> and the ordinary businesses. The business partnership viability depends on the compatibility of the industry characteristics and the community being served. This research contributes to the literature by providing evidence of the effectiveness on social media and networking on improving performance of <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> in Hong Kong.

This dichotomy is typical of the fact that a housing co-op is somewhere between a private business corporation and a social agency, and where one places it depends on one's viewpoint—and the collective viewpoint of each housing co-op.

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Sociology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. This study {{explores the}} profile of <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> in China, the {{processes}} of how they select and pursue earned income opportunities (EIOs), the opportunities and challenges of pursuing EIOs {{as well as the}} coping mechanisms to address these challenges. As there is limited research on Chinese <b>social</b> <b>enterprises,</b> the findings are compared with the U. S. literature to illustrate how Chinese <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> resemble or differ from their U. S. counterparts. The complex profile of Chinese <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> makes it more difficult to define and classify <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> in China than the United States. Chinese and U. S. <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> go through similar developmental processes, and encounter similar opportunities and challenges in the pursuit of EIOs. However, <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> in China experience context-specific benefits and difficulties {{as a result of the}} EIOs. The mechanisms they utilize to cope with these difficulties do not yield a similar theoretical model as suggested in the American literature. In order to explain why Chinese <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> emerge and how they evolve in the Chinese environment, a preliminary theoretical framework is developed. The interaction between Chinese <b>social</b> <b>enterprises</b> and the three isomorphic forces simultaneously shapes the isomorphic and idiosyncratic aspects of these organizations. The findings of this study have brought new insights to social entrepreneurship research and organizational studies, and will inspire future social entrepreneurship research through the lens of organizational sociology.
