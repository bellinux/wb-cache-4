5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> that {{industry}} will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state {{that it is}} an empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the large amounts of money involved, encourage non-productive rent-seeking behaviour and lobbying of governments, activities that dissipate economic value.|$|E
5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to be difficult.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to master and control women's orgasms.|$|E

25|$|Kabila's army began a slow {{movement}} westward in December 1996 {{near the}} end of the Great Lakes refugee crisis, taking control of border towns and mines and solidifying control. There were reports of massacres and of brutal repression by the rebel army. A UN human-rights investigator published statements from witnesses claiming that Kabila's ADFLC (Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo) engaged in massacres, and that the advancing army killed as many as 60,000civilians (a claim which the ADFLC strenuously denied).

25|$|Adherents of the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} give varied {{responses to}} these criticisms. Some point to what they claim is evidence {{for the presence of}} these items and locations.

These views are not directly supported by the LDS Church, but they do motivate archaeological efforts to further understand these situations, including research being performed by Brigham Young University (BYU) professors.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{it appears}} that a brief 0.25-second {{exposure}} to a <5nbsp&mW laser such as found in red laser pointers does not {{pose a threat to}} eye health. On the other hand, there is a potential for injury if a person deliberately stares into a beam of a classnbsp&IIIa laser for few seconds or more at close range. Even if injury occurs, most people will fully recover their vision. Further experienced discomforts than these may be psychological rather than physical. With regard to green laser pointers the safe exposure time may be less, and with even higher powered lasers instant permanent damage <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected.</b> These conclusions must be qualified with recent theoretical observations that certain prescription medications may interact with some wavelengths of laser light, causing increased sensitivity (phototoxicity).|$|E
25|$|Since P. exigua colonies {{consist of}} many queens, wasps {{within a given}} colony <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to have low {{relatedness}} among one another. However, cyclical oligogyny seems to help colonies maintain {{a higher level of}} relatedness. In cyclical oligogyny, new queens are only conceived after most of the colony’s queens have died. This late production of new queens guarantees that only a few queens from the previous generation participate. The relatedness among workers in P. exigua is 0.39, which is sufficient for wasps to exhibit worker behavior. Among queens from the same colony, 0.82 are genetically related. Therefore, queens demonstrate a significantly greater genetic relatedness than do workers from their same colony. Thus far, every epinonine species studied exhibits high relatedness among queens. This outcome of relation seems to {{play a crucial role in}} the wasp’s social behavior and in the colony’s success.|$|E
25|$|ESI has a {{more complex}} {{ionisation}} mechanism, relying heavily on droplet charge excess and as such {{there are many more}} factors to consider when exploring the cause of ion suppression. It has been widely observed that for many analytes, at high concentrations, ESI exhibits a loss of detector response linearity, perhaps due to reduced charge excess caused by analyte saturation at the droplet surface, inhibiting subsequent ejection of gas phase ions from further inside the droplet. Thus competition for space and/or charge may be considered as a source of ion suppression in ESI. Both physical and chemical properties of analytes (e.g. basicity and surface activity) determine their inherent ionisation efficiency. Biological sample matrices naturally tend to contain many endogenous species with high basicity and surface activity, hence the total concentration of these species in the sample will quickly reach levels at which ion suppression <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|E
