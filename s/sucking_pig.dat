40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} microflora and gastric {{physiology of}} piglets weaned at 2 days was {{compared with that}} of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. Although there was a significantly higher count of Escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. There were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. Lactobacillus fermentum, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius, S. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. L. fermentum and S. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. The weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in <b>sucking</b> <b>pigs</b> and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there may be gastric stasis. The gastric pH was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. In weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between pH and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and also a positive correlation between pH and number of E. coli. These correlations suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in the regulation of gastric pH in weaned pigs. Three of twenty <b>sucking</b> <b>pigs,</b> but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting HCl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, pH < 3. 5). In <b>sucking</b> <b>pigs</b> there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. In weaned scouring pigs there was a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. There was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue...|$|R

The study was conducted to research the presence of Mycoplasma hyorhinis (M. hyorhinis) in different regions of the country from exudates of pig lungs with typical EP lesions. Exudates from 280 pig lungs with typical EP lesions were studied using molecular techniques such as PCR, real time PCR and amplification of the 16 S- 23 S rRNA. It was detected that the 66 % of the samples studied resulted positive to M. hyorhinis, and the presence of this species was detected in all the provinces.

40|$|In {{demonstrating a}} kind of {{thinking}} that lies beyond our customary practices, Michel Foucault (1970), in his preface to The Order of Things, cites a Chinese encyclopaedia in which animals are categorised as (1) belonging to the emperor, (2) embalmed, (3) tame, (4) <b>sucking</b> <b>pigs,</b> (5) sirens, (6) fabulous, (7) stray dogs, (8) included in the present classification, (9) frenzied, (10) innumerable, (11) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, (12) etc., (13) having just broken the water pitcher, (14) that from {{a long way off}} look like flies (p. 15). This is, indeed, an extraordinary categorization. Why? Because it interrupts our customary lines of thought, collapsing our long-held distinctions over similar/not similar; over same/other. In that sense, the taxonomy is unsettling, even disturbing. Yet in another sense, a creative system of thought that juxtaposes entities by transgressing “the boundaries of all imagination, of all possible thought, ” (p. xvi) marks out the very real possibility of thinking otherwise. Appelbaum, similarly, in his book Embracing Mathematics: On Becoming a Teacher and Changing with Mathematics breaks “up all the ordered surfaces and all the planes with which we are accustomed ” (Foucault, 1970, p. 15).

60|$|And, {{that being}} {{the fact of the}} matter, patent to all who will take the trouble to enquire about what has been said about it, however obscure to those who merely talk of so doing, the thesis that the Gadarene swineherds, or owners, were Jews violating the Mosaic law shows itself to be an empty and most unfortunate guess.

The legal provisions, which alone had authority over an inhabitant of the country of the Gadarenes, were the Gentile laws sanctioned by the Roman suzerain of the province of Syria, just as the only law, which has authority in England, is that recognised by the sovereign Legislature. Jewish communities in England may have their private code, as they doubtless had in Gadara. But an English magistrate, if called upon to enforce their peculiar laws, would dismiss the complainants from the judgment seat, let us hope with more politeness than Gallio did in a like case, but quite as firmly. Moreover, in the matter of keeping pigs, we may be quite certain that Gadarene law left everybody free to do as he pleased, indeed encouraged the practice rather than otherwise.

40|$|Organic {{pig farming}} {{includes}} having pigs in open fields with relatively close contact {{to the wild}} fauna. The risk of transmission of parasites and diseases to the pigs is therefore higher than in traditional pig farming with pigs under strict control in indoor pigsties. Newborn and <b>sucking</b> <b>pigs</b> are also exposed to predators that may cause losses to the farmers. A general trend in organic farming is to avoid the use of pesticides. There is therefore a need for effective preventive measures and control methods that are acceptable to the organic farmers. As {{a first step in}} a project for developing strategies for pest management in organic pig farming we conducted a questionnaire survey in Denmark. The farmers were asked questions about what they considered problems arising from the natural environment. They were also asked to describe how they offered fodder and water, which types of huts they used etc. The surroundings should be described regarding factors that were thought to influence the natural fauna, such as e. g. distance to quickset hedges, forests, streams and watercourses. The results of the survey showed that rats and smaller rodents (mice and voles), foxes and hares were the most frequently occurring mammals in the fields with pigs. The farmers considered rats and foxes as causing the most important (pest) problems. Occurrence of rats is reported significantly more frequently in organic pig farming than in traditional pig farming in open fields. The answers given by the farmers were analysed as to possible relationships between occurrence of / problems with rodents and the practice regarding the pig farming. There was a significant positive correlation between occurrence of rats, smaller rodents and foxes. Use of automatic feeding systems and open water trays, and having stacks of hay and straw in the fields were all factors that were significantly positively correlated with the occurrence of rats and smaller rodents. The occurrence of smaller rodents was negatively correlated with the use of huts with a bottom and huts made of hard materials. Special shelters for the pigs exclusively made of bales of straw did not give a significant positive correlation with occurrence of rodents. These results indicate factors that are practicable as preventive measures against rodents. The farmers reported traps, shooting, and cats and dogs as the most frequent non-chemical ways of controlling rodents. ...|$|R

Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm, but within those everything was snug, happy, and well-conditioned. He was satisfied with his wealth but not proud of it, and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance, rather than the style, in which he lived. His stronghold was situated {{on the banks of the}} Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A great elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water in a little well formed of a barrel, and then stole sparkling away through the grass to a neighboring brook that bubbled along among alders and dwarf willows. Hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a church, every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads under their wings or buried in their bosoms, and others, swelling, and cooing, and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the sunshine on the roof. Sleek, unwieldy porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, whence sallied forth, now and then, troops of <b>sucking</b> <b>pigs</b> as if to snuff the air. A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farmyard, and guinea-fowls fretting about it, like ill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry. Before the barn-door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a warrior, and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart--sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.|$|R

The developmental changes of serum concentrations of methionine, phenylalanine and tyrosine were expressed in linear way (p < 0. 05); that of isoleucine, threonine, alanine, glutamate and glycine in quadratic way (p < 0. 05); that of arginine and serine in cubic way (p < 0. 05) and that of histidine and aspartate in quartic way (p < 0. 05), respectively...|$|R

60|$|Then, {{as to the}} vulture, {{it was not a}} true vulture nor a {{strictly}} true eagle, but a carrion-hawk, a bird {{the size of a small}} eagle, blackish brown in colour with a white neck and breast suffused with brown and spotted with black; also it had a very big eagle-shaped beak, and claws not so strong as an eagle's nor so weak as a vulture's. In its habits it was both eagle and vulture, as it fed on dead flesh, and was also a hunter and killer of animals and birds, especially of the weakly and young. A somewhat destructive creature to poultry and young <b>sucking</b> lambs and <b>pigs.</b> Its feeding habits were, in fact, very like those of the raven, and its voice, too, was raven-like, or rather like that of the carrion-crow at his loudest and harshest. Considering the character of this big rapacious bird, the Polyborus tharus of naturalists and the carancho of the natives, it may seem strange that a pair were allowed to nest and live for years in our plantation, but in those days people were singularly tolerant not only of injurious birds and beasts but even of beings of their own species of predaceous habits.|$|R
40|$|Martin Van Buren's New York {{political}} {{favorites are}} represented as piglets suckled by a giant sow "The Empire State. " The artist's pointed reference {{is to the}} exploitation of New York State by the President and his supporters. The piglets nursed by the sow bear the names "The Regency" and "Tammany Hall" (popular names for the state and city Democratic machines respectively), "Weigh master General," the names of various patronage positions and of banks friendly to the administration, and the "Safety Fund. " On the left other piglets, representing applications for bank charters and government offices and "The Times," await the sleeping sow's attention. Van Buren (left) and a stout Dutchman (a stereotyped character often used to represent New York State) look on. Van Buren: Was ever man blest with such a fine old sow and litter of pigs! They have made me the greatest man in the Union, and even follow me every where! Dutchman: Myn Got dey will suck de very life's blood out of dat old sow, I never seen <b>pigs</b> <b>suck</b> so in all myn life. Got for damn such a breed! Myn Vrow would not have dem on de farm.
