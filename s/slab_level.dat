40|$|In the {{framework}} of the DISWall research project, funded by the European Commission, innovative construction systems, based on the use of perforated clay units and aimed at building mainly tall, load bearing reinforced masonry walls for one-storey industrial and commercial buildings, were developed. In these cases, very often buildings are provided with deformable roofs, made with prefabricated elements or glulam beams. In the case of seismic actions, deformable roofs are not able to redistribute horizontal actions to in-plane walls. Walls orthogonal to seismic load direction can be tentatively considered as cantilevers, with vertical load applied at the top and horizontal out of plane load, due to the seismic action associated to the masses of both roof and wall itself. For this structural configuration, two real scale frames, composed by two parallel reinforced masonry walls, 6 m in height, vertically loaded by steel/concrete slab, were built and subjected to cyclic tests, by applying horizontal loads at the top <b>slab</b> <b>level.</b> The aim was studying tall walls’ behaviour under out-of-plane loads and P-∆ effects.

The shear resistance of PHC slabs has not been well discussed in the different current codes. The codes have a general shear design approach. However, the shear behavior of PHC slabs is different from that of ordinary concrete elements with shear reinforcement. On the other hand, the design models of PHC slabs in current codes does not take into consideration the significant effect of concentrated load at transfer zone as well as no method to classify the expected mode of failure. In this research, a new proposed relationship is developed to calculate shear capacity of PHC slabs. Also, the significant effect of variation of concentrated load width with respect the slab width will be studied. The proposed relation will be verified for different <b>slab</b> thickness, <b>level</b> of pre-stressing, concrete strength, and for solid net area of PHC slabs.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the numerical analyses of restrained concrete floor slabs exposed to fire. The {{analyses of the}} slabs were carried out with the SAFIR finite element program considering a 200 mm thick slab, spanning 5 metres between two end supports. The slabs {{were exposed to the}} ISO standard fire for up to four hours and were analysed with pinned and rotationally restrained supports. Different heights of the line of thrust at the supports and different levels of axial restraint were also investigated. The analyses show that fully restrained pin-supported slabs can survive the four hour ISO fire without collapse if the position of the line of thrust is located near the soffit of the slab. If the position of the line of thrust is located much above the soffit of the slab, the slabs will rapidly undergo large deformations and sag into a catenary, imposing axial tensile forces at the supports. The analyses have shown that even if the line of thrust is located close to the soffit, the slab can still deform into a catenary if there is insufficient horizontal axial restraint. In this study, rotationally restrained slabs experience much smaller vertical deflections than pin-supported slabs when exposed to fires. Rotationally restrained <b>slabs</b> with low <b>levels</b> of horizontal restraint do not collapse, due to the beneficial effects of moment redistribution. However, high levels of horizontal restraint can be detrimental, causing slabs to collapse at advanced stages of the fire...|$|R

For jellium slabs, we prove analytically and numerically that in the vacuum region {{far away from the}} surface ε_x^Slab(z →∞) → - e^ 2 / 2 z, independent of the bulk electron density, which is exactly half the corresponding exact-exchange potential V_x(z →∞) → - e^ 2 /z [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 026802 (2006) ] of density-functional theory, as occurs in the case of finite systems. The fitting of ε_x^Slab(z) to a physically motivated image-like expression is feasible, but the resulting location of the image plane shows strong finite-size oscillations every time a <b>slab</b> discrete energy <b>level</b> becomes occupied. For a semi-infinite jellium, the asymptotic behavior of ε_x^SI(z) is somehow different. As in the case of jellium slabs ε_x^SI(z →∞) has an image-like behavior of the form ∝ - e^ 2 /z, but now with a density-dependent coefficient that in general differs from the slab universal coefficient 1 / 2. Our numerical estimates for this coefficient agree with two previous analytical estimates for the same. For an arbitrary finite thickness of a jellium slab, we find that the asymptotic limits of ε_x^Slab(z) and ε_x^SI(z) only coincide in the low-density limit (r_s →∞), where the density-dependent coefficient of the semi-infinite jellium approaches the slab universal coefficient 1 / 2.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental and theoretical {{study of the}} material and structural behaviour of a Steel-Fibre reinforced Reactive Powder Concrete (SF-RPC). The experimental program consisted of three phases. Phase 1 involved {{the development of a}} design mix for use throughout the remainder of the study. Phase 2 consisted of an in-depth investigation into the material properties of the mix. The final phase of the experimental component was the testing of 16 plain and prestressed SF-RPC beams. Twelve beams were tested under short-term loading to determine their cracking and ultimate moment capacity. The remaining 4 beams were used to investigate the time-dependent flexural behaviour of prestressed SF-RPC slabs. The material properties were measured using a range of short-term tests and included the compressive and flexural behaviour, static chord modulus of elasticity and crack mouth opening. In addition to the short-term tests, investigation into the time-dependent material behaviour was undertaken and included the creep and shrinkage characteristics of the material. The response of the material to various curing conditions was also investigated. The structural behaviour investigated included the short-term flexural moment-curvature response and load-deflection behaviour of beams and slabs along with the crack patterns of both plain and prestressed SF-RPC members. In addition to the investigations into the short-term flexural behaviour, a study into the time-dependent flexural behaviour was also undertaken. There are currently 2 available models for predicting the flexural response of plain and prestressed RPC cross-sections. The analytical phase of this investigation involved an evaluation of these models. Based on the experimental findings and analysis, a modified model was proposed for calculating the short-term flexural behaviour of plain and prestressed SF-RPC beams. The applicability of an age-adjusted effective modulus method for calculating the time-dependent deformations of prestressed SF-RPC <b>slabs</b> under various <b>levels</b> of sustained loads was also evaluated and found to be adequate with minor refinements...|$|R
40|$|Since 1970 costal {{structures}} in the Port of Koper are designed as reinforced concrete slabs founded on vertical and inclined steel piles with a slope under the deck. This method of construction requires the excavation of large quantities of silt with bad characteristics, which is used mainly for acquiring new surfaces. The amount of pumped silt, derived from construction of new docks and deepening waterways, exceeds needs. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} take the extra silt elsewhere, which represents an increasing cost for the port. In the thesis is analyzed the possibility of using sheet pile wall on the particular case of the extension of dock number 11. The proposed coastal structure consists of concrete slab founded on steel tubular piles and steel sheet pile wall, which has a soil retaining and bearing function. This method of construction does not required addition excavations. Because of the complexity of the structure, individual elements and appropriate geometry models are acquired step by step. Initially the possibility of using a concrete <b>slab</b> on ground <b>level</b> founded on steel tubular piles and combined sheet pile wall that consist of different types of primary and secondary elements is analyzed. Because of the poor bearing capacity of the soil such type of structure is not an option. The following steps show the need of anchorage, inclination of piles and sheet wall and a relieving platform. Deep relieving platform 4 m below the ground anchored by Müller-Verfahren piles with inclined tubular piles at an gradient of 3 : 1 and sheet pile wall at a gradient of 5, 5 : 1 is appropriate. Cross section and length of elements are set according to the required bearing capacity.

40|$|Multi-level {{concrete}} buildings requrre substantial temporary formwork {{structures to}} support the slabs during construction. The primary function of this formwork is to safely disperse the applied loads so that the slab being constructed, or {{the portion of the}} permanent structure already constructed, is not overloaded. Multi-level formwork is a procedure in which a limited number of formwork and shoring sets are cycled up the building as construction progresses. In this process, each new slab is supported by a number of lower <b>level</b> <b>slabs.</b> The new slab load is, essentially, distributed to these supporting slabs in direct proportion to their relative stiffness. When a slab is post-tensioned using draped tendons, slab lift occurs as a portion of the slab self-weight is balanced. The formwork and shores supporting that slab are unloaded by an amount equivalent to the load balanced by the post-tensioning. This produces a load distribution inherently different from that of a conventionally reinforced slab. Through, theoretical modelling and extensive on-site shore load measurement, this research examines the effects of post-tensioning on multilevel formwork load distribution. The research demonstrates that the load distribution process for post-tensioned slabs allows for improvements to current construction practice. These enhancements include a shortening of the construction period; an improvement in the safety of multi-level form work operations; and a reduction in the quantity of form work materials required for a project. These enhancements are achieved through the general improvement in safety offered by post-tensioning during the various formwork operations. The research demonstrates that there is generally a significant improvement in the factors of safety over those for conventionally reinforced slabs. This improvement in the factor of safety occurs at all stages of the multi-level formwork operation. The general improvement in the factors of safety with post-tensioned slabs allows for a shortening of the slab construction cycle time. Further, the low level of load redistribution that occurs during the stripping operations makes post-tensioned slabs ideally suited to reshoring procedures. Provided the overall number of interconnected levels remains unaltered, it is possible {{to increase the number of}} reshored levels while reducing the number of undisturbed shoring levels without altering the factors of safety, thereby, reducing the overall quantity of formwork and shoring materials...|$|R
