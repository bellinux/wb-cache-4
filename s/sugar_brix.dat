40|$|Twenty {{sweet sorghum}} cultivars that {{included}} 17 improved cultivars (experimental grain, forage, dual and India released varieties) from India and 3 landraces from southern Africa were evaluated {{for their use}} as an alternative food and fodder crop for crop-livestock farmers. The trials were conducted during 2007 / 08 season in semi-arid conditions at Matopos Research Station, Zimbabwe. Three methods of assessment were applied to help identify suitable cultivars: grain and stover water productivity (WP), stover feed quality traits and farmers’ assessment of cultivars in the field. Grain and stover WP ranged from 0. 6 to 2. 7 kg m- 3 and 1. 2 to 4. 0 kg m- 3 respectively. We observed significant differences in cultivar groups on plant height, time to maturity, harvest index, grain WP, nitrogen uptake, nitrogen harvest index and stover metabolizable energy and digestibility (P < 0. 001), and <b>sugar</b> (<b>Brix...</b>|$|E
30|$|Lastly, Michigan’s monthly {{precipitation}} {{distribution is}} likely to undergo a change that could be beneficial to the vinifera industry. Currently, Michigan gets {{a small amount of}} rain in the early months of the growing season and too much rain {{at the end of the}} season. However, while Michigan {{is likely to}} receive a slight increase in annual precipitation (the increase according model means from NEX-DCP 30 is not statistically significant), the distribution of precipitation across each month is likely to change. The changes over time for southwest Michigan are reported in Fig.  4 c 1, c 2. In both scenarios, we see more rainfall in the months of April and May, and less rainfall in August and September, which is critical for reducing issues such as fruit rot or other diseases during the critical verasion phenological stage and at harvest. Less precipitation in the end months may also lead to less dilution of <b>sugar</b> (<b>Brix)</b> suspended sugars in individual berries (Gladstones 1992).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate low and high Brix diets, treated or not with 5 g of calcium oxide per kg of natural matter, and corn silage on intake, digestibility and performance of beef cattle. Forty cattle with initial body weight (BW) of 350 kg were used: five composed the control group, 30 were distributed into random blocks (control) and the other five were distributed in a 5 × 5 incomplete Latin square, with the {{objective of}} determining digestibility. The 30 animals evaluated for performance were slaughtered and empty body weight (EPW), carcass dressing and meat cuts were determined. The diet with corn silage (CS) presented the best intake of the other ingredients and the best weight gain, except for neutral detergent fiber intake in g/kg of BW. Only carcass dressing, in relation to BW and EBW, was not affected by the treatments, and the others were greater for animals fed diets with sugar cane silage. Animals fed diets with high <b>brix</b> <b>sugar</b> cane silage and treated high <b>brix</b> <b>sugar</b> cane silage presented lower intake of indigestible neutral detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein (g/kg of BW) in relation to diets with low and high <b>brix</b> <b>sugar</b> cane silage, respectively. Animals fed diets with corn silage presented higher digestibility, except for crude protein and non-fibrous carbohydrates. Animals subjected to diets with corn silage presented low excretion of nitrogen compounds and higher microbial crude protein synthesis.

40|$|AbstractFive tiger nut (Cyperus esculentus L.) cultivars were {{collected}} from four different regions of Ghana and irradiated. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate some physicochemical, functional and sensory qualities of milk produced from irradiated tiger nut samples. Analysis was carried out for pH, total solids, moisture, <b>sugar</b> <b>brix</b> and viscosity. Finally the consumer acceptability of the milk prepared from the nuts was determined by a taste panel using the parameters of colour, taste, aroma, mouth feel and overall acceptability. The sugar content varied from 6. 0  ±  0. 3 % (Techiman) to 15. 00  ±  1. 00 % (Asebu Ekroful) depending on the irradiation dose applied. Generally, increase in dose increased the sugar availability but decreased viscosity of the milk prepared from the nuts. The milk with the highest viscosity was from Kwahu Aduamoa and Techiman with the least viscosity from Bawjiase. Generally, no significant difference was detected by the sensory panellists with regard to mouth feel and taste among the milk samples prepared from the various tiger nut cultivars...|$|E

40|$|In {{the case}} of a {{back-end}} refinery, the final run-off or return syrup of 92 - 95 % purity and 75 ° brix is generally returned to the raw mill to be combined with raw syrup and boiled in the A-pans. Approximately 8 % of the input raw <b>sugar</b> <b>brix</b> into a refinery is returned, consequently locking up A-pan capacity and, in {{the case of}} a factory with marginal pan capacity, cane throughput is restricted. In addition, energy consumption is increased and sugar losses in final molasses are elevated. A number of processes have been considered to eliminate recycling refinery run-off, most of which require pre-treatment and/or high capital investment with a high degree of commercial risk. Test work was undertaken at the Tsb Malalane cane sugar refinery to determine the optimal pre-treatment option for decolorising and softening refinery return syrup. The pre-treatment results indicate that chemical softening, followed by the addition of a cationic colour precipitant and pH adjustment with sulphur dioxide, yields appreciable calcium reduction and modest decolourisation. The overall benefit indicates that the treated final run-off is of suitable quality to apply another crystallisation step and/or alternatively consider for further purification by chromatographic separation and/or resin decolourisation...|$|E

40|$|Size {{increase}} (expressed as diameter) of four apple cultivars in {{five seasons}} during about 130 days before harvest, was analysed {{with a simple}} first order production mechanism. All variation in diameter among individual fruit {{could be attributed to}} the same origin (development stage or biological age), with explained parts (R 2 adj) of more than 98 %. The same general behaviour of diameter development was observed in two tomato cultivars whose fruits where grown at two different temperatures. These data were also analysed using the same model with explained parts (R 2 adj) of about 90 %. Converting diameter into volume (assuming a perfect sphere), the usually observed asymmetrical sigmoidal behaviour was obtained, frequently described in growth modelling with the Richard's curve. A similar sigmoidal behaviour was also observed in the accumulation of dry matter (DM), as measured with NIR technology in growing mangoes. The cubic root of these data on DM could be analysed using the same model formulation, including the variation between individual fruit, with R 2 adj well over 90 %. Accumulation of DM ends at harvest, so the mechanism of DM production can very well define the final level of DM obtained in harvested fruit. Since sugars and DM are strongly related (e. g., conversion of starch into <b>sugars,</b> <b>Brix</b> values), a very similar mechanism could govern the accumulation of sugars. Destructively measured data on sugars were collected in nectarines, showing indeed a very similar overall behaviour and variation. This indicates that growth (diameter, mass) and quality increase (DM, sugars) could be described by a very similar mechanism, providing the first tools in the quest to harvest quality. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sweet sorghum [(L.) Moench], {{like its}} close relative, {{sugarcane}} (spp.), {{has been selected}} to accumulate high levels of edible sugars in the stem. Sweet sorghums are tall and produce high biomass in addition to sugar. Little has been documented about the genetic relationships and diversity within sweet sorghums and how sweet sorghums relate to grain sorghum racial types. In this study, a diverse panel of 125 sorghums (mostly sweet) was successfully genotyped with 47 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 322 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Using both distance-based and model-based methods, we identified three main genetic groupings of sweet sorghums. Based on observed phenotypes and known origins we classified the three groups as historical and modern syrup, modern sugar/energy types, and amber types. Using SSR markers also scored in an available large grain sorghum germplasm panel, we found that these three sweet groupings clustered with kafir/bicolor, caudatum, and bicolor types, respectively. Using the information on population structure and relatedness, association mapping was performed for height and stem <b>sugar</b> (<b>brix)</b> traits. Three significant associations for height were detected. Two of these, on chromosomes 9 and 6, support published QTL studies.

40|$|International audienceThe {{production}} of kiwi fruits {{is a dynamic}} agricultural activity in Corsica (France). The fruits are either consumed directly or used to produce kiwi wine. They are often stored for 4 - 6 months in industrial freezer chambers at 0 C or industrial ozone chambers. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure physical, chemical and fungicidal parameters, soluble sugars and non-volatile organic acids during storage in each of these types of chamber. Various standard and instrumental methods (physicochemical techniques, HPLC) in conjunction with statistical analysis were used. During storage, the kiwi mass, firmness and acidity decreased, whereas reducing <b>sugar,</b> <b>Brix</b> and pH increased. There were statistical differences between the two chambers regarding reducing sugar and acidity. The ozone gas treatment had a fungicidal effect on Botrytis cinerea. The major soluble sugar present in the kiwi fruit was fructose, followed by glucose and sucrose. The concentrations of these sugars increased during storage in both air at 0 C and ozoneenriched air. Organic acids are one of the important factors influencing fruit flavour. Citric and quinic acids predominated over malic, tartaric and ascorbic acids. During storage in the ozone chamber, concentrations of non-volatile organic acids decreased sharply after 25 weeks. Storage at 0 C enabled better retention of organic acids...|$|E
40|$|Citrus and {{watermelons}} {{are valuable}} economic crops worldwide, contributing approximately $ 120 million combined {{each year in}} Texas alone. Both citrus and watermelons are sensitive to saline conditions, which can be problematic in the Lower Rio Grande Valley where they are commonly produced. As Texas increases the percentage of irrigated agriculture each year, and in turn the amount of land potentially exposed to salinization through this practice, grafting salt sensitive plants to tolerant rootstocks becomes a more feasible way to overcome this challenge. Grafting typically improves disease resistance, cold tolerance, yield, fruit quality and {{has been shown to}} improve salt tolerance as well. While citrus is commonly grafted to rootstocks that induce desirable qualities in the scion, watermelon grafting is only common in Asia and several European countries due to cost constraints. The main goal of this research was to assess selected rootstocks for salinity tolerance by evaluating plant growth and physiological parameters when subjected to several salinity levels. In the first experiment, potential sour orange replacement rootstocks C 22 and C 146 were evaluated for salinity as ungrafted trees and grafted to the Olinda Valencia scion. These trees were then compared to the performance of grafted and ungrafted sour orange trees. The results suggest that C 22 and C 146 rootstocks are more tolerant to saline conditions than sour orange rootstocks at moderate salinity levels. However, grafting significantly decreased all measured growth and physiological parameters for all rootstocks implying that this scion-rootstock combination may not be ideal. In the second experiment, TAMU mini watermelons were grafted to four rootstocks to determine if any of these would improve their performance when subjected to poor quality irrigation water. Of the four rootstocks and ungrafted TAMU mini watermelon, Strong Tosa showed the most growth when subjected to moderate salinity. Salinity treatments were found to increase fruit quality by increasing the percentage of <b>sugar</b> (<b>brix)</b> and fruit flesh firmness...|$|E

Because of its composition, sensory characteristics and resistance during preservation, the kiwifruit has great potential for industrial exploitation. The kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa cv.

This increase is slow in the first 2 months of storage and then accelerates quickly to reach the climacteric peak. The timing of this climacteric peak varies in function of the year of harvest, occurring after between 100 and 140 days of storage. In parallel with this ethylene production, there is an increase in reducing <b>sugar</b> concentration, <b>Brix,</b> acidity and Botrytis cinerea contamination and conversely a reduction in the firmness and mass of the fruits.

40|$|In Taiwan, the {{persimmon}} (Diospyros kaki L.) culture {{area had}} more than 2, 700 ha, among these area of sweet persimmon were 800 ha, its net profit, income of each hectare (ha) was 410, 000 NT$ and become the important economic fruit in Taiwan. The year of persimmon bring into Taiwan was from 200 years ago and the sweet persimmon was 60 years ago. There are few reports about the relationship of sweet persimmon and fertilizer management. This research was major on investigate frame's habit of fertilizer application and relationship with the agent of climate, discussion the effect of nitrogen -potassium fertilizer use on the fruit quality and reduce the problem of fruit's stalk split. From the year of 2000 to 2001, in central Taiwan collected the atmosphere data from 40 's sweet persimmon garden in major culture area. Use the soil and leaf nutrient analysis method to established the management strategy of sweet persimmon garden fertilizer application. The major growth area of sweet persimmon was located at Daguan, HoPin country, the optium growth temperature of sweet persimmon were 19 ～ 23 ℃, the optium temperature of leaf bud germination were 15 ～ 19 ℃, flowering stage were 19 ～ 21 ℃young fruit form stage were 21 ～ 23 ℃, fruit mature stage were 15 ～ 21 ℃, fruit color change stage were below 24 ℃. The color of fruit lycopene will turn to orange-red below 24 ℃ and become yellow over 30 ℃. Its rainy season was centralized from April to September, the monthly average rainfall could reach 300 mm. The average rainfall of young fruit form stage had reach 378 mm(365 - 495 mm). Too much rainfall and less sunlight will influence plant normal photosynthesis process; this will induce the plant fruit physiology fall, reduce the fruit form number and influence the product of sweet persimmon fruit. From the investigate data of farmer's fertilizer application habit. The product of sweet persimmon and fertilizer use of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium had relationship with two-regales analyses. From the analysis program, we could found 90 % height product sweet persimmon plant (60 kg/tree) it's three major fertilizer applicated range were N 243 - 273 kg/ha (608 - 683 g/yr/tree), P 2 O 5 295 - 360 kg/ha (738 - 900 g/yr/tree), K 2 O 413 - 505 kg/ha (1, 033 - 1, 262 g/yr/tree). This fertilizer applicated could adjust quantity with sweet persimmon growth age, the number of fruit form and the mass of rainfall. The temporary optimum leaf nutrient range were N 2. 19 - 2. 67 %, P 0. 12 - 0. 16 %, K 2. 50 - 3. 76 %, Ca 1. 08 - 1. 58 %, Mg 0. 42 - 0. 56 %, Cu 6 - 10 mg/kg, Mn 1. 586 - 3. 672 mg/kg, Zn 49 - 89 mg/kg, Fe 54 - 100 mg/kg. If the leaf nutrient concentration less these quantity the garden will be the malnutrition garden. To discuss effect of different applicated quantity of N-K fertilizer on the plant growth and fruit quality. Set up the test area in Daguan and using with RCBD method. From the data of plant nutrient analysis and fruit product, the optimum sampling season was from August to September, sampling 5 th leaf of non-fruit branch top tip to analysis. In the analysis of leaf nutrient and product, use the suggest fertilizer N:K 2 O= 300 : 300 g/yr/tree application model, we found increase 50 %nitrogen fertilizer could increase the product 0. 1 ～ 9. 8 %, decrease 50 % N-fertilizer could decrease product 11. 8 ～ 22. 5 %; increase K 2 O 50 %could decrease product 3. 3 ～ 14. 9 %, decrease 50 % K 2 O could decrease 2 % product. The nitrogen application quality and sugar brix° was negative relationship (r value: - 0. 4523 **), <b>sugar</b> <b>brix</b> will decrease when N-fertilizer increase applicated. Potassium fertilizer had postive relationship with acid brix; acid brix will increase depend on the K 2 O applicated quality. From our data, optium fertilizer of N-K applicator could {{enhance the quality of}} sweet persimmon fruit. The fruit stalk split is a problem in sweet persimmon culture; we hope spray urea dilute solution to improve this problem. The test field was select in Daguan area with 15 years old plant (cultivar:Fuyu). Use RCBD treat and with different dilution concentration of urea, from the 15, June to 15, September each 15 day spray once of area solution and spray 6 time. The soil fertilizer applicator was each plant N:P 2 O 5 :K 2 O= 300 : 200 : 300 g/year/tree. Use suitable nitrogen- potassion fertilizer (N: K= 300 : 300 g/yr/tree) could reduce the ratio of fruit's stalk spilt and the fertilizer (N: K= 450 : 300 g/yr/tree). Use from 47. 7 % to 21. 0 %.

This study was initiated to analyze flooding induced changes in growth, physiology and root structure of sugarcane. A Japanese sugarcane variety, NiF 8, was grown in pots inside a glasshouse under natural light and flooded for one month. Flooding increased root, leaf, stalk and total dry weight. Three different kinds of roots were initiated from the flooded plants, viz. (i) from the aerial nodes (above the water surface), which were reddish-black in color; (ii) from the pre-existing roots primordia, which were developed under water and whitish in color; and (iii) from the newly developed roots, which had upward growth against the gravity and major portion above the water surface, were relatively thinner and pinkish in color. Roots growth showed a positive relationship with that of shoot growth.
