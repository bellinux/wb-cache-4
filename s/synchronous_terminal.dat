40|$|The {{avian erythroblastosis}} virus (AEV) oncoprotein v-ErbA {{represents}} a mutated, oncogenic thyroid hormone receptor alpha (c-ErbA/ TRalpha). v-ErbA cooperates with the stem cell factor-activated, endogenous {{receptor tyrosine kinase}} c-Kit to induce self-renewal and to arrest differentiation of primary avian erythroblasts, the AEV transformation target cells. In this cooperation, v-ErbA substitutes for endogenous steroid hormone receptor function required for sustained proliferation of non-transformed erythroid progenitors. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of how v-ErbA transforms erythroblasts. Using culture media strictly depleted from thyroid hormone (T 3) and retinoids, the ligands for c-ErbA/TRalpha and its co-receptor RXR, we show that overexpressed, unliganded c-ErbA/ TRalpha closely resembles v-ErbA in its activity on primary erythroblasts. In cooperation with ligand-activated c-Kit, c-ErbA/ TRalpha causes steroid-independent, long-term proliferation and tightly blocks differentiation. Activation of c-ErbA/ TRalpha by physiological T 3 levels causes the loss of self-renewal capacity and induces <b>synchronous,</b> <b>terminal</b> differentiation under otherwise identical conditions. This T 3 -induced switch in erythroid progenitor development is correlated with a decrease of c-ErbA-associated histone deacetylase activity. Our {{results suggest that the}} crucial role of the mutations activating v-erbA as an oncogene is to 'freeze' c-ErbA/ TRalpha in its non-liganded, repressive conformation and to facilitate its overexpression...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} body {{of evidence}} suggests that alterations in neurogenesis and oxidative stress {{are associated with a}} wide variety of CNS diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease, as well as routine loss of function accompanying aging. Interestingly, the association between neurogenesis and the production of reactive oxidative species (ROS) remains largely unexamined. The adult CNS harbors two regions of persistent lifelong neurogenesis: the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus (DG). These regions contain populations of quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) that generate mature progeny via rapidly-dividing progenitor cells. We hypothesized that the energetic demands of highly proliferative progenitors generates localized oxidative stress that contributes to ROS-mediated damage within the neuropoietic microenvironment. In vivo examination of germinal niches in adult rodents revealed increases in oxidized DNA and lipid markers, particularly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus. To further pinpoint the cell types responsible for oxidative stress, we employed an in vitro cell culture model allowing for the <b>synchronous</b> <b>terminal</b> differentiation of primary hippocampal NSCs. Inducing differentiation in primary NSCs resulted in an immediate increase in total mitochondria number and overall ROS production, suggesting oxidative stress is generated during a transient window of elevated neurogenesis accompanying normal neurogenesis. To confirm these findings in vivo, we identified a set of oxidation-responsive genes, which respond to antioxidant administration and are significantly elevated in genetic- an...|$|E
