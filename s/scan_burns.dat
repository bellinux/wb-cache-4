40|$|Abstract Background Laser-Doppler imaging (LDI) of {{cutaneous}} {{blood flow}} {{is beginning to}} be used by burn surgeons to predict the healing time of burn wounds; predicted healing time is used to determine wound treatment as either dressings or surgery. In this paper, we do a statistical analysis of the performance of the technique. Methods We used data from a study carried out by five burn centers: LDI was done once between days 2 to 5 post burn, and healing was assessed at both 14 days and 21 days post burn. Random-effects ordinal logistic regression and other models such as the continuation ratio model were used to model healing-time {{as a function of the}} LDI data, and of demographic and wound history variables. Statistical methods were also used to study the false-color palette, which enables the laser-Doppler imager {{to be used by}} clinicians as a decision-support tool. Results Overall performance is that diagnoses are over 90 % correct. Related questions addressed were what was the best blood flow summary statistic and whether, given the blood flow measurements, demographic and observational variables had any additional predictive power (age, sex, race, % total body surface area burned (%TBSA), site and cause of burn, day of LDI <b>scan,</b> <b>burn</b> center). It was found that mean laser-Doppler flux over a wound area was the best statistic, and that, given the same mean flux, women recover slightly more slowly than men. Further, the likely degradation in predictive performance on moving to a patient group with larger %TBSA than those in the data sample was studied, and shown to be small. Conclusion Modeling healing time is a complex statistical problem, with random effects due to multiple burn areas per individual, and censoring caused by patients missing hospital visits and undergoing surgery. This analysis applies state-of-the art statistical methods such as the bootstrap and permutation tests to a medical problem of topical interest. New medical findings are that age and %TBSA are not important predictors of healing time when the LDI results are known, whereas gender does influence recovery time, even when blood flow is controlled for. The conclusion regarding the palette is that an optimum three-color palette can be chosen 'automatically', but the optimum choice of a 5 -color palette cannot be made solely by optimizing the percentage of correct diagnoses. </p...|$|R
5|$|Mr. Burns's {{political}} advisers {{break the}} news to Mr. Burns that he is greatly despised by many people while Bailey is beloved by all. To compensate for this, they force Mr. Burns to try being friendly and even smile. Mr. Burns makes a television commercial discussing Blinky with an actor portraying Charles Darwin, who claims Blinky is an evolutionary step and not a mutated fish. Combined with a promise to lower taxes and a smear campaign against Bailey, Mr. Burns ties {{with her in the}} polls. On the night before the election, Mr. Burns's advisers suggest that Mr. Burns have dinner at the home of a middle-class family as an opportunity to put himself in the lead.

40|$|We {{present an}} automated, {{label-free}} method for lymphangiography of cutaneous lymphatic vessels in humans in vivo using {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT). This method corrects for the variation in OCT signal due to the confocal function and sensitivity fall-off of a spectral-domain OCT system and utilizes a single-scattering model to compensate for Ascan signal attenuation to enable reliable thresholding of lymphatic vessels. A segmentjoining algorithm is then incorporated into the method to mitigate partial-volume effects with small vessels. The lymphatic vessel images are augmented with images of the blood vessel network, acquired from the speckle decorrelation with additional weighting to differentiate blood vessels from the observed high decorrelation in lymphatic vessels. We demonstrate the method with longitudinal <b>scans</b> of human <b>burn</b> scar patients undergoing ablative fractional laser treatment, showing the visualization of the cutaneous lymphatic and blood vessel networks.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the ultrasound assessment of burn scars in paediatric patients and {{the association of}} these scar thickness with laser Doppler imaging (LDI) determined burn depth. A total of 60 ultrasound scar assessments were conducted on 33 scars from 21 paediatric burn patients at 3, 6 and 9 months after-burn. The mean of peak scar thickness was 0. 39 ± 0. 032 cm, with the thickest at 6 months (0. 40 ± 0. 036 cm). There were 17 scald burn scars (0. 34 ± 0. 045 cm), 4 contact burn scars (0. 61 ± 0. 092 cm), and 10 flame burn scars (0. 42 ± 0. 058 cm). Each group of scars followed normal distributions. Twenty-three scars had original <b>burns</b> successfully <b>scanned</b> by LDI and various depths of burns were presented by different colours according to blood perfusion units (PU), with dark blue < 125, light blue 125 – 250, and green 250 – 440 PU. The thickness of these scars was significantly different between the predominant colours of burns, with the thinnest scars for green coloured burns and the thickest for dark blue coloured burns. Within light blue burns, grafted burns healed with significantly thinner scars than non-grafted burns. This study indicates that LDI {{can be used for}} predicting the risk of hypertrophic scarring and for guiding burn care. To our knowledge, this is the first study to correlate the thickness of burns scars by ultrasound <b>scan</b> with <b>burn</b> depth determined by LDI.

40|$|Background: Multidisciplinary team (MDT) cancer {{meetings}} are frequently {{too large to}} be held in radiology departments, although much of the discussion at MDT meetings revolves around the radiologist’s interpretation of the patient’s imaging. Our hospital, like many district general hospitals (DGHs) in the UK, does not have a full PACS system so the radiologist has to show the films either on a viewing box or via an OHP. Aim: To modify a PC based 3 D volume rendering application developed by two of us (RSR and RL) for research purposes into a more user friendly application for presenting good quality radiological images, extracted from DICOM files, via a data projector at our weekly MDT meetings. Methods and Results: DICOM files from a selection of patients who had undergone high resolution multidetector row CT <b>scans</b> were <b>burned</b> to CD using the existing CT workstation facilities. The new software runs on a modern laptop computer with a powerful graphics card (128 MB Nvidia GeForce FX), and accesses data directly from these CDs. The quality of the images and their refresh rate was judged to be as fast as the hospital’s SG Workstations. The visualisation options include 3 D volume view, axial, coronal and sagittal views, maximum intensity projection (MIP), multi-planar reformatting (MPR), and moveable cut planes. Other features include interactive window/level and transfer function, and the ability to save images to bitmap format. Ease of use is an important consideration in the MDT setting and the software has been designed so that all of these features are selected using simple menus. Clinicians and particularly their trainees attending the MDT meetings at which the patients’ radiological images were projected up onto a large screen seem to appreciate their clarity and the ability to both see and think in 3 D with the aid of the MPR facility. Conclusions: We have shown (1) that with our software and a suitable laptop computer costing about £ 2 K it is possible to reproduce virtually all of the common functions that can be currently found on a SG Workstation costing 6 – 10 times as much and (2) linking such a system to a data projector is a relatively inexpensive way of showing radiological images at large MDT meetings...|$|R
40|$|The Campbell–Stokes {{sunshine}} recorder (CSSR) {{has been one}} of the most commonly used instruments for measuring sunshine duration (SD) through the burn length of a given CSSR card. Many authors have used SD to obtain information about cloudiness and solar radiation (by using Ångström–Prescott type formulas), but the burn width has not been used systematically. In principle, the burn width increases for increasing direct beam irradiance. The aim of this research is to show the relationship between burn width and direct solar irradiance (DSI) and to prove whether this relationship depends on the type of CSSR and burning card. A method of analysis based on image processing of digital <b>scanned</b> images of <b>burned</b> cards is used. With this method, the temporal evolution of the burn width with 1 min resolution can be obtained. From this, SD is easily calculated and compared with the traditional (i. e., visual) determination. The method tends to slightly overestimate SD, but the thresholds that are used in the image processing could be adjusted to obtain an improved estimation. Regarding the burn width, experimental results show that there is a high correlation between two different models of CSSRs, as well as a strong relationship between burn widths and DSI at a high-temporal resolution. Thus, for example, hourly DSI may be estimated from the burn width with higher accuracy than based on burn length (for one of the CSSR, relative root mean squared error is 24 and 30...|$|R
40|$|The {{admission}} and follow-up chest radiographs {{as well as}} the follow-up CT <b>scans</b> of 13 <b>burn</b> patients admitted to our clinic requiring ventilatory support were analysed for signs of inhalation injury and pulmonary complications. The findings were compared with the results of the clinical examination, the blood gas tests, and bronchoscopy. Eleven out of the 13 patients underwent bronchoscopy revealing inhalation injury. The CT scan detected pleural effusion in two patients with a normal chest radiograph. In two patients the CT scan detected asymmetrical expansion between the right lung and the left. In one patient soft tissue oedema made evaluation of the chest radiograph impossible, while the CT revealed bilateral pleural effusions and consolidations or atelectasis in both the lower lobes. In one patient the CT scan detected oedema of consolidatory pattern in every lobe (superior middle-inferior), while the image in the chest radiograph was not similar. CT identified an area of consolidation in one patient in the right middle lobe with a normal chest radiograph. The results of the CT scan correlated with the clinical course and blood gas determinations, while similar findings in the chest radiograph were observed at a later stage. In conclusion, compared to chest radiographs, the CT scan often yielded additional information in the follow-up of intubated burn patients with inhalation injury. It can be performed in order to confirm and/or more precisely define the full extent of lung injury and is also feasible in patients who are critically ill and hard to move...|$|R

The method offers a practical way to exploit long-term sets of CSSR cards to create long time series of DSI. Since DSI is affected by atmospheric aerosol content, CSSR records may also become a proxy measurement for turbidity and atmospheric aerosol loading...|$|R
