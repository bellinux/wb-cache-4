50|$|The cell-division cycle protein 20 is an {{essential}} regulator of cell division that is encoded by the CDC20 gene in humans. To the best of current knowledge its most important function is to activate the anaphase promoting complex (APC/C), a large 11-13 <b>subunit</b> <b>complex</b> that initiates chromatid separation and entrance into anaphase. The APC/CCdc20 protein complex has two main downstream targets. Firstly, it targets securin for destruction, enabling the eventual destruction of cohesin and thus sister chromatid separation. It also targets S and M-phase (S/M) cyclins for destruction, which inactivates S/M cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and allows the cell to exit from mitosis. A closely related protein, Cdc20homologue-1 (Cdh1) plays a complementary role in the cell cycle.|$|E

A slow {{conformational}} change in newly synthesized acetylcholine receptor subunits {{is thought to}} be a requisite step in the biogenesis of this multisubunit transmembrane glycoprotein.

Here we show that newly synthesized acetylcholine receptor <b>subunits</b> and <b>subunit</b> <b>complexes</b> in the muscle-like cell line, BC 3 H- 1, are associated with Bip, a ubiquitous binding protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. Characterization of the Bip/ot-subunit complex in stably transfected fibroblasts revealed that Bip associates with newly synthesized unassembled ot-subunit and some or 3, and or 6 <b>subunit</b> <b>complexes.</b> Significantly, Bip does not associate well with the more mature form of the ot-subunit containing an intramolecular disulfide bridge.

T I-IE muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), 1 originally isolated from Torpedo electric organ, is the best characterized ligand-gated channel and remains the prototype for this family of molecules. This receptor is composed of four different but homologous subunits (Noda et al., 1983) with multiple transmembrane domains assembled around a central channel in a stoichiometry of t~ 2 ~'g 5 (for reviews see Karlin, 1980; Changeux et al., 1984; Claudio, 1989).

Furthermore, both isoforms efficiently hydrolyzed Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA and ubiquitin-conjugated [125 I]lysozyme.

Maximal activation by the phospholipid was observed over a narrow concentration range; the presence in the assay mixture of lysophosphatidylcholine at concentrations above this optimum markedly inhibited p 21 GTPase. GTP hydrolysis was also stimulated, but to a lesser degree, by phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine did not significantly enhance GTPase activity. The stimulatory effect of phospholipid was mimicked, in part, by nonionic detergents. p 21 may be related to other GTPases, the regulatory guanine nucleotide-binding G proteins of the hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase complex and transducin of the retinal light-activated phosphodiesterase system.
