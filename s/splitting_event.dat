50|$|Finally, archaeogenetics {{has been}} used to study the {{occupation}} of Australia and New Guinea. The aborigines of Australia and New Guinea are phenotypically very similar, but mtDNA has shown that this is due to convergence from living in similar conditions. Non-coding regions of mt-DNA have shown “no similarities” between the aboriginal populations of Australia and New Guinea. Furthermore, no major NRY lineages are shared between the two populations. The high frequency of a single NRY lineage unique to Australia coupled with “low diversity of lineage-associated Y-chromosomal short tandem repeat (Y-STR) haplotypes” provide evidence for a “recent founder or bottleneck” event in Australia. But there is relatively large variation in mtDNA, which would imply that the bottleneck effect impacted males primarily.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel algorithm for the efficient detection and tracking of features in spatiotemporal atmospheric data, {{as well as}} for the precise localization of the occurring genesis, lysis, merging and <b>splitting</b> <b>events.</b> The algorithm works on data given on a four-dimensional structured grid. Feature selection and clustering are based on adjustable local and global criteria, feature tracking is predominantly based on spatial overlaps of the feature's full volumes. The resulting 3 -D features and the identified correspondences between features of consecutive time steps are represented as the nodes and edges of a directed acyclic graph, the event graph. Merging and <b>splitting</b> <b>events</b> appear in the event graph as nodes with multiple incoming or outgoing edges, respectively. The precise localization of the <b>splitting</b> <b>events</b> is based on a search for all grid points inside the initial 3 -D feature that have a similar distance to two successive 3 -D features of the next time step. The merging event is localized analogously, operating backward in time. As a first application of our method we present a climatology of upper-tropospheric jet streams and their events, based on four-dimensional wind speed data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses. We compare our results with a climatology from a previous study, investigate the statistical distribution of the merging and <b>splitting</b> <b>events,</b> and illustrate the meteorological significance of the jet <b>splitting</b> <b>events</b> with a case study.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel algorithm for the efficient detection and tracking of interesting features in spatial-temporal atmospheric data, {{as well as}} for the precise localization of the occurring genesis, lysis, merging and <b>splitting</b> <b>events.</b> The algorithm is based on the well-known region growing segmentation method. We extended the basic idea towards the analysis of the complete 4 -D dataset, identifying segments representing the spatial features and their development over time. Each segment consists of one set of distinct 3 -D features per time step. The algorithm keeps track of the successors of each 3 -D feature, constructing the so-called event graph of each segment. The precise localization of the <b>splitting</b> <b>events</b> is based on a search for all grid points inside the initial 3 -D feature which have a similar distance to all successive 3 -D features of the next time step.

In this report, we mapped the H 3. 3 nucleosome occupancy, the H 3. 3 nucleosome turnover rate and H 3. 3 nucleosome <b>splitting</b> <b>events</b> at the genome-wide level. Interestingly, H 3. 3 nucleosome turnover rate at the transcription starting sites (TSS) of genes with different expression levels display a bimodal distribution rather than a linear correlation towards the transcriptional activity, suggesting genes are either active with high H 3. 3 nucleosome turnover or inactive with low H 3. 3 nucleosome turnover. H 3. 3 nucleosome <b>splitting</b> <b>events</b> are enriched at active genes, which are in fact better markers for active transcription than H 3. 3 nucleosome occupancy itself.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{shape of}} phylogenetic trees {{has been used}} to make inferences about the {{evolutionary}} process by comparing the shapes of actual phylogenies with those expected under simple models of the speciation process. Previous studies have focused on speciation events, but gene duplication is another lineage <b>splitting</b> <b>event,</b> analogous to speciation, and gene loss or deletion is analogous to extinction. Measures of the shape of gene family phylogenies can thus be used to investigate the processes of gene duplication and loss. We make the first systematic attempt to use tree shape to study gene duplication using human gene phylogenies. Results We find that gene duplication has produced gene family trees significantly less balanced than expected from a simple model of the process, and less balanced than species phylogenies: the opposite to what might be expected under the 2 R hypothesis. Conclusion While other explanations are plausible, we suggest that the greater imbalance of gene family trees than species trees is due to the prevalence of tandem duplications over regional duplications during the evolution of the human genome. </p...|$|E

To assess the phylogenetic position of the Asiatic linsangs within the Feliformia, we analysed an exhaustive taxonomic sample set with cyt b and newly produced transthyretin intron I sequences (TR-I-I). TR-I-I alone and cyt b +TR-I-I combined (maximum-likelihood analysis) highly support the position of Asiatic linsangs as sister-group of the Felidae. The estimation of minimum divergence dates from molecular data suggests a <b>splitting</b> <b>event</b> ca. 33. 3 million years (Myr) ago, which lends support to historical assertions that the Asiatic linsangs are "living fossils" that share a plesiomorphic morphotype with the Oligocene feliform Paleoprionodon. The African linsang is estimated to appear more than 20 Myr later and represents the sister-group of the genus Genetta. Our phylogenetic results illustrate numerous morphological convergences of "diagnostic" characters among Feliformia that might be problematic for the identification of fossil taxa. The morphotype reappearance from the Asiatic to the African linsangs suggests that the genome of the Feliformia conserved its potential ability of expression for a peculiar adaptive phenotype throughout evolution, in this case arboreality and hypercarnivory in tropical forest...|$|E

We performed a series of numerical simulations of fictitious comets with a purely dynamical model and also with a more complete dynamical-physical model that includes besides nongravitational forces, sublimation and splitting mechanisms. With the dynamical model, we obtain a poor match between the computed distributions of orbital elements and the observed ones. However with the inclusion of physical effects in the complete model we are able to obtain good fits to observations. The best fits are attained with four splitting models with a relative weak dependence on q, and a mass loss in every <b>splitting</b> <b>event</b> that is less when the frequency is high and vice versa.

40|$|Phylloquinone is a {{compound}} {{present in all}} plants serving as cofactor for photosystem I mediated electron transport during photosynthesis. This work reports on the identification and analysis of several Arabidopsis thaliana phylloquinone absence (pha) and isochorismate synthase (ics) mutants impaired in the biosynthesis of PhQ (vitamin K 1). Besides the complete lack of PhQ, these plants show a typical phenotype characterized by seedling lethality, photosynthetic defects specifically related to impaired photosystem I accumulation/activity to 5 - 15 % of wild-type levels and partial recovery of 15 % PhQ content and 50 - 70 % PSI accumulation/activity after feeding with the metabolic precursor of vitamin K 1, 1, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 -naphthoate. Map-based localization of the mutated allele in the pha plants identified a new gene, called PHYLLO. It consists of a fusion of four previously individual eubacterial genes, menF, menD, menC, and menH, required for the biosynthesis of the photosynthetic phylloquinone in cyanobacteria and the respiratory menaquinone in eubacteria. The fact that homologous men genes still reside as polycistronic units in plastomes of red algae and in eubacterial chromosomes strongly suggests that PHYLLO derived from an operon present in the proto-organelle precursor of all plastids. The principle architecture of the PHYLLO locus is conserved in the nuclear genomes of plants and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, indicating that selective forces have been acting to maintain the cluster structure {{in the form of}} a gene fusion, presumably as an adaptation of an multifunctional association of four enzymatic activities already pre-existing in the chloroplast. In line with this finding, the data present in this work suggest that the PHYLLO composite product is part of a metabolon for the biosynthesis of phylloquinone. The menF module of PHYLLO in Chlamydomonas, encoding the isochorismate synthase activity, is full-length, whereas in higher plants this module surprisingly lacks the functional 3 ’ part, uncovering a recent gene <b>splitting</b> <b>event</b> during evolution. Such a gene fission event, which resulted in inactivation of the encoded ICS enzymatic activity from PHYLLO, must have been preceded by establishment of a second functional copy of the menF gene. Accordingly, double-knockouts of the ICS 1 and ICS 2 genes in Arabidopsis analysed during this work, were unable to synthesize PhQ, demonstrating that the activity of the menF module of PHYLLO has been replaced after the splitting of the 3 ’-region by at least one more ICS gene present in genomes of higher plants. The fact that ICS 1 is also required for salicylic acid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, establishes a metabolic link between photosynthesis and systemic acquired resistance. Therefore, gene fusion, duplication and fission events adapted a eubacterial multienzymatic system to the metabolic requirements of plants. Despite the essential function of PhQ for PSI stability and plant viability, analyses of ics heterozygous knockout plants, as well as complementation of the pha mutants by NA feeding and transgenic forms of PHYLLO demonstrate that the bulk of cellular phylloquinone is not associated with photosystem I, opening the possibility for additional functions of vitamin K 1 in plant cell membranes...|$|E
