40|$|Several {{organizations}} have conventional and activity-based cost management (ABCM) <b>systems</b> <b>or</b> models {{to determine the}} costs of their products, services, projects and clients.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop a classification system for cost management and ABCM <b>systems</b> <b>or</b> models. To meet this objective, controllers of 42 Canadian and French organizations that have claimed to have changed their cost management <b>systems</b> <b>or</b> implemented ABCM were interviewed to obtain an in-depth vision of the <b>systems</b> <b>or</b> models that they have put in place. Building on the insights gained from these interviews and previous work on cost management system characteristics, the construction of a cladogram is proposed. This cladogram will help academics and practitioners to better understand the nature of their organizationâ€™s cost management system and to move beyond to a more complex and realistic view of cost management systems whether they are conventional or ABCM. ...|$|R
