5|$|HMS Medway was {{the first}} {{purpose-built}} submarine depot <b>ship</b> <b>constructed</b> for the Royal Navy. She was built by Vickers Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness during the late 1920s. The ship served on the China Station before the Second World War and was transferred to Egypt in early 1940. Ordered to evacuate Alexandria {{in the face of}} the German advance after the Battle of Gazala in May 1942, Medway sailed for Lebanon at the end of June, escorted by a light cruiser and seven destroyers. Her strong escort could not protect her; on 30 June a German submarine torpedoed and sank her.|$|E

5|$|SMS Oldenburg {{was laid}} {{down at the}} AG Vulcan {{shipyard}} in Stettin in 1883, launched in December 1884 and commissioned into the Navy in April 1886. Oldenburg was intended {{to have been a}} fifth member of the Sachsen class, but budgetary limitations and dissatisfaction with the ships of the Sachsen class prompted a redesign that bore little resemblance to the earlier vessels. Oldenburg mounted her main battery of eight 24cm guns amidships, six in a central casemate on the main deck and two directly above them on the broadside. She was the first German capital <b>ship</b> <b>constructed</b> entirely from German-made steel.|$|E
5|$|The first ship {{to arrive}} was HMS Africaine under the Captain Robert Corbet. In the Action of 13 September 1810, Corbet engaged Bouvet's two frigates alone and was defeated, dying of his wounds {{shortly after the}} battle. Rowley in Boadicea was able to {{recapture}} Africaine later in the day, but the frigate was severely damaged and unable to provide any reinforcement to the British squadron. Bouvet retired to Grand Port several days later for repairs, and thus was not on blockade duty on 17 September when HMS Ceylon arrived. Ceylon was an unusual <b>ship,</b> <b>constructed</b> by the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) in Bombay as an East Indiaman merchant ship designed to operate as a 32gun frigate during wartime. In 1805 she was purchased by the British government and commissioned into the Royal Navy for service in the Indian Ocean. In 1810, her commander was Captain Charles Gordon, who had been ordered to sail to Rowley's aid when word of the losses suffered at Grand Port reached Madras. In his haste to depart, Gordon {{had been unable to}} obtain any Royal Marines, whose place was taken by 100 men of the 69th Regiment and the 86th Regiment from the Madras garrison. Also embarked was General John Abercromby and his staff, who were to lead a planned assault on Île de France.|$|E

25|$|Admiral Bowen {{described}} {{the situation at}} the yard in detail in his 1954 memoir, Ships, Machinery and Mossbacks. According to Bowen, the seizure saved the government over $13 million. For example, , built in San Pedro, cost $24.8 million, but sister <b>ship</b> , <b>constructed</b> in Camden, cost only $12.8 million. It also took nearly a year longer to construct Ajax.|$|E
25|$|The yard also {{constructed}} several {{merchant marine}} ships, including Thomas W. Lawson, the largest pure sailing ship ever built, and , {{which was the}} first <b>ship</b> <b>constructed</b> to carry refrigerated chemicals. General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division, as it eventually came to be known, ended its career as a producer of various LNG tankers and merchant marine ships.|$|E

Resuming commercial service in 1948 after being overhauled, the ship experienced a number of problems in the 1950s, including two fires. However this diesel-powered ship's career continued until 1960, when she was sold for scrap to Thos W Ward.

25|$|Skomvær was {{the name}} of a steel-hulled barque built in 1890 for J. C. & G. Knudsen in Porsgrunn, Telemark, Norway. The ship, which was {{designed}} by naval architect Randulf Hansen and constructed at Laxevaags Maskin- og Jernskibsbyggeri in Bergen, was the first sailing <b>ship</b> <b>constructed</b> with steel in Norway and for a time the largest Norwegian sailing vessel ever built.

25|$|The Minnie A. Caine was {{the first}} sailing <b>ship</b> <b>constructed</b> by Seattle {{shipbuilding}} company The Moran Brothers which generally specialized in steam-powered vessels. One worker died during the ship construction when the scaffolding collapsed in May 1900. The vessel's price was $55,000. The construction was supervised by George Monk, Ed Monk's father. On October 6, 1900 at 2:30 pm, in front of three thousand spectators, the Minnie A. Caine was launched broadside, creating a spectacular splash. The same day the vessel was christened by Nellie Moran, Robert Moran's daughter.|$|E
25|$|A {{community}} of sealers and others existed on Kangaroo Island from 1802 {{to the time}} of South Australia's colonisation in 1836. The sealers were rough men and several kidnapped Aboriginal women from Tasmania and mainland South Australia. The women were kept prisoner as wives and virtual slaves. At least two contemporary accounts report of (Taplin 1867, Bull 1884) reputed crossings of Backstairs Passage from Kangaroo Island to the mainland by kidnapped women seeking to escape from their captors. 'A fine specimen of her race' was pointed out to J.W. Bull as having swum the passage in 1835, and a woman and her baby were found dead on the beach after a presumed crossing in 1871. In 1803 sealers from the American brig Union built the schooner Independence, the first <b>ship</b> <b>constructed</b> in South Australia, at what is now American River.|$|E

500|$|The Tessarakonteres ( [...] , [...] "forty-rowed"), {{or simply}} [...] "forty" [...] {{was a very}} large {{catamaran}} galley reportedly built in the Hellenistic period by Ptolemy IV Philopator of Egypt. It was described {{by a number of}} ancient sources, including a lost work by Callixenus of Rhodes and surviving texts by Athenaeus and Plutarch. According to these descriptions, supported by modern research by Lionel Casson, the enormous size of the vessel made it impractical and it was built only as a prestige vessel, rather than an effective warship. The name [...] "forty" [...] refers not to the number of oars, but to the number of rowers on each column of oars that propelled it, and at the size described {{it would have been the}} largest <b>ship</b> <b>constructed</b> in antiquity, and probably the largest human-powered vessel ever built.|$|E
500|$|There {{are various}} ways {{to define the}} term bulk carrier. As of 1999, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea defines a bulk carrier as [...] "a <b>ship</b> <b>constructed</b> with a single deck, top side tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces and {{intended}} to primarily carry dry cargo in bulk; an ore carrier; or a combination carrier." [...] However, most classification societies use a broader definition where a bulker is any ship that carries dry unpackaged goods. Multipurpose cargo ships can carry bulk cargo, but can also carry other cargoes and are not specifically designed for bulk carriage. The term [...] "dry bulk carrier" [...] is used to distinguish bulkers from bulk liquid carriers such as oil, chemical, or liquefied petroleum gas carriers. [...] Very small bulkers are almost indistinguishable from general cargo ships, and they are often classified based more on the ship's use than its design.|$|E
