5|$|Although the {{two leaders}} had a strong relationship, by 1960 US {{officials}} were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian procrastination on vital issues, such as whether Canada should join the Organization of American States (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F. Kennedy won the race, he sent <b>Senator</b> <b>Kennedy</b> a note of congratulations. Kennedy did not respond until Canadian officials asked {{what had become of}} Diefenbaker's note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was annoyed at the President-elect's slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in the Eisenhower administration, little else could be accomplished.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, the {{legislature}} and local press started questioning {{the actions of the}} Puerto Rico Police, the Puerto Rico Justice Department, the U.S. Justice Department, and the FBI actions during the first investigation, alleging corruption within the agencies and a conspiracy to cover-up evidence. Letters were sent by various community and political leaders to then Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Edward M. Kennedy, asking for an inquiry into the conduct of the Federal investigations. Several letters even accused former US Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti of providing aid to Gov. Romero Barceló during the investigations. Two leaders from the opposing parties, the Popular Democratic Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party, charged that after a December 1979 meeting between the two, the Governor, then considered as a lifelong Republican, began campaigning to deliver the 41 Democratic Party convention votes of the island for President Jimmy Carter's (D) nomination for the presidency (ironically, Carter’s opponent for the nomination was <b>Senator</b> <b>Kennedy).</b> Almost 45 days after President Carter won the nomination by only one delegate, the U.S. Justice Department announced that due to lack of evidence it was bringing its investigation of the case to an end. A Justice Department internal memorandum that was issued the same month of Romero Barceló’s and Civiletti’s meeting later proved that the investigations were closed even when agents were still investigating important evidence of the case that could potentially incriminate the officers, including “several unexplained contusions” on a victim's face and the fact that one of the police officers recanted his original story, stating that there was in fact “two bursts of firing”.|$|E

25|$|Kennedy's {{close ties}} with Republican (GOP) Senator Joseph McCarthy {{strengthened}} his family's position among Irish Catholics, but weakened it among liberals who strongly opposed McCarthy. Even before McCarthy became famous in 1950, Kennedy had forged {{close ties with}} the Republican <b>Senator.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> often brought him to his family compound at Hyannis Port as a weekend house guest in the late 1940s. McCarthy at one point dated Patricia Kennedy.|$|E
25|$|Most {{polls showed}} McGovern running well behind {{incumbent}} President Richard Nixon, except when McGovern was paired with Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy. McGovern and his campaign brain trust lobbied <b>Senator</b> <b>Kennedy</b> heavily {{to accept the}} bid to be McGovern's running mate. Much to their surprise, he continually refused their advances, and instead suggested such figures as House Ways and Means Committee chairman Wilbur Mills of Arkansas and Boston Mayor Kevin White.|$|E

25|$|By 1954 Robert F. Kennedy and McCarthy's chief aide Roy Cohn had had {{a falling}} out, and Robert no longer worked for McCarthy.

When the Senate voted to censure McCarthy on December 2, 1954, <b>Senator</b> <b>Kennedy</b> {{was in the hospital}} and never indicated how he would cast his vote.

25|$|Lowenstein {{was one of}} {{the most}} vocal critics of the unwillingness of Los Angeles and federal {{authorities}} to reopen the investigation into the June 6, 1968, assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Lowenstein's one-hour appearance on the PBS television show Firing Line in 1975, where he was interviewed by William F. Buckley Jr., {{was one of the}} first times the American public were shown that many elements of ballistic and forensic evidence were radically at odds with eyewitness testimony and the assumption that Sirhan Sirhan alone had shot <b>Senator</b> <b>Kennedy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hannan was in Rome for {{meetings}} of the Second Session of the Second Vatican Council in November 1963 when news reached him concerning the assassination of President John F.

Cushing {{was a close friend}} of the family who had witnessed and blessed the marriage of <b>Senator</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and Jacqueline Bouvier in 1953, baptized two of their children, given the invocation at President Kennedy's inauguration, and officiated at the recent funeral of the President's infant son, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy.|$|E

500|$|Furcolo ran for Governor of Massachusetts in 1956, easily {{winning the}} Democratic party {{nomination}} and primary. [...] The campaign against Republican Lieutenant Governor Sumner G.

[...] Furcolo was further characterized by Republicans {{as a part of}} the Dever political machine who would be beholden to Boston interests. <b>Senator</b> <b>Kennedy</b> in this election specifically endorsed Furcolo for the office. [...] Furcolo won the election and was re-elected in 1958, easily defeating former Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Charles Gibbons, who was chosen by the Republicans as a write-in candidate after their chosen nominee, Attorney General George Fingold, died two months before the election.

2500|$|The phrase [...] "Quemoy and Matsu" [...] {{became part}} of American {{political}} language in the 1960 U.S. presidential election. During the debates, both candidates, Vice-President Richard Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy, pledged to use American forces if necessary to protect Taiwan from invasion by the PRC, which the United States did not recognize as a legitimate government. But the two candidates had different opinions about whether to use American forces to protect Taiwan's forward positions, Quemoy and Matsu, also. In fact, <b>Senator</b> <b>Kennedy</b> stated that these islands - as little as 5.5 {{miles off the coast}} of China and as much as 106 miles from Taiwan - were strategically indefensible and were not essential to the defense of Taiwan. On the contrary, Vice-President Nixon maintained that since Quemoy and Matsu were in the [...] "area of freedom," [...] they should not be surrendered to the Communists as a matter of [...] "principle." ...|$|E
2500|$|While the Kennedy and Reggie {{families}} were friends for many years, Vicki remembers (but <b>Senator</b> <b>Kennedy</b> did not) their first meeting, when Vicki was a summer intern in his Senate office's mailroom, the year following her college graduation. They began dating after meeting again in June 1991 {{at a party}} celebrating her parents' 40th wedding anniversary. [...] Ted Kennedy said of this meeting, [...] "I had known Vicki before, {{but this was the}} first time I think I really saw her." [...] The relationship became serious in September 1991. [...] They were engaged in March 1992, and married July 3, 1992, in a civil ceremony at his home in McLean, Virginia. [...] His political career had suffered from a long period of womanizing, drinking, and adverse publicity, and she is credited with stabilizing his personal life and helping him resume a productive career in the Senate. [...] Kennedy was devoted to her two children.|$|E
2500|$|At Twentieth and Providence Avenues, the Nixon {{motorcade}} {{suddenly stopped}} and Nixon strode {{across the street}} to greet John McClure, who was recovering in a wheelchair from a hip fracture. [...] "They (the Secret Service) didn't want me to stop, but I just couldn't pass you up." [...] They both chatted for a few moments, then Nixon and his motorcade continued up Route 320, stopping in Swarthmore, the Springfield Shopping Center, Lawrence Park, Newtown Square, West Chester, before stopping in Paoli. Seven days later, <b>Senator</b> <b>Kennedy</b> appeared in Chester at Sixth and Penn Streets, drawing the largest ever crowd in the city, some 15,000 to 20,000. He continued to hammer away at the themes of America's lagging prestige abroad and lagging economy at home. [...] "I want the U.S. to meet its responsibilities at home and abroad and the U.S. to move forward", he told the crowds. [...] "This is more of a contest between the comfortable and the concerned - those who are satisfied with things as they are and those who want to move forward." [...] Two days earlier, Kennedy had declared: [...] "I say we can't afford another recession." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to {{news reports}} at the time, {{residents}} feared that <b>Senator</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> visit {{was going to}} be a publicity stunt showing the people of Eastern Kentucky as backwards [...] "and with out hope."
