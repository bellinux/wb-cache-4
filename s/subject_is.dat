5|$|The 3rd person {{singular}} and plural nominative forms, ngonggega and bogo, {{are labeled}} 'rare' {{because they are}} gradually becoming disused. Speakers prefer to use non-personal pronouns such as gayh- 'that' or gayh-gorden 'those'. Moreover, since the person and number of the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> contained in the prefix of the verb, nominative free pronouns are often dropped.|$|E

5|$|Big Painting No. 6 (sometimes Big Painting or Big Painting VI) is a 1965 oil and Magna {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. Measuring 235cm × 330cm (92.5 in × 129 in), {{it is part}} of the Brushstrokes series of artworks that includes several paintings and sculptures whose <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> the actions made with a house-painter's brush.

Law enforcement in protected areas may use horses in places where mechanised transport is difficult or prohibited. Horses can be {{an essential part of}} an overall team effort as they can move faster on the ground than a human on foot, can transport heavy equipment, and provide a more rested rescue worker when a <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> found.|$|E

5|$|In the {{subordinate}} clause the subject, if {{different from the}} subject of main clause, sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case. There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking ablative case as well. Subjects of attributive clauses in which the head has a function (as {{is the case for}} all English relative clauses) usually require that if the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> not the head, then it take the genitive, e.g. tüünij idsen hool that.one- eat- meal 'the meal that s/he had eaten'.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} cost of insecticide resistance is significant, but published {{data on the}} <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> minimal. In 1994, total costs of the insecticide and crop losses in the US state of Michigan were $13.3 million, representing 13.7% of {{the total value of}} the crop. The estimate of the cost implication of insecticides and crop losses per hectare is $138–368. Long-term increased cost to the Michigan potato industry caused by insecticide resistance in Colorado potato beetle was estimated at $0.9 to $1.4 million each year.|$|E

5|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} of the introduction of polar coordinates {{as part of a}} formal coordinate system. The full history of the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> described in Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidge's Origin of Polar Coordinates. Grégoire de Saint-Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid-seventeenth century. Saint-Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647, while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653. Cavalieri first used polar coordinates to solve a problem relating to the area within an Archimedean spiral. Blaise Pascal subsequently used polar coordinates to calculate the length of parabolic arcs.|$|E
5|$|These {{include two}} images {{that show the}} subject standing. One captures a full length view, in which the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> unclothed except {{for a pair of}} {{stockings}} and shoes. In the other, the subject's right leg is raised to provide a clearer view of the genitalia. Another image presents the subject lying back with one arm covering the face while someone else's hand pulls on the penile tissue. A similar photograph shows the subject in an examination position, with a hand– visible in the uncut photographic plate as belonging to Maisonneuve– spreading the vaginal lips. The series also includes a close-up of the subject's genitalia, with the legs open.|$|E
5|$|To {{distinguish}} various subtypes, polysomnography is required. This {{usually requires}} brief admission {{to a hospital}} with a specialized sleep medicine department where {{a number of different}} measurements are conducted while the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> asleep; this includes electroencephalography (electronic registration of electrical activity in the brain), electrocardiography (same for electrical activity in the heart), pulse oximetry (measurement of oxygen levels) and often other modalities. Blood tests are also recommended for the identification of hypothyroidism and polycythemia.|$|E

One <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> excluded for incorrectly answering both catch trials, and of the 48 remaining <b>subjects,</b> 16 <b>were</b> male (mean age[*]=[*] 38.65 years). One hundred and nineteen <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> recruited to complete the final VCRT followed by an additional test discussed in study 3 (Novel Object Memory Test) and were compensated US$ 0.75 for completing both.

5|$|Today {{physicists}} {{continue to}} look for applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence in quantum field theory. In addition to the applications to nuclear physics advocated by Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators, condensed matter physicists such as Subir Sachdev have used string theory methods to understand some aspects of condensed matter physics. A notable result in this direction was the description, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, of the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. Another emerging <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> the fluid/gravity correspondence, which uses the AdS/CFT correspondence to translate problems in fluid dynamics into problems in general relativity.|$|E
5|$|Van Meegeren was a {{prolific}} artist and produced thousands of original paintings {{in a number}} of diverse styles. This wide range in painting and drawing styles often irritated art critics. Some of his typical works are classical still lifes in convincing 17th century manner, Impressionistic paintings of people frolicking on lakes or beaches, jocular drawings where the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> drawn with rather odd features, Surrealistic paintings with combined fore- and backgrounds. Van Meegeren's portraits, however, are probably his finest works.|$|E
5|$|When {{taking the}} patient's medical history, the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> {{questioned}} about any significant signs or symptoms, such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing. These may suggest obstructing lesions in various locations within the upper airway, larynx, or tracheobronchial tree. A history of previous surgery (e.g., previous cervical fusion), injury, radiation therapy, or tumors involving the head, neck and upper chest {{can also provide}} clues to a potentially difficult intubation. Previous experiences with tracheal intubation, especially difficult intubation, intubation for prolonged duration (e.g., intensive care unit) or prior tracheotomy are also noted.|$|E

30|$|By {{analyzing}} {{the results in}} Tables 1, 2, and 3, it can be observed that the proposed algorithm performs {{at a level that}} is rather close to that of human subjects. The algorithm shows a good correlation for length and width values. In fact, for length values, the average correlation among human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> 0.97, whereas the correlation of the proposed algorithm to human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> 0.99. Similarly, for width values, the average correlation among human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> 0.89, whereas the correlation of the proposed algorithm to human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> 0.95. In the case of orientation measures, the correlation is not as good as for the other characterization parameters. In fact, the average correlation among human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> 0.92, whereas the correlation of the proposed algorithm to human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> only 0.89.

Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is in the car and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease if the car explodes. Mulder finds the bomb in the ceiling.|$|E
