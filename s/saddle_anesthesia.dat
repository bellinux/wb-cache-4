40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} effects of intratracheal general {{anesthesia}} (ITGA) and regional (<b>saddle</b> block) <b>anesthesia</b> on leptin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cortisol blood concentrations during anorectal surgery. Methods: Fifty-eight patients suffering from hemorrhoidal disease, pilonidal sinus, anal fissure, or anal fistula were included the study. Patients were randomly assigned {{into one of the}} two groups (n[*]=[*] 29). Patients in one group received ITGA. After thiopental and fentanyl induction, vecuronium was used as a muscle relaxant. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. In the other group we applied saddle block, injecting hyperbaric bupivacaine into the subarachnoid space, through the L 3 -L 4 intervertebral space, in the sitting position. Blood samples were collected for leptin, CRP, and cortisol analysis before the induction of anesthesia at 3 and 24 hours postoperatively. Results: Preoperative leptin, CRP, and cortisol concentrations were comparable between the groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} postoperative levels of leptin and CRP in both groups. Although not significant, leptin and CRP concentrations were lower in the saddle block group at three hours postoperatively (mean[*]±[*]SD, 6. 95 [*]±[*] 8. 59 and 6. 02 [*]±[*] 12. 25, respectively) than in the ITGA group (mean[*]±[*]SD, 9. 04 [*]±[*] 9. 89 and 8. 40 [*]±[*] 15. 75, respectively). During early postoperative period, cortisol increased slightly in the ITGA group and remained at similar level in the saddle block group, but later decreased in both groups. Cortisol levels in the saddle block group were significantly lower than in the ITGA group at 3 hours postoperatively (343. 7 [*]±[*] 329. 6 vs 611. 4 [*]±[*] 569. 8; P[*]=[*] 0. 034). Conclusion: Saddle block, a regional anesthetic technique, may attenuate stress response in patients undergoing anorectal surgery, by blocking afferent neural input during early postoperative perio...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relative risk of perinatal complications in common childhood disorders. Specifically, the ability of perinatal complications to predict membership into children's disorders was studied. The sample consisted of 634 normal children and children with mental retardation, learning disabilities, and emotional handicaps, whose mothers completed the Maternal Perinatal Scale (WS). Seven MPS items significantly contributed {{to the prediction of}} the mentally retarded, learning disabled, emotionally handicapped, and regular education groups. The two significant discriminant functions correctly classified about 46 % of the students, with the greatest misclassification occuring for those with emotional handicaps. When the separate disorders were collapsed to form a single group, eleven MPS items significantly contributed to the prediction of the special education and regular education groups. The linear composite from discriminant function analysis correctly classified about 74 % of the students. Some 89 % of the special education students were correctly classified. When MPS factors were used as predictors, 90 % of the special education students were correctly classified. Seven MPS factors comprised the discriminant function. Relative risk ratios were computed for each perinatal item. Significant relative risk ratios included maternal weight over 151 pounds, <b>saddle</b> block <b>anesthesia,</b> no anesthesia, stress during pregnancy, prenatal care, medically induced labor, unplanned pregnancy, medication use during pregnancy, hypoxia, and cigarette use during pregnancy. An overall relative risk of 6. 35 was computed based on the linear composite of perinatal variables defined by the discriminant function, suggesting that a suggesting that a synergism of perinatal complications makes a child over 6 {{times more likely to be}} placed in special education. A second overall relative risk of 3. 83 was derived from the linear composite of MPS factor scores. This indicated that children with a perinatal history marked by this particular combination of perinatal complications were nearly 4 times as likely to require special educational services. Results were discussed in terms of comorbidity among special education categories. The potential use of the MPS as a screener for early intervention was also discussed.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} a <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia</b> with different doses of chloroprocaine in perianal surgery. METHODS: Total 60 Patients aged 18 – 75 years (Anesthesiologists grade I or II) scheduled to receive perianal surgery. Patients using <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia</b> were randomized to group A, group B and group C {{with the same}} concentration (0. 5 %) chloroprocaine with different doses 1. 0 mL, 0. 8 mL and 0. 6 mL, respectively. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR) and the sensory and motor block were recorded to evaluate the anesthesia effect of chloroprocaine in each group. RESULTS: The duration of sensory block of group C is shorter than those of group A and B. The maximum degree of motor block is observed (group C: 0 level, group A: III level; and group B: I level) after 15 minutes. Besides, there was a better anesthetic effect in group B than group A and group C, such as walking after <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> However, {{there is also no}} significant difference of blood pressure decreasing in these three groups. CONCLUSION: It’s worth to employ a <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia</b> with appropriate doses of chloroprocaine in clinical perianal surgery...|$|E
40|$|Objective : This {{study was}} {{investigated}} on the Scolopendrid Pharmacopuncture of Caude equina syndrome {{which has been}} described as a complex of low back pain, bilateral sciatica, <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia</b> and motor weakness in the lower extremity that progress to paraplegia with baldder and bowel incontinence. Methods & Results : Clinical observation was done on Cauda equina syndrome in the Department of Acupuncture & Moxibustion, Woosuk jeonju Oriental Medical Hospital frome May 30 to July 13. The patient was treated with Scolopendrid Pharmacopuncture at Shinsu(B 23), Gihaesu(B 24), Taejangsu(B 25), Gwanweonsu(b 26), Dangryo(b 31), Charyo(b 32), Jang-gang(gv 1) and Hoe-eum(cv 1) with Oriental Medicine treatment. We evaluated SF- 36, the bladder incontinence, bowel incontinence, sensibility by sting skin, before and after treatmeat. Conclusion : 1. At the early time, gait disturbance was treated well, but discomfort of bladder incontinence, bilateral sciatica, <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia</b> and motor weakness was remained. 2. The symptoms of Cauada equina syndrome, especially bladder incontinence and bilateral sciatica, was recurred in short duration by scolopendrid Pharmacopuncture and oriental medicine treatment...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{request for}} lumbosacral MRI in Iran  based on {{previous}} studies is high (almost half of all MRI cases), so, our study is concerned with investigating the necessity of lumbosacral MRI request in patients with low back pain that is covered by  complementary health insurance in Tehran through comparing  MRI practice with valid guidelines. Methods: Information of 274 complementary insured patients at Dana Insurance Company in Tehran, who had undergone low back MRI was studied. A portion of information in the questionnaire including age, sex, the physician’s field of specialty, and MRI report, {{was derived from the}} medical records. Other information based on guidelines indications, including duration of the prolonged back pain, record of associated infection, malignancy or trauma, <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> lower limb motor deficit and incontinence of urine or feces, was elicited from patients orally. Results: Males represented 35 % and females 65 % of patients. Also, males were on average 10 years younger than females. Over 90 % of MRI scans were requested by three fields of specialty (orthopedic, neurosurgery and neurology). Considering the indications of lumbar spine MRI request (prolonged back pain of more than one month duration, incontinence of urine or feces, lower limb motor deficit, <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> recent related trauma, infection and malignancy), approximately 20 % of lumbar spine MRI scans were prescribed in accordance with guidelines. Conclusion: Out of every five cases of lumbar spine MRI, four cases were not requested based on guidelines, suggesting needs for local guideline design and revising the manner in which MRI scans are prescribed for low back pain in complementary health insured patients in Tehran...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Although {{vertebral}} and epidural metastases are common, intradural metastases and intramedullary {{spinal cord}} metastases are rare. The indications {{for the treatment}} of intramedullary spinal cord metastases remain controversial. We present the first biopsy-proven case of an intramedullary spinal cord metastasis from adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Case presentation Our patient was a 68 -year-old right-handed Caucasian man with a Gleason grade 4 [*]+[*] 3 prostate adenocarcinoma who had previously undergone a prostatectomy, androgen blockade and transurethral debulking. He presented with new-onset <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia</b> and fecal incontinence. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a spindle-shaped intramedullary lesion of the conus medullaris. Our patient underwent decompression and an excisional biopsy; the lesion’s pathology was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Postoperatively, our patient received CyberKnife ® radiosurgery to the resection cavity at a marginal dose of 27 Gy to the 85 % isodose line. At three months follow-up, our patient remains neurologically stable with no new deficits or lesions. Conclusions We review the literature and discuss the indications for surgery and radiosurgery for intramedullary spinal cord metastases. We also report the novel use of stereotactic radiosurgery to sterilize the resection cavity following an excisional biopsy of the metastasis. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{comprehensiveness}} {{of physical}} therapists' {{adherence to the}} guidelines for red flag documentation for patients with low back pain has not previously been described. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to describe that comprehensiveness. Red flags are warning signs that suggest that physician referral may be warranted. Clinic charts for 160 patients with low back pain seen at 6 outpatient physical therapy clinics were retrospectively reviewed, noting the presence or absence of 11 red flag items. Seven of the 11 red flag items were documented over 98 % of the time. Most charts (96. 3 %) had at least 64 % of the red flag items documented. Documentation of red flags was comprehensive in some areas but lacking in others. Red flags that were regularly documented included age over 50, bladder dysfunction, history of cancer, immune suppression, night pain, history of trauma, <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> and lower extremity neurological deficit. The red flags not regularly documented included weight loss, recent infection, and fever/chills. Factors influencing item documentation comprehensiveness are discussed, and suggestions are provided to enhance the completeness of recording patient examination data. The study results provide a red flag documentation benchmark for clinicians working with patients with low back pain and they lay the groundwork for future research...|$|E
40|$|Background: Spinal dural {{arteriovenous}} fistula (SDAVF) is a {{known cause}} of nontraumatic slow progressive araparesia and is frequently overlooked because its clinical features overlap with more common causes of myelopathy and also neuroimaging may be normal. Case Report: A 53 year-old man with developed weakness of both lower limbs had symptoms begun spontaneously 3. 5 month before admission and progressed from 1 month ago with bowel and bladder incontinence. The patient's physical examination was normal and neurologic testing revealed lower extremity motor strength of 3 / 5. Deep tendon reflexes were decreased and superficial abdominal reflexes were absent. Sensation of pinprick and temperature was absent distal to the T 4 -T 5 level. Vibration and proprioception were decreased to the ankle and <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia</b> {{and the patient}} was non ambulatory. Laboratory routine and specific tests for vitamin B 12 level, hepatitis, HIV, HTLV 1, 2 were negative. MRI of spine with and without contrast {{raised the possibility of}} dural arteriovenous malformation extended from T 3 level to conus medullaris which was confirmed by angiography. The patient referred to neurosurgeon for deciding route of treatment. Conclusion: SDAVF can be a significant non traumatic slowly progressive cause of myelopathy. The majority of the affected patients are males older than 50 years of age. Rapid diagnosis in these patients leads to significant improvement...|$|E

40|$|Spinal {{epidural}} abscess is a severe, generally pyogenic, {{infection of}} the epidural space of spinal cord or cauda equina. The swelling caused by the abscess leads to compression or vascular disruption of neurological structures that requires urgent surgical decompression to avoid significant permanent disability. We share a rare case of Klebsiella pneumoniae spinal epidural abscess secondary to haematogenous spread of previous lung infection that presented late at our centre with cauda equina syndrome that showed good short-term outcome in delayed decompression. A 50 -year old female presented with one-week history of persistent low back pain with progressively worsening bilateral lower limb weakness for seven days and urinary retention associated with <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia</b> of 2 -day duration. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the lumbo-sacral region showed an intramuscular collection of abscess at left gluteus maximus and left multifidus muscle with a L 3 -L 5 posteriorly placed extradural lesion enhancing peripherally on contrast, suggestive of epidural abscess that compressed the cauda equina. The pus was drained using the posterior lumbar approach. Tissue and pus culture revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae, suggestive of bacterial infection. The patient made immediate improvement of muscle power over bilateral lower limbs postoperative followed by ability to control micturition and defecation in the 4 th post-operative day. A good short-term outcome in delayed decompression of cauda equine syndrome is extremely rare. Aggressive surgical decompression combined with antibiotic therapy led to good short-term outcome in this patient despite delayed decompression of more than 48 hours. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In renal transplantation, {{there is}} end-to-side {{anastomosis}} of renal artery to {{external iliac artery}} and end-to-end anastomosis of renal artery to internal iliac artery. The end-to-end internal iliac artery anastomosis {{can be associated with}} complications due to compromised distal vascular supply to limbs and penile erectile tissue. A method of end-to-side anastomosis can overcome them. Till date, there is no case series or trial that has studied the effect of end-to-side anastomosis. This study is aimed at comparing the outcome of end-to-side and end-to-end anastomosis, so as to evaluate the efficacy of end-to-side technique. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 renal transplant recipients were taken, with internal iliac artery anastomosis, and were divided into two groups, 20 patients with end-to-end and 20 patients with end-to-side anastomosis. The cold ischemia time, arterial anastomosis time, post-operative bleeding and urine leak, claudication, <b>saddle</b> <b>anesthesia</b> and erectile dysfunction, and follow-up recipient creatinine and eGFR and Doppler to look for graft renal artery patency (at 6 months post-transplant) were compared between the two groups. Results: The intraoperative cold ischemia time was slightly more in the group with end-to-end anastomosis, but it was statistically significant (P = 0. 22). The arterial anastomosis time was comparable in both the groups (P = 0. 65). In the end-to-end group, 15 %, 20 % and 15 % patients had post-operative saddle anaesthesia, claudication and mild-to-moderate erectile dysfunction, which were absent in the end-to-side group. On follow-up, the mean recipient serum creatinine and eGFR were comparable in the two groups. Also, the graft renal artery patency on Doppler was comparable. Conclusion: The end-to-side technique can be definitely applied for renal transplantation, with some advantages over end-to-end technique, and without compromising efficacy...|$|E
