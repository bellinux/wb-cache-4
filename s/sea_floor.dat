5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in spring or early summer, and the larvae hatch in summer, living as plankton. They settle to the <b>sea</b> <b>floor</b> again as post-larvae {{in the late}} summer and fall.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} large numbers of organisms {{actually}} consumed by the walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the <b>sea</b> <b>floor,</b> releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day the}} crossback stingaree {{is usually}} {{inactive}} {{and can be found}} partially or completely buried in sand on the <b>sea</b> <b>floor.</b> It is a carnivore and adults forage for crustaceans, polychaete worms and other small invertebrates on the seafloor. Juveniles feed on smaller crustaceans such as isopods, amphipods and shrimps.|$|E
50|$|Halophila decipiens, {{commonly}} known as Caribbean seagrass or paddle grass, is a seagrass in the family Hydrocharitaceae. It grows underwater on sandy or muddy <b>sea</b> <b>floors</b> in shallow parts of tropical seas.|$|R
50|$|A {{preferential}} {{habitat is}} a <b>seabed</b> <b>floor,</b> {{with a relatively}} smooth bottom of gravelly sand; {{an example of this}} prime habitat is the <b>floor</b> of the <b>Sea</b> of the Hebrides. Sand eels typically burrow in the sand to escape from predators.|$|R
50|$|Halophila engelmannii, {{commonly}} known as star grass and Engelmann's seagrass, is a flowering plant, a seagrass in the family Hydrocharitaceae. It grows underwater on sandy or muddy <b>sea</b> <b>floors</b> in shallow parts of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.|$|R
5|$|In 2016, a {{scientific}} drilling project drilled {{deep into the}} peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current <b>sea</b> <b>floor,</b> to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects.|$|E
5|$|Kimberella dwelt {{in shallow}} waters (up {{to tens of}} meters in depth), sharing the calm, well-oxygenated <b>sea</b> <b>floor</b> with {{photosynthetic}} organisms and microbial mats. Assemblages bearing Kimberella often also bear fossils of Andiva, Yorgia, Dickinsonia, Tribrachidium and Charniodiscus, suggesting that it lived alongside these organisms.|$|E
5|$|On 28 December 1963, {{submarine}} activity 2.5km (1.5mi) to {{the northeast}} of Surtsey caused {{the formation of a}} ridge 100m (328ft) high on the <b>sea</b> <b>floor.</b> This seamount was named Surtla, but never reached sea level. Eruptions at Surtla ended on 6 January 1964, and it has since been eroded from its minimum depth of 23m (75ft) to 47m (154ft) below sea level.|$|E
50|$|For {{defensive}} purposes, navies use {{arrays of}} magnetometers laid across <b>sea</b> <b>floors</b> in strategic locations (i.e. around ports) to monitor submarine activity. The Russian 'Goldfish' (titanium submarines) were {{designed and built}} at great expense to thwart such systems (as pure titanium is non-magnetic).|$|R
50|$|Very {{deep ocean}} {{water has been}} {{discovered}} {{in a number of}} troughs in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Depths can range from 1500 meters to 15 kilometers and life forms are supported where volcanic processes bring heat and minerals to the <b>seabed</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Poss's scorpionfish, Scorpaenopsis possi, is a scorpionfish {{from the}} Indo-Pacific. It {{occasionally}} {{makes its way}} into the aquarium trade. It grows to 19.4 cm in length. Its species is named for S. G. Poss. This species lives from 1 to 40 m deep on rock and coral <b>sea</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{burial of}} algae and {{bacteria}} below the mud of the <b>sea</b> <b>floor</b> {{during this time}} resulted {{in the formation of}} North Sea oil and natural gas, much of it trapped in overlying sandstone by deposits formed as the seas fell to form the swamps and salty lakes and lagoons that were home to dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The crew of a French {{salvage ship}} {{trying to raise}} a World War II-era {{submarine}} from the <b>sea</b> <b>floor</b> are stricken with massive radiation burns—except for one, who has been infected with a parasitic black oil discovered on the submarine. The oil is controlling the crewman's body, and after passing through several hosts, has overtaken Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), whom Mulder has been pursuing. Scully finds that the submarine {{had been involved in}} discovering the oil on the <b>sea</b> <b>floor</b> during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the oil escapes his body to board the craft. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Luis Cardinal, the man responsible for killing her sister.|$|E

5000|$|Sponge reefs require unique conditions, {{which may}} explain their global rarity. They are found only in glacier-scoured troughs of low-angle {{continental}} shelf. The seafloor is stable and consists of rock, coarse gravel, and large boulders. Hexactinellid sponges require a hard substrate, and do not anchor to muddy or sandy <b>sea</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
40|$|Falling ocean oxygen levels due {{to rising}} {{temperatures}} and influence from human {{activities such as}} agrochemical use is an increasingly widespread problem. Considering that the <b>sea</b> <b>floors</b> have taken more than 1, 000 years to recover from past eras of low oxygen, {{according to a recent}} University of California study, this is a serious problem...|$|R
50|$|A {{consistent}} {{theme of}} the organization was the threat of deep-sea bottom trawling fisheries to coral habitats and other sensitive <b>sea</b> <b>floors.</b> In 2007 MCBI led a joint statement at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting calling for the abolition of subsidies that permit deep-sea trawling, which built on the previous scientists' statement.|$|R
5|$|Walruses prefer shallow shelf {{regions and}} forage {{primarily}} on the <b>sea</b> <b>floor,</b> often from sea ice platforms. They are not particularly deep divers compared to other pinnipeds; their deepest recorded dives are around 80m (260ft). They can remain submerged {{for as long as}} half an hour.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated {{in the bow}} and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in about half an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the <b>sea</b> <b>floor,</b> the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the <b>sea</b> <b>floor</b> mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E
50|$|The planehead {{filefish}} {{is found}} in the Atlantic Ocean at depths of up to 300 m. Its range extends from Nova Scotia to Uruguay in the west and from the Canary Islands to Angola in the east. It is found near the seabed on reefs and over sandy and muddy <b>sea</b> <b>floors.</b> It is often found among Sargassum seaweed.|$|R
25|$|Favored {{locations}} {{include those}} with narrow shelves (volcanic islands), steep (15-20 degrees) offshore slopes, and relatively smooth <b>sea</b> <b>floors.</b> These sites minimize {{the length of}} the intake pipe. A land-based plant could be built well inland from the shore, offering more protection from storms, or on the beach, where the pipes would be shorter. In either case, easy access for construction and operation helps lower costs.|$|R
40|$|CaCO₃ - Mohs Hardness: 3 ½ - 4. Aragonite {{occurs as}} the hard {{skeletal}} material of certain fresh-water and marine invertebrate organisms, including pelecypods (e. g. Clams, oysters, mussels), gastropods (creatures such as snails, slugs, and whelks), and some corals. The accumulated debris from these skeletal remains can be thick and extensive, usually on shallow <b>sea</b> <b>floors,</b> and with time may transform into limestone. [URL]...|$|R
5|$|During daytime, the {{angelshark}} usually lies motionless on the <b>sea</b> <b>floor,</b> {{buried under}} {{a layer of}} sediment with only its eyes showing. At night, it becomes more active, and may sometimes be seen swimming above the bottom. Aggregations numbering up to a hundred have been observed off Gran Canaria in the summer. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Grillotia smaris-gora, G. angeli, and Christianella minuta, the fluke Pseudocotyle squatinae, the monogenean Leptocotyle minor, and the isopod Aega rosacea.|$|E
5|$|Four {{hundred million}} years ago, California lay {{at the bottom of}} a large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the <b>sea</b> <b>floor.</b> By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came to the surface of the Sierra Nevada, and eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 the CIA's Project Azorian, through billionaire Howard Hughes, {{commissioned}} the ship Hughes Glomar Explorer with {{the cover story}} of harvesting manganese nodules from the <b>sea</b> <b>floor.</b> That triggered a rush of activity to collect manganese nodules, which was not actually practical. The real mission of Hughes Glomar Explorer was to raise a sunken Soviet submarine, the K-129, {{with the goal of}} retrieving Soviet code books.|$|E
50|$|In 1992 {{researchers}} {{first used}} the term large igneous province to describe very large accumulations—areas greater than 100,000 square kilometers (approximately the area of Iceland)—of mafic igneous rocks that were erupted or emplaced at depth within an extremely short geological time interval: a few million years or less. Mafic, basalt <b>sea</b> <b>floors</b> and other geological products of 'normal' plate tectonics {{were not included in}} the definition.|$|R
2500|$|Flatfish are superbly adapted groundfish, {{found on}} muddy and sandy <b>sea</b> <b>floors.</b> In many species both eyes lie {{on one side}} of the head, one or the other {{migrating}} through and around the head during development. Some species face their [...] "left" [...] side upward, some face their [...] "right" [...] side upward, and others face either side upward. Some flatfish can camouflage themselves on the ocean floor.|$|R
40|$|Demersal fishes {{are those}} fishes which live and feed {{on or near}} the bottom (the {{demersal}} zone) of seas. They occupy the <b>sea</b> <b>floors,</b> which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or rocks. In coastal waters they are found {{on or near the}} continental shelf, and in deep waters they are found on or near the continental slope or along the continental rise. In India, demersal finfishes contribute about 26...|$|R
5|$|In 2000, {{the wreck}} was located by Danish divers. The British marine {{archeologist}} Innes McCartney led a subsequent dive and {{confirmed that the}} wreck sits upright on the <b>sea</b> <b>floor</b> and is largely intact. Skeletal remains from the ship's crew are scattered around the sunken cruiser. The wreck was positively identified when McCartney's team recovered the ship's bell in 2001, which they donated to the Laboe Naval Memorial near Kiel, where the bell is currently on display.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{researchers}} {{note that}} mammals and birds {{get the most}} attention but smaller creatures {{at the base of}} the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil. Life on the <b>sea</b> <b>floor</b> and near the shore such as mussels, barnacles, and other shellfish are unable to move out of the way. When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E
5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity {{that was in}} the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the <b>sea</b> <b>floor.</b> These lava flows began to rise up out of the ancient ocean to form the Superior craton; the Superior craton later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part of the North American craton. The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the nucleus of the North American craton.|$|E
50|$|Monoplacophorans are univalved (though not gastropodal), limpet-shaped, and are untorted. They have a pseudometamerism of bilaterally {{symmetrical}} repeated {{organs and}} muscles. The extant {{members of the}} class live only in the deep ocean (the abyssal zone, the continental shelf, and the continental slope) at depths below 180 m. Cambrian forms predominately lived in shallow seas, whereas later Paleozoic forms are more commonly found in deeper waters with soft, muddy <b>sea</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
