5|$|Racial {{tensions}} increased {{after the}} United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education to end segregation in public education, which it ruled as unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling {{would lead to}} interracial dating and marriage. Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, {{which they had been}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century.

5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet clover, {{and that this was}} functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was {{due to a lack of}} functioning prothrombin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century, Copenhagen {{has seen}} strong urban and {{cultural}} development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure.

Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malmö, forming the Øresund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions.|$|E

5|$|Since 2009, the {{intensity}} of the rivalry has waned as the duo's domination of the domestic game has decreased. This is partly due to the resurgence of North Belfast derby clubs, Cliftonville and Crusaders. In 2013, Cliftonville became the first club other than Linfield or Glentoran to lift the league title since Portadown did so in 2002. In 2014, Cliftonville went on to retain the title {{for the first time in}} the club's history, with Crusaders then winning the 2014–15 title in convincing fashion, finishing 10 points ahead of runners-up Linfield. During this time, Glentoran lifted the Irish Cup in 2013 and again in 2015, but their overall fortunes on the field have taken a relative downturn. The club has won only three league titles <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century; in 2002–03, 2004–05 and 2008–09.

5|$|The Preservation Society {{celebrated its}} 50th anniversary in 2001, {{and as part}} of the year of {{celebrations}} a major new project was launched to once more extend and improve facilities at Tywyn Wharf station. For many years the station had been home to semi-permanent buildings housing the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum, but the new plans for the station included {{the construction of a new}} two-storey building to house the museum and the extension of the existing station building to house a new cafe and booking office. Work began on the first phase of the project in January 2002. In 2003 the railway received a £682,500 Heritage Lottery grant towards the £1,170,000 cost of redeveloping Wharf station, and the new station and museum were officially opened by Prince Charles and The Duchess of Cornwall on 13 July 2005.
