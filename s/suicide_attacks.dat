Ben Kaplan is in his first undercover operation disguised as a recent convert to Islam and {{becomes part of the}} cell. As part of his cover, Ben shares a flat with Jawad (Tariq Jordan), another member. However, {{over the course of the}} operation Ben becomes close to Jawad, which Ben's handler Lucas advises against, as Jawad is not an innocent.|$|E

5|$|In late 2008, US forces began {{accelerating}} their {{move out}} of cities across Iraq, turning over the task of maintaining security to Iraqi forces. The Marines pulled out of both Fallujah and Haditha Dam in November and December. Lance Corporal Brandon Lara from 3rd Battalion 4th Marines was the last American service member killed in Anbar, on 19 July 2009. In early August, a unit of Marines operating in Anbar located and recovered the body of Navy Captain Scott Speicher, who had been missing in action since the 1991 Gulf War. By 6 October 2009, the last two Marine Regiments had left, ending the American combat presence. Experts and many Iraqis were worried that AQI might resurface and attempt mass-casualty attacks to destabilize the country. There was a spike {{in the number of}} <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks,</b> and AQI rebounded in strength through November 2009 and appeared to be launching a concerted effort to cripple the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} {{focuses on}} the invasion and land battles of Iwo Jima. The player commands the United States Marine Corps against the Imperial Japanese Army, who are occupying the islands {{as part of the}} Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II. The game is menu-based and only allows the player to use four command functions; move, attack, land and pass. Depending on the difficulty set, the game lasts 32 to 36 turns and can only be won by eliminating all Japanese forces from the island before the final turn ends. During the game, the enemy may fortify their positions, launch air strikes against the United States Navy fleet or may perform <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> if their unit is about to be wiped out. The player also has the ability to order air strikes against the enemy, if weather permits.|$|E
5|$|During July 1945 the U.S Third Fleet, {{which was}} led by Admiral William Halsey, {{conducted}} a series of air raids and naval bombardments against targets in Japan. These attacks were made by the Third Fleet's striking force, Task Force38 (TF38), which was commanded by Vice Admiral John S. McCain and included nine fleet carriers, six light carriers and their escorts. Almost one thousand aircraft were embarked on board these carriers. On 10July TF38's aircraft struck airfields around Tokyo and claimed to have destroyed 340 Japanese aircraft on the ground and two in the air. No Japanese aircraft responded to this attack as they were being held in reserve to mount large-scale <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> on the Allied fleet during the expected invasion of the country later in 1945. Following this raid, the Third Fleet conducted raids on Hokkaido and northern Honshu on 14 and 15July which sank large numbers of ships and destroyed 25 aircraft on the ground. The American warships then sailed south and on 16July were joined by the British Pacific Fleet's (BPF's) main striking force, which was designated Task Force37 (TF37), and comprised three aircraft carriers and their escorts.|$|E

40|$|<b>Suicide</b> <b>attack,</b> {{though not}} a new phenomenon, is the most virulent and horrifying form of {{terrorism}} that endangers {{the safety of the}} world today. It is the most dangerous modus operandi of modern terrorism which is a new development in the long history of martyrdom. <b>Suicide</b> <b>attack</b> has overturned the traditional concepts of terrorist <b>attacks.</b> When a <b>suicide</b> <b>attack</b> occurs in any country, {{it seems to be a}} slap not only to the state structure of that particular country, but also to humanity and civilization of the world community at large. A conclusion can also be drawn that after a successful <b>suicide</b> <b>attack</b> a <b>suicide</b> bomber not only obliterates the lives of many people, but also insults the value of his own life and ultimately degrades his own position as a human being. 99 page(s...|$|R
