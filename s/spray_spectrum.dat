40|$|Maximum {{retention}} of spray and run-off volumes on citrus leaves were studied {{in a laboratory}} experiment and then compared with a field trial. In the field trial an air-assisted sprayer fitted with a tower air conveyor was used to apply between 1000 and 8000 l ha- 1, atomised as a uniform <b>spray</b> <b>spectrum,</b> at different forward speeds. The volume of spray retained by leaves increased with increasing application volumes but the percent retention decreased above an application volume of 2000 l ha- 1. The proportion of spray lost as canopy run-off also increased above 2000 l ha- 1. Spray deposition was highest on leaves in the bottom tree zone, decreased in the top tree zone and was lowest in the middle tree zone. This deposition pattern is probably caused by the airflow pattern generated by the sprayer and indicates that uneven distribution of airflow to the tree is related to uneven leaf coverage throughout the canopy. A tractor speed of 3. 6 km h- 1 did not reduce leaf {{retention of}} spray volume compared with the slower speed (1. 7 km h- 1) but reduced canopy run-off at the 4000 l ha- 1 application volume. Canopy spray run-off was highest along the tree axis parallel to sprayer travel and lowest along the tree axis perpendicular to sprayer travel. The application of pesticides to citrus at volumes that do not exceed 2000 l ha- 1 reduces the loss of pesticide as canopy spray run-off and maximises pesticide spray recovery on the citrus leaf canopy...|$|E

40|$|Pesticide drift and the {{inherent}} {{risks associated with}} the application of pesticides in agriculture have been attracting the attention from the public sector {{as well as the}} scientific community. In an effort to reduce pesticide drift, efforts have been made to implement drift reduction technologies (DRTs). These technologies aim to mitigate off-target spray deposition through methods such as reducing the proportion of small droplets in sprays (e. g. improved nozzle or tank mix designs), shielding the spray from wind displacement (e. g. through the placement of hoods, shrouds, shields or cones over the nozzles), or improving the spray trajectory towards the target. However, spray drift is a complex research topic that includes environmental and equipment variables, and many application parameters that make it difficult to test all possible interactions. The full effect of DRTs on the biological efficacy of herbicides is not well understood and much of the research into DRTs is at relatively early stages, particularly for application systems common in the US. ^ The objectives of this research were: 1) evaluate and further expand a database of droplet size and <b>spray</b> <b>spectra</b> data using herbicides and adjuvants commonly used in ground applications in Nebraska, 2) conduct greenhouse and field studies to evaluate the impact of factors that influence droplet size on the biological efficacy of herbicides, and 3) evaluate the effect of DRTs as they relate to canopy penetration, retention, and how that correlates with weed control efficacy. ^ This research has refined and expanded the current understanding of how changes in herbicide <b>spray</b> droplet size <b>spectra</b> impact biological efficacy in the field. This research has also expanded the understanding of how application parameters such as nozzle type, spray pressure, and tank mixture interact and influence the efficacy of the herbicide being applied. The results will be disseminated to herbicide applicators through a variety of means to aid in the decision making process of what is a complex system. ...|$|R

There are several different technologies that are used by researchers to measure droplet size from spray nozzles. The objective of these studies was to determine the influence of eight spray adjuvants on the droplet size spectrum produced by two nozzles in a high-speed wind tunnel when characterized using three different droplet size measurement systems. The adjuvant, nozzles, and airspeeds used in these studies are commonly used by aerial applicators. Three droplet sizing systems (Malvern laser diffraction, PMS optical array probe, and LaVision laser imaging) were simultaneously operated to measure the <b>spray</b> droplet size <b>spectra</b> for each adjuvant, air-speed, and nozzle combination. Two spray nozzles (a D 6 - 46 nozzle and a D 2 straight stream nozzle) were evaluated in a high-speed wind tunnel at airspeeds of 45 and 58 m/sec. There were significant differences in the droplet size spectra produced by the eight spray adjuvants tested. There were also significant differences between the droplet size values reported by the three measurement systems (Malvern, LaVision, and PMS) evaluated; however, there was considerable agreement trendwise.

Chemical {{control is}} a viable and {{practically}} indispensable tool in the control and management of cultivated plant pests, but insufficient detail in documenting {{the methods used for}} applying phytosanitary products has been reported in the majority of scientific publications dealing with insecticide application. A survey of 200 scientific studies was conducted to examine how much basic information was provided on the application method. The amount of descriptive detail concerning the insecticide application method was found to be below the minimum requirements. In particular, there was insufficient detail concerning the <b>spray</b> droplet <b>spectrum</b> (no information in 173 studies evaluated - 86. 5 %), operating pressure (38 studies - 19 %), solution concentration (52 studies - 26 %), distance and position of spray nozzles in relation to the target (114 studies - 57 %), temperature (128 studies - 64 %), relative humidity (134 studies - 67 %) and wind speed (145 studies - 72. 5 %).

40|$|Dry {{deposition}} of atmospheric particles mainly depends on wind speed and particle diameter. The dry deposition velocity, Vd, {{is found to}} vary {{by a factor of}} 100 - 1, 000 with diameter in a likely diameter range, adding uncertainty to deposition estimates, because the diameter distribution for many particulate species is not well known. Experimental studies of vd over both water and solid surfaces largely confirm the above cited huge variations with diameter. However, a number of studies over natural waters report both much less diameter variation and overall larger deposition velocities. The consensus has developed that if those latter estimates are correct, {{it is likely to be}} associated with the spray and bubble activities characterizing natural water surfaces for moderate to high winds. The influence of these phenomenons on dry deposition is fairly easily modelled. However, it has proven difficult to verify the models due to the difficulties of measuring the relatively small deposition rates under spray condition over the natural waters. Here are presented data on this subject obtained in a wind/water tunnel, where the bubble and spray process were modelled by use of 2, 600 submerged aquarium frits. We summarize the experimental set up. Earlier experiments showed that the tunnel spray and bubble process described the natural processes satisfactorily, in the sense that the bubble and <b>spray</b> production <b>spectra</b> could be related to the white cap cover in a way similar to the expressions over the ocean. The results of the experiments reported here are that the bubbling and spray processes have no significant influence on the deposition rate of the particles.

Dates are widely {{considered}} to be a strategic source of food security as well as an important cash crop, and have always been looked upon as a key source of stability for oasis agro-ecosystems. Several insect and mite pests and plant pathogens attack Date Palm trees. The Dubas bug, Ommatissus lybicus DeBergevin (Homoptera: Tropiduchidae), has been considered the key pest of Date Palm plantations in Oman for 40 years due to the total area infested, the severity of infestations and the scale of the crop losses. Current control programmes for Dubas bug are reliant on chemical pesticides, applied by air and from the ground over an area ranging from 12, 000 – 20, 000 ha annually. These pesticides are currently the only feasible control measure against this pest, although research is underway on bio-control technologies. The cropping environment resulting from traditional Date Palm cultivation - high planting density, high temperature and humidity, topography of the plantations, intercropping and variability in cultivars and plant height - has an influence on pest and disease incidence and also affects the control options available.

The study reported here sought to investigate the commercial suitability of a new compound, Regent ®, for the control of Lygus. This novel mode of action represents one of the few potential new tools under development for Lygus management. Under a federal Emergency Use Permit (EUP), Regent was tested against two standards of Lygus control (Orthene ® and Vydate ®) and an untreated check. In a test of unusually high Lygus densities, Regent provided excellent control of small (instars 1 – 3) and large (instars 4 – 5) Lygus nymphs and may provide marginally better control of adults than current standards. None of the tested agents provided quick control or knockdown of adults. Rather, adult levels were reduced over time, most likely as a result of prevention of the development of new adults via nymphal control.

Okra pods are used as vegetables and as traditional medicines. Sequential extraction showed that the Hot Buffer Soluble Solids (HBSS) extract of okra consists of highly branched rhamnogalacturonan (RG) I containing high levels of acetyl groups and short galactose side chains. In contrast, the CHelating agent Soluble Solids (CHSS) extract contained pectin with less RG I regions and slightly longer galactose side chains. Both pectic populations were incubated with homogeneous and well characterized rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase (RGH), endo-polygalacturonase (PG), and endo-galactanase (endo-Gal), monitoring both high and low molecular weight fragments. RGH is able to degrade saponified HBSS and, to some extent, also non-saponified HBSS, while PG and endo-Gal are hardly able to degrade either HBSS or saponified HBSS. In contrast, PG is successful in degrading CHSS, while RGH and endo-Gal are hardly able to degrade the CHSS structure. These results point to a much higher homogalacturonan (HG) ratio for CHSS when compared to HBSS. In addition, the CHSS contained slightly longer galactan side chains within its RG I region than HBSS.
