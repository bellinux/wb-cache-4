500|$|The opening {{segment of}} the episode, which was leaked onto the {{internet}} weeks before the episode aired, features Homer voting for Barack Obama. Rather than taking sides in the election, executive producer Al Jean says it is [...] "mostly a comment on what many people to {{believe to be the}} irregularities in our voting system." [...] "Untitled Robot Parody" [...] is modeled on the live action Transformers film, rather than the cartoon. Al Jean said it was [...] "just really fun to do transformations [...] you can <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> enjoyed doing that film." [...] "How to Get Ahead in Dead-Vertising" [...] featured a parody of the title sequence of Mad Men. Jean was a fan of the series and pitched the scene.|$|E
500|$|Janssen {{said the}} film is [...] "definitely played {{with a bit of}} a wink and doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Wirkola himself {{described}} it as [...] "a little more grounded" [...] and action-centered than Dead Snow. He recalled that he has tried to downplay comedy elements: [...] "If you go too far, it can turn into a spoof almost...We shot a lot more than what is in the movie of course and it’s just balancing it when you’re cutting." [...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how they do things here with testing and the studio." [...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> do it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E

2500|$|To {{the chagrin}} of long-time fans, the band waited until 2010 to perform live, despite having been {{together}} (as Shadow Gallery) since the early 1990s. When asked the question in one interview, Wehrkamp explained that [...] "We have always been more a studio band than a performing band unfortunately, and while we rehearsed for a tour just before Tyranny was started, a few obstacles blocked our touring options, and we were locked back in the studio to make another record. I know {{there are many people}} who cannot understand why we haven't played in support of this record, and I can <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> feel that way, but honestly, it's very difficult." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Americans {{inhabited}} {{neighborhoods of}} Port-au-Prince in houses {{that the majority}} of Haitians could only dream of. This neighborhood was called the “millionaires' row.” Hans Schmidt recounted a navy officer's opinion on the matter of segregation: “I can't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't have a better time with their crowd, just as I do with mine." [...] American racial intolerance provoked indignation and resentment – and eventually a racial pride that was reflected in the work {{of a new generation of}} Haitian historians, ethnologists, writers, artists, and others. Many of these later became active in politics and government. The elite Haitians, who were mostly mixed race with higher levels of education and capital, continued to dominate the country's bureaucracy and to strengthen its role in national affairs.|$|E

These people were extraordinary. You can <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> frightened the old guard, because they saw no boundaries. They {{wanted to build a}} palace, they built a palace. They wanted to buy a yacht, they bought a yacht. And the old guard in New York weren’t like that at all, and suddenly this whirlwind of couture descended on their heads. They redesigned being rich. They created a rich culture that we still have — people who are rich are rich {{in a way that was}} established in America in the 1880s, ’90s, 1900s. It was different from Europe. Something like Newport would never have happened in any other country, where you have huge palaces, and then about 20 yards away, another huge palace, and 20 yards beyond that another huge palace. In England right up to the 1930s, when people made good money, they would buy an estate of 5,000 acres and they’d have to look after Nanny. The Americans of the 1880s and ’90s didn’t want too much of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hatton {{agreed to}} terms on 27 July for an 8 December 2007 welterweight fight with Floyd Mayweather Jr. which was {{considered}} to be the biggest welterweight fight since the 1999 clash between Oscar De La Hoya and Puerto Rican legend Tito Trinidad. The MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue on 17 August 2007. The fight was agreed to less than three months after Mayweather had said he planned to retire following a victory over Oscar De La Hoya. Hatton was able to bring the fight to Mayweather in the early rounds. In the 1st round, Hatton caught Mayweather with a left jab which knocked Mayweather off balance. His constant pressure appeared to make Mayweather uncomfortable at first. In the third round, Mayweather landed a right that cut Hatton above the right eye. In round six, referee Joe Cortez took a point away from Hatton after he appeared to hit Mayweather {{on the back of the}} head while Mayweather was rested between the ropes. However, the punch was revealed to have hit the rope rather than Mayweather's head, but Hatton was warned for punching behind the head on numerous occasions before the deduction. Hatton became angry at the referee's decision to deduct a point and turned his back on him. Hatton later claimed he was angered by the referee, which caused him to lose his calm and contributed to his downfall. Hatton was able to hold his own until round eight, when Mayweather began to adapt to Hatton and started counterattacking. Mayweather knocked Hatton down to the mat in round ten. Hatton got up, but Mayweather quickly resumed his attack, resulting in Joe Cortez putting a stop to the fight and Hatton's corner threw in the towel. Mayweather commented post-match that [...] "Ricky Hatton is one tough fighter. He is still a champion in my eyes and I'd love to see him fight again... Ricky Hatton is probably one of toughest competitors I've faced. I hit him with some big ones but he kept coming and I can <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> call him the 'Hitman'." [...] The fight received large amounts of publicity, with both fighters promoting the fight heavily.|$|E
