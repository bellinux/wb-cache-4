5|$|In 1958 Poulenc {{embarked}} on a collaboration with his old friend Cocteau, in an operatic version of the latter's 1930 monodrama La Voix humaine. The work was produced in February 1959 at the Opéra-Comique, under Cocteau's direction, with Duval as the tragic deserted woman <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> former lover by telephone. In May Poulenc's 60th birthday was marked, a few months late, by his last concert with Bernac before the latter's retirement from public performance.|$|E

They {{also said that}} they hoped that she would leave pornography, saying that her image did not honor her family or her home country.|$|E
5|$|The Bambers were financially secure. There was the farmhouse, {{property}} in London, 300 {{acres of land}} and a caravan site. Their company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth ₤400,000 (c.£1,057,000). In her will June left ₤230,000 (c.£608,000 in 2016), and Nevill left ₤380,000 (c.£1,004,000); Bamber was a major beneficiary of both wills. The couple gave the children a good home and private education, but June was intensely religious and tried to force her children and grandchildren to adopt the same ideas. She had a poor relationship with Sheila, who felt June disapproved of her, and June's relationship with Jeremy was so troubled that he had apparently stopped <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Sheila's ex-husband {{was concerned about the}} effect June was having on his sons. She made them kneel and pray with her, which upset him and the boys.|$|E

25|$|In a February 2011 radio interview, Ford {{acknowledged}} {{that she and}} Gillette were divorcing. The family were in negotiations for a reality TV show, tentatively titled The Gillettes: An Extreme American Family on TLC. The couple's impending divorce ended any plans for the television show. In a March 2011, interview on the Classic Rock Revisited website, Ford claimed that she had taken a business trip to Los Angeles to discuss the reality show with TLC executives, and returned home to find her husband and sons not <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
25|$|Puyi's {{second choice}} {{for his wife}} was Wanrong, a Daur. She married Puyi in 1922 and became his Empress. Her father, Rong Yuan (榮源), was a Minister of Domestic Affairs. She was {{considered}} beautiful and came from a wealthy family. By Puyi's own account, he abandoned Wanrong in the bridal chamber {{and went back to}} his own room. He maintained that she was willing to be a wife in name only, in order to carry the title of Empress. The couple's relationship was good initially, and Puyi showed preference over Wenxiu for Wanrong and displayed trust in her. However, after Wenxiu left in 1931, Puyi blamed Wanrong and stopped <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and ignored her presence. She became addicted to opium, and eventually died in a prison in Yanji, Jilin after being arrested by Chinese Communist soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Yasuna's unique affliction to {{be unable}} to see males is changed from the manga to the anime. While in the manga Yasuna says she has never once {{been able to see}} males {{completely}} clearly (Hazumu being the only slight exception), Yasuna explains in the anime that she at one time was able to see males, but one day she could not see her father anymore after he got angry with her as a child, and it escalated from there to encompass all males. Additionally, in the eleventh anime episode, Yasuna becomes unable to see females as well, though this is later rectified in episode twelve when Yasuna is completely healed and is able to see both males and females. In the anime, Yasuna is shown to be terrified of males, even those in her own class, but in the manga she merely pays very little attention to males around her, even when spoken to directly, or otherwise ignores males completely. In the anime, Yasuna is shown at one time accidentally ignoring her father at the dinner table, but the only time Yasuna is shown <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father in the manga has her smiling to him.|$|E

500|$|In 1912 Barrett was {{selected}} by Kenney to help run the WPSU national campaign, following the raid by police on Clement's Inn and Christabel Pankhurst's subsequent flight to Paris. Barrett moved back to London {{and within a few}} months she was given the role of assistant editor of the WSPU newspaper, The Suffragette, on its launch in October 1912. Writing in her autobiography Barrett described becoming an editor as [...] "an appalling task as I knew nothing whatever of journalism". By taking on the job she also took on the risks connected with the increasingly militant WSPU. She travelled under cover to Paris to meet with Christabel Pankhurst, and when <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> on the phone she recalled how she [...] "could always hear the click of Scotland Yard listening in." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the true}} {{identity}} of Archie's killer is kept a secret between Max and Stacey for several months, Max's daughter Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) becomes suspicious in November 2010 when Max tells her Bradley was innocent. Lauren suspects Max killed Archie as she becomes paranoid about his anger. Jossa {{said in an}} interview with website Digital Spy: [...] "'s thinking about Archie's murder and realising that if Bradley didn't do it, it must have been someone else. As far as she knows, her dad is the only person who knows that Bradley didn't do it, so she's trying to put this puzzle together and it's all adding up to Max being the killer, because everything he does seems to lead to a lot of aggression." [...] However, Lauren soon works out that Stacey is the murderer after <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Jossa said she was excited that her character was one of only a select few to know the true identity of Archie's killer.|$|E

500|$|According to Taraborrelli, [...] "Many female artists {{behave like}} a diva for a period when they reach superstar status, and the 'Who's That Girl?' tour marked the {{beginning}} of Madonna's." [...] For instance, she would not allow crew members to talk directly to her; they had to talk to her representatives, lest they distract her from the business at hand. She also forbade her dancers from <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and her musicians were not permitted to even look at her unless they were onstage with her. Moreover, when coming on and off the stage, Madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from the eyes of [...] "those who couldn't help but stare". DeMann commented: [...] "She has a way of demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention", to which Taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was an indication of how successful and strong Madonna was. [...] "You don't {{behave like a}} bitch until you are that successful. The tour sure helped cement her star status", he commented.|$|E

Scully looks back at Boggs and sees another vision of her father, <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and singing the song that had been played at his funeral, [...] "Beyond the Sea". She does not tell Mulder about this, and the pair discuss the {{possibility}} that Boggs has orchestrated the kidnapping with a partner to avoid execution. They have a fake newspaper made which declares the couple to have been found, hoping to trick Boggs into contacting his accomplice. He does not fall for the trick, but gives the agents vague clues about the case. Scully, acting on these, first finds a warehouse where the couple had been held, and later leads Mulder and several other agents to a boathouse where the kidnapper is holding the couple. The girl is rescued, but the kidnapper shoots Mulder and escapes with the boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, it was {{announced}} that Welsh actor Michael Sheen would guest star as a love interest for series creator Tina Fey's character, Liz Lemon. He made his debut as Wesley in the previous episode, [...] "Future Husband". Actor Scott Bryce guest starred as Dave Hess, a former colleague of Jack Donaghy's. Bryce first appeared in the season three episode [...] "Flu Shot" [...] as a different character named Michael Templeton. Actress Marceline Hugot made her ninth appearance as Kathy Geiss, the daughter of GE CEO Don Geiss. In the episode, Kathy performs Ellens dritter Gesang by Schubert with a trumpet at her father's funeral. Dr. Kaplan was played by actor James Rebhorn, who first guest starred as the character in [...] "Future Husband". At the end of [...] "Don Geiss, America and Hope", where Liz is shown watching one of the [...] "porn for women" [...] channels, the man depicted as <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> was portrayed by actor John Anderson, who has guest starred previously on the show as Astronaut Mike Dexter. At the end of the credits, Anderson is credited as Astronaut Mike Dexter. Jack learns from former GE CEO Jack Welch, in the last episode, that current GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) has died. In [...] "Don Geiss, America and Hope", a funeral service is held for Geiss. Television critic Bob Sassone of TV Squad, in his recap of this episode, wondered if Torn was written out of the series due to an alcohol-related incident that occurred to Torn in January 2010.|$|E

500|$|The Initiative's {{goals are}} {{gradually}} made clearer. A recurring character {{since the second}} season is Spike (James Marsters), a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past, depending on what suits his interests. Recently wanting to kill Buffy, Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can get to her and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them, or even to fight them. Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative, {{spending more time with}} Riley, and trying to impress Dr. Walsh. At different times, Willow, Xander, and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative's true motives and there are questions about their mission that are unanswered. Buffy begins asking questions during [...] "The I in Team". After being sent after a Polgara demon, a being with a skewer in its arm, she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons. Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh—who answers to no one—then cement Dr. Walsh's decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative. After a botched attempt to kill Buffy, Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314 and <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> pet project, Adam who is laying on a table, apparently unconscious. Adam rises and impales Dr. Walsh with the skewer in his arm—the one taken off the Polgara demon. His first word is [...] "Mommy", which he says as Dr. Walsh falls to the floor, dead.|$|E
500|$|Vocally, Benson {{performs}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] using a whispered, [...] "intense" [...] {{singing voice}} {{as opposed to}} belting, although her performance has also been described as [...] "bigger-than-yourself". Spanning exactly one octave from C4 to C5, the song's limited vocal range allows Benson to effortlessly transition from her <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> singing voice, raising and lowering her volume throughout {{in a manner that}} resembles normal speech. In addition to singing using [...] "a light, speech-driven ‘mix’", the singer also incorporates [...] "quirky little comments and girly gestures". According to Screen Rant's Turner Minton, Benson's vocals [...] " [...] a rawness to the song, giving a depth of eagerness to Ariel’s voice that makes for a genuine performance", by delivering a vocal track that is a combination of passion, strength, sincerity, angst, emotion and innocence. Described as [...] "wistful pleas", Bustles Emma Lord observed that Benson sings the song using a combination of [...] "tomboyish-ness and yearning". Meanwhile, the final line of the song's reprise is sung with [...] "a bit more oomph" [...] than the original, declaring [...] "I don't know when, I don't know how/But I know something's starting right now". Musical similarities have been drawn between [...] "Part of Your World" [...] and [...] "Somewhere That's Green" [...] from Ashman and Menken's musical Little Shop of Horrors, specifically {{the way in which the}} lines [...] "part of your world" [...] and [...] "somewhere that’s green" [...] are sung. The song has also been compared to Judy Garland's song [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] due to their shared themes about [...] "wish for something new and different." [...] Meanwhile, Variety observed similarities between the ballad and some selections from the stage musical Les Misérables (1980).|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, Peter is shown playing on the gameshow Wheel of Fortune, with hosts Pat Sajak and Vanna White also appearing. When Mayor West is playing as a {{contestant}} on Jeopardy!, he spells {{the name of the}} host, Alex Trebek, backwards (Kebert Xela), sending him back to the fifth dimension; this is a reference to when DC Comics supervillain and nemesis to Superman, Mister Mxyzptlk, is sent to the fifth dimension when someone makes him say his own name backwards. A Family Guy fan later did this in a real life episode of Jeopardy! When Peter and the children are flying through space and singing, this is a [...] reference to The Great Space Coaster. The two Asian men who meet Peter at the traffic lights when riding Joan's back speak in a very similar tone to Howard Cosell, a reference to the 1985 cult film Better Off Dead. When Quagmire fantasizes about being alone in the forest with Joan and <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in Elvish, this is a reference to a scene from The Lord of the Rings; Quagmire goes on to imagine himself with Joan dancing dressed as the title characters from Beauty and the Beast, eating a plate of spaghetti similar to that shown in Lady and the Tramp, and flying on a magic carpet dressed as Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. They also fly through Baghdad which is in ruins from the US/British invasion. Adam West's response to seeing the Statue of Liberty is taken from the original Planet of the Apes. Also, there is a scene where Brian watches Malcolm in the Middle. In the scene, Lois nags the boys so much that she will go on strike, so Hal ends up killing her with a refrigerator door and walks away blissfully with the boys. Twice during the episode Quagmire engraves his name with his nose much like Woody Woodpecker. In the end, he engraves [...] "giggity giggity goo" [...] in the same fashion.|$|E
