The Spraberry Trend area has produced oil since 1949 with a history of low productivity and unresponsive waterflooding within areas of interest in the field. It has been shown over the years that the conventional line drive waterflooding approach is highly ineffective in this field and {{there is a need to}} develop unique ways in which the reservoir can be waterflooded and produced. The reservoir model used for this study was developed in two distinct steps to speed up the development and ascertain the accuracy of the model. The preliminary model introduced only a single <b>water</b> <b>injector</b> while the final model included all the injectors around the area of interest. In developing the model, we found that the conventional simulation grid orientation which is normally employed in dynamic model building could not be applied to the Spraberry. Rather, fracture enhancements were introduced into the model to represent and model the complex fracture network. This proved valuable in validating the final reservoir model which was used for the various studies in this research. This thesis examined the influence of the distance and orientation of producers to <b>injectors,</b> <b>water</b> injection rate, fracture spacing and reservoir wettability in the effectiveness of waterflooding in the Spraberry with the hope that the distance and orientation of producers to injectors as well as the water injection rate can be optimized and implemented in the field. Furthermore it is hoped that this research will throw more light on how fracture spacing and matrix wettability affect the response of producers to <b>water</b> <b>injectors.</b> Reservoir simulation work contained in this thesis was performed on an 800 acre area of the O'Daniel pilot. Some of the results obtained validated earlier studies while other results provided new insights into the behavior of waterflooding in this reservoir. By systematically using the developed simulation model to confirm the production pattern observed in the field, the results obtained show that attention has to be paid to the orientation of the production wells relative to the <b>water</b> <b>injectors</b> and the dominant fractures. The effects of the fracture orientation and fracture spacing at various distances from the <b>water</b> <b>injector</b> were also investigated and it was concluded that if the producer is close to the <b>water</b> <b>injector,</b> the fracture orientation will dominate fluid movement while the farther the injector and producers are placed apart, the greater the influence of the fracture spacing on the fluid movement. Investigating the wettability, we found that with a high water matrix wettability, it was possible to optimize the injection rate. At low wettability however, we found that it is not possible to optimize the injection rate since the water injection rate has a somewhat inverse relationship with oil production. Finally, the result obtained by this research shows that fracture spacing of 10 ft could be considered as the critical spacing, above which there is an insignificant effect of fracture spacing on the performance of the waterflooding in the Spraberry...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThis thesis aims to give {{a general}} insight into sand control and various sorts of sand control {{measures}} and applications of sand control tools. Special focus {{will be given to}} expandable sand screens – a technology which came about in the late 1990 ’s through the use of flexible, expandable tubulars as base pipe in sand screens. More specifically Darcy’s Hydraulic Endurance Screens, a compliant sand screen system using hydraulic activation, and the future use of these will be discussed. This technology has been successfully deployed in a test rig environment(System Integration Test) 14 and was planned to be field tested for Statoil on the Statfjord field(Well B- 03) 14, an operation which eventually was delayed as the 9 5 / 8 “ casing above the reservoir could not be cemented due to heavy losses. Insight will be given into possible future use of the Hydraulic Endurance screens - specifically in <b>water</b> <b>injector</b> wells. Sand control {{is one of the key}} aspects to be considered when planning the completion of a well. Sand control tools may not always be necessary in a well - at least not from the start – and whether or not these are to be installed is one of the first things that need to be decided on. However, in poorly consolidated or unconsolidated sandstone reservoirs sand production is one of the biggest challenges for the completion and production engineers and some sort of sand control tools will almost always have to be installed at some point during the wells lifecycle. These tools or sand control methods may include, but are not limited to, slotted or pre-drilled liners, gravel packs, frac packs, selective perforations, oriented perforations or as mentioned above, different types of sand screens. All of these sand control measures and their use will be discussed. In <b>water</b> <b>injectors,</b> sand production poses certain specific challenges. These challenges usually arise not during the actual water injection, but when for various reasons the injection has to be stopped and the well is shut-in. These “water injector”-specific challenges include reservoir cross-flow between formation layers of different permeability, the “water hammer” phenomenon, well-to-well backflow, thermal fractures and gravel loss into fracture systems. If one or more of these factors come into play, sand production may be initiated and a situation where the injection well is filled with sand may be the case. It is the aim of this thesis to discuss and analyze whether or not the Darcy’s Hydraulic Endurance Screens may solve or improve on these challenges in <b>water</b> <b>injectors</b> and how they compare to the Open Hole Gravel Pack and the Stand Alone Screen, specifically with a possible use at the Johan Sverdrup field in mind. A theoretical case of a field installation of Darcy’s Hydraulic Endurance Screens in a <b>water</b> <b>injector</b> well at the Johan Sverdrup field will be presented. It was found that Darcy’s Hydraulic Endurance Screen is a fully viable alternative to Open Hole Gravel Packs and Stand Alone Screens in <b>water</b> <b>injector</b> wells. It is particularly well suited for the Johan Sverdrup field as the innovative utilization of a solid base pipe together with a compliant screen design enables among other things injection selectivity with the possibility of future shut-off, integration of Inflow Control Devices and easier filter cake removal - factors that may be vital in the two-zone reservoir encountered at the Johan Sverdrup field. Uncertainties with the Hydraulic Endurance screens mostly relate to the lack of experience running the system...|$|R
