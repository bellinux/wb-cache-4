Much {{of the research on}} Akan has also posited the existence of a system for rounding harmony as well. In this thesis, I argue that both systems are well-attested and highly consistent. First, I demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} produce a coherent, consistent description of Akan vowel harmony. I then examine the pa tterns of harmony and demonstrate that it is easily understood when its different domains - stems, prefixes, and suffixes - are examined independently. Based on this information, it is possible to demonstrate that tongue root harmony applies universally, while rounding harmony occurs directional! y. After fully describing the harmony system, I take a preliminary look at an Optimality Theory account. I compare and contrast <b>Stem</b> <b>Control</b> and Agreement theory, as proposed by Bakovic (2003), andAligrunent theory, as modeled by Akinlabi (1997). On evaluation of the data, I demonstrate that Alignment explains a larger portion of the Akan data, but that <b>Stem</b> <b>Control</b> has some interesting implications for dealing with "irregular" forms. This thesis is organized as follows: In chapter 1, I give a general overview of work on Akan phonology and, on Akan orthography and vowels. In chapter 2, I give a systematic, organized description of the vowel harmony system based on the published literature.

40|$|Two-year-old {{branches}} on control trees (Pinus strobus L.) {{were compared}} through a season with branches on trees stem-girdled just above, or below, the branch whorl. All branches first sagged down for 20 {{days and then}} moved up for 40 days. Then, control branches reversed and moved back down while branches in both girdle treatments continued to move up. Movement reversal correlated with cessation of both elongation and diameter growth in control branches. Diameter growth continued in branches of girdled trees. Control branches continued to stiffen even after diameter growth stopped. Differences in movements due to girdling are from compression wood formed after cessation of branch elongation. Apical control stops cambial activity and compression wood formation in branches after branch elongation ceases, allowing photosynthate produced in the branch {{to move to the}} <b>stem.</b> <b>Control</b> branches bend down from increasing self-weight after cambial activity ceases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{phases of}} {{swallowing}} {{are controlled by}} central pattern-generating circuitry of the brain stem and peripheral reflexes. The oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases of swallowing are independent of each other. Although central pattern generators of the brain <b>stem</b> <b>control</b> the timing of these phases, the peripheral manifestation of these phases depends on sensory feedback through reflexes of the pharynx and esophagus. The dependence of the esophageal phase of swallowing on peripheral feedback explains its absence during failed swallows. Reflexes that initiate the pharyngeal phase of swallowing also inhibit the esophageal phase which ensures the appropriate timing of its occurrence to provide efficient bolus transport and which prevents the occurrence of multiple esophageal peristaltic events. These inhibitory reflexes are probably partly responsible for deglutitive inhibition. Three separate sets of brain stem nuclei mediate the oral, pharyngeal, and esoph-ageal phases of swallowing. The trigeminal nucleus and reticular formation probably contain the oral phase pattern-generating neural circuitry. The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) probably contains the second-order sensory neurons {{as well as the}} pattern-generating circuitry of both the pha-ryngeal and esophageal phases of swallowing, whereas the nucleus ambiguus and dorsal motor nucleus contain the motor neurons of the pharyngeal and esophageal phases of swallowing. The ventromedial nucleus of the NTS may govern the coupling of the pharyngeal phase to the esopha-geal phase of swallowing...|$|E

Experienced gardeners watch the stems for signs of frass protruding from small holes, which is an indicator of the presence of the larva inside.

Others use a stiff wire, a needle, or a toothpick to kill the borer without seriously injuring the vine.|$|R
40|$|When {{the spinal}} cord is injured at or below {{thoracic}} level 5 (T 5), cardiovascular control is markedly unbalanced as the heart and blood vessels innervated by upper thoracic segments remain under brain <b>stem</b> <b>control,</b> whereas the vasculature of the lower body is affected by unregulated spinal reflexes. Importantly, the regulation of heart rate and cardiac function is abnormal after spinal cord injury (SCI) at T 5 because sympathetic outflow to the heart is increased. An increase in tonic sympathetic outflow may be attributable to multiple mechanisms, such as increases in cardiac sympathetic innervation density, altered morphology of stellate ganglia neurons, and/or structural neuroplasticity of cardiac sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs). Furthermore, these neuroplastic changes associated with SCI may be mediated by nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF is a neurotrophin that supports the survival and differentiation of sympathetic neurons and enhances target innervation. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that T 5 spinal cord transection (T 5 X) is {{associated with an increased}} left ventricular (LV) NGF content, LV sympathetic innervation density, and cardiac SPN arborization. In intact and paraplegic (9 wk posttransection) rats, LV NGF content (ELISA), LV sympathetic innervation density (tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry), and cardiac SPN arborization (cholera toxin B immunohistochemistry and Sholl Analysis) were determined. Paraplegia, compared with intact, significantly increased LV NGF content, LV sympathetic innervation density, and cardiac SPN arborization. Thus, altered autonomic behavior following SCI is associated with structural neuroplastic modifications...|$|E

40|$|Summary Complex {{regulatory}} networks regulate {{stem cell}} behavior and contributions to tissue growth, repair, and homeostasis. A full {{understanding of the}} networks <b>controlling</b> <b>stem</b> cell self-renewal and differentiation, however, {{has not yet been}} realized. To systematically dissect these networks and identify their components, we performed an unbiased, transcriptome-wide in vivo RNAi screen in female Drosophila germline stem cells (GSCs). Based on characterized cellular defects, we classified 646 identified genes into phenotypic and functional groups and unveiled a comprehensive set of networks regulating GSC maintenance, survival, and differentiation. This analysis revealed an unexpected role for ribosomal assembly factors in <b>controlling</b> <b>stem</b> cell cytokinesis. Moreover, our data show that the transition from self-renewal to differentiation relies on enhanced ribosome biogenesis accompanied by increased protein synthesis.

40|$|International audienceTranslational {{read-through}} of the UGA {{stop codon}} is an evolutionarily conserved feature that most prominently represents {{the basis of}} selenoprotein biosynthesis. It requires a specific cis-acting <b>stem</b> loop <b>control</b> element, termed SECIS, which {{is located in the}} 3;-untranslated region of eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs. In a search for novel factors underlying the SECIS-directed UGA read-through process, we identified an evolutionary conserved GTPase-activating protein, termed GAPsec. We show that the activity of the Drosophila GAPsec (dGAPsec) is necessary to support SECIS-dependent UGA read-through activity in flies and the mouse homolog mGAPsec in mice tissue culture cells. However, selenoprotein biosynthesis is not impaired in flies that lack dGAPsec activity. The results indicate that GAPsec is part of a novel SECIS-dependent translational read-through system that does not involve selenocysteine incorporation. -Hirosawa-Takamori, M., Ossipov, D., Novoselov, S.

40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{characterize}} the pontile components of the brain <b>stem</b> ventilatory <b>control</b> system in rats. This study was precipitated by reports that this pontile component might differ fundamentally from that of other species. Efferent activity of the phrenic nerve was recorded in anesthetized, vagotomized, paralyzed, and ventilated adult rats. As in other species, electrical stimulations of the rostral pons caused premature terminations and/or onsets of phrenic activity in eupnea. Electrolytic lesions of rostrolateral pons resulted in apneusis, characterized by significant prolongations of the phrenic burst. Some effective lesions were {{in the region of}} the nucleus parabrachialis medialis and the Kolliker-Fuse nucleus, the site of the pneumotaxic center. Other lesions resulting in apneusis were ventral to the pneumotaxic center. As in cats, lesions in the caudal pontile reticular formation caused the duration of the apneustic neural inspiration to return toward that of eupnea. Again, as in other species, gradual alterations from eupnea to gasping in the rat were recorded during hypoxia, which was induced by ventilation with carbon monoxide. We conclude that the brain <b>stem</b> respiratory <b>control</b> system is similarly organized in rats and other mammalian species. These results have implications for contemporary hypotheses concerning the neurogenesis of ventilatory activity. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
