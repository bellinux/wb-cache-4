However, for more densely-filled H 2 -THF and pure- H 2 systems, in which there is more than <b>single</b> <b>H</b> 2 occupation in the small cage, there is an onset of inter-cage H 2 migration events from the small cages to neighbouring cavities at around 200 K. The mean square displacements of the hydrogen molecules were fitted to a mathematical model consisting of an anomalous term and a Fickian component, and non-linear regression fitting was conducted to estimate long-time (inter-cage) diffusivities. An approximate Arrhenius temperature relationship for the diffusion coefficient was examined and a rough estimation of the hydrogen hopping energy barrier was calculated for each system...|$|E

Density functional calculations (B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p)) of the infrared spectra of all possible protonated isomers of each species showed that the observed IRMPD spectra are best fit to the isomer with the largest proton affinity and lowest relative electronic energy. Potential energy surfaces of the most stable isomers of [ACN+H](+) and [DHP+H](+) have been calculated for H and H- 2 loss. The lowest energy barriers are for loss of H- 2, with predicted energies 4. 28 and 4. 15 eV, respectively.
