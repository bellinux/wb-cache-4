25|$|Rajendra {{fire control}} radar for the Akash SAM: The Rajendra is stated to be ready. However, {{it can be}} {{expected}} that further iterative improvements will be made. The Rajendra is a high power Passive electronically scanned array radar (PESA), with the ability able to guide up to 12 Akash SAMs against aircraft flying at low to medium altitudes. The Rajendra has a detection range of 80km with 18km height coverage against small fighter sized targets {{and is able to}} track 64 targets, engaging 4 simultaneously, with up to 3 missiles per target. The Rajendra features a fully digital high <b>speed</b> <b>signal</b> processing system with adaptive moving target indicator, coherent signal processing, FFTs and variable pulse repetition frequency. The entire PESA antenna array can swivel 360 degrees on a rotating platform. This allows the radar antenna to be rapidly repositioned and even conduct all round surveillance.|$|E

50|$|Typically railroads in the Eastern United States ran <b>speed</b> <b>signaling,</b> while railroads in {{the west}} used route signaling, with some mixing of systems in the Midwest and South. This {{was due to the}} lower train density {{in the west}} {{combined}} with generally simpler track layouts. Over time, the route signaling railroads have incorporated segments of <b>speed</b> <b>signaling</b> through merger and have also adopted more speed-based aspects into their systems. Of the five major Class 1 railroads in the United States, CSX uses <b>speed</b> <b>signaling,</b> Union Pacific and BNSF use <b>speed</b> enhanced route <b>signaling</b> and Norfolk Southern uses a mix of <b>speed</b> and route <b>signaling</b> based on the original owner of the line. Commuter railroads and Amtrak all use <b>speed</b> <b>signaling</b> where they own or maintain the tracks they run on. Canadian railroads all use a strong system of <b>speed</b> <b>signaling</b> in Canada, but have some segments of route signaling on lines they have acquired in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Under <b>speed</b> <b>signalling,</b> {{the signal}} aspect informs the driver at what speed he may proceed, but not {{necessarily}} the route the train will take. <b>Speed</b> <b>signalling</b> requires a far greater range of signal aspects than route signalling, but less dependence is placed on drivers' route knowledge.|$|R
5|$|USB2.0 was {{released}} in April 2000, adding a higher maximum signaling rate of 480Mbit/s (High Speed or High Bandwidth), {{in addition to the}} USB1.x Full <b>Speed</b> <b>signaling</b> rate of 12Mbit/s.

50|$|Simple servomotors may use {{resistive}} potentiometers {{as their}} position encoder.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of CMOS, the {{precharge}} transistor could be changed to be the complement of the logic transistor type, which allows the gate's output to charge quickly {{all the way up}} to the high level of the clock line, thus improving the <b>speed,</b> <b>signal</b> swing, power consumption, and noise margin.

50|$|Currently, DIGIC is {{implemented}} as an {{application-specific integrated circuit}} (ASIC) designed to perform high <b>speed</b> <b>signal</b> processing {{as well as the}} control operations in the product in which it has been incorporated. Over its numerous generations, DIGIC has evolved from a system involving a number of discrete integrated circuits to a single chip system, many of which are based around the ARM instruction set.

5|$|These bus power {{currents}} being {{much higher}} than cables were designed for, though not unsafe, cause a larger voltage between {{the ends of the}} ground signal, significantly reducing noise margins causing problems with High <b>Speed</b> <b>signaling.</b> Battery Charging Specification 1.1 specifies that charging devices must dynamically limit bus power current draw during High Speed signaling; 1.2 simply specifies that charging devices and ports must be designed to tolerate the higher ground voltage difference in High <b>Speed</b> <b>signaling.</b>|$|R

50|$|Some of the 2005 {{and later}} Subaru vehicle Engines (especially the turbo charged engines) are using CAN bus as their sole Vehicle/Vessel speed input channel. When those ABS <b>Speed</b> <b>signal</b> are removed, the ECU will force the Engine {{to run in}} limp home mode.

50|$|From {{one to four}} {{channels}} can be implemented, each channel {{having a}} photosensor that scans one of at most two signal tracks on a slotted disk. Experience shows that the possible number of channels achievable by this technique is still not enough. A number of subsystems therefore {{have to make do}} with looped-through signals from the wheel slide protection electronics and are therefore forced to accept, for instance, the available number of pulses, although a separate <b>speed</b> <b>signal</b> might well have some advantages.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{subsystems}} in a rail vehicle, such as {{a locomotive}} or multiple unit, depend on a reliable and precise rotary <b>speed</b> <b>signal,</b> in some cases {{as a measure of}} the speed or changes in the speed. This applies in particular to traction control, but also to wheel slide protection, registration, train control, door control and so on. These tasks are performed by a number of rotary speed sensors that may be found {{in various parts of the}} vehicle.|$|E

50|$|The major {{advantage}} of encoders with built-in interpolation and digital signal transmission is improved noise immunity. However, the high frequency, fast edge <b>speed</b> <b>signals</b> may produce more emc emissions.|$|R
50|$|A rail vehicle, {{particularly}} a locomotive, possesses numerous subsystems {{that require a}} separate electrically separated <b>speed</b> <b>signal.</b> There usually are neither enough mounting places nor is there sufficient space where separate pulse generators could be installed. Multichannel pulse generators that are flange-mounted onto the bearing shells or covers of wheelsets offer a solution. Using a number of bearingless speed sensors would also involve additional cables, which should preferably be avoided for outdoor equipment {{because they are so}} susceptible to damage, for instance from flying track ballast.|$|E
50|$|In North America slide fences are {{typically}} connected {{in such a}} way as to shunt the track circuit when activated. This causes signals on either side of the slide fence to display a restricting indication, requiring trains to travel at a speed enabling them to stop within one half the range of vision. On lines formerly operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad signals connected to a slide detector have an 'SP' placard, reminding engineers to watch for slides when governed by a restrictive <b>speed</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{cruise control}} takes its <b>speed</b> <b>signal</b> from a {{rotating}} driveshaft, speedometer cable, {{wheel speed sensor}} from the engine's RPM, or from internal speed pulses produced electronically by the vehicle. Most systems do not allow {{the use of the}} cruise control below a certain speed - typically around 25 mph. The vehicle will maintain the desired speed by pulling the throttle cable with a solenoid, a vacuum driven servomechanism, or by using the electronic systems built into the vehicle (fully electronic) if it uses a 'drive-by-wire' system.|$|E

40|$|Subsynchronous {{oscillation}} (SSO) of generators {{caused by}} high voltage direct current (HVDC) {{systems can be}} solved by applying supplemental subsynchronous damping controller (SSDC). SSDC application in mitigating SSO of single-generator systems has been studied intensively. This paper focuses on SSDC application in mitigating SSO of multi-generator systems. The phase relationship of the <b>speed</b> <b>signals</b> of the generators under their common mechanical natural frequencies is a key consideration in SSDC design. The paper studies in detail the phase relationship of the <b>speed</b> <b>signals</b> of two generators in parallel under their shared mechanical natural frequency, revealing {{regardless of whether the}} two generators are identical or not, there always exists a common-mode and an anti-mode under their common natural frequency, and the phase relationship of the <b>speed</b> <b>signals</b> of the generators depends {{on the extent to which}} the anti-mode is stimulated. The paper further demonstrates that to guarantee the effectiveness of SSDC, the anti-phase mode component of its input signal should be eliminated. Based on the above analysis, the paper introduces the design process of SSDC for multi-generator systems and verifies its effectiveness through simulation in Power Systems Computer Aided Design/Electromagnetic Transients including Direct Current (PSCAD/EMTDC) ...|$|R
50|$|Polaritonics is an {{intermediate}} regime between photonics and sub-microwave electronics (see Fig. 1). In this regime, signals are carried by an admixture of electromagnetic and lattice vibrational waves known as phonon-polaritons, rather than currents or photons. Since phonon-polaritons propagate with frequencies {{in the range}} of hundreds of gigahertz to several terahertz, polaritonics bridges the gap between electronics and photonics. A compelling motivation for polaritonics is the demand for high <b>speed</b> <b>signal</b> processing and linear and nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy. Polaritonics has distinct advantages over electronics, photonics, and traditional terahertz spectroscopy in that it offers the potential for a fully integrated platform that supports terahertz wave generation, guidance, manipulation, and readout in a single patterned material.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{signaling}} aspect systems found in North America, Speed Signaling and Weak Route Signaling. Speed signaling transmits information regarding how fast the train is permitted to be going in the upcoming segment of track; weak route signaling transmits information related to the route a train will be taking through a junction, and {{it is incumbent upon}} the engineer to govern the train's speed accordingly. Weak Route Signaling is applied with the term [...] "Weak" [...] because some <b>speed</b> <b>signal</b> aspects may be used in the system and also because exact route information is not typically conveyed, only the fact of a diverging or straight route, each having a predictable range of known speeds.|$|E
