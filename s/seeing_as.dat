Thus, their respiratory system had characteristics comparable to both modern archosaur clades.|$|E
5|$|There are no dates {{available}} for post-caldera lava domes, which probably arose from magma ascending through the caldera forming conduits, <b>seeing</b> <b>as</b> these domes are found only inside the caldera.

5|$|Badmotorfinger was Soundgarden's {{first album}} with bassist Ben Shepherd, {{who joined the}} group in April 1990. Shepherd {{replaced}} previous bassist Jason Everman. The album was recorded {{in the spring of}} 1991 at Studio D in Sausalito, California, Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, Washington, and A Studios in Los Angeles, California. Soundgarden chose to work with producer Terry Date again as it had on its previous release Louder Than Love (1989). Frontman Chris Cornell said the band decided to work with Date again <b>seeing</b> <b>as</b> the band had a good relationship with him {{and did not want to}} go through the pressure of trying to find a new producer.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the video}} games, Kyo has made {{appearances}} which met disapproval by critics. Lucas M. Thomas from IGN lamented {{the fact that}} Kyo has a few appearances in the volume from the manhua The King of Fighters 2003 in comparison to Ash Crimson, who is the greater focus of the series. Den of Geek found ridiculous the comic SVC Chaos as when Kyo is killed by Akuma and Takuma Sakazaki in the first chapter, Iori in turn kills himself {{in order to go}} to the afterlife and kill Kyo there which in turn causes M. Bison to also kill himself to search Iori. Additionally, John Funk from The Escapist found Kyo's actor in the series' live-action confusing since they changed his nationality from Japanese to North American when first announced <b>seeing</b> <b>as</b> one of the weakest points from the upcoming movie. Beyond Hollywood was also confused by Kyo's portrayal in the film due to flashbacks of his childhood featuring him as Japanese whereas his adult self is American.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{publicly}} disassociated {{himself from}} the Struggle Movement. However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he may have thought, the discontent against Kỳ was by then {{too much for him}} to control even if he had wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, <b>seeing</b> <b>as</b> the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{controversial}} {{issues such as}} Turkey's close relationship with Pakistan, {{relations between the two}} countries have often been blistered at certain times, but better at others. India and Turkey's relationship alters from unsureness to collaboration when the two nations work together to combat terrorism in Central and South Asia, and the Middle East. India and Turkey are also connected by history, <b>seeing</b> <b>as</b> they have known each other since the days of the Ottoman Empire, and <b>seeing</b> <b>as</b> India was one of the countries to send aid to Turkey following its war of independence.

25|$|House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who {{has served}} in Congress since he was elected in a 1981 special {{election}} to fill the seat previously held by Gladys Spellman, did not face a Republican opponent in this election.

Hoyer beat out Green Party candidate Steve Warner and Constitution Party candidate Peter Kuhnert to win another term in Congress.|$|E

25|$|Computer games {{sometimes}} use DRM {{technologies to}} limit the number of systems the game can be installed on by requiring authentication with an online server. Most games with this restriction allow three or five installs, although some allow an installation to be 'recovered' when the game is uninstalled. This not only limits users who have more than three or five computers in their homes (<b>seeing</b> <b>as</b> the rights of the software developers allow them {{to limit the}} number of installations), but can also prove to be a problem if the user has to unexpectedly perform certain tasks like upgrading operating systems or reformatting the computer's hard drive, tasks which, depending on how the DRM is implemented, count a game's subsequent reinstall as a new installation, making the game potentially unusable after a certain period even if it is only used on a single computer.|$|E
