It leaves room for failure but hopes for success.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E
5|$|Working {{with his}} {{associate}} Theodore Musho, Pei developed a design {{centered on a}} building with a top much wider than the bottom; the facade leans at an angle of 34 degrees. A plaza <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> before the building, {{and a series of}} support columns holds it up. It was influenced by Le Corbusier's High Court building in Chandigarh, India; Pei sought to use the significant overhang to unify building and plaza. The project cost much more than initially expected, and took 11 years. Revenue was secured in part by including a subterranean parking garage. The interior of the city hall is large and spacious; windows in the ceiling above the eighth floor fill the main space with light.|$|E

This quarter <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> from the Northern shores of the harbour, and covers an area roughly bounded by Ahmed Rafiq al-Mahdawi Street to the North-west, al-Jezayir Street to the South-east and 23 July Street to the South-west. The heart of the medina is Maydan al-Hurriya (Freedom Square); to the northeast of this is the covered Souq al-Jareed.|$|E

While Farmer <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> on the raft, a storm begins to arrive : the wind picks up, the rain falls and lightning illuminates the sky. Seal, standing on the raft, is destabilized and falls into the water. Farmer tries to save him giving him her hand, but without success. The night starts to fall and Farmer, now alone on the raft, lights a match and puts off it immediately.|$|E
25|$|When Mordecai {{finds out}} about the plan, he implores Esther to try and intercede with the King; but she is afraid {{to break the law}} and present herself to the King unsummoned, as this was {{punishable}} by death. She orders Mordecai to have all Jews fast for three days together with her, and on the third day she goes to Ahasuerus, who <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> his sceptre to her to indicate that she is not to be punished. She invites him to a feast in the company of Haman. During the feast, she asks them to attend a further feast the next evening. Meanwhile, Haman is again offended by Mordecai and, at his wife's suggestion, has a gallows built to hang him.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 Sorolla {{began to}} paint {{children}} bathing. In the 1904 painting La hora del baño Sorolla linked fishing and bathing children and portrayed naked children swimming between {{a fishing boat}} and an ox standing in the water. In the foreground {{one of the children}} comes from the sea and is awaited by a young woman who <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> a white cloth to dry the wet child. Already this picture anticipates Sorolla's themes in Walk on the Beach. So the white fabric plays a central role: The movement of the cloth in the wind is already the main subject, the shore area between the water and beach has no clear contours and the whole picture is bathed in the light of early evening.|$|E

[...] for Sir Edmund Wright. To {{the west of the}} house, a large lawn <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> to what is now known as Swakeleys Lake.

500|$|The {{composer}} (and former Sibelius pupil) Leevi Madetoja further {{praised the}} score upon review, writing in Uusi Suometar in July 1914 that Sibelius, rather than [...] "repeat endlessly" [...] {{the style of}} his previous works, had yet again shown his penchant for [...] "renewing himself musically... always forward, striving for new aims". The Finnish critic Karl Wasenius (aka BIS), writing in Hufvudstadsbladet after the birthday celebration performances of 1915, wrote approvingly of Sibelius's [...] "refined mastery" [...] of technique. [...] "Not a single note is wasted on brash effects", Wasenius continued. [...] "Yet mighty things are still achieved. Sibelius gives us the expanse and magnitude of the ocean, its powerful wave-song but without boastful gestures. He is too noble for that". In Tidning för musik, Otto Anderssen interpreted Sibelius's latest compositions (among them The Oceanides) as yet another indicator that {{he was among the}} most forward-looking modernists: [...] "Sibelius is, I believe, a man of the future... constantly ahead of his time. Now he stands at the heights where the horizon <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> over fields which the rest of us cannot yet see". Cecil Gray, moreover, calls the piece [...] "daring" [...] and applauds the score's [...] "exceptional complexity and refinement", challenging critics who see Sibelius as a [...] "primitive artist".|$|E

2500|$|Visions of purgatory abounded; Bede {{mentioned}} {{a vision of}} a beautiful Heaven and a lurid Hell with adjacent temporary abodes, as did St. Boniface. In the 7th century, the Irish abbot St. Fursa described his foretaste of the afterlife, where, though protected by angels, he was pursued by demons who said, [...] "It is not fitting that he should enjoy the blessed life unscathed..., for every transgression that is not purged on earth must be avenged in heaven," [...] and on his return he was engulfed in a billowing fire that threatened to burn him, [...] "for it <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> each one according to their merits... For just as the body burns through unlawful desire, so the soul will burn, as the lawful, due penalty for every sin." ...|$|E
