At 8:35 a.m. a nuclear warhead air bursts high over the North Sea, producing an electromagnetic pulse which damages or destroys communications and most electrical systems throughout the UK and northwestern Europe. Two minutes later the first missile salvos hit NATO targets, including nearby RAF Finningley 18 mi from Sheffield. Although the city is not yet heavily damaged, the mushroom cloud from Finningley is visible and chaos reigns in the streets, with Jimmy last seen running from his stalled truck in an attempt to reach Ruth. Sheffield is soon hit by a one-megaton warhead which air bursts directly above the Tinsley Viaduct. Strategic targets, including steel and chemical factories in the Midlands, are the primary targets, with two thirds of all UK homes destroyed and immediate deaths ranging between 17 and 30 million. The resulting East-West exchange amounts to 3,000 megatons. About 210 megatons fall on the UK.|$|E
