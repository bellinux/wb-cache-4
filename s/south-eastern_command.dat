2500|$|Under {{pressure}} from the Canadian government to ensure that Canadian troops saw some action, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, commanded by Major General John Hamilton Roberts, was selected for the main force. [...] The troops were drawn from Combined Operations and <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Command,</b> under Lieutenant General Bernard Law Montgomery. The plan called for a frontal assault, without any heavy preliminary air bombardment. The absence of a sufficient bombardment {{was one of the}} main reasons for the operation's failure, and various reasons have been given to explain why one was specifically excluded. British and Canadian officials supposedly withheld the use of air and naval bombardments in an attempt to limit casualties of French civilians in the port-city core. The planners of the Dieppe Raid feared that unjustifiable civilian losses would anger and further alienate the Vichy government; an unattractive option considering the intent of Operation Torch not three months later. [...] Maj. Gen. Roberts, the military force commander, is also said to have argued that a bombardment would make the town streets impassable, and thus hinder the assault after it had broken out of the beaches. The Canadian officers planning the assault believed that the combination of speed, surprise and the sheer shock caused by having tanks come ashore with the infantry would be enough to carry the day. General C. Churchill Mann, who was regarded as the most able staff officer in the Canadian Army, wrote that the entire concept of landing tanks onto the shoreline of France [...] "is almost a fantastic conception", and that what would be gained via [...] "surprise" [...] and the [...] "terrific moral effects on the Germans and the French" [...] would be more than enough to ensure the success of Operation Rutter, as the raid was then code-named.|$|E

Troops participating in Tiger noted that it was particularly gruelling for the infantry involved, who marched over 100 miles {{during the course of}} the exercises.|$|E
50|$|The {{division}} was again serving under Western Command. In April 1942 the {{division was}} sent to defend Kent in <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Command,</b> under Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery, between 1942-1943, joining XII Corps in an anti-invasion role, serving alongside both the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division and 46th Infantry Division.

50|$|The 44th Division - {{comprising}} the 131st, 132nd, 133rd Infantry Brigades and supporting divisional troops - was serving in Kent {{as part of}} Lieutenant General James Gammell's XII Corps, part of <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Command</b> under Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, and, soon after Hughes took command, was ordered to prepare for overseas service. The division, destined for North Africa, moved to Glasgow, Scotland in late May and, after being at sea for almost two months, finally arrived in Egypt in late July and, moving some 60 miles east of Cairo, commenced training for desert warfare.|$|E
5000|$|The {{guerrilla war}} {{was not as}} intense in Prout's <b>south-eastern</b> <b>command</b> as {{elsewhere}} but his troops came in for considerable criticism for indiscipline and inefficiency. A National Army report of October 1922 stated, [...] "Prout is too weak as well as too guilless to handle traitorous or semi-mutinous incompetents". In December a number of posts under Prout's command, including Carrick on Suir, surrendered to an anti-Treaty column under Tom Barry, giving up their arms and equipment. Commandant General Eamon Price, sent to investigate the incident, backed Prout's plea for more arms and transport for his command and blamed Prout's subordinate officers for the reverse.|$|E
50|$|In 1939 Regular Troops {{reporting}} to Aldershot Command included 1st Infantry Division and 2nd Infantry Division. On {{the outbreak of}} World War II in September 1939, a similar process to August 1914 was repeated when the GOCinC Aldershot Command (Sir John Dill) became GOC I Corps in the new BEF despatched to France. Unlike the other Home Commands, Aldershot had no Coast Divisions or other defence forces under its command, and was solely responsible for providing drafts and reserve formations. In 1941 the Command was downgraded to ‘Aldershot Area’ within a new <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Command.</b> South Eastern Command ceased to exist {{at the end of}} 1944, and Aldershot was transferred to Southern Command, without its own GOC.|$|E
5000|$|McCleverty {{served in}} campaigns against the Maharajah of Coorg (1834) and in New Zealand during the Wanganui Campaign (1847). He lived in New Zealand from 1846 to 1857, and later {{returned}} to New Zealand for another period. Promoted to major-general, he became commander of Madras district in 1860, General Officer <b>Commanding</b> <b>South-Eastern</b> District in October 1866 and Commander-in-Chief of the Madras Army in November 1867 before retiring from that post in March 1871.|$|R
50|$|Love was {{commissioned}} into the 52nd Regiment of Foot in 1804 and {{took part in}} the retreat to Corunna and the Battle of Bussaco during the Peninsular War.

He was appointed British resident at Zakynthos in 1835, Lieutenant Governor of Jersey in 1852 and General Officer <b>Commanding</b> <b>South-Eastern</b> District in 1856 before becoming Inspector-General of Infantry in 1857.|$|R
50|$|Born {{the son of}} Admiral Sir George Francis Seymour, Seymour {{served in}} the Crimean War in 1854 and in the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882. He became General Officer <b>Commanding</b> <b>South-Eastern</b> District in February 1891 and Commander of the British Troops in Canada in 1898. From November 1901 to 1902, he served as acting Military Secretary {{in the absence of}} Ian Hamilton. He became Lieutenant of the Tower of London in 1902 before {{retiring}} in 1905. He was also Colonel-in-Chief of the Coldstream Guards.|$|R
5000|$|In late November 1941, after {{handing over}} the 3rd Division to Major General Eric Hayes, Gammell {{moved on to}} be GOC XII Corps with the acting rank of {{lieutenant}} general, in December (made temporary the following year), again succeeding Bernard Montgomery, who was being promoted to command the <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Command</b> and thought highly of his successor, believing Gammell to be [...] "young and virile". Gammell's BGS was Dudley Ward and, like with the 3rd Division, XII Corps was concerned with the defence of Southern England, although the threat of invasion had much receded, and the corps, with the 43rd (Wessex), 44th (Home Counties) (replaced in April by the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division) and 46th Infantry Divisions, along with several smaller units, under command, began training for offensive operations overseas, including in Exercise Tiger in May.|$|E
50|$|In February 1941, by now a major, {{he was a}} General Staff Officer Grade 2 (GSO2) at the {{headquarters}} of Major General Charles Allfrey’s 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, another first-line TA formation. The division was part of XII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Andrew Thorne, but he was replaced in April 1941 by Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, who soon noted Lloyd as a promising officer. In later life Lloyd would sometimes write nostalgically to former colleagues about the gruelling regime of physical fitness (“100% Binge” and “Binge, More Binge & Great Binge”) which Montgomery expected of all those under his command, irrespective of rank. Montgomery was promoted to command <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Command</b> at Reigate (he soon renamed it “South Eastern Army”) and on 18 December 1941 Lloyd was posted to join him. By 1942 Lloyd was a lieutenant colonel (GSO1) on the staff. He wanted to see fighting, and was disappointed not to be posted to Egypt with Montgomery when the latter took command of the Eighth Army in August 1942. Montgomery told him that temporary officers lacked the aptitude of regulars for fighting, but were often better at staff work.|$|E
50|$|In late February 1941 Allfrey {{was ordered}} to form the Devon and Cornwall County Division, {{comprising}} the recently created 203rd, 209th and 211th Infantry Brigades (all formerly independent brigades), but with no supporting troops, with himself as its General Officer Commanding (GOC). However, within a week, he relinquished command of the division to Major General Frederick Morgan and ordered to succeed Major General Robert Pollok as GOC of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, a first-line Territorial Army (TA) formation stationed {{on the other side}} of the country in Kent on anti-invasion duties. He was promoted to temporary major general on 19 July 1941. The division was serving as part of XII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Andrew Thorne (replaced in April by Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery who in turn was replaced by Lieutenant General James Gammell in December), under <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Command</b> and, like Allfrey's former command, was on anti-invasion duties and training to repel an invasion. However, with the arrival of Montgomery as the corps commander, Allfrey's 43rd Division − comprising the 128th, 129th and 130th Infantry Brigades and divisional troops − was, throughout 1941, put through highly intensive and strenuous training for offensive operations, as a result of which the division had been selected for overseas service, although this would not occur during Allfrey's reign as GOC.|$|E
50|$|He was Lieutenant-Colonel of the 48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot between 1841 and 1853. He became Assistant Secretary for Scotland in 1854 and General Officer <b>Commanding</b> <b>South-Eastern</b> District in April 1861. Promoted to {{the rank}} of general in 1873, he also {{inherited}} the titles of his nephew, Henry Arthur Hew Dalzell, becoming Earl of Carnwath that same year. Lord Carnwath died unmarried on 28 April 1875 aged 75, in London. His titles were inherited by his younger brother, Harry Burrard Dalzell.|$|R
50|$|Parke was {{commissioned}} as an ensign in the 72nd Regiment, Duke of Albany's Own Highlanders on 15 December 1840. He {{fought in the}} Crimean War and was appointed a Knight, 5th class of the Legion of Honour in August 1856. He became Brigadier-General of Field Forces in India in March 1858, Commandant, School of Military Engineering at Fleetwood in August 1861 and colonel {{on the staff of}} South-Eastern District in October 1871. He went on to be Brigadier-General at Aldershot in July 1872 and General Officer <b>Commanding</b> <b>South-Eastern</b> District in October 1874.|$|R
50|$|Educated at Twyford School, Hallam Parr was {{commissioned}} as an ensign in the 13th Regiment of Foot on 8 September 1865.

He also saw action at the Battle of Tamai in March 1884 and {{took part in the}} Nile Expedition later that year during the Mahdist War. He served as adjutant-general to Lord Grenfell, in his capacity as Sirdar of the Egyptian Army, in the late 1880s. He became Commander, Shorncliffe Garrison, in July 1898, General Officer <b>Commanding</b> <b>South-Eastern</b> District in October 1899 and General Officer Commanding North-Western District in May 1902; he retired in November 1903.|$|R
50|$|In late November 1939, {{nearly three}} months after the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Paget took over as General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 18th Infantry Division, a recently raised Territorial Army (TA) formation, relinquishing command in mid-May 1940. In the acting rank of lieutenant general he commanded British forces in the withdrawal at Åndalsnes in Norway in 1940 during the Norwegian Campaign, and was subsequently appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He was promoted to lieutenant general and made General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Command</b> in 1941. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the New Year's Honours' List {{at the end of the}} year. He went on to be GOC of GHQ Home Forces in the acting rank of general in December 1941. The rank of general was made permanent in July 1943. Paget commanded the 21st Army Group in the United Kingdom from June to December 1943 prior to General Sir Bernard Montgomery taking over. In January 1944 he became Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) Middle East Command until October 1946, when he retired from the army. In December 1944 he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta by the Polish government-in-exile. In 1946 he was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{returning}} to the United Kingdom, the 46th Division, now under Major General Desmond Anderson, was sent to Scotland where it served under Scottish Command and, due to the heavy casualties it suffered, was reformed {{with large numbers of}} conscripts, and {{most of the rest of}} 1940 was spent training to repel a German invasion and, in mid-December, the division received a new GOC, Major General Charles Hudson, a highly distinguished World War I veteran, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC). Soon afterwards, in early January 1941, the division was sent to East Anglia, where it came under command of II Corps, under Lieutenant General Edmund Osborne, itself under Eastern Command, and continued its anti-invasion duties. In late 1941 the division was sent to Kent, where it came under command of XII Corps, then commanded by Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, but soon replaced by Lieutenant General James Gammell after Montgomery was promoted to <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Command,</b> under which XII Corps was serving. Under Montgomery the division commenced very strenuous large-scale field exercises. Throughout 1941 the division went through several changes in command, with Major General Hudson being succeeded on 22 May by Major General Douglas Wimberley, who was only in command for three weeks before Major General Miles Dempsey became GOC; he in turn was succeeded on 3 November by Major General Harold Freeman-Attwood, who remained until August 1943.|$|E

5000|$|Rundle became General Officer <b>commanding</b> <b>South-Eastern</b> District in December 1898. The Second Boer War {{started in}} late 1899, however, and Rundle was in January 1900 {{appointed}} to the command of the 8th Division of the South African Field Force, with the temporary rank of lieutenant general. The appointment was described as [...] "the most remarkable instance of advancement to high military office which {{has occurred in the}} recent history of the Army" [...] by a contemporary issue of The Times. He served as commander until early March 1902, {{when he returned to the}} United Kingdom on board the SS Carisbrook Castle. He was mentioned in despatches (including by Lord Kitchener on 23 June 1902) and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) for his war-time services (dated 29 November 1900 in the gazette), invested by King Edward VII at St James's Palace on 2 June 1902.|$|R
5000|$|Newdegate was {{commissioned}} into the Rifle Brigade in 1842.

For his services in the war, he was mentioned in despatches, received a brevet promotion to major, the Crimea Medal with three clasps, the Turkish Crimean War medal, and was awarded the knighthood of the French Legion d'Honneur and the fifth class of the Order of Medjidie. In 1861 he left the Rifle Brigade, and was employed in Canada. From 1865 to 1870 he was assistant adjutant general at Aldershot, and from 1873 to 1877 he commanded first the Carlisle Regimental district, then the Rifle Depot at Winchester. In 1878 he was appointed in command of the Chatham district, but relinquished the command the following year for active service. [...] He served as General Officer Commanding the 2nd Division during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879 and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) for his service in the war.

2500|$|In early 1854, {{shortly after}} the Crimean War broke out, Campbell {{accepted}} the command of the Highland Brigade.

The Highland Brigade distinguished themselves at the Battle of Alma in September 1854 and, with his [...] "thin red line of Highlanders", Campbell repulsed the Russian attack on Balaclava in October 1854. He was promoted to the local rank of lieutenant general on 23 January 1855 and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 5 July 1855. When the Duke of Cambridge returned to England, Campbell took command of the 1st Division (Guards and Highland brigades) and commanded the Division at the Battle of the Great Redan in September 1855. Promoted to the local rank of full general on 28 December 1855 and the substantive rank of lieutenant general on 4 June 1856, he remained in the Crimea hoping to take overall command, but when General Sir William Codrington was appointed instead, he returned home in a huff. Prince Albert suggested the army in the Crimea be split into two corps d'armee, and Campbell be given one. Lord Panmure requested Queen Victoria ask Campbell return to command one of these corps, and Campbell agreed. However, {{by the time he}} had returned, the war was virtually over.
