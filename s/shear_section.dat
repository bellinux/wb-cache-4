50|$|Since the {{earliest}} {{surveys of the}} area, theories about {{the movement of the}} JF Microplate have evolved to include compression of the plate through rotational movement and also shear zones between two major plates and the JF Microplate driving this clockwise rotational movement. The Pacific Plate is estimated to have a spreading rate anywhere between 13 and 16 cm/yr in relation to the Juan Fernandez MicroPlate. This spreading ridge supplies magma {{to the west of the}} plate, acting as a lubricant. In the development stages of the microplate, the Pacific Plate also shared a coupled <b>shear</b> <b>section</b> to the south of the microplate and, together with the Nazca Plate, drove fast rotation of the microplate. Approximately 2.5 Ma ago the JF Microplate began decoupling from the Pacific Plate and coupling with the Antarctic Plate. The latter severely braked the rotational movement of the microplate. Now, the Nazca and Antarctica Plates, are the plates that share the current shear zones with transform faulting between them and the JF Plate. The Nazca Plate shears to the east while the Antarctica Plate shears relatively to the west, and this continues to drive the rotation of the microplate clockwise as well as consequential compression however at a much slower rate. Compression has been observed on the Juan Fernandez Microplate at the Pacific-Nazca-JF triple junction and the Nazca-Antarctic-JF triple junction, due to the slightly irregular shape of the plate which does not rotate perfectly about its center.|$|E

However, the shear behavior of this {{material has}} not been yet fully understood due to lack of an appropriate and accurate direct shear test method. This paper aims to investigate the shear properties of the SHCC material. For this purpose, Iosipescu shear test was selected, where loads are applied in antisymmetric four points bending, assuring a pure <b>shear</b> <b>section</b> {{at the center of the}} specimen. A special geometry for the specimen was adopted in order to assure a uniform shear stress distribution in the pure <b>shear</b> <b>section.</b> This experimental test can characterize the shear behavior of SHCC material. The experimental test was simulated by the FEM-based computer program, FEMIX. To predict the average shear stress-sliding response, the shear crack softening diagram, available in the multi-directional fixed smeared crack model, was used. After demonstration the good predictive performance of the numerical model, a parametric study was carried out to evaluate the influence of shear retention factor, fracture energy of mode II, and crack shear strength on the average shear stress-sliding response of the SHCC. The advantage of SHCC instead of conventional mortar was also studied. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) - PTDC/ECM/ 114511 / 200...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical {{and experimental}} {{studies on the}} performance of Hybrid Composite Plates (HCPs) as a shear strengthening technique for reinforced concrete (RC) beams. A HCP is a thin plate of Strain Hardening Cementitious Composite (SHCC) reinforced with Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) laminates applied according to the Near Surface Mounted technique (NSM). Due to the excellent bond conditions between SHCC and CFRP laminates, these reinforcements provide the necessary tensile strength capacity to the HCP. However, the shear behavior of SHCC material has not been yet fully understood due to lack of an appropriate and accurate direct shear test method. To characterize the behavior of SHCCs in shear, the Iosipescu shear test setup was used to test several specimens, in which the loads were applied in an antisymmetric four point bending configuration to assure a pure <b>shear</b> <b>section.</b> A special geometry for the specimens was chosen to assure a uniform shear stress distribution in the pure <b>shear</b> <b>section.</b> A numerical model is presented for predicting the strengthening effectiveness of HCPs in reinforced concrete beams. The numerical simulations were performed on FEMIX, a computer program that includes a shear crack softening law to simulate the stress transfer mechanism at the shear crack as the crack widens. The values of the parameters that define the shear crack softening law were derived based on simulations of Iosipescu shear tests performed as part of this study. The results of the numerical models for the reinforced concrete beams strengthened with HCPs are compared with the experimental data obtained for this beams. It is demonstrated that the numerical model can predict fairly well the behavior of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with HCPs...|$|E

Recently there has been a growing interest in the designing and manufacturing the muffler tube due to the strict environmental regulations. The technique of perforating on the muffler tube has been largely affected by the shear clearance. And considering the concentration of the force around the punch edge, it is essential to reduced it through the punch radius. In this research, finite element analysis has been carried out to predict optimal forming conditions of the muffler tube using DEFORM TM- 3 D. In analysis, using one-fourth component of the punch and die, metal forming process is simulated and Cockcroft-Latham ductile fracture theory is used. According to the simulation results, when the shear clearance is 0. 04 mm, the punch radius is 0. 05 mm and the value of plate holder force is 250 KN, the relation of load-stroke for punch is optimized. Also the burr is minimized and optimal <b>shear</b> <b>section</b> is obtained. The simulation results are reflected to the forming process design for the muffler tube. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} {{and strength of}} edge and corner column slab connections of flat plate structures subjected to shear force only, moment only as well as combined shear force and moment were investigated. A two bay by two bay flat plate structure (nine columns) and eight isolated edge column slab connections were constructed and tested to failure. After the tests of the four edge column connections of the continuous slab were completed, the edge connections were repaired using two types of concretes (normal concrete and CAB expansive concrete) and tested to failure. Interaction diagrams between shear force and unbalanced moment at edge column slab connections based on building code provisions (ACI 318 - 99, CSA A 23. 3 - 94 and CEB-FIP MC 90) and three alternative approaches (Regan's approach, the Truss Model and the Strip Model) proposed in the literature are examined using {{the results of the}} present experimental work. Interaction diagrams for corner connections calculated using Regan's approach and the building code provisions are compared with the experimental results. The shear strength of edge and corner connections is calculated according to ACI 318 - 99, CSA A 23. 3 - 85, BS 8110 - 85, CEB-FIP MC 90 and the alternative approaches of Regan, Sherif, Gardner, Elgabry, the Truss Model and the Strip Model. All alternative approach predictions of shear strength of edge connections, except Sheril's, are conservative. The average ratio of measured shear strength to calculated shear strength ranges from 0. 90 to 1. 30 with coefficients of variation (COV) ranging from 0. 18 to 0. 40. Gardner's approach, that considered a linear shear stress distribution as in ACI 318 - 99, with a critical <b>shear</b> <b>section</b> taken at the column perimeter or perimeter of loaded area gives the most conservative and the least scatter of the test results compared with the other proposed approaches. The measured shear strengths of the corner connections are compared to the calculated shear strengths based on the building code provisions and five alternative approaches available in the literature (i. e. Ingvarsson's, Regan's, Zaghlool's, Gardner's and Desayi's approach). On the basis of the present test results, the effects of load eccentricity (M/V) and reinforcement ratio (rho avg) on shear strength of edge column slab connections are investigated. The reduction in shear capacity of edge connections due to the increase in M/V ratios approximates a logarithmic function. The effect of the reinforcement ratio on the shear strength of the present tests on the edge and corner connections calculated using the North American codes is not obvious. However, tests by Zaghlool (1973) and Regan (1981) show that the shear strength increased with an increase in reinforcement ratio. The strength and stiffness of repaired edge connections were investigated using the four, previously failed, edge connections of the continuous slab specimen. Connections repaired using normal concrete can have similar strength and stiffness as the original connections. However, the connections repaired using the CAH expansive concrete exhibited less strength and stiffness compared to the original edge connections...|$|E
40|$|Shape sensing, i. e., {{reconstruction}} of the displacement field of a structure from surface-measured strains, has relevant implications for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), {{as well as for}} control and actuation of smart structures. The knowledge of the full-field displacements implies that other essential response quantities such as stresses can be assessed, thus enabling real-time damage predictions by means of appropriate failure criteria. The inverse Finite Element Method (iFEM) is a shape-sensing methodology shown to be fast, accurate, and robust. In the present thesis, the general framework of iFEM, i. e., least-square variational statement and displacement-based finite element approximation, has been adopted to develop efficient and robust shape-sensing techniques, with focus on thin-walled structures, beam and frame structures and multilayered, composite and sandwich structures. The theoretical framework of the iFEM and its original formulation for plates and shell structures, developed {{on the basis of the}} First-order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT), are firstly summarized. Then, the variational principle for three-dimensional frame structures, based on Timoshenko beam theory, is reviewed. This is followed by a discussion of two C 0 -continuous, beam inverse elements, a 0 th-order element, having constant shear-section strain along the element length, and a newly formulated 1 st-order element, having linear <b>shear</b> <b>section</b> strain. The formulation, originally proposed for circular cross-section beams, is extended to rectangular beams. In addition, relationships between the order of kinematic-element interpolations and the number of required strain gauges are established. A new formulation for the shape sensing of multilayered composite and sandwich structures possessing a high degree of anisotropy and heterogeneity is herein presented. The new formulation employs the iFEM as a general framework and the Refined Zigzag Theory (RZT) as the underlying plate theory. A three-node inverse plate finite element is formulated, enabling robust and efficient modeling of arbitraty plate structures. A methodology to infer applied loads from iFEM-predicted displacements is proposed. The evaluated loads can then be used within a direct finite element analysis to evaluate high-fidelity finite element stress solution. Several example problems involving thin-walled structures, three-dimensional frame structures and multilayered, composite and sandwich structures, undergoing static and dynamic response, as well as thermal deformation, are discussed. To simulate experimentally measured strains and to establish reference displacements, high-fidelity MSC/NASTRAN finite element analyses are performed. For the sandwich plate problems, exact elasticity solution or direct RZT solution are employed to the same purpose. To enable the analysis of partially instrumented structures considered in the present example problems, a method to select optimal weights to be used in the weighted least-square formulation for plates with sparse strain data is proposed. Numerically simulated measurement errors, based on Gaussian distribution, are also considered in order to verify the stability and robustness of the iFEM methodology. Furthermore, a comparative study involving iFEM and other shape sensing methodologies existing in the literature is discussed. An experimental test campaign is presented aiming to demonstrate that iFEM for beam and plate structures is reliable when experimentally measured strains are used as input data. The accuracy and robustness of iFEM with respect to unavoidable measurement errors, due to strain sensor locations, measurement systems, and geometry imperfections, are demonstrated for both static and dynamic loadings. The proposed methodology based on the iFEM is computationally efficient and accurate in reconstructing both static and time-varying displacement fields. Since only strain-displacement relationships are used, all type of struct...|$|E

In addition, it was investigated that the developed model rationally considered the effect of main parameters such as concrete compressive strength, shear span–depth ratio, stirrup ratio, and member depth. Through simplification, the developed model can be useful to develop more rational shear design provisions for reinforced concrete members with stirrups.|$|R

In order to examine the influence of the impact parameter, including the impact energy and the nose diameter of the impact head, on the deformation, failure and energy absorption characteristics of the thin sandwich plate in a free boundary condition, drawing type drop impact experiments have been performed.

40|$|This thesis embodies a {{field and}} {{laboratory}} {{study of the}} sulphide deposits of the Hanson Lake area, northern Saskatchewan. The field mapping of the mineralized showings indicated none, or very little, lithologie control of sulphide emplacement {{but there is some}} structural control by fractures, slips, and weak <b>shears.</b> Thin <b>section</b> studies indicate a uniform grade of dynamic metamorphism belonging to the amphibolite facies. Very similar mineralogy and paragenesis of the sulphide assemblages in the different mineralized zones indicates the deposits are of similar ages and related origins. Mineralization at Wildnest Lake, 25 miles northeast of Hanson Lake, shows similar features. The deposits are classified as being deep seated, high temperature, hydrothermal replacements. None of the deposits can be mined at present day costs and prices, but two or three may produce someday. The discovery of a mineralized zone in a gneissic area may encourage future exploration in such areas...|$|R
50|$|In the Euler-Bernoulli {{theory of}} slender beams, a major {{assumption}} is that 'plane sections remain plane'. In other words, any deformation due to <b>shear</b> across the <b>section</b> is not accounted for (no shear deformation). Also, this linear distribution is only applicable if the maximum stress {{is less than the}} yield stress of the material. For stresses that exceed yield, refer to article plastic bending. At yield, the maximum stress experienced in the section (at the furthest points from the neutral axis of the beam) is defined as the flexural strength.|$|R

At the time of impact, aircraft‟s heading was 220 degrees and its speed was [...] Following the impact, the aircraft skipped, started breaking up, skidded along the ground and rolled inverted before coming to a halt. During this process, parts of the aircraft including undercarriage, engines, wings and tail <b>section</b> <b>sheared</b> off. There were 32 fatalities, with the sole survivor a Congolese journalist.|$|R
