5|$|The Mascarene {{martin has}} a heavy flight with slow wingbeats {{interspersed}} with glides, and may repeatedly {{return to a}} favourite perch. This martin is often seen perched on wires, and sometimes rests on sandy beaches. The martin roosts in small flocks in bushes, on buildings or on cliffs. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> joined at the roost by other birds, such as blue-cheeked bee-eaters in the Seychelles.|$|E
5|$|Turunen's {{voice is}} {{described}} by critics as remarkably powerful and emotional. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> stated that her voice is too trained or operatic for metal music, but even critics who do not like classical voices admit that her voice suits the kind of metal songs she sings unusually well.|$|E
5|$|In Tibetan Buddhism, sharabha is {{represented}} as a beast with a goat's head and horns, a lion's mane and horse's body and legs. It symbolizes determination, strength and speed. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> represented additionally with horns of an antelope and claws of an eagle. Sometimes, the goat head {{is replaced by a}} lion's, horse's feet by a lion's and horns can be of a ram. A common feature of all representations is the horse's body. It is often depicted as mounts of young Devas or dwarfs in a Torana – a six-level archway behind an enlightenment throne of a Buddha or Boddhisattva. Together with the devas, they symbolize the perfection of effort (virya).|$|E
60|$|They {{were soon}} {{out of the}} little town, and running through the uneven lanes of the country. Ursula nestled near him, into his {{constant}} warmth, and watched the pale-lit revelation racing ahead, the visible night. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a wide old road, with grass-spaces on either side, flying magic and elfin in the greenish illumination, <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> trees looming overhead, <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> bramble bushes, <b>sometimes</b> {{the walls of a}} crew-yard and the butt of a barn.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I did, really. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> horrid and <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> funny. <b>It</b> all {{depended}} on the man. Dear me, how red and uncomfortable most of them looked--all but the fifth. He was so cool and business like that he almost surprised me into accepting him." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{have all}} heard it many and many a time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a proud {{distinction}} {{to be able}} to say those words. It brought envy to the speaker, a kind of glory; and he basked in <b>it</b> and <b>was</b> happy through all his veins. And who <b>was</b> <b>it</b> he stood so close to? The answer would cover all the grades. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a king; <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a renowned highwayman; <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an unknown man killed in an extraordinary way and made suddenly famous by it; always <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a person who was for the moment the subject of public interest of a village.|$|R
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.|$|E
5|$|The word kosher is {{also part}} of some common product names. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> used as an {{abbreviation}} of koshering, meaning the process for making something kosher; for example, kosher salt is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of kashrut, because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At other times it is used as a synonym for Jewish tradition; for example, a kosher dill pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine, and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.|$|E
60|$|From time to {{time there}} came rumours of Sharkey over the sea. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> from some {{schooner}} which had seen a great flame upon the horizon, and approaching to offer help to the burning ship, had fled away {{at the sight of}} the sleek, black barque, lurking like a wolf near a mangled sheep. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a frightened trader, which had come tearing in with her canvas curved like a lady's bodice, because she had seen a patched fore-topsail rising slowly above the violet water-line. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> from a Coaster, which had found a waterless Bahama Cay littered with sun-dried bodies.|$|R
6000|$|The {{answers to}} this {{question}} were various and contradictory. Sometimes the broken reply <b>was,</b> [...] "Wait! <b>It</b> would kill me if I saw her too soon." [...] <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> given in a tender rain of tears, and then <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "Take me to her." [...] <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> staring and bewildered, and then <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "I don't know her. I don't understand." ...|$|R

5|$|They live {{throughout}} rainforest, dry sclerophyll (Eucalyptus) forest, open woodland, Pandanus thickets, paperbarks, mangroves, watercourses, and wetter {{areas of}} semi-arid regions, {{as well as}} parks, gardens, and golf courses in urban areas. The understory in eucalypt-dominated woodland where the blue-faced honeyeater is found is most commonly composed of grasses such as Triodia, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> made up of shrubs or small trees such as grevilleas, paperbarks, wattles, Cooktown ironwood (Erythrophleum chlorostachys) or billygoat plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana). One study in Kakadu National Park found that blue-faced honeyeaters inhabited mixed stands of eucalypts and Pandanus but were missing from pure stands of either plant.|$|E
25|$|The {{gravitational}} acceleration varies {{from place to}} place. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> simply taken to have a standard value of , which gives the standard weight.|$|E

25|$|The {{defense of}} {{checking}} {{from the side}} normally requires three empty files between the pawn and the black rook. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible with only two files when the pawn is on the seventh rank.|$|E
25|$|The {{loading coil}} is usually {{inserted}} {{at the base}} of the antenna, between it and the transmission line (base loading), but <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> inserted in the center of the antenna element itself (center loading).|$|E
25|$|An {{embolism}} {{is usually}} a pathological event, i.e., accompanying illness or injury. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> created intentionally for a therapeutic reason, such as to stop bleeding or to kill a cancerous tumor by stopping its blood supply. Such therapy is called embolization.|$|E
60|$|As {{the time}} for leaving came on Rose had hours of depression, wherein she {{wondered}} if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> worth while. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> began when she noticed a fugitive look of sorrow on her father's face, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> at parting with some of her girl friends, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> at thought of Carl. She had {{spent a year in}} the Siding in preparation for the work in Madison, and the time of her adventure with the world was near.|$|R

5000|$|Jiaolong (...) or jiao is a polysemous aquatic dragon in Chinese mythology. Edward H. Schafer {{describes}} the jiao:Spiritually {{akin to the}} crocodile, and perhaps originally the same reptile, was a mysterious creature capable of many forms called the chiao (kău). Most often <b>it</b> <b>was</b> regarded {{as a kind of}} lung - a [...] "dragon" [...] as we say. But <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> manlike, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> merely a fish. All of its realizations were interchangeable. (1967:217-8) ...|$|R
25|$|It {{is almost}} certain that cricket reached London, and thereby Middlesex, by the 16th century. Early {{references}} to the game in London or Middlesex are often interchangeable and <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not clear if a particular team represents the city or the county.|$|E
25|$|Presbyterians {{typically}} have viewed {{this method of}} government as approximating that of the New Testament and earliest churches. However, <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> admitted that episcopacy {{was a form of}} government that was used very early in the church for practical reasons.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{all these}} factors, the {{classification}} of Sireniki Eskimo language is not settled yet: Sireniki language is sometimes regarded as a third branch of Eskimo (at least, its possibility is mentioned). <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> regarded rather as a group belonging to the Yupik branch.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{desirable}} {{to find a}} model of set theory that is narrow like L, but that includes or is influenced by a set that is not constructible. This {{gives rise to the}} concept of relative constructibility, of which there are two flavors, denoted L(A) and L.|$|E
25|$|If this proves {{ineffective}} or if barbiturates {{cannot be}} used for some reason, then a general anesthetic such as propofol may be tried; <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> used second after the failure of lorazepam. This also means putting the people on artificial ventilation. Propofol {{has been shown to}} be effective in suppressing the jerks seen in myoclonus status epilepticus.|$|E
25|$|The hybrid-pi {{model is}} a popular circuit model used for {{analyzing}} the small signal behavior of bipolar junction and field effect transistors. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also called Giacoletto model because it was introduced by L.J. Giacoletto in 1969. The model can be quite accurate for low-frequency circuits and can easily be adapted for higher-frequency circuits {{with the addition of}} appropriate inter-electrode capacitances and other parasitic elements.|$|E

60|$|Lessingham {{pushed them}} on one side. He {{stood on the}} edge of the beach and, {{borrowing}} a lantern, watched for his opportunity. Then suddenly he vanished. They looked after him. They could see nothing but the rope slipping past their feet, inch by inch. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> stationary, <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> drawn taut. The first great wave that came flung a yard or so of slack amongst them. Then, after the roar of its breaking had died away, they saw the rope suddenly tighten, and pass rapidly out, and the excitement began to thicken.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{well-known}} Kaufman {{character is}} Tony Clifton, an absurd, audience-abusing lounge singer who began opening for Kaufman at comedy clubs and eventually even performed concerts {{on his own}} around the country. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Kaufman performing as Clifton, <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> his brother Michael or Zmuda. For a brief time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unclear to some that Clifton was not a real person. News programs interviewed Clifton as Kaufman's opening act, with the mood turning ugly whenever Kaufman's name came up. Kaufman, Clifton insisted, was attempting to ruin Clifton's [...] "good name" [...] {{in order to make}} money and become famous.|$|R
