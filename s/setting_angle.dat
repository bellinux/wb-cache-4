40|$|We {{consider}} a generalized anisotropic planar-rotor model on a triangular lattice for interchain orientational ordering of undoped and doped polyacetylene, and investigate {{the effects of}} various terms on the symmetry {{and the range of}} stability of the observed herringbone (HB) phases. Dipole, quadrupole, and octopole interactions are included in the model with sixfold crystal-field anisotropy and are analyzed within the mean-field theory. The relative strength of these interactions can be estimated from the observed <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> of the HB phase {{with the help of the}} smallness of crystal-field anisotropy. A model where the polymer chain is represented by a ‘‘quadrupolar’’ mass density only has various phases as the temperature and the interaction parameters are varied. Among them, the HB phase is found below a critical temperature Tc for some range of the parameter space, and the <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> of the HB phase is 45 ° and independent of temperature. Competition between quadrupole and other interactions such as dipole or octopole, parametrized by the ratio of interaction strengths λ, results in an additional phase transition at T’c(λ) and makes the <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> vary with the temperature below T’c(λ). For a model with quadrupole and octopole terms, there are two degenerate states of the <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> related by θ’=π/ 2 -θ. This degeneracy does not reflect a symmetry of the system and is lifted by the dipole terms. For a model with quadrupole and dipole interactions, the <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> increases as the temperature is reduced below T’c(λ). From these results, we conclude that quadrupole and dipole interactions are important terms to explain experimental observations. Effects of crystal-field anisotropy resolve the twofold degeneracy, destroy the critical behavior associated with T’c(λ), and make the <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> temperature dependent over the entire range of temperature below Tc. Crucial information on the interaction parameters of the model can be obtained through the temperature dependence of the <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> of the HB phase...|$|E

40|$|As the induced-voltage {{commutation}} type commutatorless motor (Thy-CLM) {{does not}} need external commutation elements such as capacitors and reactors, its construction is simple compared with the compulsive commutation type CLM. But, as the commutation of the thyristors depends on the armature induced-voltage, the <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> has to be equal to or larger than the commutation margin angle. Therefore, for the Thy-CLM, if the <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> is smaller than the commutation‐margin angle, its normal operation {{as well as its}} starting are imposible. This paper describes the effects of the cumulative-and differential-compound field windings over the load characteristics of the transistor-CLM(TR-CLM), based on the experiments, and the following results are obtained. (1) For the TR-CLM the <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> can be chosen in a range wider than that for the Thy-CLM, and therefore the former is superior in starting and steady operation characteristics. (2) The differential-compond field winding results in a good constant speed characteristic, but in a heavy load condition, the powerfactor and efficiency decline.

40|$|For the 180 °-type thyristor-commutatorless motor, {{reactors}} and capacitors {{are needed}} to obtain commutation energy, and the <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> must be held leading and therefore the armature current circulates through the feedback diodes and armature windings. For these reasons the 180 °-type thyristor-commutatorless motor has low efficiency and {{is considered to be}} impractical. While the transistor-commutatorless motor does not depend on the induced voltage during the commutation and needs neither reactors nor capacitors for commutation, and therefore its circuit configuration is simple and the system is economical. Furthermore the transistor-commutatorless motor has the advantage that its <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> can be made zero or negative (lagging) for steady operation as well as starting. In this paper, based on the experiments, the characteristics of the 180 °-type transistor-commutatorless motor, which has neither feedback diodes nor commutation reactors and capacitors, are discussed compared with the 120 °-type transistor-commutatorless motor. Also the effect of the cumulative- and differential -compound field windings over the load characteristics of the 180 °-type transistor- commutatorless motor are discussed. The results are as follows. 1) For the 120 °-type, the positive torque is generated for the <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> in the range, - 60 °≤γ₀≤ 60 °, while for the 180 °-type the positive torque is obtained only in the range, - 30 °≤γ₀≤ 30 °. 2) In the case of the 120 °-type, the input voltage is always higher than the induced voltage and therefore the transistor is ON during the entire period (120 °) for which the base voltage is applied to the transistor. In the case of the 180 °-type there exists the period of 60 °during which the induced voltage is higher than the input voltage and therefore the transistor is ON only in the time interval of 120 °while the base voltage is applied for 180 °. 3) For the identical <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> and load current, the 180 °-type has a higher induced voltage (or motor speed) than the 120 °-type, namely, the former has a larger torque pulsation than the latter. 4) With the differential-compound field winding and for a negative <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> (lagging), the motor efficiency is low (about 50 %) due to the increase of commutation- surge loss and decrease of power factor...|$|E

Canard effects to BWB aerodynamic characteristics are not widely investigated. Hence the focus of the study is to investigate the variations of lifts, drags and moments when the angles of attack are varied at different canard setting angles. Wind tunnel tests were performed on BWB aircraft with canard setting angles, δ ranging from- 20 ˚ to 20 ˚. Angles of attack, α were varied from- 10 ˚ to 10 ˚. Aspect ratio and canard planform area were kept fixed. All tests were conducted in the subsonic wind tunnel at Universiti Teknologi MARA, at Mach number of 0. 1. The streamlines flow, at the upper surface of the canard was visualized using mini tuft. Result shows that the lift coefficient does not change much with different canard setting angles.
