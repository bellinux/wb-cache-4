50|$|A Christmas {{stocking}} is {{an empty}} sock or sock-shaped bag that is hung on Christmas Eve so that Santa Claus (or Father Christmas) can {{fill it with}} small toys, candy, fruit, coins or other small gifts when he arrives. These small items are {{often referred to as}} <b>stocking</b> <b>stuffers</b> or <b>stocking</b> fillers. In some Christmas stories, the contents of the Christmas stocking are the only toys the child receives at Christmas from Santa Claus; in other stories (and in tradition), some presents are also wrapped up in wrapping paper and placed under the Christmas tree. Tradition in Western culture threatens that a child who behaves badly during the year will receive only a piece or pile of coal. However, coal is rarely if ever left in a stocking, as it is considered cruel. Some people even put their Christmas stocking by their bedposts so Santa Claus can fill it by the bed while they sleep.|$|R

500|$|On January18, 1873, Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Archibald Loudon Snowden {{complained that}} the [...] "3" [...] in the date, as struck by the Mint, too closely resembled an [...] "8", {{especially}} on the smaller-sized denominations. [...] In response, Pollock ordered Chief Engraver William Barber to re-engrave the date, opening {{the arms of the}} [...] "3" [...] wider on most denominations, including the three-dollar piece. [...] Both the Closed3 and Open3 varieties are extremely rare, though the official mintage of 25pieces for 1873 is understated, since more specimens than that are known to exist. In 1875 and 1876, no pieces were struck for circulation, with only pieces in proof condition being made available to collectors. [...] The official mintage is 20for 1875 and 45for 1876, though an unknown number of pieces may have been later illicitly restruck for each date. Numismatic writer R.W. Julian believes that there were no later restrikes, but as proof pieces were not counted until sold, employees substituted common-date pieces when unsold coins were to be melted. These pieces had been made available to the public only as part of a proof set of all gold denominations, at a price of $43 (a premium of $1.50 over face value). Julian suggests that the relatively large mintages of almost 42,000 in 1874 and some 82,000 in 1878 were struck in anticipation of the resumption of specie payments, but when this finally occurred at the end of 1878, [...] "there was a loud yawn from the public and the Mint kept most of the pieces on hand, paying them out slowly as <b>stocking</b> <b>stuffers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Critical {{reviews for}} All Through the House have been positive. Horror Society says that All Through the House is the “perfect <b>stocking</b> <b>stuffer,</b> the perfect present under the tree. It’s an {{unpredictable}} gorefest filled with holiday cheer and unadulterated horror.” The Blood Shed states that “almost {{every aspect of}} the film is superb”. The Shock Chamber praised the film, saying, “If this film was made 30 years ago it would be mentioned today in the same conversations as Black Christmas and Silent Night, Deadly Night [...]” The reviewer also noted that director/writer Todd Nunes is an [...] "exceptional horror filmmaker and I look forward to seeing him crank out many more projects.” The UK's Bloody Flicks reports that, [...] "All Through the House isn’t perfect but it revels in its flaws and creates a rip roaring sleigh ride straight to hell." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Christmas in Harlem" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Giving the song a three-and-a-half star rating, Chuck Eddy of Rolling Stone stated: [...] "Kanye's tinsel-tinted <b>stocking</b> <b>stuffer</b> sounds uncharacteristically tossed-off, as if he's {{preoccupied with the}} Xmas shopping spree he says he's planning. But actual Harlem R&B hopeful Teyana Taylor offers warmth from the wind chill, eventually slipping into the comfy melody from the Brothers Johnson's 'Strawberry Letter 23.' And gruff-rapping Atlanta Santa CyHi Da Prynce promises presents for non-Christian kiddies, too — hauled in a Porsche-speed sleigh." [...] The magazine later included the song in its list of [...] "The Greatest Rock & Roll Christmas Songs", describing it favorably as a follow-up to [...] "Christmas in Hollis", a similarly themed Christmas song by hip-hop group Run-D.M.C. In {{his description of the}} track, Andy Greene of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "It's only been out for a year, but Kanye West's follow-up to Run-D.M.C.'s 'Christmas in Hollis' is already a classic. With help from Teyana Taylor, Cam'Ron, Jim Jones and Pusha T, West paints a vivid and cheerful portrait of the season." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator wrote of the track: [...] "Soulful, sweet and sprightly, it's one of the most joyful tracks we’ve heard from Kanye [...] Maybe even ever?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Elsewhere, {{the game}} {{received}} [...] "favorable" [...] reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. [...] Common Sense Media gave it all five stars, saying, [...] "Returning fans will recognize {{the style of}} many of the game's puzzles. Some force you to carefully analyze images, others are tricky riddles, and still others involve clever application of basic math skills -- but each one is different enough from the last that boredom never sets in. Add in yet another engaging story filled with quirky personalities and several seemingly unsolvable grand mysteries, and you have a recipe for a very memorable Professor Layton adventure." [...] National Post gave it a score of 8.5 out of 10, saying that it [...] "entertains without violence or scares, it provides a healthy workout for your brain, and it's suitable for most ages and both genders. It will provide hours of entertainment for your son, your daughter, you, and your significant other (you'll need to take turns playing, but that's what multiple save files are for). Suffice to say we think Santa couldn't have chosen a better <b>stocking</b> <b>stuffer</b> for clever kids (or their parents)." [...] Digital Spy gave it four stars out of five, saying, [...] "Its fascinating story and well-balanced array of puzzles means Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask is probably the best outing in the series since the ground-breaking original, and the new approach to visuals once again reminds you of the system's now forgotten selling point: its terrific 3D screen." ...|$|E
