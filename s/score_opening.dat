2500|$|With the Patriots down {{to their}} last timeout and ahead by two points, 17–15, the {{possibility}} existed that the Giants would run a play to stop short of the goal line, which would have forced the Patriots to use that timeout to stop the clock {{on any of the}} last two plays. The Giants could run the clock down, allow Tynes—who had not missed under 30 yards in four years—to kick a winning field goal, and give the Patriots only about 20 seconds of play left to score again. This also meant that the Patriots could call a defensive play where they would purposely allow the Giants to score a touchdown, which despite giving up the lead would allow the Patriots to get the ball back still with that timeout and with more time remaining. New England chose to let New York <b>score,</b> <b>opening</b> its defense to let Bradshaw enter the end zone with the ball. In what Sports Illustrated later called [...] "perhaps the strangest play in Super Bowl history", Bradshaw attempted to stop on the 1-yard line upon realizing what the Patriots were doing, but his forward momentum caused him to fall into the end zone for a touchdown. The intentionally surrendered touchdown gave the Patriots 57 seconds to score again, and they went into their final drive trailing by a 21–17 count after the Giants failed to convert a two-point play.|$|E

The New York City skyline of 1962 was digitally recreated for backdrops. A greenscreen technique was used to simulate unconvincing 1960s rear projection using restored street footage from the late 1950s and early 1960s. The film begins with the 1960s logos for 20th Century Fox and for CinemaScope, a wide-screen process introduced in the 1950s, developed and owned by 20th Century Fox.

In her work, she uses repetition as a strategy, {{as a way of}} making things visible, of activating them. She is more interested {{in the interest of the}} audience in things than in the things themselves. She is also interested in how situations leave traces in memory, and how memory becomes an active part of reading something. Her work is both profound and witty, sober and rich in detail. By using a playful approach to thoughts and references Mette Edvardsen examines how language can be used to form pictures in the heads of the audience.|$|E

5000|$|... 1974 - USC 55, Notre Dame 24 [...] "The Comeback" [...] : In one of {{the most}} notable comebacks in college {{football}} history, the 1974 Trojans erased a 24-point deficit to beat defending national champion Notre Dame, 55-24, in the Coliseum. Many football historians cite this game as one of USC's 10 greatest games. The Irish jumped out to a 24-0 lead, but with 10 seconds remaining before halftime, Anthony Davis scored on a 7-yard pass from Pat Haden. At the start of second half, Davis took the opening kickoff of and raced 102 yards for a <b>score,</b> <b>opening</b> the floodgates as USC rallied for 35 points in the third quarter. Davis scored 2 more touchdowns that quarter, and Haden threw two TD passes to J. K. McKay, the head coach's son. In the fourth quarter, Haden connected with Shelton Diggs for a touchdown and Charles Phillips returned an interception 58 yards for a touchdown. Adding to the shock of the comeback was the fact that USC scored 55 points in under 17 minutes. After the game, the Rev. Theodore Martin Hesburgh, the then-president of Notre Dame, said to Trojan coach John McKay, [...] "That wasn't very nice." [...] McKay, an Irish Catholic known for his quick wit, replied (referring to Parseghian's faith), [...] "That's what you get for hiring a Presbyterian!" [...] A few weeks later, Ara Parseghian announced his resignation, and the Irish gave him a fitting farewell present with an emotional 13-11 win over Alabama and Bear Bryant in the Orange Bowl.|$|E

5000|$|... "HUME LEAGUE. LAVINGTON PREMIERS. BETHANGA OVERWHELMED IN ROUGH GAME.From {{start to}} finish {{there was only one}} team in it. Furthermore on various {{occasions}} blows were struck, and in one instance, the umpire, who rushed in to stop a melee, was violently thrown aside. Tripping and elbowing, which appeared deliberate, was an order of the day, and only on rare occasions was good and systematic play in evidence. By way of comparison, this match was miles behind the first semi final played on the same ground between Bethanga and Walbundrie the three weeks previously. Lavington won the toss, {{and with the help of}} a strong breeze blowing diagonally across the ground soon had Bethanga in difficulties. The side was on the defense throughout the quarter, and failed to <b>score.</b> <b>Opening</b> with several behinds L. O’Connell then kicked two goals, which were followed by a string of seven behinds. Only on one occasion did the ball cross the centerline in Bethanga’s favor. Rough and congested play excluded good football, and the game was held up several times in order to quell disturbances caused by pugilistic encounters. At the change Lavington led by 21 points to nil. It was expected that with the wind in its favor, Bethanga would make up the leeway in the second quarter, but supporters were disappointed when Lavington quickly added three goals to their score (T Farley-1 goal, Rowley Gulson-2 goals). Play was again interrupted by fighting and when the goal umpire fell over a boy who got in his road, he was unable to signal the score, and play ceased for about 10 minutes to give way to arguments and explanations. Order being restored, play was resumed and Bethanga seemed to wake up. Wally Butler kicked two goals and several behinds gave them more points. Then the game swerved in Lavingtons favor again, and with the help of 4 behinds and a goal by Jack Livermore, they led by 35 points at half time. Although Bethanga opened the third quarter well, and early scored several points they were for the most part defending desperately and were unable to add further to their tally. Lavington was now definitely on top, and did as it liked. By adding 4 goals (Jack Livermore 2 goals, T Farley, Spud Prater 1 goal each) and eight behinds, they drew away from their opponents, who were beaten in the ruck, in the air, in fact anywhere. The issue was no more in doubt, and the players, realizing that the game was won and lost, managed to keep their ruffled tempers in check. As in the previous quarter Bethanga again scored first in the last term. Wally Butler raised the two flags. Rowley Gulson replied with a sixer, and Tom Barnett gave Bethanga another goal. W. Dawson, T. Farley and L. O’Connell in turn kicked correctly, and Tom Barnett once more gave Bethanga a goal. Three goals by Lavington (Jack Livermore, Spud Prater, Harold McIntosh) made the margin still wider, and large numbers had already left the ground when the final bell proclaimed Lavington premiers of the Hume League for 1938.The scores: first quarter, Lavington 2-9 Bethanga nil. Second quarter, Lavington 6-13 Bethanga 2-2. third quarter, Lavington 10-21 Bethanga 2-4. Final scores. Lavington, 17 goals 23 behinds (125 points). Bethanga, 5-6 (36 points). Goal kickers-Lavington.
