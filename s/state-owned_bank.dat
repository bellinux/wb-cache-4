5|$|During {{the presidential}} {{referendum}} in Egypt, Nasser was re-elected {{to a second}} term as UAR president and took his oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging <b>state-owned</b> <b>bank</b> loans to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports. During the 60's, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.|$|E

40|$|Thirty {{years of}} {{neoliberal}} restructuring have side-lined alternative financing practices, and propagated mainstream myths about <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks.</b> This paper examines these neoliberal claims, arguing instead that <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks</b> can remain {{a crucial part}} of progressive, sustainable and democratic strategies for investments in long-term development and infrastructure.

To this end the chapter dispels nine popular neoliberal claims about <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks</b> while discussing how <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks</b> have undergone neoliberal restructuring processes such as marketization and corporatization in ways that nonetheless challenge their status as ‘public’ banks.

In addition to founding the <b>state-owned</b> <b>Bank</b> of North Dakota and North Dakota Mill and Elevator (both still in existence), the NPL established a state-owned railroad line (later sold to the Soo Line Railroad). Anti-corporate laws virtually prohibited a corporation or bank from owning title to land zoned as farmland. These laws, still in force today, after having been upheld by state and federal courts, make it almost impossible to foreclose on farmland, as even after foreclosure, the property title cannot be held by a bank or mortgage company. Furthermore, the Bank of North Dakota, having powers similar to a Federal Reserve branch bank, exercised its power to limit the issuance of subprime mortgages and their collateralization in the form of derivative instruments, and so prevented a collapse of housing prices within the state in the wake of 2008's financial crisis.|$|E

Furthermore, the model also shows that if the government is generous with employees of <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks,</b> it will also contribute to the profit performance of private banks and high interest rates spreads.

40|$|Although <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks</b> are {{expected}} to promote the growth of less-developed regions, especially in developing economies, several cross-country studies report that lending by state banks {{is associated with the}} inefficient allocation of credit and low levels of development.

In this paper, we study the lending activities of <b>state-owned</b> and private <b>banks</b> during the period 1992 - 2010 and analyze the relationship between the credit these banks provide and local economic growth in Turkey during crisis periods and in election years. We find that the share of <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks</b> in the credit market in crisis periods and local election years is significantly higher than their share in non-crisis and non-election periods. The per capita real credit that <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks</b> provide during crisis years is found to be positively associated with local growth in all provinces.

Findings indicate that the ratio of cash flow rights over control rights is significantly higher in stated-owned banks. The board size of <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks,</b> on average, is larger than that of family-owned <b>banks.</b> In addition, <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks</b> disclosed significantly more detailed information measured by number of lines than family-owned banks.

40|$|In this paper, we analyse {{the impact}} of credits {{provided}} by banks on provincial growth in Turkey, where <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks</b> have an implicit role of reducing disparity by allocating loans in underdeveloped regions that are ignored by private banks. We find a paradoxical effect of <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks</b> on regional development: their credits contribute significantly {{to the growth of}} more developed provinces, whereas they fail to encourage the well-being of less developed provinces. On the other hand, credits provided by private banks, in general, positively impact the per capita real gross domestic product (GDP) in both developed and less developed provinces. Contrary to their purpose of existence, our results suggest that <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks</b> did not reduce economic disparity among Turkish provinces. In the trade-off between growth and income disparity, our results suggest that <b>state-owned</b> <b>banks</b> should improve their lending behaviour, especially in the less-developed regions, in order to broaden their development role to the whole economy.
