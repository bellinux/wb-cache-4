5000|$|The Corex Process is a <b>smelting</b> <b>reduction</b> process {{created by}} Siemens VAI {{as a more}} {{environmentally}} friendly alternative to the blast furnace. Presently, the majority of steel production is through the blast furnace which has to rely on ever decreasing amounts of coking coal.

[...] In addition, the Blast furnace requires a sinter plant too in order to prepare the iron ore for reduction. [...] Unlike the Blast Furnace, <b>smelting</b> <b>reduction</b> processes are typical smaller and use coal and oxygen directly to reduce iron ore into a usable product. <b>Smelting</b> <b>reduction</b> processes come in two basic varieties, two-stage or single-stage.

40|$|The work {{discussed}} in this thesis is aimed at examining the formation of freeze layers and refractory wear on water-cooling elements within direct smelting processes {{through the use of}} computational modelling techniques. The motivation of performing this work is to examine the cooling of regions of the <b>Smelt</b> <b>Reduction</b> Vessel of the HIsmelt process closer to the molten bath material. HIsmelt is a novel process for the production of pig iron which has been under development by Rio Tinto and is now being ommercialised. The previous work performed in this are has been reviewed with particular focus on the refractory wear mechanisms as the solidification algorithms have been thoroughly implemented within the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) framework PHYSCIA used within this work. The governing equations along with the Finite Volume discretisations of these equations are set out within this thesis. Some comment is made about the solution methods used, and how boundary conditions are implemented. The Free-surface flow and Solidification governing relationships are also described as these are important for investigating the formation of freeze layers. The implementation of the refractory wear mechanisms are {{discussed in}} some detail. The three mechanisms implemented are for the penetration of slag into the refractory, the corrosion of the refractory by this penetrated slag; and the erosion of the refractory by the bulk flow of slag within the furnace. To be able to reasonably predict refractory wear, it is necessary to make the properties of the materials within the system temperature dependent. During the pilot plant trials at the HIsmelt® Research and Development facility, located in Kwinana Western Australia, accretions formed {{on the end of the}} solids injection lances. These accretions have been termed Elephant's Trunks. With the imminent construction of the Development Plant which injects the iron bearing feeds at an elevated temperature rather than at ambient temperatures used on the pilot plant, the formation of these pipe-like accretions under both the cold and hot injection conditions have been examined. This work provides confidence that the freeze layers predicted from the model will reflect those formed within the furnace. To evaluate the effectiveness of the refractory wear mechanisms, data from experimental and the HIsmelt pilot plant have been modelled. Sections of refractory samples from an induction furnace test and a rotary slag test have been modelled. The results are in agreement with the profile and affected regions of the sectioned refractory test pieces. A part of the HIsmelt pilot plant <b>Smelt</b> <b>Reduction</b> Vessel (SRV) has been modelled for the period of campaign 8 - 1 & 8 - 2 (just over 20 days). The predicted wear is in agreement with the measurements taken after the vessel had been cooled. To bring together freeze layer formation with the refractory wear mechanisms, a water-cooled element was modelled for the sloping slag section. The results show the growth of a small freeze layer that is consistent with the small freeze layer seen on the upper cooling panels of the pilot plant SRV. This model is an ideal tool to evaluate different water-cooling strategies for HIsmelt and other similar direct smelting processes. This work has developed models that predict the formation of freeze layers and refractory wear within direct smelting processes. The models have focused on slag-refractory interactions and further work would be needed to extend the refractory wear models to account for metal-refractory interactions. To examine spalling, stress calculations could be performed to determine when this may occur...|$|R
50|$|The HIsarna {{ironmaking}} {{process is}} a direct reduced iron process for iron making in which iron ore is processed almost directly into liquid iron or hot metal.

The process {{does not require the}} manufacturing of iron ore agglomerates such as pellets and sinter, nor the production of coke, which are necessary for the blast furnace process.

The geometry of this furnace causes a cyclone to form in the neck when the crushed iron ore is injected into this cyclone together with oxygen (so oxygen is injected at the top rather than at the bottom). The heat of the cyclone causes the initial (partial) reduction reaction to take place that reduces iron ore to iron.|$|E

40|$|Abstract–A popular {{model for}} ureilites assumes that during {{anatexis}} in an asteroidal mantle, pressure-buffered equilibrium <b>smelting</b> (partial <b>reduction</b> coincident with partial melting) engendered their conspicuous mafic-silicate-core mg diversity (75 – 96 mol%). Several mass-balance problems arise from this hypothesis. Smelting inevitably consumes {{a large proportion}} of any plausible initial carbon while generating significant proportions of Fe metal and copious proportions of CO gas. The most serious problem concerns the yield of CO gas. If equilibrium smelting produced the ureilites’ entire 21 mol % range in olivine-core mg, the proportion of gas within the asteroidal mantle (assuming plausibly low pressure <∼ 80 bar) should have reached ≥ 85 vol%. Based on the remarkably stepwise cooling history inferred from ureilite texture and mineralogy, a runaway, CO-leaky process that can loosely be termed smelting appears to have occurred, probably triggered by a major impact. The runaway scenario appears likely because, by Le Châtelier’s principle, CO leakage would tend to accelerate the smelting process. Also, the copious volumes of gas produced by smelting would have led to explosive, mass-leaky eruptions into the vacuum surrounding the asteroid. Loss of mass would mean diminution of interior pressure, which would induce further smelting, leading to further loss of mass (basalt), and so on. Such a disruptive runaway process may have engendered the ureilites’ distinctive reduced olivine rims. But the only smelting, according to this scenario, was a short-lived disequilibrium process that reduced only the olivine rims, not the cores; and the ureilites were cooling, not melting, during the abortive “smelting ” episode...|$|R

Under fully reducing conditions, both in liquid-state (cast iron) and solid-state bloomery <b>smelting</b> (direct <b>reduction)</b> processes, such rock ores would be predicted to produce phosphoric iron, and bog iron ores even more so. Ore-metal-slag phosphorus ratios for bloomery iron are derived here, by means of: laboratory experiments; full-scale experimental bloomery smelting; and analysis of remains from three Medieval and two Late Roman-Iron Age iron production sites in England and the Netherlands. Archaeological ore, slag, metal residues (gromps), and iron artefacts were analysed by metallography, SEM-EDS, EPMA, and XRD. The effects of forging and carburising on phosphoric iron were studied by experiment and artefact analysis.
