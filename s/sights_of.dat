5|$|Graham Arthur Chapman {{was born}} on 8 January 1941 at the Stoneygate Nursing Home, Stoneygate, Leicester, the son of {{policeman}} Walter Chapman and Edith Towers. He had an elder brother, John, {{who was born in}} 1936. One of Chapman's earliest memories was seeing the remains of Polish airmen who had suffered an aeroplane accident near Leicester, later saying the horrific <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> this remained in his memory.|$|E

5|$|Herb Hunter {{arranged}} {{for a group of}} All-Stars, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Earl Averill, Charlie Gehringer, Jimmie Foxx and Lefty Gomez, to tour Japan playing exhibitions against a Japanese all-star team. Despite the fact that Berg was a mediocre, third-string catcher, he was invited at the last minute to make the trip. Among the items Berg took with him to Japan were a 16-mm Bell & Howell movie camera and a letter from MovietoneNews, a New York City newsreel production company with which Berg had contracted to film the <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> his trip. When the team arrived in Japan, he gave a welcome speech in Japanese and also addressed the legislature.|$|E
5|$|In February 1834, Etty became seriously ill, and was {{incapacitated}} {{for four}} months. Unable to paint, he exhibited only two already-completed {{paintings in the}} 1834 Summer Exhibition, Elizabeth Potts and The Cardinal. In June of that year he left London to convalesce, renting a cottage in York. Weak and unable to concentrate, Etty painted very little, and spend {{the next few months}} visiting friends and touring the <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> Yorkshire. Gradually regaining his health, he returned to London in December 1834, and resumed work on those paintings he had left incomplete on the onset of his illness.|$|E
5|$|The Tower of London {{has become}} {{established}} {{as one of}} the most popular tourist attractions in the country. It has been a tourist attraction since at least the Elizabethan period, when it w{{as one of the}} <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> London that foreign visitors wrote about. Its most popular attractions were the Royal Menagerie and displays of armour. The Crown Jewels also garner much interest, and have been on public display since 1669. The Tower steadily gained popularity with tourists through the 19thcentury, despite the opposition of the Duke of Wellington to visitors. Numbers became so high that by 1851 a purpose-built ticket office was erected. By the end of the century, over 500,000 were visiting the castle every year.|$|E

5|$|In the December 11, 1892 Sunday paper, Dunne wrote another dialect column, {{this time}} {{set in the}} upscale Dearborn Street saloon of Colonel Malachi McNeary (in all columns but the first spelled McNeery). That barkeeper was based on James McGarry, owner of a saloon near Chicago's {{newspaper}} district; Dunne and other journalists would drink there and write their stories. Beginning in the second McNeery column, the listener for his monologues is Johnny McKenna, a real-life figure, who was a Republican in a mostly Democratic Irish community, and who often received government jobs as a token of bipartisanship. The World's Columbian Exposition was the major event of 1893 in Chicago, and McNeery {{was used as a}} mouthpiece for Dunne's commentary on the events and <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> the fair. For example, McNeery views a meeting of the fair's Board of Lady Managers, chaired by Bertha Palmer, who in the column proves incapable of stopping an argument between the members.|$|E
5|$|The party spent a {{total of}} 11days {{traversing}} the North China Plain via the Grand Canal before reaching Tongzhou District, {{where there was a}} large warehouse depot adjunct to the capital city. From there they left their courier ships and traveled by donkey and foot towards the capital Beijing, where they lodged at the Central Courier Hostel. The Ming court granted the Korean party gifts of fine clothes during their stay. On June 3, the officer in charge of Choe's escort notified the transport office in Beijing that three carriages plus horses and donkeys would be needed in the journey to the Korean border; when these were granted in the morning, the party swiftly departed from Beijing. Choe was not sad to leave the <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> Beijing behind, as he found the people there to be obsessed with business and cared little for agriculture or farming, a clear indication of his Confucian-oriented values.|$|E

25|$|This {{political}} activism placed Grottkau in the <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> the German police. Faced with arrest {{by the authorities}} under the Anti-Socialist Laws, Grottkau emigrated to the United States of America in 1878.

25|$|The Baroque {{library is}} the most {{spectacular}} part of the monastic buildings {{and one of the}} main <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> the Oberschwäbische Barockstraße. The room is extremely light. The locked bookcases are arranged in two storeys. The ornamentation is among the richest of the 18th century in the German-speaking world. The ceiling fresco completed by Franz Georg Hermann in 1757 shows in bewildering detail the workings of divine wisdom in apocalypse, scholarship, education and craft.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of reactive and active armours on combat vehicles of the then Warsaw Pact countries started a {{development in the}} technology of the capability of the warheads, the effective range and the optical <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> anti-tank recoilless rifles were therefore improved substantially. Despite these technological improvements, the primary role of the recoilless firing system as the most effective weapon against armoured tanks — at a distance up to 600 metres — remained the most important to infantrymen until the late 1990s.|$|E

25|$|The {{justification}} for razing the West End {{has also been}} called into question. Some say that, {{as one of the}} neighborhoods that supported the former mayor, it was in the political <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> the Hynes administration. The entire net cost of the project was $15.8 million, not including the additional loss of tax dollars for the years that the West End was vacant. It is uncertain as to whether the increased tax revenue would ever be enough to justify the costs.|$|E
25|$|By 1800, Hokusai {{was further}} {{developing}} {{his use of}} ukiyo-e for purposes other than portraiture. He had also adopted the name he would most widely be known by, Katsushika Hokusai, the former name referring to the part of Edo {{where he was born}} and the latter meaning, 'north studio'. That year, he published two collections of landscapes, Famous <b>Sights</b> <b>of</b> the Eastern Capital and Eight Views of Edo.
