50|$|<b>Special</b> <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (Special VFR, SVFR) are {{a set of}} {{aviation}} regulations under which a pilot may operate an aircraft. It's a special case of operating under visual flight rules (VFR).|$|E
50|$|For {{most private}} pilots, the most {{significant}} value of flying under IFR {{is the ability to}} fly in instrument meteorological conditions (such as inside clouds). Additionally, all flights operating in Class A airspace, defined in the US as the airspace from 18,000 MSL up to FL 600 (roughly 60,000 feet), must be conducted under IFR. In the United States, an instrument rating is required when operating under <b>special</b> <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (SVFR) at night.|$|E
