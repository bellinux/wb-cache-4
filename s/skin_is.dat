5|$|A frog's <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Apples {{are often}} eaten raw. The whole fruit {{including}} the <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> suitable {{for human consumption}} except for the seeds, which may affect some consumers. The core is often not eaten and is discarded. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples.|$|E
5|$|If other {{interventions}} have failed, several {{operations have}} been reported to provide benefit. One is septal dermoplasty or Saunders' procedure, in which <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> transplanted into the nostrils, and the other is Young's procedure, in which the nostrils are sealed off completely.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the smooth skin of most large whales, its back <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> usually wrinkly and has been likened to a prune by whale-watching enthusiasts. Albinos have been reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{sperm whale}} {{characteristically}} has a large, squarish head one-third {{the length of}} its body; the blowhole is slightly to the left hand side; the <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> usually wrinkled; and it has no teeth on the upper jaw.|$|E
5|$|The toxic {{properties}} of parsnip extracts {{are resistant to}} heating, or a storage period of several months. Toxic symptoms can also affect livestock and poultry in parts of their bodies where their <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> exposed. Polyynes {{can be found in}} Apiaceae vegetables such as parsnip, and they show cytotoxic activities.|$|E

30|$|To prepare swollen-skin, the pretreated <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> {{soaked in}} 0.1  M phosphoric acid with a skin/solution ratio of 1 : 10 (w/v) for 6  h {{with a gentle}} {{stirring}} at room temperature as per the method of Kaewruang et al. (2013). The acidic solution was changed every 3  h. Acid-treated <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> washed thoroughly with tap water until wash water became neutral or faintly acidic. To prepare autolysed skin, the swollen <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> mixed with deionised water {{at a ratio of}} 1 : 5 (w/v) and subjected to autolysis as previously described. Autolysed <b>skin</b> obtained <b>was</b> referred to as ‘SS’.|$|R
50|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that fair <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> {{a characteristic of}} the cloistered binukot, who were often kept indoors from a very early age. In historical epics of the Philippines their fair <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> presented as a standard of beauty among the upper class.|$|R
5|$|A green tinge in the <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} {{associated with}} nausea and sickness. The expression 'green at the gills' means appearing sick. The color, {{when combined with}} gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In some Far East cultures the color green {{is used as a}} symbol of sickness or nausea.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, the <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> poisonous. The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E
5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E
25|$|When rosé wine is {{the primary}} product, it is {{produced}} with the skin contact method. Black-skinned grapes are crushed and the <b>skins</b> <b>are</b> allowed to remain {{in contact with the}} juice for a short period, typically one to three days. The must is then pressed, and the <b>skins</b> <b>are</b> discarded rather than left in contact throughout fermentation (as with red wine making). The longer that the <b>skins</b> <b>are</b> left in contact with the juice, the more intense the color of the final wine.|$|R

5|$|Complications of {{smallpox}} arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia. Respiratory complications tend to develop {{on about the}} eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin. Secondary bacterial infection of the <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> a relatively uncommon complication {{of smallpox}}. When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated.|$|E
5|$|Enlargement of the spleen {{may occur}} in AML, {{but it is}} {{typically}} mild and asymptomatic. Lymph node swelling is rare in AML, in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> involved about 10% {{of the time in}} the form of leukemia cutis. Rarely, Sweet's syndrome, a paraneoplastic inflammation of the skin, can occur with AML.|$|E
5|$|Krishna is {{represented}} in the Indian traditions in many ways, but with some common features. His iconography typically depicts him with black, dark, or blue skin, like Vishnu. However, ancient and medieval reliefs and stone-based arts depict him in the natural color of the material out {{of which he is}} formed, both in India and in southeast Asia. In some texts, his <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> poetically described as the color of Jambul (Jamun, a purple-colored fruit).|$|E

5000|$|In 1974, {{a four-year-old}} tomcat with fragile <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> taken to Cornell University's New York State Veterinary College Small Animal Clinic for investigation. Dr DV Scott noted that its <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> {{exceptionally}} thin and velvety in texture. It was hyperextensible (extremely stretchy) {{and had a}} criss-cross network of fine white scars from previously healed tears. When fur was clipped from a foreleg to gain a blood sample, the skin peeled away. Peeling was found to occur whenever the slightest pressure was applied anywhere to the cat's skin. Investigation showed that the collagen fibres in the cat's <b>skin</b> <b>were</b> abnormal.|$|R
5|$|Melanins are {{a family}} of dark-pigmented {{substances}} found {{in a wide range}} of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase. The melanin that darkens human <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there is substantial evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|Monk seals have {{a slender}} body and are agile. They have a broad, flat snout with {{nostrils}} on the top. Monk seals are polygynous, and group together in harems. They feed mainly on bony fish and cephalopods, {{but they are}} opportunistic. The <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> covered in small hair, which are generally black in males and brown or dark gray in females. Monk seals {{are found in the}} Hawaiian archipelago, certain areas in the Mediterranean sea (such as Cabo Blanco and Gyaros island), and formerly in the tropical areas of the west Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through {{the top of their}} skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> thick and scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.|$|E

5|$|Moulting {{serves a}} number of {{functions}} – firstly, the old and worn <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> replaced, secondly, it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks. Renewal of the skin by moulting is supposed to allow growth in some animals such as insects, however this view has been disputed {{in the case of}} snakes.|$|E
5|$|Nantes carrots. These have sparse foliage, are cylindrical, short {{with a more}} blunt tip than Imperator types, and attain high yields in a {{range of}} conditions.
