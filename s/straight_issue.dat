It was a plain, <b>straight</b> <b>issue</b> {{of the strong}} man humbling himself--not too much of course, but sufficiently: and it called, in his opinion, for the low voice, the clenched hand, and the broken whisper. Speaking as he had spoken, he had given the scene the right key from the start--or would have done {{if she had not}} got in ahead of him and opened it on a note of absurd cheeriness? Derek found himself resenting her cheeriness. Often as he had attempted during the voyage from England to visualize to himself this first meeting, he had never pictured Jill smiling brightly at him. It was a jolly smile, and made her look extremely pretty, but it jarred upon him. A moment before he had been half relieved, half disconcerted: now he was definitely disconcerted. He searched in his mind for a criticism of her attitude, and {{came to the conclusion that}} what was wrong with it was that it was too friendly. Friendliness is well enough in its way, but in what should have been a tense clashing of strong emotions it did not seem to Derek fitting.|$|E

Yet this hybrid security's issuance costs and offer yields {{have not been}} previously examined in a systematic manner. We analyze a sample of 3, 042 U.

She was the most frequently-appearing cover artist on Weird Tales during her stint with the magazine.

From 1936 through 1938, Brundage often alternated with others as cover artist; Virgil Finlay was her chief competitor.|$|R

This feature is important because there have been no studies of the information content of private debt issues, while private debt is substantially more prevalent than public debt. We find no abnormal returns following <b>straight</b> debt <b>issues.</b> However, convertible debt issuers under-perform the market on the order of 50 to 70 percent in the following five years.

40|$|We {{report the}} average costs of raising {{external}} debt and equity capital for U. S. corporations from 1990 to 1994. For {{initial public offerings}} (IPOs) of equity, the direct costs average 11. 0 percent of the proceeds. For seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), the direct costs average 7. 1 percent. For convertible bonds, the direct costs average 3. 8 percent. For <b>straight</b> debt <b>issues,</b> the direct costs average 2. 2 percent, although they are strongly related to the credit rating of the issue. All classes of securities exhibit economies of scale, although they are less pronounced for <b>straight</b> debt <b>issues.</b> IPOs also incur a substantial indirect cost due to short-run underpricing. Most large equity offers include an international tranche, although debt issues do not. I. introduction In this article we present the average costs of raising external capital for US. corporations from 1990 to 1994. Specifically, we report the average spreads on public equity offerings and debt offerings, {{along with the other}} direct costs of raising capital, {{as a percentage of the}} proceeds. We find substantial economies of scale for initial public offerings (IPOs) of equity and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). We also find substantial economies of scale for both straight bond offerings and convertible bond offerings. Spreads on bond offerings are highly sensitive to the credit rating of the offering. This article is descriptive in nature; no theories are tested. Its purpose is to provide benchmark numbers for use by issuers of securities. We do not address why firms issue the securities they do.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} whether there is any mispricing of publicly <b>issued</b> <b>straight</b> corporate bonds in Japan, and to determine what factors explain variations in the degree of mispricing. While there is an extremely large literature devoted to investigating the extent of mispricing of initial public offerings (IPOs) of equity in both the United States, and Japan, there appear to be very few studies examining the extent of mispricing of IPOs of straight corporate bonds in the United States and Japan. The key study for the United States is Datta et al. (1997) who find that IPOs of speculative grade ("junk") bonds are underpriced, but those rated investment grade are overpriced. Two later studies for the United States report underpricing rather than overpricing (see Helwege and Kleiman (1998) and Cai et al. (2007)). For Japan, Matsui (2000, 2006) finds that IPO and seasoned issues when analyzed together exhibit significant overpricing too. In this paper, using data on initial (IPO) and seasoned issues of publicly <b>issued</b> <b>straight</b> bonds over the ten year period between March 1992 and March 2002, evidence is presented that suggests the existence of significant mispricing, in particular, overpricing, of these bonds. This overpricing has several features: it does not appear decline overtime; on average, it increases as the rating of the bond issued falls, it is smaller for IPO issues; and it is influenced by the degree of competition among lead underwriters.

In {{the face of a}} growing bond market, some corporate bond issues arranged by these property developers have been successful. Apart from investment appetite, property developers have to gauge carefully {{the pros and cons of}} raising funds through bond issues. Successful bond issues need to be structured with suitable credit enhancement features since the perception of risk and rising interest rates are major deterrents to potential investors who would otherwise face bond defaults or bear high opportunity costs with the committed funds.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the costs and}} determinants of international capital raising for a sample of 427 <b>straight</b> public debt <b>issues</b> made by non-U. S. firms in the U. S. (Yankee) and Eurodollar markets. We model the joint determination of market choice and interest costs using a switching regression model with endogenous switching. We find that firms issue bonds in the highly regulated U. S. market when the estimated interest cost is low relative to the Eurodollar market. Firms issuing Yankee bonds {{are more likely to}} be located in countries that require transparent accounting standards, protect creditor rights, and have strong traditions of law and order. Further, we find that investors are willing to pay higher prices for Yankee bonds issued by firms that have previously met U. S. registration and reporting requirements.
