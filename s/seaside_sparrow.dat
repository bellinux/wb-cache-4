5|$|Two {{species of}} birds in the park {{are in danger of}} disappearing. The range of the Cape Sable <b>seaside</b> <b>sparrow</b> is {{restricted}} to Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress Swamp. In 1981 6,656 Cape Sable seaside sparrows were reported in park boundaries, but surveys over 10 years documented a decline to an estimated 2,624 birds by 2002. Attempts to return natural levels of water to the park have been controversial; Cape Sable seaside sparrows nest about a foot off the ground, and rising water levels may harm future populations, as well as threaten the endangered snail kite. The Everglades snail kite eats apple snails almost exclusively, and the Everglades is the only location in the United States where this bird of prey exists. There is some evidence that the population may be increasing, but loss of habitat and food sources keep the estimated number of these birds at several hundred.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Seaside</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Ammodramus maritimus) nest at varying {{population}} densities, {{and breeding}} pairs may occupy either large, all-purpose activity spaces or small nesting territories, foraging in undefended areas {{separate from the}} nest site. We determined the prevalence of extra-pair paternity in a large, socially monogamous population of <b>Seaside</b> <b>Sparrows</b> nesting in small, overlapping territories. We used six microsatellite DNA markers and a likelihood-based approach to paternity assignment. Five of 47 chicks (11 %) in three of 18 broods (17 %) in this population were sired by extra-pair males. Although {{this is the first}} study of the genetic mating system in the genus Ammodramus, the rate of extra-pair paternity we observed is lower than in most other New World emberizines. As the first measurment of extra-pair paternity in <b>Seaside</b> <b>Sparrows,</b> this study provides a baseline for comparative studies of how extra-pair paternity is influenced by the wide variation in nesting density and territoriality found in <b>Seaside</b> <b>Sparrows.</b> These results, from a socially monogamous sparrow may also provide a context for studies of unusual mating systems in other salt-marsh nesting birds.

40|$|Background: Nelson’s, Saltmarsh, and <b>Seaside</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Ammodramus nelsoni, A. caudacutus, and A. maritimus, respectively) {{depend on}} marsh and wetland {{habitats}} – ecosystems in which mercury (Hg) bioavailability is notoriously high. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to address the potential impact of Hg on these species using first primary and breast feathers as non-destructive biomonitoring tools. Methods and Principal Findings: Feathers were sampled from wintering sparrows in North Carolina salt marshes (2006 – 2010). Feather Hg data were used in three risk analysis components (1) Threshold Component – examined feather Hg with regard to published negative effects thresholds; (2) Hg Dynamics Component – examined Hg in sparrows captured multiple times; and (3) Capture Frequency and Survival Component – tested for links between Hg and return frequency and survival. Threshold Component analyses indicated that Hg concentrations in 42 – 77 % of sampled individuals (breast feather n = 879; first primary feather n = 663) were within the range associated with decreased reproduction in other avian species. Hg Dynamics Component analyses demonstrated that Hg increased between first and second captures for Nelson’s (n = 9) and <b>Seaside</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (n = 23). Capture Frequency and Survival Component analyses detected a negative relationship between Hg and capture frequency in Nelson’s Sparrows (n = 315).

50|$|Cape Sable, Florida, is {{the southernmost}} {{point of the}} US {{mainland}} and mainland Florida.

The cape is a peninsula issuing from the southeastern part of the Florida mainland, running west and curving around to the north, reaching Ponce de Leon Bay, {{at the mouth of the}} Shark River. It forms the southern and western margins of Whitewater Bay. There are three prominent points on the cape, East Cape, which is the actual southernmost point of the Florida and United States mainland and the location of Lake Ingraham, the southernmost lake in the United States of America, Middle Cape, also known as Palm Point, and Northwest Cape.

40|$|<b>Seaside</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Ammodramus maritimus) {{along the}} Gulf of Mexico are {{currently}} recognized as four subspecies, including taxa in Florida (A. m. juncicola and A. m. peninsulae) and southern Texas (Ammodramus m. sennetti), plus a widespread taxon between them (A. m. fisheri). We examined population genetic structure of this "Gulf Coast" clade using microsatellite and mtDNA data. Results of Bayesian analyses (Structure, GeneLand) of microsatellite data from nine locations do not entirely align with current subspecific taxonomy. Ammodramus m. sennetti from southern Texas is significantly differentiated {{from all other}} populations, but we found evidence of an admixture zone with A. m. fisheri near Corpus Christi. The two subspecies along the northern Gulf Coast of Florida are significantly differentiated from both A. m. sennetti and A. m. fisheri, but are not distinct from each other.

40|$|I {{investigated}} ways {{in which}} events and processes within the annual cycle of migratory birds differ between the sexes of individual species, and between two closely-related species with different breeding systems. Specifically, I compared male and female Saltmarsh Sparrows (Ammodramus caudacutus), which are highly promiscuous, non-territorial, and have female-only care, and <b>Seaside</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (A. maritimus), which are socially monogamous, territorial, and have bi-parental care, to investigate how differential life histories influence: 1) the timing of migration and molt events; 2) feather quality and condition throughout the year; 3) within-season body condition and survival during summer and winter; and 4) migration patterns. The most significant conclusions were: 1) early male arrival to the breeding grounds may occur for different reasons in different species; 2) reproductive investment can delay pre-basic molt and migratory departure and reduce molt rate; 3) most feather damage occurs in the breeding season and can be influenced by a bird’s reproductive status and investment; 4) reproductive investment can lead to poor body condition that carries over into the winter, but condition differences do not necessarily translate into survival differences; 5) early male arrival may not correspond with sex-based latitudinal segregation on the wintering grounds, and 6) extensive banding efforts imply low connectivity between breeding and wintering sites in Saltmarsh Sparrows. Together, {{these results suggest that}} breeding strategies influence the performance of individuals throughout the annual cycle, and, while parental care can be costly, indirect forms of reproductive investment are costly too...|$|R
40|$|The year 2009 {{marked the}} 110 th {{anniversary of the}} first colored {{reproduction}} of a Fuertes painting; a watercolor of two <b>seaside</b> <b>sparrows</b> published in The Auk, when Fuertes was about 25 years old. Although Fuertes 2 ̆ 7 life spanned {{little more than a}} half-century, and most living ornithologists were born after his tragic 1927 death, his influence on natural history art has not lessened. This manuscript is a testimony to his enduring artistic legacy. I first looked in awe at the original set of Fuertes paintings in the summer of 1995, during a visit to the Field Museum in conjunction with my research on North American hummingbirds and avian brood parasites. Like many other lovers of fine bird art, I had marveled at the Field Museum 2 ̆ 7 s 1932 album of Abyssinian plates, but the sight of all the additional, and especially the original, images was overwhelming. I inquired at the time about plans for possible publication of the entire collection, and was told that this was under consideration. Next, I was shown the Museum 2 ̆ 7 s set of baby bird portraits by George Sutton, and I immediately broached the possibility of publishing these in book form. That query met with favorable response from Benjamin W. Williams, Special Collections Librarian. This project flourished and during the spring of 1998 resulted in the publication of Baby Bird Portraits by George Miksch Sutton: Watercolors in the Field Museum. As soon as this book appeared I began wistfully thinking again of the Fuertes plates. Then, in the summer of 1998 I made a formal suggestion to Mr. Williams that we consider producing a book containing all the bird paintings and their associated pencil sketches, with the text by me, and the hope that perhaps publication and descriptions of the mammal plates could be taken up by someone more qualified than I. I followed this up in September with a proposed outline for the book, and some preliminary text. I also visited the Field Museum during November, 1998, to examine the paintings and drawings closely, measure them, and discuss possible publication plans. At that time Mr. Williams and I agreed that the mammal plates needed inclusion, since there were too few to warrant a separate publication. I reviewed all the Fuertes drawings and watercolors, and photographed them for personal reference. I also selected out some preliminary pencil sketches and anatomical studies, and a few small watercolors of plant material that seemed too incomplete and data-deficient to warrant inclusion. The text length for each species description {{is directly related to the}} number of plates done by Fuertes (roughly 300 word per plate). One problem in dealing with these plates is the fact that many of the English vernacular names, as well as the Latin names, associated with the species Fuertes illustrated have undergone changes since 1926, and produced to some problems in identification. There were also a few cases of inaccurate identification of the species illustrated. Thus, two appendices have been provided, respectively organized by original Latin names and by original vernacular names, to try deal with these confusing anomalies between my text and the names shown on the plates themselves or used in various publications. Avian taxonomy in this book follows Fry, Keith 2 ̆ 6 Urban (1982 - 2004). Mammal taxonomy follows Kingdom (1997). There seems to be little agreement as to the proper spelling of Ethiopian place names, and I have modified some of those that were used by Fuertes and Osgood (1936) to conform with currently used spellings. This review could not have been written without the complete support of the Field Museum of Natural History, and especially its Special Collections Librarian, Benjamin Williams. After Mr. Williams left the Museum, the manuscript lay fallow for several years and I directed my attention toward other projects. Then, in May of 2008, Elizabeth Babcock encountered a copy of my manuscript among older Museum files. She soon contacted me, and brought the project back to my attention. Later I contacted Dr. Paul Royster, Scholarly Communication director. University of Nebraska-Lincoln, about making the manuscript available on-line through the University 2 ̆ 7 s digital library ([URL] In preparing this book I have received assistance from several people. Ms. Linda Brown helped in the indexing and photographing of the plates, and provided a great deal of constructive advice and encouragement on my text. Advice on the identification of the unidentified insect painted by Fuertes was offered by Dr. Brett Ratcliffe of the Nebraska State Museum...|$|R
