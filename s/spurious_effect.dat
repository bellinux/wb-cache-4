The inference appears to be that there is some subtle connection between immorality and art, as if the handling of the lewd, or the depicting of it, were in some sort the hallmark of the true artist. It is not difficult to handle or depict. On the contrary, it is so easy, and so essentially dramatic in many of its forms, that the temptation to employ it is ever present. It is the easiest and cheapest of all methods of creating a <b>spurious</b> <b>effect.</b> The difficulty does not lie in doing it. The difficulty lies in avoiding it. But one tries to avoid it because {{on the face of it}} there is no reason why a writer should cease to be a gentleman, or that he should write for a woman's eyes that which he would be justly knocked down for having said in a woman's ears. But [...] "you must draw the world as it is." [...] Why must you? Surely it is just in selection and restraint that the artist is shown. It is true that in a coarser age great writers heeded no restrictions, but life itself had fewer restrictions then. We are of our own age, and must live up to it.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} risk {{is central to}} {{strategy}} research and practice. Yet, the expected positive association between risk and return, familiar from financial markets, is elusive. Measuring risk as the variance {{of a series of}} accounting-based returns, Bowman obtained the puzzling result of a negative association between risk and mean return. This finding, known as the Bowman paradox, has spawned a remarkable number of publications, and various explanations have been suggested. The present paper contributes to this literature by showing that skewness of individual firms’ return distributions has a considerable <b>spurious</b> <b>effect</b> on the mean-variance relationship. I devise a method to disentangle true and spurious effects, illustrate it using simulations, and apply it to empirical data. It turns out that the size of the <b>spurious</b> <b>effect</b> is such that, on average, it explains the larger part of the observed negative relationship. My results might thus help to reconcile mean-variance approaches to risk-return analysis with other, ex-ante, approaches. In concluding, I show that the analysis of skewness is linked to all three streams of literature devoted to explaining the Bowman paradox. mean-variance; risk; risk-return paradox; skewness...|$|E

40|$|We report {{experimental}} {{results on the}} decay of wave turbulence in an elastic plate obtained by stopping the forcing from a stationary turbulent state. In the stationary case, the forcing is seen to induce some anisotropy and a spectrum in disagreement with the weak turbulence theory. After stopping the forcing, almost perfect isotropy is restored. The decay of energy is self similar and the observed decaying spectrum is in better agreement with the prediction of the weak turbulence theory. The dissipative part of the spectrum is partially consistent with the theoretical prediction based on previous work by Kolmakov. This suggest that the non agreement with the weak turbulence theory is mostly due to a <b>spurious</b> <b>effect</b> of the forcing related to the finite size of the system.
