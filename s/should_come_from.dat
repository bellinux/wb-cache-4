This made her unpopular; she could easily afford the payments herself. She {{was surprised by the}} grief she felt following the death of her eldest living daughter in 1733. Sarah lived to see her enemy Robert Walpole fall in 1742, and in the same year attempted to improve her reputation by approving a biographical publication titled An Account of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough from her first coming to Court to the year 1710. She died of old age, at the age of eighty-four, on 18 October 1744, at Marlborough House; she was buried at Blenheim. Her husband’s body was exhumed from Westminster Abbey and buried beside her.|$|E

Reid suggested the appointment of one of four Republican Senators, none of whom possessed previous judicial experience: Mel Martinez of Florida, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Mike Crapo of Idaho and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

25|$|The outlay of the {{buildings}} is three stories on Balcarce Street and four storys plus a basement/galleries of Government House Museum, on Avenida Paseo Colón, practically covering the footage of a whole bloc. All the original rooms {{that are on the}} three main façades have direct ventilation and lighting, while the original internal rooms were designed {{in such a way that}} ventilation and light <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the loggia that surround internal patios designed for this purpose. All, except one, were crowned by skylights, of which only two remain. The original structure consists of packwalls of varying thickness and slabs supported by brick counter ceilings with steel or wood roof lines, according to the sector. Following a long process of construction the current building was officially inaugurated in 1898, during the second presidency of General Julio Roca.|$|E
25|$|In Switzerland, Schur's colleagues Heinz Hopf and George Pólya were {{informed}} of the dismissal of Issai Schur in 1935. They tried to help as best they could. On behalf of the Mathematical Seminars chief Michel Plancherel, on December 12, 1935 the school board president Arthur Rohn invited Isay Schur to une série de conférences sur la théorie de la représentation des groupes finis. At {{the same time he}} asked that the formal invitation <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> President Rohn, comme le prof.

George Pólya arranged from this invitation of the Mathematical Seminars the Conference of the Department of Mathematics and Physics on December 16. Meanwhile, on 14 December the official invitation letter from President Rohn had already been dispatched to Issai Schur. Schur was promised for his guest lecture a fee of CHF 500.|$|E
25|$|In late April 1898, Congress {{passed a}} {{resolution}} declaring that {{a state of war}} had existed since April 21, 1898, between the United States and Spain. Although the Spanish–American War was short, its financing needs resulted in a federal budget deficit. In the landmark case of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Co. the Supreme Court had nullified the income tax of 1894. Many in Congress felt that tariff increases could create too much disturbance with industry. As a result, the leaders in Congress felt that the revenues required for military expenditures either <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> increases in existing domestic taxes or supplements of new taxes of the same type. Thus, in the War Revenue Act of 1898, an excise tax on telephone service was introduced {{for the first time in}} 1898. The tax was repealed in 1902, at the end of the Spanish-American related Philippine-American War.|$|E

25|$|There {{were some}} jurists who thought rulings derived through analogy could {{contradict}} a ruling {{derived from the}} Qur'an and the authentic hadith. However, Ibn Taymiyyah disagreed because he thought a contradiction between the definitive canonical texts of Islam, and definitive reason was impossible {{and that this was}} also the understanding of the salaf. Racha el-Omari says that on an epistemological level, Ibn Taymiyyah considered the Salaf to be better than any other later scholars in understanding the agreement between revelation and reason. One example for this is the use of analogy in the Islamic legal principle of maslaha (public good) about which Ibn Taymiyya believed, if there were to be any contradiction to revelation then it is due to a misunderstanding or misapplication of the concept of utility. He said that to assess the utility of something, the criteria for benefit and harm <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the Qur'an and sunnah, a criteria which he also applied to the establishment of a correct analogy.|$|E
25|$|By abandoning English constitutionalism and {{creating}} a new republic based {{on the rights of}} the individual, the North Americans introduced a new force in the world. Ideas spread most rapidly when they have found adequate concrete expression. Thus republicanism entered our Romanic/Germanic world.... Up to this point, the conviction had prevailed in Europe that monarchy best served the interests of the nation. Now the idea spread that the nation should govern itself. But only after a state had actually been formed on the basis of the theory of representation did the full significance of this idea become clear. All later revolutionary movements have this same goal.... This was the complete reversal of a principle. Until then, a king who ruled by the grace of God had been the center around which everything turned. Now the idea emerged that power <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> below.... These two principles are like two opposite poles, and it is the conflict between them that determines the course of the modern world. In Europe the conflict between them had not yet taken on concrete form; with the French Revolution it did.|$|E

500|$|The ambassadors {{of the six}} Great Powers {{decided to}} {{constitute}} the Principality of Albania on July 29, 1913 during the [...] 54th meeting of the London Conference. The new country needed a sovereign, borders, government and military police force. To ensure the gendarmerie's neutrality, the Powers decided that its members <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a different country. Their first choice was Sweden, but that country was already busy with a similar mission in Persia, they chose the Netherlands for its neutrality, lack of direct interest in Albania and extensive colonial experience in the Dutch East Indies. On October 15, 1913 they established the International Commission of Control to administer the country until its own political institutions were established.

500|$|It {{was during}} this time, {{the heyday of the}} French Revolution, that Barbauld {{published}} her most radical political pieces. From 1787 to 1790, Charles James Fox attempted to convince the House of Commons to pass a law granting Dissenters full citizenship rights. When this bill was defeated for the third time, Barbauld wrote one of her most passionate pamphlets, An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts. Readers were shocked to discover that such a well-reasoned argument <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a woman. In 1791, after William Wilberforce's attempt to outlaw the slave trade failed, Barbauld published her Epistle to William Wilberforce Esq. On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade, which not only lamented the fate of the slaves, but also warned of the cultural and social degeneration the British could expect if they did not abandon slavery. In 1792, she continued this theme of national responsibility in an anti-war sermon entitled Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation which argued that each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation: [...] "We are called upon to repent of national sins, because we can help them, and because we ought to help them." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Crepes of Wrath" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons for which George Meyer was {{credited}} as a writer, and he wrote it together with Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. The episode {{was inspired by the}} French movie Manon of the Spring. The writers were trying to figure out which country the foreign exchange student <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> when they came up with Albania. They had not seen many uses of the country on television and decided to make the episode a tribute to actor John Belushi, who has Albanian roots. The writers did not know much about the country and could not think of a good name for the boy so they gave him the surname Hoxha after the former leader of Albania, Enver Hoxha. They used real Albanian in the scene where Adil says goodbye to his family, and they tried to get the actual language right at Sam Simon's instigation. They also used real French in the scenes of Bart in France. The writers did some research on a certain airport in France for the shots of Bart at the airport in Paris. Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes Skinner, made her first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode, although her voice was a bit different from what the viewers are used to in the later episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the elected}} UFA members espoused radical {{political}} doctrines calculated {{to transform the}} provincial government. Brownlee quickly became identified with the caucus's conservative faction. At the caucus meeting that approved his appointment, he {{put an end to}} discussion of whether nominations for justices of the peace <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> UFA locals or its central political committee by asserting that they would continue to be handled by the office of the Attorney-General. [...] Later, many UFA MLAs argued that only motions explicitly declaring a lack of confidence in the government should be treated as motions of non-confidence. [...] They were concerned that supporters of the government who nonetheless disagreed with it on a specific issue might be pressured to refrain from voting their consciences on motions, such as money bills, that were conventionally considered tests of the government's confidence. [...] Brownlee warned these MLAs that regardless of their beliefs, the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta was free to request the government's resignation any time he considered that it lacked or did not merit the legislature's confidence. [...] Despite this warning, UFA MLAs John Russell Love and Alex Moore proposed a resolution in the legislature changing the convention. The proposal attracted notice from across Canada; R. B. Bennett advised Brownlee, his former clerk, to warn Moore and Love that it was unconstitutional and demand that they withdraw it. Brownlee was reluctant to do so, since a similar proposal {{had been part of the}} UFA's election platform, and instead moved successful amendments weakening the motion to a vague [...] "statement of intent".|$|E
