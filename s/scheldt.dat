5|$|After {{two weeks}} {{out of the}} line, the {{division}} attacked the Hindenburg Line itself on 29 September, easily achieving its objectives and capturing 1,000 prisoners. With the New Zealanders on the St. Quentin Canal and the adjacent <b>Scheldt</b> River, a platoon had managed to cross it and reach the village of Crèvecœur. However, it became pinned down until the 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions of the 1st Brigade managed to cross {{the next day and}} capture the village. Private James Crichton, a member of the trapped platoon, earned the VC, the last of the war for the New Zealand Division, for his efforts in relaying messages between his companions and his company commander. He also defused demolition charges on the bridge spanning the <b>Scheldt</b> River.|$|E
5|$|Aigle {{was part}} of a large expeditionary force in the summer 1809. Comprising more than 600 vessels and nearly 40,000 troops, it left The Downs on 28 July, intent on {{destroying}} the dock-yards and arsenals at Antwerp, Terneuse and Flushing, and capturing the French fleet stationed in the river <b>Scheldt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the Belgian White Brigade, the 11th Armoured Division, and {{elements}} of the British 3rd Infantry Division had entered Antwerp as early as 6September, taking the city and docks, a strategic oversight meant that the nearby bridges over the Albert Canal were not seized, leaving the Germans {{in control of the}} <b>Scheldt</b> estuary. The failure to make an immediate push on the estuary ensured the strategically vital port would remain useless until the <b>Scheldt</b> was cleared. Strong formations of the German Fifteenth Army, which had withdrawn from the Pas de Calais, were able to consolidate their positions on the islands of South Beveland and Walcheren, as well as the Albert Canal directly northwest of Antwerp, and were further reinforced by elements of General Kurt Student's First Parachute Army.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, {{the troop}} {{was sent to}} Yugoslavia, where it raided {{numerous}} Dalmatian islands held by the Germans. In the Autumn of 1944, the troop was part of Operation Infatuate to capture the island of Walcheren {{at the head of}} the <b>Scheldt</b> Estuary, alongside Free Norwegian and British Commandos. The unit later moved into Germany.|$|E
5|$|Joining the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, the {{division}} moved into defensive {{positions in the}} vicinity of Wuustwezel, Belgium on 23 October 1944. The Timberwolves were then assigned to British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group under the British I Corps, along with the U.S. 7th Armored Division, in order to clear out the <b>Scheldt</b> Estuary and open the port of Antwerp. While the U.S. 7th Armored Division was assigned static duty holding the right flank of the gains made during the failed Market Garden operation, the 104th Infantry Division was to assist the First Canadian Army in the taking of the <b>Scheldt.</b> The Timberwolves traveled across France by train and debarked near the Belgian-Dutch border and waited for word to attack, taking the place of the experienced British 49th Infantry Division on the left flank and the Polish 1st Armored Division on the right.|$|E
5|$|Rapid forces, {{whether for}} an {{offensive}} or defensive purpose, {{were needed to}} deny vital locations to the enemy. Long before the Germans did, the French had contemplated using airborne troops to achieve speedy attacks. As early as 1936 the French had commissioned the design of light airborne tanks, but these plans had been abandoned in 1940, as they possessed no cargo planes large enough to carry them. A naval division and an infantry division were earmarked to depart for Zealand to block the Western <b>Scheldt</b> against a German crossing. These would send forward forces over the <b>Scheldt</b> estuary into the Isles, supplied by overseas shipping.|$|E
5|$|The Paris {{region is}} the most active water {{transport}} area in France, {{with most of the}} cargo handled by Ports of Paris in facilities located around Paris. The Loire, Rhine, Rhone, Meuse, and <b>Scheldt</b> rivers can be reached by canals connecting with the Seine, which include the Canal Saint-Martin, Canal Saint-Denis, and the Canal de l'Ourcq.|$|E
5|$|The RNSB also {{operated}} the 118th Minesweeper Flotilla, composed of MMS-class minesweepers, from Harwich from 1943. The 118th {{served in the}} English Channel and North Sea clearing paths through German minefields. In November 1944, the flotilla was involved in clearing the <b>Scheldt</b> Estuary to the Belgian port of Antwerp to enable it {{to be used by}} the Allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{reserve is}} located in the valley of the , a {{tributary}} of the Hogneau, and is part of the greater drainage basin of the <b>Scheldt.</b> The reserve is not in direct contact with the river. It is supplied with water only by precipitation, which is retained by the natural properties of marl.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{called for}} the French and British to abandon the Antwerp–Namur line and strong positions in favour of improvised positions behind the <b>Scheldt,</b> without facing any real resistance. In the South, General Deffontaine of the Belgian VII Corps retreated from the Namur and Liège regions, the Liège fortress region put up stiff resistance to the German 6th Army. In the North, the 7th Army was diverted to Antwerp after the surrender of the Dutch on 15 May, but was then diverted to support the French 1st Army. In the centre, the Belgian Army and the BEF suffered little German pressure. On 15 May, the only sector to really be tested was around Leuven, which was held by the British 3rd Division. The BEF was not pursued vigorously to the <b>Scheldt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Troops were {{landed on}} the Island of Walcheren at 16:30 on 30 July, while bomb-vessels and gun-boats began a {{bombardment}} of Veere. The town surrendered immediately but it took several days of fighting, before the fort was captured on 1 August. The British then mounted an attack on Flushing, and the island of Zuid-Beveland which was taken unopposed; the forts there having already been deserted. However, the British neglected Cadzand on the south-west side of the <b>Scheldt,</b> where more than 5,700 French troops crossed the river to reinforce Flushing. The capitulation of Fort Rammekens allowed the British to besiege the town on 3 August and to prevent further aid being sent, a flotilla of gunboats was dispatched to the western arm of the <b>Scheldt,</b> to cut it off on the seaward side. The British then began locating and marking a channel for larger ships on 6 August.|$|E
5|$|While {{the port}} of Antwerp was vital for the Allies after D-Day, Admirals Cunningham and Ramsay warned SHAEF and Montgomery that the port was of no use while the Germans held the approaches. But Montgomery {{postponed}} the Battle of the <b>Scheldt,</b> and the delay in opening the port was a grave blow to the Allied build-up before winter approached.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{prisoner}}s were marched {{to the city of}} Trier, with the march taking as long as 20 days. Others were marched to the river <b>Scheldt</b> and were sent by barge to the Ruhr. The prisoners were then sent by rail to prisoner of war camps in Germany. The majority (those below the rank of corporal) then worked in German industry and agriculture {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The port of Antwerp was an {{important}} strategic objective because Allied supply lines were heavily stretched and needed a deep-sea port near the front lines. The British Second Army liberated Antwerp on September 6, {{with help from the}} local resistance. Despite taking control of the city, the port was not accessible until the surrounding waters were safe for cargo ships. The Germans successfully denied access to the port until the Battle of the <b>Scheldt</b> completed in November.|$|E
5|$|As {{far as the}} Belgians were concerned, the Dyle Plan had advantages. Instead of {{the limited}} Allied advance to the <b>Scheldt,</b> or meeting the Germans on the Franco-Belgian border, the move to the Dyle river would reduce the Allied front in central Belgium by , freeing more forces {{for use as a}} {{strategic}} reserve. It was felt it would save more Belgian territory, in particular the eastern industrial regions. It also had the advantage of absorbing Dutch and Belgian Army formations (including some 20 Belgian divisions). Gamelin was to justify the Dyle Plan after the defeat using these arguments.|$|E
5|$|C.mutica {{populations in}} Europe were first {{found in the}} Netherlands in 1995. During a species inventory, several {{specimens}} of an unknown caprellid were recovered by Platvoet et al. from artificial structures {{in and around the}} Neeltje-Jans and the Eastern <b>Scheldt</b> storm surge barrier in Burghsluis, Zeeland. As with the case of the first discovery of C.mutica in North America, Platvoet et al. initially misidentified them as a new species. Remarking upon the resemblance of the caprellids to C.acanthogaster, they named it Caprella macho. They were later discovered to be introduced populations of C.mutica rather than a new species.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{opposition}} from the two SS panzer divisions in the area {{proved to be a}} critical factor not only in preventing the British 1st Airborne Division from holding the Rhine Bridge at Arnhem, but also imposed serious delays on the capture of the bridges at Nijmegen by the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and the advance of the armoured units of the British XXX Corps. For SHAEF, the outcome meant that attention had to turn to the Battle of the <b>Scheldt</b> to open the approaches to Antwerp and to building up resources for an invasion of Germany in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Ironside {{arrived at}} British General Headquarters at 06:00am on 20 May, {{the same day}} that {{continental}} communications between France and Belgium was cut. When Ironside made his proposals known to Gort, Gort replied such an attack was impossible. Seven of his nine divisions were engaged on the <b>Scheldt</b> and even if it was possible to withdraw them, it would create a gap between the Belgians and British which the enemy could exploit and encircle the former. The BEF had been marching and fighting for nine days and was now running short of ammunition. The main effort had to be made by the French to the south.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May the Germans had {{occupied}} {{almost all of}} North Brabant. SS-Standarte Deutschland, quickly advancing to the Western <b>Scheldt,</b> reached the Bath Position. This cut off the retreat of 27e Groupe de Reconnaissance de Division d'Infanterie, which was subsequently destroyed defending Bergen-op-Zoom. The morale of the defenders of the Bath Position, already shaken by stories from Dutch troops fleeing to the west, was severely undermined by the news that Winkelman had surrendered; many concluded that it was useless for Zealand to continue resisting as the last remaining province. A first preparatory artillery bombardment on the position in the evening of 14 May caused the commanding officers to desert their troops, who then also fled.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 May, German Army Group A broke the defences at Sedan and was now free to drive for the English Channel. The Allies {{considered}} a wholesale withdrawal from the Belgian trap. The withdrawal would reflect three stages: the night of 16/17 May to the River Senne, the night of 17/18 May to the river Dendre and the night of 18/19 May to the river <b>Scheldt.</b> The Belgians were reluctant to abandon Brussels and Leuven, especially as the Dyle line had withstood German pressure well.|$|E
5|$|Poverty {{may have}} pushed Sien back into prostitution; the home became less happy and Van Gogh {{may have felt}} family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development. Sien gave her {{daughter}} to her mother, and baby Willem to her brother. Willem remembered visiting Rotterdam {{when he was about}} 12, when an uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry to legitimise the child. He believed Van Gogh was his father, but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely. Sien drowned herself in the River <b>Scheldt</b> in 1904.|$|E
5|$|The Allied plan to aid Belgium was the Dyle Plan; {{the cream}} of the Allied forces, which {{included}} the French armoured divisions, would advance to the Dyle river in response to a German invasion. The choice of an established Allied line lay in either reinforcing the Belgians in the east of the country, at the Meuse–Albert Canal line, and holding the <b>Scheldt</b> Estuary, thus linking the French defences in the south with the Belgian forces protecting Ghent and Antwerp, seemed to be the soundest defensive strategy.|$|E
5|$|The {{final month}} of the war offered little respite to the battalion. In {{the days leading up}} to the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the Liverpool Scottish helped to secure {{numerous}} villages without opposition and crossed the River <b>Scheldt</b> on 9 November. On the day of the Armistice, the Liverpool Scottish was situated at Villers-Notre-Dame. With the 165th and 166th brigades, the battalion had been readied to assault German positions obstructing passage into the town of Ath. Such a prospect was averted, however, when the 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers attacked and seized one of the bridges before it could be demolished.|$|E
5|$|The land battles moved {{towards the}} River Rhine, {{to the east}} of which lay the German heartland. Most of France had been liberated, as had the Belgian cities Brussels and Antwerp. Although Operation Market Garden had failed in 1944, by 1945 the Allies had overrun most of the {{southern}} Netherlands and the <b>Scheldt</b> Estuary. As the ground forces moved across Europe, the Allied tactical air forces moved into new bases on the continent, to continue providing close support. The only limiting factor for the Allies was the weather. As winter came, the rains and mud turned airfields into quagmires, so large-scale air and land operations came to a halt.|$|E
5|$|A two-day long {{bombardment}} of Flushing forced its capitulation on 15 August. Ratified the following day, {{it left the}} British in control of Walcheren which they garrisoned with 10,000 troops. Schouwen and Duiveland on the Eastern branch of the <b>Scheldt,</b> were occupied peacefully on 17 August. The French fleet had already withdrawn to Antwerp however, having been informed on 29 July when the British were still at sea. Between the British and their objective were now more than 35,000 French soldiers, garrisoned in heavily armed forts at Lillo, Liefkenshoech, and Antwerp. The deliberate destruction of dykes by the French had led to widespread flooding, and with disease spreading through the British army, {{it was decided to}} abandon the expedition in early September.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{purification}} of {{the waste}} water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until the 21st century, when two purification stations were built. The south station treats refuse water from 360,000 inhabitants, which is about {{one third of the}} polluted water, and lies on the border of Anderlecht and Forest. The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the <b>Scheldt</b> river.|$|E
5|$|At 08:13, {{the first}} {{formations}} took off. In total, 64 Fw 190D-9s participated. Before {{the target was}} reached, some 14 D-9s were forced to turn back due to AAA damage or mechanical difficulties. Three Fw 190s were lost to German AAA fire. At 09:10, when the front was reached, Allied heavy AAA units began to engage the formation and another five were shot down. Most of the fire was from British Naval AAA defences defending the <b>Scheldt</b> Estuary. As the formation crossed the Dutch and Belgian border, I./JG 26 and III./JG 54 were intercepted by Spitfires. Five of the Fw 190s were shot down. I./JG 26 destroyed or damaged the few aircraft at the airfield. AAA defences claimed five kills and I./JG 26 reported two Fw 190s lost to Spitfires. Several others were lost over the airfield. Other losses occurred against friendly fire again on the return flight.|$|E
5|$|By August the {{division}} was {{still waiting to}} be deployed, but now plans envisioned using {{them as part of}} a larger force. Operation Transfigure involved {{the division}}, the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, the US 101st Airborne Division, and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade landing at Rambouillet St Arnoult, to close the gap between Orléans and Paris. Operation Axehead, using the same force, was to seize the bridges over the River Seine in support of 21st Army Group. Operation Boxer, with the same force, was to seize Boulogne and assault V1 flying bomb sites. Near the end of the month, Operation Linnet, with the same units as before, was formulated to seize crossings over the Escaut. Operation Infatuate, drawn up in early September, involved the entire I Airborne Corps landing in Belgium to trap the retreating German armies in the <b>Scheldt</b> estuary, as well as aiming to threaten Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the <b>Scheldt</b> started 1 November 1944, with 4th Special Service Brigade {{assigned}} {{to carry out}} a seaborne assault on the island of Walcheren. The plan was for the island to be attacked from two directions, with the Commandos coming by sea and the Canadian 2nd Division and the 52nd (Lowland) Division attacking across the causeway. No. 4 Commando landed at Flushing and No. 41 and 48 at Westkapelle. No. 47 Commando was held in reserve and landed after No.s 41 and 48. They were to advance past No. 48 Commando and attempt to link up with No. 4 Commando in the south. On the first day No. 41 captured an artillery observation tower at Westkapelle and cleared the rest of the town. They then moved along the coast and dealt with the coastal defence installations.|$|E
5|$|The first Canadian Army units {{arrived in}} Britain in December 1939. In all, {{over a million}} Canadians served {{in the armed forces}} during World War II and {{approximately}} 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded. Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the <b>Scheldt</b> in 1944. Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany. The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.|$|E
5|$|While {{the commanders}} of the {{remaining}} Dutch troops on South-Beveland refused direct commands by their superior to threaten the German flank, on 17 May a night attack at 03:00 across the Sloedam failed. The Germans now demanded the capitulation of the island; when this was refused they bombed Arnemuiden and Flushing. Middelburg, the province's capital city, was heavily shelled by artillery, its inner city partially burning down. The heavy bombardment demoralised the largely French defenders, and the Germans managed to establish a bridgehead around noon. The few Dutch troops present on Walcheren, about three companies, ceased their resistance. In the evening the encroaching Germans threatened to overrun the French forces that had fled into Flushing, but a gallant delaying action led by brigade-general Marcel Deslaurens in person, {{in which he was}} killed, allowed most troops to be evacuated over the Western <b>Scheldt.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Belgians {{had taken}} {{measures}} to reconstruct their defences {{along the border}} with the German state upon Adolf Hitler's rise to power in January 1933. The Belgian government had watched with increasing alarm the German withdrawal from the League of Nations, its repudiation of the Treaty of Versailles and its violation of the Locarno Treaties. The government increased expenditure on modernising the fortifications at Namur and Liège. New lines of defence were established along the Maastricht–Bois-le-Duc canal, joining the Meuse, <b>Scheldt</b> and the Albert Canal. The protection of the eastern frontier, based mainly on the destruction of a number of roads, was entrusted to new formations (frontier cyclist units and the newly formed Chasseurs Ardennais). By 1935, the Belgian defences had been completed. Even so, it was felt that the defences were no longer adequate. A significant mobile reserve was needed to guard the rear areas, and as a result it was considered that the protection against a sudden assault by German forces was not sufficient. Significant manpower reserves were also needed, but a bill made for the provision of longer military service and training for the army was rejected by the public on the basis that it would increase Belgium's military commitments as well as the request of the Allies to engage in conflicts far from home.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the breed lived in the northern river valleys of the Sambre and the <b>Scheldt,</b> near Valenciennes. Although it is a popular myth that many French draft breeds, including the Trait du Nord, are descendants of the prehistoric horses found at Solutré, this is not true. Two or possibly three subspecies of now-extinct equines have been found at Solutré, {{but there is no}} evidence that they migrated to the area that later produced the Trait du Nord. Like Dutch and Belgian draft breeds such as the Brabant, the origin of the Trait du Nord is found in the large, fertile Flemish grasslands that cover the southern portion of the Netherlands, northern France and all of Belgium. The Hainaut region is the true birthplace of the breed in France. The Belgian draft breeds, the Ardennes and the Trait du Nord share the same ancestry, and the Trait du Nord has a history that is very similar to the Ardennes, due to the influence of the latter breed on the former. The Ardennes, Belgian, Dutch Heavy Draft, Trait du Nord and Auxois are all considered to come from the same group of breeds, due to their heritage, physical characteristics and selection for draft work. Until relatively recently, the breeds were not differentiated, and were frequently crossbred.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May, Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands. Army Group B, under Generaloberst Fedor von Bock, {{attacked}} into Belgium, {{while the}} three Panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung {{around to the}} south and drove for the Channel. The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the River Dyle within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May. They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the <b>Scheldt</b> River on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold. During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was astonished to learn from Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves. On 19 May, Gort met with French General Gaston Billotte, commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea. Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities. Surrounded by marshes, Dunkirk boasted old fortifications and the longest sand beach in Europe, where large groups could assemble. After continued engagements and a failed Allied attempt on 21 May at Arras to cut through the German spearhead, the BEF was trapped, along with the remains of the Belgian forces and the three French armies, in an area along the coast of northern France and Belgium.|$|E
25|$|They {{were ordered}} to capture the vital Port of Antwerp {{and as a result}} were {{involved}} in the Battle of the <b>Scheldt</b> in Belgium and the Netherlands, which included Operation Vitality, Operation Infatuate and the ultimate capture of Walcheren Island, in order to open the mouth of the <b>Scheldt</b> estuary to Allied shipping.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to use the port of Antwerp, the Canadian First Army {{including}} Lieutenant-General John Crocker's I Corps, began the Battle of the <b>Scheldt</b> and the Battle of Walcheren Causeway in October and November. After clearing the southern bank of the <b>Scheldt,</b> British and Canadian forces took the island of Walcheren after an amphibious assault.|$|E
