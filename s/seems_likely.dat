5|$|The lumber {{used in the}} {{construction}} of Fort Jackson was either sold for salvage or scavenged by squatters, most of whom were freed slaves traveling north in a search for new lives following the ending of slavery in the United States.

5|$|The {{reason for}} the {{presence}} of these non canonical bases in DNA is not known. It <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that {{at least part of the}} {{reason for the}}ir presence in bacterial viruses (phages) is to avoid the restriction enzymes present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses.|$|E
5|$|While poorly documented, {{chemical}} communication {{is believed to}} be important to the group. Anal secretions are produced in the hindgut, and released along the posterior setae as predator deterrents In Australia, aggregations of male common blossom thrips have been observed on the petals of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Gossypium hirsutum; females were attracted to these groups so it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that the males were producing pheromones.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald came to {{the throne}} {{on the death of}} his father on 24 February 616, or {{possibly}} 618. Although Æthelberht had been Christian since about 600 and his wife Bertha was also Christian, Eadbald was a pagan. Bertha died some time before Eadbald's accession, and Æthelberht remarried. The name of Æthelberht's second wife is not recorded, but it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that she was a pagan, since on his death she married Eadbald, her stepson: a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church.|$|E

5|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that Urbicus planned his {{campaign}} of attack from Corbridge, advancing north and leaving garrison forts at High Rochester in Northumberland and possibly also at Trimontium as he struck towards the Firth of Forth.

5|$|Kentish {{manufacture}} before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. Kentish jewellers {{were highly}} skilled, {{and before the}} end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the Loire. It is not known what Kent traded for all of this wealth, although it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that there was a flourishing slave trade. It may well be that this wealth was the foundation of Æthelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{agree that}} Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, {{but what exactly}} he {{achieved}} {{is a matter of}} some confusion. As has been discussed, some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC. Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him to the status of subject ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that, under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC.|$|E

5|$|The Netherlands {{provided}} William Bruce {{with many}} of his influences. He was in the Low Countries {{at a time when}} Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.|$|E
5|$|The nearby vicarage {{dates from}} 1638. The Reverend White Kennett (1660–1728) was vicar of Ambrosden from 1685 until 1708. During his incumbency, Kennett became tutor and vice-principal at St Edmund Hall, Oxford and {{published}} {{a number of}} scholarly works. Kennett was also Rector of St Botolph's Aldgate in London from 1700, Archdeacon of Huntingdon from 1701 and Dean of Peterborough from 1707. It therefore <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that Kennett may have been largely absent from Ambrosden in the latter years of his tenure. He relinquished the living of Ambrosden in 1708. Kennett was consecrated Bishop of Peterborough in 1718.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then {{it may be that the}} marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E

5|$|Kaoru is the {{instructor}} of the Kamiya Kasshin martial-arts school. She inherited her fighting style {{and a small}} dojo from her father, who was drafted by a police swordsmen unit and died defending a comrade during the Seinan War. At {{the beginning of the}} story, Kaoru has no students and runs the dojo alone; she <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> to lose it when Kenshin helps her. Despite occasional mood swings and a reputation for bad cooking, she is independent, compassionate, courageous and a good fighter. In her first appearance, Kaoru searches for the assassin Hitokiri Battosai, who claims to be from Kamiya Kasshin-ryu. Kaoru is saved by the real Battosai, Himura Kenshin, and invites him to her dojo.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Norse {{tradition}} {{states that}} Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation {{for the death}} of his son in battle in Scotland, and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty. Sigurd's line barely survived him and it was Torf-Einarr, Rognvald's son by a slave, who founded a dynasty that controlled the Northern Isles for centuries after his death. He was succeeded by his son Thorfinn Turf-Einarsson and during this time the deposed Norwegian King Eric Bloodaxe often used Orkney as a raiding base before being killed in 954. Thorfinn's death and presumed burial at the broch of Hoxa, on South Ronaldsay, then led to a long period of dynastic strife. Whatever the historical details, it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that Orkney and Shetland were being rapidly absorbed into Norse culture by this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{extreme length}} of Æthelberht's reign {{also has been}} {{regarded}} with skepticism by historians; {{it has been suggested}} that he died in the fifty-sixth year of his life, rather than the fifty-sixth year of his reign. This would place the year of his birth approximately at 560, and he would not then have been able to marry until the mid 570s. According to Gregory of Tours, Charibert was king when he married Ingoberg, Bertha's mother, which places that marriage no earlier than 561. It therefore is unlikely that Bertha was married much before about 580. These later dates for Bertha and Æthelberht also solve another possible problem: Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburh, <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> to have been Bertha's child, but the earlier dates would have Bertha aged sixty or so at Æthelburh's likely birthdate using the early dates.|$|E

5|$|The lightest {{isotopes}} were synthesized {{by direct}} fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 262Rf; heavier isotopes {{have only been}} observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers, of which only 267Rf has been confirmed. The heavy isotopes 266Rf and 268Rf have also been observed as electron capture daughters of the dubnium isotopes 266Db and 268Db, but have short half-lives to spontaneous fission: it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that {{the same is true}} of 270Rf, a likely daughter of 270Db. While the isotope 264Rf has yet to be observed, it is predicted to have a short half-life of 5s.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of each colossal head {{must have been}} carefully planned, given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available; it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to mobilise such resources. The workforce would have included sculptors, labourers, overseers, boatmen, woodworkers and other artesans producing the tools to make and move the monument, {{in addition to the}} support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers. The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the {{production of}} the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{political}} structures of late Middle Ages Italy have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed {{the emergence of}} a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller city states and territories: the Kingdom of Naples controlled the south, the Republic of Florence and the Papal States at the center, the Milanese and the Genoese to the north and west respectively, and the Venetians to the east. Fifteenth-century Italy {{was one of the most}} urbanised areas in Europe. Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.|$|E
