25|$|Bluefin-21 {{required}} 16 {{missions to}} complete its {{search of the}} 314 square kilometre area around the detections made by the Towed Pinger Locator. The seafloor <b>sonar</b> <b>search</b> was suspended on 2 May for the AVDOcean Shield to return to port to replenish supplies and personnel. Within two hours of its first deployment after returning to the search area on 13 May, Bluefin-21 developed a communications problem and was recovered. Spare parts from the UK were required and the AVDOcean Shield returned to port to collect the parts. After Bluefin-21 was repaired, the seafloor sonar survey resumed on 22 May.|$|E
25|$|Geosounder {{returned}} to Geraldton on 20 March. Major delays during the installation {{and testing of}} the ROV delayed departure until 29 March, with the survey ship sailing through the path of Cyclone Pancho. Electrical problems with the ROV pushed the start of filming back to 3 April. Sydney {{was the first to}} be inspected, with six ROV dives over a five-day period, during which the main hull and debris field were filmed and documented. The bow had torn free, causing the ship to sink; the main hull section had hit the seabed stern first. This damage corresponded with descriptions given by the Kormoran crew after the battle. Geosounder next travelled to the wreck of Kormoran. The ship had been split into two large pieces by the explosion of the mine deck, which also destroyed the superstructure and scattered debris across a wide area. A possible battle site was located during the <b>sonar</b> <b>search,</b> but observation with the ROV revealed that what was thought to be debris from the ships were actually outcrops of pillow lava.|$|E
500|$|A search-and-rescue {{effort was}} {{launched}} in southeast Asia soon after the aircraft's disappearance. After initial analysis of communications between the aircraft and a satellite, the surface search was moved the following week to the southern Indian Ocean. Between 18 March and 28 April, 19 vessels and 345 sorties by military aircraft searched over [...] The final phase of the search was a bathymetric survey and <b>sonar</b> <b>search</b> of the sea floor, about [...] south-west of Perth, Western Australia. With effect from 30 March 2014, the search was coordinated by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC), an Australian government agency established specifically to co-ordinate the search effort to locate and recover Flight 370, which primarily involved the Malaysian, Chinese, and Australian governments.|$|E
50|$|From 1956 {{until late}} 1964 Loyalty sailed on three WestPac cruises; {{performed}} special operations in 1962 during the nuclear {{tests in the}} Pacific Ocean; and exercised off the California coast perfecting the techniques of modern mine warfare. She also performed <b>sonar</b> <b>searches</b> for downed aircraft. Her service with the powerful U.S. 7th Fleet was climaxed during her 1964 cruise. Following the Gulf of Tonkin incident when North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked U.S. destroyers in international waters, Loyalty was dispatched to steam {{off the coast of}} Vietnam ready for further provocation.|$|R
50|$|Approaching the {{continental}} shelf, the ship moved from deep ocean to much shallower waters. In preparation {{for its first}} surfacing, the requisite <b>sonar</b> <b>searches</b> and contact confirmations would be made. The officer of the deck would be temporarily relieved by a second OOD, enabling the watch OOD {{to be prepared to}} re-establish his watch in the ship’s sail after surfacing had occurred. The quartermasters would break out the portable communications console (“bridge suitcase”) that would enable the OOD in the sail to have communications with the control room.|$|R
50|$|The ocean bottom {{environment}} surrounding Masirah is hostile as {{the majority}} of the area is covered in either sand or hard rock. There is a swift current flowing through the area with a very sharp halocline visible {{on the surface of the}} ocean. The water depth nearby is around 10 m and is not conducive to side-scan <b>sonar</b> <b>searches</b> due to the shallow water and choppy surface conditions. Despite the poor quality ocean bottom, the area is very productive with marine fisheries, and any hard objects (barrels, engines) are immediately colonized by local fauna.|$|R
500|$|Revised {{estimates}} of the radar track and the aircraft's remaining fuel led to a move of the search [...] north-east of the previous area on 28 March, which was followed by another shift on 4 April. Between 2 and 17 April an {{effort was made to}} detect the underwater locator beacons (ULBs; informally known as [...] "pingers") attached to the aircraft's flight recorders, whose batteries were expected to expire around 7 April. Australian naval cutter ADV Ocean Shield equipped with a towed pinger locator (TPL); China's Haixun 01 equipped with a hand-held hydrophone; and the Royal Navy's HMS Echo equipped with a hull-mounted hydrophone; were utilized in the search. Operators considered it a shot in the dark, when comparing the vast search area with the fact that a TPL could only search up to [...] per day. Between 4–8 April several acoustic detections were made that were close to the frequency and rhythm of the sound emitted by the flight recorders' ULBs; analysis of the acoustic detections determined that, although unlikely, the detections could have come from a damaged ULB. A <b>sonar</b> <b>search</b> of the sea-floor near the detections was carried out between 14 April and 28 May without any sign of Flight 370. In a March 2015 report, it was revealed that the calendar life of the battery for the ULB attached to Flight 370's flight data recorder had expired in December 2012 and may not have been as capable.|$|E

50|$|VDS is a blue-water solution. In shallow water, {{the high}} levels of biological, wave and tide noise, the influx of fresh water from rivers and the lack of a thermal {{gradient}} — and therefore CZs — make it a truly formidable environment to detect a sub-surface threat. Passive detection is almost impossible and surface units are forced to use active <b>sonar</b> to <b>search.</b> Doctrine is that a fleet must act as if they have already been detected and maybe even targeted when navigating close to shore or in shallow waters. Because of this constraint, naval commanders hate operating in such waters.|$|R
