40|$|Objective To {{describe}} {{the use of}} a scrotal flap for covering perineal <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> in dogs. Study Design Experimental study. Animals Male Beagles (n = 5). Methods A scrotal flap was created by making a U-shaped incision around the scrotum, with the base of the flap at its rostral border. Orchiectomy was performed through this incision and the scrotum was undermined from the underlying tissue. A small median longitudinal incision in the caudal aspect of the scrotum eliminated its curvature. A <b>skin</b> <b>defect,</b> comparable {{to the size of the}} scrotal flap, was created in the perineum extending from the caudal side of the scrotum toward the anus. The scrotal flap covered the defect and was sutured in place. Results By 57 days, all flaps had approximate to 27 % necrosis on their caudal border. The necrotic area was surgically excised and the defect was covered completely again by the remaining healthy flap. One year after surgery, wound healing was normal and flap survival was complete, providing full coverage of the perineal <b>skin</b> <b>defect.</b> Conclusion A scrotal flap can be used to reconstruct perineal <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> ventral to the anus...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Among {{stem cells}}, {{autologous}} mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) {{are ideal for}} transplantation by virtue of limited rejection reactions and marked proliferative ability. This study presents a novel method by which MSCs were harvested from the bone marrow of a patient who presented with severe post-traumatic infection and a non-healing <b>skin</b> <b>defect</b> in the hand, secondary to uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM). An autologous MSC suspension was injected into the persistent <b>skin</b> <b>defect</b> after stabilizing the blood glucose level and appropriate infection control. During {{the course of a}} regular 18 -month postoperative follow-up, the patient exhibited imme-diate recovery with no transplant-associated complications, as well as no evidence of tumorigenicity. Thus, transplantation of autologous MSCs {{may play a role in}} the clinical application of stem cells, particularly for treatment of <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> following surgery in cases of DM and for those caused by various other traumas...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to describe the use of skin fold advancement flaps (SFAFs) and other reconstructive techniques for closure of large <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> following mammary tumor excision in dogs. Materials and Methods: Twelve dogs underwent reconstruction of large ventral <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> following mammary tumor excision with wide margins. Skin fold flaps (flank fold flap and elbow fold flap) were elevated from the flank and elbow region, respectively, and transposed and sutured onto the large ventral <b>skin</b> <b>defect</b> following mastectomy in all the dogs. In addition to the skin fold flaps, other reconstructive techniques such as undermining, walking sutures, and tension-relieving suture techniques were followed during surgery in the closure of large <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> without <b>skin</b> tension and compromising limb mobility. The skin flap viability was assessed subjectively by gross observation of the flap such as color, temperature, capillary perfusion, and cosmetic appearance, and scoring (1 - 4) was done. Tissue samples were collected from a surgical site on days 3, 6, and 12 post-operatively for histopathological evaluation and healing status of the skin flap. Results: All the surgical wounds healed primarily, without any major complications and the skin flap remained healthy throughout the healing process post-operatively. Distal flap necrosis was noticed in one case and necrosis of skin flap between two suture lines was noticed in another case in which the necrotized distal portion healed by secondary intention after 7 days.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} ability of a three-layer graft in the closuse of large fetal <b>skin</b> <b>defects.</b> Methods: Ovine fetuses {{underwent}} a large (4 x 3 cm) full-thickness <b>skin</b> <b>defect</b> over the lumbar region at 105 days` gestation (term = 140 days). A bilaminar artificial skin was placed over a cellulose interface to cover the defect (3 -layer graft). The skin was partially reapproximated with a continuous nylon suture. Pregnancy was allowed to continue and the surgical site was submitted to histopathological analysis at different post-operative intervals. Results: Seven fetuses underwent surgery. One maternal/fetal death occurred, and the remaining 6 fetuses were analyzed. Artificial skin adherence to the wound edges was observed in cases that remained in utero for at least 15 days. Neoskin was present beneath the silicone layer of the bilaminar artificial skin.

40|$|Full-thickness <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> can {{be covered}} with dermal skin {{substitutes}} in combination with split-thickness skin grafts. However, slow vascularization of the matrices bears the risk of wound infection and extends the length of hospitalization. To overcome these problems, we describe a promising vascularization strategy. Green fluorescent protein(+) adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments (ad-MVF) were isolated from epididymal fat pads of C 57 BL/ 6 -Tg(CAG-EGFP) 1 Osb/J mice. ad-MVF were seeded on collagen-glycosaminoglycan matrices, which were implanted into full-thickness <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> in the dorsal skinfold chamber of wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Nonseeded matrices served as controls. Vascularization, lymphangiogenesis, and integration of the implants were studied by using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology, and immunohistochemistry over 14 days. ad-MVF rapidly reassembled into microvascular networks within the implants, which developed interconnections to the host microvasculature. Accordingly, vascularization of the implants was markedly accelerated, as indicated by a significantly higher microvessel density when compared with controls. Moreover, dense lymphatic networks originating from the green fluorescent protein(+) ad-MVF developed within the implants. This was associated with an improved implant integration. Hence, seeding ad-MVF on collagen-glycosaminoglycan matrices represents a potential strategy to reduce morbidity and hospitalization of patients undergoing the treatment of full-thickness <b>skin</b> <b>defects...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{spina bifida}} the neural tube fails to close during the {{embryonic}} period {{and it is}} thought that prolonged exposure of the unprotected spinal cord to the amniotic fluid during pregnancy causes additional neural damage. Intra-uterine repair might protect the neural tissue from exposure to amniotic fluid and might reduce additional neural damage. Biodegradable collagen scaffolds may be useful in case of fetal therapy for spina bifida, but biochemical properties need to be studied. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether biodegradable collagen scaffolds can be used to treat full-thickness fetal <b>skin</b> <b>defects.</b> We hypothesized that the pro-angiogenic growth factors VEGF and FGF 2 would enhance vascularization, epidermialization and lead to improved wound healing. To investigate the effect of these two growth factors, a fetal sheep model for <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> was used. Compared to wounds treated with bare collagen scaffolds, wounds treated with growth factor-loaded scaffolds showed excessive formation of capillaries and less myofibroblasts were present in these wounds, leading to less contraction. This study has demonstrated that collagen scaffolds can be used to treat fetal <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> and that the combination of collagen scaffolds with VEGF and FGF 2 had a beneficial effect on wound healing.

40|$|Purpose] Recently, {{reconstruction}} of <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> using artificial dermis composed of an outer layer of silicone and an inner sponge layer of collagen {{has been developed}} and is performed clinically. When the artificial dermis is grafted onto a total <b>skin</b> <b>defect,</b> the inner sponge layer spontaneously converts into dermis-like connective tissue. However, 2 or 3 weeks after {{the application of the}} artificial dermis, a secondary split -thickness skin graft on the dermis-like tissue is required for skin resurfacing. Until the secondary skin graft, problems of wound infection or tissue fluid leakage persist. In this study, the authors investigated the effect of cultured bone marrow cells on the synthesis of dermis-like tissue using artificial dermis in rats. [Methods] Two rats were sacrificed to harvest bone marrow cells from the femurs, and the cells were cultured for 10 days. Full thickness <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> (3 cm× 4 cm) were made on the backs of 20 male Fisher rats, then the rats were divided into 5 groups. The artificial dermis containing 10 ^ 4 (10 ^ 5, 5 × 10 ^ 5, 10 ^ 6) /ml bone marrow cells were grafted on the <b>skin</b> <b>defects</b> of rats in Group 1 (2, 3, 4). In Group 5, artificial dermis only was grafted. After 10 days, the grafted artificial dermis was harvested, and histological examination was perfor- med. In each group, mean thickness of dermis-like tissue, which was infiltrated by fibroblasts and capillaries, was measured. [Result] The dermis-like tissue was significantly thicker in Groups 1 ～ 4 than in Group 5, and was significantly thickest in Group 2. [Conclusion] Histologically, topical application of bone marrow cells accelerates prolif- eration of fibroblasts and capillaries in artificial dermis. Therefore, this study suggests the usefulness of bone marrow cells combined with artificial dermis for wound healing...|$|R
