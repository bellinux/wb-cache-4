40|$|Node 1 (Unity) flew to International Space Station (ISS) on Flight 2 A. Node 1 was {{the first}} module of the United States On-Orbit Segment (USOS) {{launched}} to ISS. The Node 1 ISS Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) design featured limited ECLS capability. The main purpose of Node 1 was to provide internal storage by providing four <b>stowage</b> <b>rack</b> locations within the module and to allow docking of multiple modules and a truss segment to it. The ECLS subsystems inside Node 1 were routed through the element prior to launch to allow for easy integration of the attached future elements, particularly the Habitation Module which was planned to be located at the nadir docking port of Node 1. After Node 1 was on-orbit, the Program decided not to launch the Habitation Module and instead, {{to replace it with}} Node 3 (Tranquility). In 2007, the Program became concerned with a potential Russian docking port approach issue for the Russian FGB nadir docking port after Node 3 is attached to Node 1. To solve this concern the Program decided to relocate Node 3 from Node 1 nadir to Node 1 port. To support the movement of Node 3 the Program decided to build a modification kit for Node 1, an on-orbit feedthrough leak test device, and new vestibule jumpers to support the ECLS part of the relocation. This paper provides a design overview of the modification kit, a summary of the Node 1 ECLS re-verification to support the Node 3 relocation from Node 1 nadir to Node 1 port, and a status of the ECLS modification kit installation into Node 1...|$|E
50|$|During the Iraq War, some M1 Abrams {{tanks were}} {{fitted with a}} second bustle rack on {{the rear of the}} {{existing}} one {{at the back of the}} turret. This additional rack is often referred to as a bustle rack extension, or BRE. Also, some M113s, Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, and the Stryker family of APCs were fitted with similar <b>stowage</b> <b>racks</b> on the sides of the hull. The bustle rack extensions on the Abrams come in two versions; one with provisions for mounting jerrycans on either end originally used by US Marine Corps Abrams (as seen in the image at left) and one without, used by U.S. Army Abrams, though the former has begun to replace the latter on Army tanks. Additionally, M109 self-propelled howitzers in Israeli service have used bustle racks on their front turrets for carrying crewmens' personal equipment for decades.|$|R

40|$|As {{part of my}} KSC summer internship, I {{was given}} the very cool task of writing a test {{preparation}} sheet (TPS). A TPS {{is a set of}} instructions for certain procedures or tasks, and serves as the documentation for the tasks. TPSs guide task leaders and technicians throughout the work procedures, safely, informing them of what steps will be hazardous, what precautions must be taken, and what to do {{in the case of an}} accident or emergency. I was placed in Boeing's Resupply & Return Division (R&R). R&R is responsible for sending up food and supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) with the use of three Italian Multi Purpose Logistics Modules - Leonardo, Donatello, and Raffaello. The supplies are loaded into Resupply <b>Stowage</b> <b>Racks</b> (RSRs) or Resupply Stowage Platforms (RSPs) (though, both are usually referred to as racks), depending on their size and shape. These racks are loaded into the modules with the help of a specialized crane known as the Rack Insertion Device (RID). The RID rests on four pneumatic air jacks, these allow for an operator to raise or lower the RID. The pneumatic air system supplies the air jacks with the necessary air pressure required to lift the RID...|$|R

40|$|Now {{that the}} International Space Station (ISS) is being constructed, payload {{developers}} have {{to not only}} verify the Shuttle-to-payload interface, but also the interfaces their payload will have with the ISS. The Multi Purpose Logistic Module (MPLM) being designed and built by Alenia Spazio in Torino, Italy is one such payload. The MPLM is the primary carrier for the ISS Payload <b>Racks,</b> Re-supply <b>Stowage</b> <b>Racks,</b> and the Resupply Stowage Platforms to re-supply the ISS with food, water, experiments, maintenance equipment and etc. During {{the development of the}} MPLM there was no requirement for verification of the on-orbit interfaces with the ISS. When this oversight was discovered, all the dynamic test stands had already been disassembled. A method was needed that would not require an extensive testing stand and could be completed in a short amount of time. The residual flexibility testing technique was chosen. The residual flexibility modal testing method consists of measuring the free-free natural frequencies and mode shapes along with the interface frequency response functions (FRF's). Analytically, the residual flexibility method has been investigated in detail by, MacNeal, Martinez, Carne, and Miller, and Rubin, but has not been implemented extensively for model correlation due to difficulties in data acquisition. In recent years improvement of data acquisition equipment has made possible the implementation of the residual flexibility method as in Admire, Tinker, and Ivey, and Klosterman and Lemon. The residual flexibility modal testing technique is applicable to a structure with distinct points (DOF) of contact with its environment, such as the MPLM-to-Station interface through the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM). The CBM is bolted to a flange on the forward cone of the MPLM. During the fixed base test (to verify Shuttle interfaces) some data was gathered on the forward cone panels. Even though there was some data on the forward cones, an additional modal test was performed to better characterize its behavior. The CBM mounting flange is the only remaining structure of the MPLM that no test data was available. This paper discusses the implementation of the residual flexibility modal testing technique on the CBM flange and the modal test of the forward cone panels...|$|R
