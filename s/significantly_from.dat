30|$|To further delimitate the qHI- 8 region, {{differences}} in HI among recombinant lines and controls (CK 1 and CK 2) {{were analyzed using}} Duncan’s multiple range test.

Furthermore, all recombinant lines in G 3, G 4, and G 5 were <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> CK 1 (p <  0.0001), but not <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> CK 2 (p >  0.05), suggesting that qHI- 8 is not located in the intervals of ID 08.26 -RM 502 and RM 6845 -RM 477.

40|$|Abstract — Diversity and {{abundance}} of spider community is generally {{determined by the}} complexity {{of the structure of the}} plant and their environmental conditions. We have examined this relationship in four habitat types of agricultural crops, namely tomato, kidney bean, maize and shallot in Tompaso and Langowan regions of Minahasa Regency, North Sulawesi. We found the diversity of spider species in tomato was more than in maize and shallot, but not <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> in kidney bean. Likewise the spider species diversity on the kidney bean was not <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> the maize, but <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> the shallot. Spider species diversity was found highest in tomato, and then kidney bean, maize, and shallot, consecutively. Spider species richness in tomato and kidney bean was not significantly different, and the similar was between maize and shallot, but that in tomato and kidney bean was <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> maize and shallot...|$|R
30|$|Significant {{differences}} in the overall i.p. mean are almost always consistent, between two consecutive years (2004 and 2005; 2005 and 2006; 2008 and 2009). One–Way ANOVA (F 7, 631 = 6.619 p < 0.001) shows no significant {{differences in}} the overall i.p. mean between the years of 2004, 2006 and 2008, but they are <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> the other years of the study. For example, 2004 is <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> 2005 and 2009 (Games-Howell post hoc test p = 0.049; p = 0.014); 2006 is <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> 2005 (p = 0.001), 2009 (p < 0.001) and 2010 (p = 0.002), which were hot years.|$|R
5|$|Dayton's {{population}} declined <b>significantly</b> <b>from</b> {{a peak of}} 262,332 {{residents in}} 1960 to only 141,527 in 2010. This was {{in part due to}} the slowdown of the region's manufacturing and the growth of Dayton's affluent suburbs including Oakwood, Englewood, Beavercreek, Springboro, Miamisburg, Kettering, and Centerville. The city's most populous ethnic group, white, declined from 78.1% in 1960 to 51.7% by 2010. However, recent census estimates show a 1.3% population increase since 2010, the first increase in five decades.|$|E

40|$|A spatial outlier is {{a spatial}} {{referenced}} object whose non-spatial attribute values are <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> {{those of other}} spatially referenced objects in its spatial neighborhood. It represents locations that are <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> their neighborhoods {{even though they may}} not be <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> the entire population. Here we adopt this definition to spatio-temporal domain and define a spatial-temporal outlier (STO) to be a spatial-temporal referenced object whose thematic attribute values are <b>significantly</b> different <b>from</b> those of other spatially and temporally referenced objects in its spatial or/and temporal neighborhood. Identification of STOs can lead to the discovery of unexpected, interesting, and implicit knowledge, such as local instability. Many methods have been recently proposed to detect spatial outliers, but how to detect the temporal outliers or spatial-temporal outliers has been seldom discussed. In this paper we propose a multiscale approach to detect the STOs by evaluating the change between consecutive spatial and temporal scales. 1...|$|R
